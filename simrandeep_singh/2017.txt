One consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households’ real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year.   While it’s hit the income of households, however, the depreciation has come as a boon for many exporters. In sterling terms goods export prices rose 12% through the course of last year. This will significantly have boosted exporters’ profitability and with it the incentive to invest in extra capacity.       In general, it’s not really right – not enough at least – to think about the impact of a change in the exchange rate in isolation. Asset prices are volatile in the short run, sometimes inexplicably so. But over time they tend to move for a reason. They’re driven by deeper things that can have important effects of their own. To get the full picture you need to take both into account, not just the partial impact of a change in the exchange rate but those of its underlying drivers as well.   Take sterling’s fall in 2008 and 2009. One plausible explanation was that the financial sector is more important for the UK – notably its exports and the government’s tax receipts – than for other countries. So its economy and public finances were more vulnerable to the global financial crisis. The depreciation helped to cushion these effects but it wasn’t enough to outweigh them. The downturn was no less severe here than elsewhere, notwithstanding sterling’s fall.    Sterling’s more recent decline was clearly prompted by the referendum result. It also seems likely that the foreign exchange market has decided the consequences are negative. The most plausible explanation for the depreciation is that, in the eyes of the market, leaving the EU will make exporting harder and more costly. To help compensate the currency needs to be cheaper.   There are many important differences with 2008/09, of course. One is this: Brexit hasn’t happened yet. Back then sterling’s fall happened alongside its cause. On this occasion the depreciation reflects beliefs about a change in the UK’s future trading arrangements, but it’s acting on an economy where those arrangements are for the time being unchanged. The result – higher prices and profits but unchanged rules and costs – represents something of a sweet spot for exporters and businesses that compete with imports.    How they respond is one important determination of economic growth this year. Usually, one of the more positive aspects of an exchange-rate depreciation is that, by raising their profitability, it encourages the expansion of firms in the tradable sector. With the world economy in better health than for some time, there is certainty every incentive to do that today. On this occasion that response might be more muted than usual, however, because it’s not clear how long the sweet spot will last. If the currency market is right the UK’s future trading relationships will be less favourable; if it’s too pessimistic sterling is likely to rebound. Either 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   way, future returns in the tradable sector may not be as healthy as they are right now. This may act as something of a deterrent to longer-term, sunk-cost investments in that sector.        In what follows I’ll begin by looking at sterling and what economics has to say about its reaction to the referendum result. I’ll then say something about how depreciations work in small open economies, in particular their impact on profitability and investment in the tradable sector. There’s a short concluding section.   Sterling’s response to the EU referendum: some exchange-rate economics  So let’s begin with the depreciation and its proximate cause, the outcome of referendum. The link between the two was clear long before the vote itself. In the months leading up to June 23 there was a tight correlation between the value of the currency and the perceived likelihood of a “remain” vote (Chart 1).   That’s why the MPC, in conditioning its May 2016 forecasts on that outcome, assumed a higher path for the exchange rate. It’s also why the Committee suggested there might be a “sharp correction” in sterling’s value in the event of a leave vote. And in the event that’s what we got. On June 23 and 24 sterling fell further against the dollar than over any two-day period since the devaluation of 1967.   You didn’t need any economics to make this prediction – the relationship in in Chart 1 was enough. But you probably do need some economics if you want to understand why the currency reacted this way. While we don’t know precisely what’s in the collective mind of the  Chart 1: Sterling sensitive to expected result well before the referendum itself  Source: Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters Datastream, Betfair foreign exchange market, in my view there are two broad possibilities: Brexit is expected either to weaken domestic demand or raise the cost of exporting.       
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   To understand these effects remember first what the real exchange rate is: the relative price of consumption here compared with that in our trading partners1.  Suppose you split consumption into stuff that can only be produced domestically (“non-tradables” like homes or haircuts) and things that can also be imported from abroad (“tradables” such as holidays and cars). This distinction is important because you’d expect prices of traded goods and services to move reasonably closely across countries (I’ll return to this point later). If so, it turns out you can re-express the real exchange rate in terms of another relative price, that of non-traded to traded output2:  𝜀≈𝑝𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑇⁄        [1]  So when things happen that push up this relative price, whether on the demand or the supply side of an economy, the real exchange rate will tend to move in the same direction.   Take domestic demand first. The material distinction between non-traded and tradable output is that, whereas the first can only be supplied domestically, the second is also produced elsewhere: its overall supply is more “elastic”. New houses can only be built by domestically located firms; cars are made everywhere.   So even a general increase in domestic demand will put relatively more pressure on the resources used to produce non-tradables as their global supply is more limited. As a result their relative price will tend to rise in domestically led expansions and to fall in contractions. This is illustrated in an extremely stylised way in Chart 2. You can think of the appreciation, in this case, as the economy’s way of tempering the effects on relative demand and, at the same time, encouraging resources to move where they’re needed. If domestic demand strengthens, the resulting rise in the exchange rate reduces returns in the tradable sector and raises them in the non-traded sector, drawing investment from the first to the second.3   This isn’t just theory. We know, for example, that fiscal expansions tend to be associated with an appreciating exchange rate4. More generally real exchange rates tend to be pro-cyclical. Chart 3 plots the relationship for the UK, with both lines – sterling’s real exchange rate and domestic demand growth – plotted                                                       1 I’m interested here in the real forces driving the exchange rate. The nominal rate, e = εP*/P, where P* and P are price levels at home and abroad respectively, also depends on relative inflation rates. And in the shorter run, when those prices are sticky, monetary events can and do affect real exchange rates. But over time, the real exchange rate depends more on non-monetary things.  And in this particular instance, sterling’s fall had essentially nothing to do with differences in monetary policy (as measured, for instance, by shifts in relative short-term interest rates). Note too that, judging by the behaviour of forward inflation rates, financial markets too consider this to be a real phenomenon: five years ahead, the expected value of eP/P* is around 16% lower than it was at the start of 2016.  2 This ratio then has to be divided by the same ratio in our trading partners.  Obviously for every domestic shock described here, the exchange rate is affected symmetrically, and in the opposite direction by the same phenomenon in the rest of the world. 3 The ease with which this happens is what determines the slope of the supply curve in Charts 2 and 4. In the limit, if resources can move seamlessly and costlessly between sectors, the supply curve is flat. But this reallocation could take a long time. Empirically, over cyclical horizons, the correlation between exchange rates and demand disturbances is clear.   4 Arguably, the recent appreciation of the US dollar owes something to the expectation that the incoming administration will loosen fiscal policy.

The graph also illustrates quite how weak the currency is at the moment (the green dot on the right-hand side) given the recent robustness of domestic demand growth (the blue dot).   Among other things this framework has important implications for the link between exchange rates and “imbalances”. The UK has periodically experienced episodes where the exchange rate is strong, the external balance deteriorates and, on the production side of the economy, the traded sector gets “crowded out”. One often hears that all this is the “consequence” of an “over-valued exchange rate”, as if that were some arbitrary, unexplainable thing.   Chart 2: Stronger domestic demand tends to push up the exchange rate Chart 3: UK data bear this out     Source: ONS and Thomson Reuters Datastream  But in these situations the exchange rate is more symptom than cause: the underlying driver is relatively strong growth in domestic demand5. And it’s this that jointly pushes up both the value of currency and the trade deficit6.  Indeed I think this helps explain to explain why sterling appreciated so strongly after 2012 (and until last year): relative to their respective incomes, domestic demand grew much more strongly in the UK than among its main trading partners in continental Europe.     There’s a limit to the duration of financial deficits, at an aggregate as well as an individual level. It was always unlikely that the UK could finance a 5%-of-GDP current account deficit indefinitely and the market would presumably have anticipated a closure at some point, partly via weaker growth of domestic demand. But one possibility, regarding sterling’s recent behaviour, is that the foreign exchange market believes that leaving the EU will hasten the correction of these imbalances. If, for as long as it lasts, financing the deficit                                                       5 The word “relatively” is important here – what matters is the behaviour of domestic demand compared with that in other countries. If demand weakens in other countries the home country’s exchange rate will still appreciate even if nothing happens to domestic savings rates. [More here on global imbalances]  6 For a thorough treatment of the relationship between imbalances and the exchange rate – and specifically the chain of causation running from the former to the latter – see Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007).

International capital markets might require a higher premium for sterling finance. If so, this would slow the growth of domestic demand that much earlier, accelerate a rebalancing of the economy and depress the fair value of the exchange rate7.   While possible in principle, I’m not convinced this is the main explanation for sterling’s reaction to the referendum result. The currency has remained weak even in the face of robust consumption growth since that date. And if the foreign exchange market had anticipated a higher cost of finance for sterling borrowers after Brexit you’d probably have seen the same expectation in other financial markets – a steeper yield curve, perhaps, or higher premia in UK banks’ funding markets. That hasn’t really happened.   Chart 4: Weaker productivity in tradable sector depresses the exchange rate Chart 5: Supported by cross-country evidence     Source: Penn World Table  A more likely channel, to my mind, involves expected supply. Go back to that relationship in [1] and imagine now that something happens to push up the cost of producing or selling tradable goods. Perhaps productivity in that sector grows less rapidly (relative to that in our trading partners)8. Or perhaps tariff and/or non-tariff barriers are imposed on international trade. Either way, if the relative cost of producing or selling tradable output goes up then so must its relative price (Chart 49). In effect, the currency falls to help absorb these costs. In doing so it spreads them throughout the economy: even those in the non-traded sector have to work longer to buy the same quantum of imports.                                                         7 Sometimes this point is expressed in terms of the “sustainable” current account deficit but it amounts to the same thing.  8 Cost is inversely related to productivity.  9 Note that a contraction in tradable productivity, which is the denominator in the SNT/ST curve, shifts it to the right. PNT /PT YNT /YT DNT /DT SNT /ST 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   There is ample empirical evidence of this channel in the data. Chart 5, for example, is a cross-country plot of relative price levels (the real exchange rate) against per-capita income. The latter is determined by  whole-economy productivity. But much of the variation in aggregate productivity, across countries as well as over time, is in the tradable sector specifically. So the correlation is reasonably persuasive evidence of the link between tradables productivity and exchange rates10. And it’s quite possible that this is what lies behind sterling’s reaction to the referendum. Foreign exchange markets may believe that exiting the EU will in some way raise the cost of exporting – either directly, via the erection of barriers of one sort or another, or by depressing inward investment and productivity in the tradable sector (relative to that in other countries).  What does the weaker currency do in the meantime? Some more exchange-rate economics  I should emphasise at this point that what I’m musing about here are the implicit beliefs of the foreign exchange market. The specific question is why that market thinks the long-term consequences of leaving the EU warrant a lower sterling exchange rate. For its part the MPC has no particular expectation about the forthcoming negotiations. The currency market could turn out to have been too pessimistic.   Two things are clear, however. First, if the market has misjudged the risks – if the UK emerges from this as open an economy as it is today, or more so – one imagines the exchange rate will re-appreciate, all else equal. I’ll come back to the significance of this point later on.   Second, the weaker exchange rate is acting on an economy whose trading relationships are for the time being quite unchanged. As yet Brexit has done nothing directly to affect the UK’s openness because Brexit hasn’t happened.   The MPC is always keen to caution against treating a change in asset prices as some independent, “exogenous” event, without considering its underlying cause. This case is a bit special, however: in this instance the cause has yet to occur. We’ve had the reaction in asset prices well ahead of the event. In that sense it’s more independent than usual.  And what’s striking about this is that economists usually view independent depreciations in the exchange rate as expansionary rather than contractionary. Yes, they dent real household incomes and therefore consumer spending. But the usual view is that this negative effect is compensated, indeed outweighed, by positive effects on other areas of spending, net exports and investment.  With the additional tailwind of a strengthening world economy you might expect most forecasters to have predicted faster economic growth following sterling’s decline. Yet the opposite is true: after 2% through 2016 (in the year to Q4), the consensus forecast is that UK GDP growth will slow to 1.2% through this year.                                                         10 In economics the impact on the exchange rate of variations in tradable versus non-tradable productivity is known as the  “Balassa-Samuelson” effect (Samuelson (1964); for a survey of the evidence see Egert et al (2006)).   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   I want to ask why this is. Why do forecasters think the more negative effects of sterling’s fall will predominate – what impediment might there be to its more positive effects?  To do so it’s worth taking a closer look at how depreciations actually work.   The view one often hears is that they make UK output cheaper in foreign currency terms, encouraging extra demand from overseas. I’m not sure that’s quite right.    I said earlier that economists often make the approximation that prices of tradable goods and services are the same in all countries (measured in some common currency). This makes intuitive sense when you think of an area like commodities. For example, you would not expect sterling’s fall to reduce the dollar price of North Sea oil or the euro price of UK-produced wheat. Those are determined largely in global markets. What happens instead is that their prices go up in sterling terms. And if there is a response of net export volumes it comes about largely because the rise in prices directly boosts the profitability of UK-based production. Whether we’re talking about firms that export or those that compete with imports, it encourages such businesses to expand. In other words it’s a matter of supply not demand.   Chart 6 gives a stylised description. In a competitive market the demand curve facing an individual firm (and those in a relatively small country) is essentially flat. Domestic events don’t have much effect on the global price. When the currency falls, pushing up prices and profits of outward-facing firms, the response of export volumes depends on the slope of the supply curve: to what extent do firms in the tradable sector have the capacity to raise output and, where that is insufficient, the willingness to invest in more?      Chart 6: For a small open economy tradable demand is highly elastic Chart 7: Depreciations push up the sterling price of goods exports as well as those of imports   Source: ONS and Thomson Reuters Datastream.  * excluding oil and erratics.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   Now commodities may be an extreme case. They’re essentially homogenous – one country’s output is much like another’s. But even in non-commodity goods markets you find a similar pattern. The UK is relatively small, accounting for only 3% of international goods trade (even including oil). Many UK firms are to a significant extent “price takers” in international markets. And you can see from Chart 7 the close correlation between the sterling price of the UK’s (non-oil) goods exports and the exchange rate. The reaction is a bit less than one-for-one but in general no less marked than that of import prices. That’s true of the most recent period as well: prices of non-oil goods exports rose 12% through the course of last year, in line with those of imports.   Admittedly, the behaviour of the sterling price of services exports is rather different.  They’re more stable in the face of exchange-rate movements (Chart 8), implying that depreciations do indeed reduce them in foreign currency terms. I think this is understandable. Services are less homogenous than goods and there’s more room for non-price competition. The UK has a larger presence in this area, accounting for 7% of global services trade in total, 12% for business and financial services specifically. Those wholesale services are relatively specialised.  Chart 8: Sterling price of services exports more stable  Equally, and for many of the same reasons, the evidence suggests that service export volumes are much less sensitive to any cross-country variations in prices than in goods markets. Indeed it’s only because of this relative insensitivity that such variations can persist for any length of time.  At any rate, my main point here is that the positive effects of a currency depreciation depend at least as much on the response of domestic firms as on that of foreign buyers. If firms in the tradable sector have plenty of spare capacity you’d expect net export volumes to rise significantly; once capacity constraints start to bind you’d expect greater investment; in general, given that the degree of spare capacity is bound to vary across firms, you’d expect to see both.  Source: ONS and Thomson Reuters Datastream   I think this is what you have seen in the past – in both directions. The data are limited. Detailed sectoral numbers on profits and investment exist only from the early 1990s and until 2014. But that period does at least cover two significant moves in the currency, even before the financial crisis: the big drop when sterling fell out of the European Exchange Rate System (ERM) in 1992, after which the exchange rate remained relatively low for a few years; and the equally large re-appreciation in 1997 and 1998. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   As it happens, I think these swings can be traced back to the demand-side influences I discussed in the last section. Subdued domestic consumption, public as well as private, supressed the exchange rate in the years after sterling exited the ERM; much stronger growth, associated in part with the revival in the housing market, helped to push it back up later that decade (you can see these broad movements back in Chart 3).   And if you define the “tradable” part of the economy as those sectors with above-average trade shares,  “non-tradables” the rest, they behaved broadly as you might expect. Aggregate profits recovered strongly in the early 1990s, as they tend to in the early stage of economic recoveries. But, thanks to a jump in the sterling price of their output, the rise was most marked for firms exposed to international trade (Chart 9).   There was plenty of slack in the economy (Chart 10 uses the balances on capacity use from the BCC surveys). Within the tradable sector in particular this allowed for a marked rise in net export volumes. In the three years after ERM exit the UK’s trade balance improved by close to 2% of GDP. Furthermore, despite that spare capacity, business investment too began to accelerate – and again it was the tradable sector whose spending grew fastest (Chart 11).   Chart 9: Profits in tradable sector boosted by depreciation in early 90s, hit by later appreciation Chart 10: Unlike early 1990s, there is now limited spare capacity, including in tradable sector   Source: ONS and Bank of England calculations  Source: BCC and Bank of England calculations

If subdued domestic consumption had allowed the economy to “rebalance” through the 1992-97 period, the opposite occurred over the following few years. Stronger domestic demand growth “crowded out” the tradable sector by helping to push up sterling’s exchange rate. This led to falls in prices, profits and investment in the tradable sector.      What about today? Sadly we don’t have such detailed information on anything like a real-time basis. Indeed we have very little data of any kind, even at an aggregate level, to tell us how profits and investment have behaved since last summer. But here’s my take on what we do know:      First, it’s likely that profitability has improved significantly in the tradable sector of the economy. We know that non-financial corporate profits in aggregate rose 10% in the year to Q3. We know too that export prices rose strongly last year, much faster than those of domestic-facing firms11. At a rough guess, and relative to that in the non-traded sector, this will have pushed up the rate of return in the traded sector by 2-3 percentage points12.    Second – and this is in sharp contrast to the early 1990s – there is only limited spare capacity in the economy, including in its more tradable sectors (Chart 10 again). One would certainly expect net export volumes to improve this year. But one would also expect a greater share of the response to the depreciation, compared with the early 1990s, to come via stronger investment, less of it from                                                       11 While export prices rose 12% in the year to 2016Q4, gross output prices across the economy as a whole, excluding the government sector, rose by around 4½% (by gross I mean including the cost of imports).  With exports worth around one quarter of gross output, this would imply output-price inflation in the rest of the economy of less than 2%.      12 Higher prices boost profits, and disproportionately so, given the operational gearing. On the other hand exporting firms will also be paying more for their imports, on which they rely more than others. To work out the overall impact on profits you need to net out the extra cost of imports. We’ve done this by passing the rise in both export and import prices through the UK’s input:output tables and used the same definition of tradables and non-tradables as before.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   higher output in the tradable sector. There is less room to raise output but more of an incentive to add to that capacity.     Third, and despite these incentives, growth of overall business investment in the UK was relatively weak last year. Early official estimates say it shrank slightly in the year to Q4, by around 1%. (This compares with positive growth of 2% or so in the Euro area.)  And although those estimates are particularly prone to revision, the various survey indicators also subsided in 2016 (Chart 12).   This last point is the critical one. The world economy is looking better than it has done for some time. Against this backdrop, and given the existing capacity constraints, the fall in sterling provides a powerful incentive to invest in the UK’s tradable sector. All else equal, it would make sense for existing exporters to expand; for domestic-facing firms to think about entering new markets; and for multinationals to shift production to the UK.   Yet some caution would also be understandable. All else is not equal. While much is at stake, no-one can be sure about the eventual outcome of the Brexit negotiations. The evidence suggests that investment is less responsive to these commercial incentives the greater the degree of uncertainty about future returns13. Nor is it just a matter of uncertainty: it’s unlikely that these propitious conditions will last forever. Either the currency market is right about the consequences of Brexit, in which case the UK’s trading relationships will become less favourable; or it’s wrong, in which case sterling is likely to recover. Yet even in normal times, currency moves generally have to endure for quite a while before multinationals decide to shift production from one location to another14.   So these are not straightforward decisions. Put simply, firms in the tradable sector, and those thinking of entering it, will be weighing the boost in the current rate of return against any additional risk premium they currently require of such investments. The question is whether the first is big enough to compensate for the second.     Summary and conclusion  The adjective “post-Brexit” is bandied around quite a bit these days. The term’s a bit previous. A better description of the UK’s current economic circumstances is “post-referendum” but “pre-Brexit”.   The result is something of a sweet spot for exporters. Sterling fell sharply after the referendum and, despite the strength of consumption since then, has remained close to record lows. The most likely explanation is that the foreign exchange market believes that, when it does actually occur, leaving the EU will raise costs in                                                       13 Bloom et al (2007); for more on the impact of uncertainty on sunk-cost investment decisions see Dixit and Pindyck (1994); Handly and Limao (2013) consider the specific case of uncertainty about tariffs. 14 For example Goldberg (2007).

Whether this occurs through explicit tariffs, non-tariff barriers or lower productivity growth, the currency would need to be weaker in compensation.   But the UK’s trading rules are for the time being unchanged. The result is that the costs and ease of exporting are unchanged but the returns to it significantly higher. With the world economy looking better than for some time the circumstances for the tradable sector could hardly be more propitious. One would expect firms in the more open parts of the economy both to use up any spare capacity and, in the normal course of events, to invest significantly more in that capacity as well. Over the longer run, this reallocation of resources is what the positive impact of an exchange-rate depreciation relies upon.    It’s possible, of course, that Brexit won’t be as bad as the foreign exchange market appears to believe. If the government succeeds in negotiating a “new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement15” with the EU, and in opening up trade with non-European countries, the UK’s overall degree of openness may not worsen and it could improve. If so, and all else equal, the currency should in time rebound.   But this makes longer-term investment in the tradable sector a somewhat tricky decision. Either the currency market is too pessimistic, in which case sterling’s depreciation is likely to be reversed over time. Or it’s not, in which case the costs of exporting will eventually go up. Barring some other source of exchange rate weakness, such as a sharp rise in the household saving rate (which would have its own implications for the economy), the sweet spot is unlikely to last indefinitely. So while investments with shorter-term payoffs make commercial sense, especially for those already running up against capacity constraints, the uncertainties involved in longer-term decisions could temper the usually positive response of business spending to depreciations in the exchange rate. Indeed they’re probably already doing so somewhat.     In its latest forecasts the MPC expects this caution to persist. That’s why, in the central projection in the February Inflation Report, growth slows slightly this year, from 2.0% at the end of last year to 1.7% by 2017Q4. Though there are plenty of other variables to consider, the negative effects of the depreciation on consumption (via import prices and household income) are expected marginally to outweigh its more positive effects on other parts of demand.    If only implicitly the consensus forecast seems to attach more weight to this Brexit-related caution. My guess is that financial markets do so as well. Despite higher profitability, business investment is projected to stagnate or fall this year even as it accelerates significantly further in other developed economies. The more negative effects on consumption clearly predominate and growth of aggregate demand is projected to slow reasonably sharply, to 1.2% by the end of this year.                                                         15 This is the Prime Minister’s phrasing in her speech on 17 January. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   Yet there are clearly risks to both. If businesses share the view of financial markets, and in particular the foreign exchange market, the risks around EU exit could persuade them to cut investment further this year. If they side more with consumers – who, as we’ve noted before, appear to have taken such uncertainties very much in their stride – they will respond more to today’s favourable conditions than to any caution about the longer-term future and instead raise investment spending.

William C Dudley: The importance of financial conditions in theconduct of monetary policyRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, Sarasota, Florida, 30March 2017.*   *   *It is a pleasure to be here today.  I would like to thank the University of South Florida forsponsoring this conference.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and notnecessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal ReserveSystem. One aspect of today’s event is the dedication of a financial laboratory to help students learn aboutfinancial markets, which I think has great value.  Knowledge of how financial markets operate isan important aspect of financial and economic literacy, and it leads to greater financial securityover time.  For example, one important lesson is that when the promised returns on aninvestment offering are extraordinarily high, it is because the investment is either very risky orfraudulent.  When investing, it is important to remember that if it seems to be too good to be true,it likely is!Today, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the importance of financial markets ininfluencing the economic outlook and, in turn, U.S. monetary policy.  This is a subject near anddear to my heart.  Nearly 20 years ago—when I was working in the private sector—mycolleagues and I introduced an index of financial conditions.  I believe that my long-standingfocus on financial conditions has, over time, helped me become a better economic forecaster. And, I am pleased that economists and analysts increasingly incorporate financial conditions intotheir assessments of the economic outlook.As I will argue, financial conditions in the United States play an important role in influencingeconomic conditions.  Because movements in financial markets are a major factor influencingbroader financial conditions, it is necessary to understand how financial market developmentscan affect the economic outlook and, therefore, the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  But,this story gets more complicated, as the setting of monetary policy, in turn, affects marketdevelopments and financial conditions.  This two-way feedback is an important feature of theinteraction between financial conditions and monetary policy.To begin, let me be clear about what we mean by “financial conditions.”  Focusing on the UnitedStates, financial conditions can be broadly summarized by five key measures: short- and long-term Treasury rates, credit spreads, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and equity prices. Although many other measures and prices can also be included in one’s assessment, I thinkthese five are the most essential.In the conduct of monetary policy, the FOMC does not have targets for either specificcomponents of financial conditions or for financial conditions more broadly.  We care aboutfinancial conditions not for themselves, but instead for how they can affect economic activity andultimately our ability to achieve the statutory objectives of the Federal Reserve—maximumemployment and price stability.  Let me provide a few examples.  A decline in mortgage ratescan lift the demand for owner-occupied housing and support construction activity.  A rise in equityprices can boost household wealth, which is one factor that underpins consumer spending.  Theforeign exchange value of the dollar can affect the relative competitiveness of importers andexporters, which, in turn, influences the country’s trade performance.  Narrower credit spreadscan reduce the cost of capital for business and help support greater business investment.123 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
In sum, financial conditions affect households’ and firms’ saving and investment plans, and,therefore, play a key role in influencing economic activity and the economic outlook.  This is whythe evaluation of financial conditions is so crucial in the conduct of monetary policy.The FOMC traditionally implements monetary policy by adjusting the federal funds rate—theshort-term interest rate paid by banks that borrow reserves from other financial institutions. However, few economic decisions directly depend on the federal funds rate.  Rather, changes inthe federal funds rate affect the economy through their impact on other interest rates, which,consequently, influence broader financial conditions.  If financial conditions moved predictablywith the policy rate, then there would be no need for the FOMC to focus on financial conditions. In such a world, by adjusting the level of the federal funds rate, the FOMC could be fully confidentthat it could generate the appropriate financial conditions necessary to support achievement offull employment and price stability.In fact, the response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates is not rigid andpredictable.  Instead, as we shall see shortly, the linkage between the federal funds rate andfinancial conditions changes over time, as it is influenced by a whole host of other factors. Recent evidence suggests that even the relation between short-term and long-term rates hasshifted substantially over the past 15 years.  Moreover, at times, we have observed cases inwhich financial conditions did not move in the same direction as the monetary policy stance.  Letme highlight two recent divergences which indicate that we need to keep a separate eye on theevolution of financial conditions. The first occurred in the mid-2000s.  In June 2004, the FOMC decided to begin raising the federalfunds rate target in order to remove policy accommodation.  It raised the target in 25-basis-pointincrements at 17 consecutive meetings, pushing the rate up from a starting point of 1.0 percentto a peak of 5.25 percent.  Despite this tightening of monetary policy over two years, financialconditions failed to tighten in a similar manner.  This can be seen by looking at the behavior ofwell-known measures of financial conditions during this period (Exhibit 1).  The rise in short-termrates was offset by a decline in long-term yields, a rise in equity prices and narrower creditspreads. In contrast, there have been times when financial conditions tightened even as the FOMCreduced short-term interest rates.  For example, consider what happened during the heart of thefinancial crisis.  Even as the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate in the fall of 2008—eventuallyhitting its effective lower bound that December—credit spreads widened sharply, household andbusiness loan underwriting standards tightened sharply, liquidity in many financial markets driedup, and the U.S. stock market plummeted.  Financial conditions tightened despite the aggressiveeasing of monetary policy during this period.There are many explanations for why the relationship between the federal funds rate and financialconditions is so variable.  Without being exhaustive, let me highlight three.  First, animal spirits infinancial markets wax and wane, pushing asset values up or down in a manner that can morethan offset the effects of movements in short-term interest rates.  The movements in manyfinancial markets following last year’s presidential election are a notable example of thisphenomenon.  Second, domestic financial conditions are influenced by what happens abroad.  Ifthe monetary policy of major U.S. trading partners becomes easier relative to policy in the UnitedStates, then it could lead to a dollar appreciation that would weigh on U.S. trade performance, allelse equal.  Third, financial instability and stress can cause risk-averse investors to increasetheir demand for safe assets.  This can push up risk premia and credit spreads, and push downstock prices—which can more than offset the impact of an easier monetary policy. Divergences between short-term interest rates and financial conditions often appear to be largerand more persistent in the United States than in most other advanced economies.  There areseveral reasons for this.  First, the U.S. financial system depends less on its banking system to4 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
intermediate financial flows than in other countries.  The share of credit supplied by the bankingsector fluctuates around 50 percent in the United States, which is much lower than in the euroarea, Japan and the United Kingdom (Exhibit 2).  Second, in contrast to most other countries,U.S. residential housing is financed mainly by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, rather than—as isthe case in most other countries—adjustable-rate mortgages with rates that much more closelytrack their central banks’ short-term interest rate targets.  Third, the equity market plays a muchmore important role in the United States than elsewhere.  The total market capitalization of theU.S. equity market is considerably higher than in the euro area and Japan (Exhibit 3).Because the evolution of financial conditions can diverge from the path of the federal funds rate,financial conditions need to be carefully considered in the conduct of monetary policy.  However, Iwant to reiterate that what we care about is not financial conditions themselves, but rather theirinfluence on economic activity.  Accordingly, we should care much more about longer-termmovements in financial conditions than about higher-frequency, transitory movements.  That isbecause behavior in firms and households will be influenced much more by how financialconditions evolve over time, rather than by where they happen to be at a particular moment.To emphasize this point, let me give two contrasting examples—one where financial conditionsmoved sharply but not persistently, and another where financial conditions moved systematicallyover a longer time period.  We will see that it is the long-lived movements that have the largestinfluence on the economic outlook. For the first example, consider the U.S. equity market in 1987.  The S&P 500 index began theyear at 242, shot up to a peak of 337 in August (an increase of almost 40 percent) andplummeted to a trough of 225 in October (a fall of 33 percent).  When the stock market fell morethan 20 percent on October 19th—which came to be known as “Black Monday”—many fearedthat the decline would lead to a recession.  After all, that crash was the largest-ever one-daypercentage decline of the U.S. stock market.  But, no recession occurred.  Importantly,households sustained their spending despite the sharp decline in household wealth.  Thishappened, in part, because household spending had not yet responded much to the sharp run-upin stock prices earlier in the year, so consumer spending turned out to be relatively insensitive tothe market’s sharp reversal.  In addition, the damage from the sharp stock market decline wasmitigated by the Federal Reserve’s commitment “to serve as a source of liquidity to support theeconomic and financial system.”A contrasting example is the sharp appreciation of the dollar that began in 1978 and reached apeak in March 1985.  The persistent strength of the dollar had a significant negative consequencefor U.S. trade performance.  Our trade deficit widened sharply in 1985 and 1986, whichcontributed to the sharp slowdown in U.S. manufacturing production growth—and a milderslowdown in GDP growth—over this period. This leads to an important question:  When should the FOMC take changes in financialconditions into consideration in its conduct of monetary policy?  I don’t think there is a simpleanswer.  Financial conditions matter in influencing the economic outlook, but so do many otherfactors.  It is true that monitoring financial conditions can help improve the effectiveness of thepolicy decision-making process.  However, as I hope is clear from my previous examples, thereis no mechanical link between policy rates and financial conditions that monetary policymakerscan systematically rely upon to set policy.Another key question is what one should focus on in assessing financial conditions.  Again, Idon’t think there is a simple answer, as the significance of any particular aspect of changes infinancial conditions depends on the economic circumstances and environment.  In the early- tomid-2000s, the combination of looser mortgage underwriting practices and home equitywithdrawal were major financial factors contributing to that economic expansion.  Thesubsequent housing crash was exacerbated by the sharp reversals of mortgage lending5 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
standards and home equity withdrawal, which together contributed to the severity of the GreatRecession.  Today, these factors seem less important because lending practices in the housingmarket have been much more stable in recent years.The importance and complexity of financial conditions also underscore the need for caution infollowing any mechanical monetary policy rule.  For example, the most well-known rule—theTaylor Rule—does not explicitly take financial conditions into account in terms of its monetarypolicy prescription.  In that rule, the federal funds rate depends only on the deviations of outputfrom its potential and inflation from the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective, and on the level ofthe real short-term interest rate consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy.  Because theinteractions can shift between financial conditions and the economic outlook—as well asbetween financial conditions and the federal funds rate—the absence of financial conditions inthis rule can cause it to perform poorly as a guide for monetary policy.As a case in point, consider what the 1999 variant of the Taylor Rule indicated as the appropriatemonetary policy setting in September 2008, just prior to the failure of Lehman Brothers.  In theBluebook document that the Federal Reserve Board staff prepared for the September 2008FOMC meeting, the 1999 Taylor Rule called for a federal funds rate setting of 3.5 percent for thefourth quarter of 2008, well above the 2 percent setting at the time of the meeting.  The standard1993 Taylor Rule—which puts a greater weight on inflation—called for an even higher federalfunds rate target of 4.1 percent.  Given the rapid deterioration in financial conditions, instead offollowing the prescription from these rules, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate rapidly over thenext three months, pushing the federal funds rate down to a range of 0 to a quarter of 1 percentby year-end.Consistent with this episode, such rules often perform poorly at times when the economicenvironment and outlook are rapidly changing.  This is one important reason why I do not supportproposals that would require the Federal Reserve to explain to Congress whenever its federalfunds rate target deviates from a particular prescriptive monetary policy rule.  As FederalReserve Chair Yellen explained in a recent speech, not only are there a plethora of rules tochoose from, but following any monetary policy rule in a perfunctory manner would likely lead toinappropriate monetary policy at times—especially during economic turning points when theoutlook is changing rapidly. Also, requiring the Federal Reserve Chair to explain frequently why the FOMC had deviated froma particular rule would unduly impinge on the ability of the FOMC to conduct monetary policy in amanner insulated from short-term political considerations.  Of course, Congress has the right tohear from the Federal Reserve about its conduct of U.S. monetary policy.  There are alreadyseveral opportunities, including regular testimony and semiannual monetary policy reports.  IfCongress desires, such communications could become more frequent or enhanced.  But, mypoint is that these exchanges should not be triggered by deviations from a mechanical rule.  And,of course, I feel that this is especially true for a rule that does not account for financialconditions. Now that I have expounded upon the importance of financial conditions, I would like to discusstheir implications for the current stance of U.S. monetary policy.  As I see it, there were a numberof factors behind the FOMC’s decision in March to take another step in gradually removingaccommodation by raising the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a range of threequarters of a percent to 1 percent. Most importantly, the economy has continued to grow modestly above its sustainable long-termpace.  This has led to continued, sturdy monthly job gains and a gradual diminution of the amountof slack in the U.S. labor market.  Forward-looking indicators foreshadow a continuation of thistrend.  For example, household and business confidence has increased markedly over the pastfew months. 6 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The economic outlook abroad also appears to have brightened.  Growth has picked up in Europe.Commodity prices have risen, reducing the pressure on emerging market economies that aremajor commodity exporters.  There are still significant uncertainties and risks abroad, but overall,these risks seem significantly lower than they were a year ago. Inflation has moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has moved up in the past few months as the sharp declines in energy prices inlate 2015 and early 2016 have fallen out of the calculation.  Core inflation—which ignores themore volatile movements in energy and food prices—also has moved slightly higher.  Over the12 months through January 2017, the core personal consumption expenditure deflator has risenat about 1.75 percent, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier.  Thus, I have become more confidentthat inflation will stabilize around the FOMC’s objective over the medium term. While there is still considerable uncertainty about fiscal policy and its potential contribution toeconomic activity, it seems likely that it will shift over time to a more stimulative setting. Consequently, it appears that the risks for both economic growth and inflation over the mediumto longer term may be shifting gradually to the upside. Even after the latest increase, the federal funds rate target range at three quarters of a percent to1 percent is still unusually low in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms.  While most FOMCparticipants judge the equilibrium short-term real interest rate that is consistent with a neutralmonetary policy to be low—perhaps in a range of 0 to 1 percent—this is still above the currentinflation-adjusted federal funds rate.  In such circumstances, it seems appropriate to scale backmonetary policy accommodation gradually in order to reduce the risk of the economyoverheating, and to avoid a significant inflation overshoot in the medium term. Finally, prior to the March FOMC meeting, financial conditions were generally easing rather thanbecoming tighter, even as the FOMC raised its policy rate in December and market participantsincreasingly expected further policy tightening in the coming year.  Between the December andMarch FOMC meetings, U.S. equity prices rose by about 4 percent, and credit spreads, such asthose for high-yield bonds, narrowed.  Long-term yields and the trade-weighted dollar were littlechanged over this period.William McChesney Martin, the ninth chair of the FOMC, once famously opined that the FederalReserve is “in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just whenthe party was really warming up.”  I don’t think we are removing the punch bowl, yet.  We’re justadding a bit more fruit juice. Before I conclude, let me make a few comments about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Asyou are undoubtedly aware, the Federal Reserve dramatically expanded the size of its balancesheet during and following the financial crisis to provide accommodation to support the economywhen short-term interest rates were constrained by their effective lower bound.  Currently, weare reinvesting maturing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securitiesrepayments to keep the size of the balance sheet generally stable.  We have said that we plan tocontinue this policy of reinvestment until we are well along in the process of normalizing the levelof the federal funds rate.  As the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate three times, thisprocess seems to have proceeded smoothly so far, prompting renewed interest in our balancesheet and reinvestment policy.The anticipation of and actual announcement by the FOMC of changes in reinvestment policy islikely to push up longer-term interest rates and tighten financial conditions somewhat, just as theearlier purchases pushed down long-term interest rates.  To what extent is difficult to judge. Presumably, financial conditions would tighten by more if we were to end reinvestments earlierand more abruptly.  This suggests a better course may be to taper reinvestments gradually andpredictably.  5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
In addition, because changes in reinvestment policy will likely tighten financial conditions, we willhave to take this into account in our interest rate decisions.  My view is that reducing the FederalReserve’s balance sheet and raising short-term interest rates are two different, yet related, waysof removing monetary policy accommodation.  Therefore, I would expect that, when we begin toend reinvestment, we will have to consider the implications for the appropriate short-term interestrate trajectory.In conclusion, financial conditions are important.  They matter enormously to monetary policybecause their movements can often diverge from the trajectory of short-term rates, and becausethey affect economic activity and the economic outlook.  While it is essential to account forfinancial conditions appropriately in conducting monetary policy, it is also important not tooverreact to every short-term wiggle in financial markets.  In addition, it is important to rememberthat the policy goal is not the level of financial conditions per se, but the achievement of theFederal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Sometimes, that will be consistent with easingfinancial conditions, and at other times, it will be consistent with tighter financial conditions.  At alltimes, our focus will be on achieving our objectives of maximum sustainable employment andprice stability, thereby supporting the livelihoods of households and businesses throughout theUnited States.Thank you for your kind attention.

Gent Sejko: Ninth and tenth review of the arrangement with the IMFconcludedSpeech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the joint press conference with theIMF mission and the Minister of Finance, Tirana, 24 January 2017.*   *   *On the completion of the ninth and tenth review of the Arrangement with the IMFThe beginning of 2017 coincides with the conclusion of Albania’s arrangement with the IMF. ThisArrangement has guided our development policies over the past three years, and has been aroadmap for our structural reforms agenda in the long term. Against this backdrop, the lastreview of the Arrangement not only provides for a comprehensive assessment on theachievement of its objectives, but also helps in identifying challenges to the country’sdevelopment and contributes to discussions on the policies that need to be designed andimplemented for supporting the development.Let me now outline the opinion of the Bank of Albania on this review.The Arrangement with the IMF was signed amid an external economic and financialenvironment surrounded by uncertainties, and in response to deepening internaldevelopment challenges. Economic growth was on the downtrend, public debt and non-performing loans were set on the uptrend, and uncertainties in the Albanian economy andfinancial markets were relatively high. With the support provided through expertise and funds, theagreed programme with the IMF has aimed at drawing up an appropriate monetary and fiscalpolicy mix, correcting fiscal imbalances, improving the balance sheets of economic agents, andimplementing an ambitious structural reforms programme, to support the long-term developmentof Albania.The Bank of Albania assesses that the Arrangement has achieved its majorobjectives: correcting structural imbalances and setting the country on a steadier path to long-term development.Economic growth has been improving in the recent years, driven – among others – by thecombination of the monetary stimulus and fiscal consolidation, reduction of risk premiums in theeconomy and improvement of the balance sheets in the real sector of the economy. From alonger-term perspective, the structural reforms and the improved business climate should openthe way for faster, more balanced and stable growth.In addition, excluding the effects of supply-side shocks, inflation has trended upwardrecently. The improvement of economic activity, implementation of a prudent monetary policyand a better anchoring of inflation expectations render us confident for the stable return ofinflation to our 3% target.Lastly, Albania has made notable progress with regard to strengthening other economicand financial equilibriums. Safety nets in the financial system have been strengthened. Theinstitutional framework that shapes the coordination, design and implementation of measures forsafeguarding financial stability has been improved. The legal framework that disciplines contractenforcement has been improved. Credit risk has been lowered and non-performing loans havebeen reduced, although their level remains high. After peaking in 2015, Albania’s public debtappears to be set on a downward trend. Also, our external position remains stable and currentaccount deficits have been financed by high levels of foreign direct investments.Turning to the latest developments, the Bank of Albania deems that the recent economic 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
and financial indicators have been in line with our projections.This performance reconfirms our scenario of expectations for the outlook. The Bank ofAlbania expects economic activity to improve in the medium-term horizon. This improvement willenable the return of the economy to equilibrium, the further improvement of indicators in thelabour market, and the return of inflation to target.The outlook remains positive, but its guaranteeing requires prudent economic policiesand further structural reforms. Such policies and reforms should be, in essence, acontinuation of the philosophy that has guided the initiatives and steps we have undertaken in therecent years.To sum up, the Bank of Albania judges that:The actual economic policy combination, based on an accommodative monetarypolicy and fiscal policy stance set on public debt reduction, should bemaintained. The monetary policy should maintain the accommodative stance in themedium-term horizon, whereas the intensity of the monetary stimulus should adapt to theneeds of the country’s development.The business climate at home should be further improved. The Bank of Albaniaconsiders that the attraction of foreign investments as well as the support and stimulation ofdomestic investments should be at the focus of decision makers.Structural reforms should be accelerated and Albania’s competitive advantagesshould be enhanced further.In conclusion, I would like to once again thank the IMF Mission for the useful and constructivediscussions. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: Have unconventional policies overstretched centralbank independence? Challenges for accountability andtransparency in the wake of the crisisKeynote address by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the "Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An Agenda forEurope and the United States", Frankfurt am Main, 29 March 2017.*   *   *I would like to thank Claus Brand for his contribution to this speech.Evolution in consensus on the role of central banks and central bank independenceIn the course of monetary history, consensus on the role of monetary policy and on theappropriate degree of independence of the central bank has fluctuated considerably. Duringmajor crises, the pendulum has tended to swing from one extreme to the other. In the heyday of the gold standard, i.e. the decades preceding World War I, there was acommonly accepted understanding of how to preserve monetary and financial stability. The goldstandard provided what we call a “nominal anchor”. It effectively ensured central bankindependence from other public policies by subjecting monetary policy to an automatic rule. Atthe same time, there was a clear understanding of the role of central banks as a lender of lastresort. Under that regime, central banks enjoyed sufficient discretion to take effective action inthe event of banking panics. Adherence to the oft-quoted Bagehot principle (“lend freely at a highrate against good collateral” to solvent, but illiquid institutions) ensured that lender of last resortactivities did not threaten monetary stability.The pendulum began to swing away from this pre-war consensus when World War I promptedmany countries to subordinate monetary policy to financing war and to suspend the goldstandard. Countries returning to the gold standard after World War I, however, turned to overlyrigid management of monetary affairs. Lacking the necessary discretion, following the WallStreet crash and the global recession in 1929, and the subsequent banking crisis, monetarypolicy prompted a precipitous collapse in money and prices. This spawned the greatest loss injobs and output on record in what came to be remembered as the Great Depression.In a fateful irony of monetary history, the role of monetary policy in precipitating these calamitousevents did not usher in monetary reform. On the contrary, notions hardened that monetary policywas powerless and that macroeconomic stability needed to be safeguarded through otherpolicies. This shift in emphasis culminated in fiscal dominance, which contributed to themonetary mismanagement of the 1960s and 70s, paving the way for the “Great Inflation”. Only afew countries that preserved central bank independence, such as Germany, were able tomaintain low inflation rates throughout these years.The Great Inflation was eventually overcome as monetary policy once again gained centre stageand was recognised as a powerful factor in macroeconomic stability. Economists, irrespective oftheir scholarly persuasion, and policymakers alike became convinced of Milton Friedman’sfamous dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. This return toold wisdom helped to rebuild a consensus that central banks need to be granted sufficientindependence to pursue monetary stability without political interference. The pendulum hadswung back, and central bank independence became the mainstay of inflation targetingframeworks. In the European Union, the independence granted to the ECB for the pursuit of pricestability is a central plank of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and has thereby attained aunique institutional and legal status.12345 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Challenges for central bank communication and accountability in times of crisisWe have been going through the biggest financial crisis in two generations, which has nowlasted nearly a decade. Prior to it, monetary policy operated predominantly through adjustmentsto short-term interest rates. But the crisis has upended traditional patterns in finance andeconomics, and monetary policy is no exception. In its response to the crisis, the ECB hasdeployed a novel and complex range of instruments. The novelty and complexity of theseunconventional measures have created challenges for accountability and transparency.The financial crisis has evolved in three main phases, each of which has required differentmonetary policy responses and has brought about particular challenges for central bankcommunication and accountability.The first phase was the abrupt liquidity crisis triggered by the turning of the global financial cycleand the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. It provoked a systemic failure of fundingmarkets and prompted global central banks to step in with forceful and coordinated interventionsto provide essential liquidity to the banking sector. Without this response, the financial systemwould have collapsed and a far deeper recession would have ensued.Owing to the funding freeze, the classical interest rate instrument ceased to be the mainsignalling device of the monetary policy stance. The deployment of the central bank balancesheet as a stabilising instrument was a novelty, and immediately met substantial scepticism.First, there were concerns about moral hazard, given the unprecedented expansion of ECBcredit to banks at a time when banks were under scrutiny for their mismanagement of risk in thepre-crisis period and for having precipitated the crisis in the first place. Second, there were alsoconcerns about these liquidity injections paving the way for inflation.Owing to the incompleteness of the institutional structure of Economic and Monetary Union(EMU), the profound effects of the banking crisis were not addressed as swiftly in the euro areaas in other jurisdictions. This paved the way for the second phase of the crisis, the sovereigndebt crisis, which was amplified by the fact that banks predominantly hold debt securities of theirown national governments. As the cost of borrowing increased for certain governments, bankswith exposures to this debt came under intense market pressure, ultimately leading to entirenational banking systems losing market access. This in turn resulted in financial fragmentationand a serious disruption of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. As a consequence,cuts in key ECB interest rates were not being passed on to firms and households to the sameextent in every euro area country.To arrest and reverse this development, two policies were introduced. First, to ensure bankscould rely on longer-term funding, central bank liquidity was made available for up to three years,and the collateral that could be used to access central bank money was expanded. Second, theannouncement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in 2012 removed the euro area break-up risk that was being priced into government borrowing costs.Notwithstanding the success of OMTs in alleviating redenomination risk, the sovereign debt crisisset back the recovery and laid the ground for the third phase of the crisis. Banks in large parts ofthe euro area became less willing and less capable of keeping credit flowing to the real economy,producing a vicious circle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics. Accordingly,headline inflation began to drift downwards, owing both to global energy and commodity pricedevelopments and to ongoing weakness in the core components.In June 2014 monetary policy in the euro area embarked on a phase of renewed expansion,aimed both at enhancing monetary policy transmission, in a context of continued bankdeleveraging, and increasing policy accommodation in view of persistently weak inflation. Havinglimited room for manoeuvre on the main refinancing rate, the ECB initiated a series of newunconventional measures. These consisted of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
(TLTROs), our asset purchase programme for public and private sector securities (APP), andour policy of charging a zero interest rate on main refinancing operations and a negative rate onexcess reserves. As the floor of our monetary policy corridor – which by then had become thekey instrument steering monetary conditions in the money market – was reduced to negativelevels, other short to medium-term market yields dipped below the zero line as well.Given the novelty, scope and size of the measures taken, and given their potential interactionwith other public policies, communication of these measures proved to be much more difficultthan before the crisis, when we only had to explain how changes in the main policy interest ratesaffect the economy and ultimately the price level.Likewise, holding the ECB accountable for its monetary policy has also become more difficult.Let me illustrate this difficulty by considering how observers have been using Taylor rules tocompare our policy interest rates with rule-based benchmarks. In a Taylor rule, suchbenchmarks are pinned down mainly by the deviation of inflation from target and by a measure ofeconomic slack. On this basis, observers held central banks accountable for monetary policydecisions, as the relation between policy objective and instrument is transparent and notequivocal. In a nutshell, empirical regularities lay the ground for a prescriptive monetary policyrule – even though oversimplified – against which central bank actions can be evaluated.In crisis times, it turned out to be nearly impossible to track the monetary policy stance using aTaylor rule. First, with the interest rate having ceased to be the main instrument, incorporatingbalance sheet measures into the rule is not straightforward at all.. Second, as the transmissionof policy interest rates to the economy has been impaired, their comparison with Taylor rulebenchmarks has become much less informative. Third, in view of persistently weak and lowinflation and a high degree of economic slack, Taylor rules might well prescribe the setting ofinterest rates below their effective lower bound, wrongly indicating a tight policy stance, as theeasing effects of unconventional measures cannot be accounted for. Developing othercomparatively simple monitoring tools has not been possible. Overall, the ability of observers touse policy rules to hold the ECB accountable has been severely hindered.How can we then be sure that the measures taken fall within the ECB’s narrowly defined pricestability mandate?The precise scope of our price stability mandate has been the subject of some debate in recenttimes. Some have argued that central banks, by engaging in a systematic expansion of theirbalance sheets, are in effect venturing into the realm of fiscal policy. Such views could be pavingthe way for another turnaround in the public perception and institutional status of central banks,which could result in less financial and, ultimately, less statutory independence. This threat maybe even more pronounced in a world in which, virtually everywhere, public debt has surged tohigh levels, making political pressure on central banks to alleviate debt servicing costs throughhigher inflation more likely. Another swing of the pendulum?Central banks are ultimately judged on their success or failure in ensuring low and stableinflation. Central bank independence gives them the freedom to pursue their mandate.Independence does not mean that they can act in a completely unfettered way. In moderndemocratic societies, independent institutions are accountable. They need to explain the reasonsfor their actions and why these are appropriate for fulfilling the mandate that has been assignedto them as the result of a democratic process. For central banks, one of the challenges is tocommunicate their internal deliberations in a transparent manner to their external stakeholders.Safeguarding accountabilityThe Treaty sets out an accountability framework for the ECB, which requires regularappearances by ECB officials before the European Parliament and the publishing of the Annual67 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Report. Let me remind you that the ECB was the first major central bank to hold pressconferences on its monetary policy decisions. The Economic Bulletin provides a comprehensiveaccount of the economic and monetary analyses supporting the Governing Council’sassessments. In 2015, we took another important step: we started publishing accounts of themonetary policy meetings of the Governing Council, as an additional means to explain thedeliberation process that leads to our actions.Overall, the steps that the ECB took to enhance transparency have been acknowledged in areport released this week by Transparency International EU. Concerning monetary policycommunication, it notably commends our decision to publish regular accounts of the GoverningCouncil’s monetary policy discussions. By explaining the rationale behind our policy decisions,the accounts also show how the measures we take are aligned with our mandate of maintainingprice stability. This is important, because some unconventional monetary policy measures havebeen challenged on the grounds that they could be serving other policy objectives.To elaborate further on this, I will take a few examples of monetary policy measures that somehave perceived to be fiscal or quasi-fiscal measures. It is imperative to be fully transparent onsuch measures and dispel any doubts about their motivation and their effect on price stability.Safeguards against encroachment on the area of fiscal responsibilities are extremely important.Conflicts with the price stability objective could emerge from monetary operations that supportunsustainable government finances or insolvent financial institutions.There is no doubt that monetary policy has had beneficial effects on government finances;monetary policy has unavoidable implications for public budgets. The same kind of indirectsupport occurred during the easing cycle in the early 2000s, when our main refinancing rate wasreduced to 2% – a very low level at the time – and was maintained at that level for more than twoyears. The fiscal ramifications of monetary policy that we see today (and in the early 2000s),however, differ fundamentally from the deliberately coordinated strategy of monetary financingthat we observed in some countries in the 1970s. Today the use of any central bank instrumenthas to be justified solely on the basis of the central bank’s narrow price stability objective, and noton any fiscal consequences thereof.Borrowing from the theory of monetary regimes, it is the dominance of the central bank mandateover the objective governing fiscal conduct that differentiates the setting of monetary policy todayfrom anything we saw prior to monetary union. The ECB continues to have the necessaryinstitutional independence, the financial resources and operational capacity to take all appropriatemeasures, if and when needed, to counter upside or downside risks to price stability in a trulysymmetric fashion.It could be argued that there are multiple channels through which the central bank could take ontasks and obligations that pertain to the fiscal authority, and some of these channels are bothmore subtle and less apparent than outright financing of public deficits. Extending liquiditysupport to insolvent banks is a case in point.But, even in this admittedly fuzzier terrain that separates liquidity provision from solvencysupport, the ECB operates in a sound framework that has passed multiple resilience tests inrecent years. In the case of Greece, for instance, the choices of the Governing Council wereanother example of strict adherence to this framework. In keeping with Article 123 of the Treaty,which prohibits the ECB from monetary financing, the Governing Council imposed strict limits onthe use of government securities as collateral for loans that the Greek banks received from theECB.We nevertheless continued to supply the necessary liquidity so as to ensure the functioning ofthe Greek banking system and the continuation of lending to businesses and households. Thiswas in line with the principle by which the Eurosystem may lend to banks which are solvent andhave sufficient collateral. To sum up, the balance we achieved with our interventions during the8 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Greek crisis was fully within our mandate; it respected the political commitment to the singlecurrency contained in the Treaty, but at the same time we implemented that commitment withinthe limits of our Statute.The Treaty prohibition of monetary financing has been a key element in preserving the monetarypolicy nature of OMTs and the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). The technicalfeatures of OMTs imply that they would only be considered if warranted from a monetary policyperspective. Moreover, the extra exposure to any single country that the Eurosystem mightacquire as a consequence of OMT activation would be secured by the country’s strict obligationsarising from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) macroeconomic adjustment programmeto which the country would have to submit as a precondition. It is worth noting that in June 2015the European Court of Justice ruled that, given the strict modalities for activation, OMTs fall withinthe scope of the ECB’s mandate and include sufficient safeguards to avoid monetary financing.A number of safeguards apply to public sector bond purchases under the PSPP too. Suchpurchases have a monetary policy purpose which is different from the one that applies to OMTsand are specifically aimed at bringing inflation back to our medium-term objective in a situation inwhich our key interest rates are at levels that can hardly be reduced much further. The modalitiesare exclusively governed by the primary objective of price stability and are decided in fullindependence, irrespective of developments in other policy areas.The size and duration of the PSPP are calculated to achieve progress towards the ECB’sinflation objective. The effectiveness of the tool is rooted in two important features of the financialsystem. First, government bond yields are the benchmark indicator for pricing a large set ofprivate debt instruments. Second, government bond markets are deep and liquid. Interventions inthese markets can initiate a process of portfolio rebalancing with significant secondary effects onbroad financing conditions. Several safeguards are in place to minimise potential distortiveeffects on market functioning and price formation (such as the issuer limit and the issue sharelimit of 33%).There has been a prominent financial stability dimension in all unconventional measures taken,but the existing institutional framework ensures that monetary policy is the last line of defencewith respect to preserving financial stability. The establishment of the European banking union, inparticular the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism(SRM), has taken monetary policy one step further away from financial stability issues. Progresshas been made to ensure that regulatory capture and forbearance are minimised and thatshareholders bear responsibility and face the consequences of failure. But we are not there yet.These mechanisms need to be complemented by a common system of deposit protection,which would further bolster financial stability by reducing the risk of bank runs in crisis times.ConclusionTo conclude, unconventional policies have been complicated to implement and to communicate.But they have been effective in enhancing our ability to deliver on our mandate in a medium-termperspective. Our measures have been designed to complement each other and have provedadaptable to and effective against the series of shocks which have buffeted the euro areaeconomy. The complex nature of unconventional measures has repercussions for thetransparency and accountability dimension of central bank independence. But they were a sinequa non for our mandate to be respected. The challenge from the monetary policyconsequences of the financial crisis has placed a particularly heavy responsibility on the ECB toexplain how the measures taken fall within the ambit of its price stability mandate.Non-standard measures have been designed in such a way that they cannot compensate forfailures in other policy areas. The evolving institutional structure of EMU is further contributing toensuring that, if at any critical juncture in future the macroeconomy faces risks, monetary policywill be able to concentrate solely on preserving price stability. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
As described in Barry Eichengreen (1992), Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919–1939, Oxford University Press, pp. 29–66, the credibility of the pre-World War I gold standard rested oninternational cooperation, with Britain at the centre, enjoying considerable leeway in observing the rules of thegame, and France, Germany, and others willing to support sterling’s stability. The United States, at the time anagricultural exporter and a foreign borrower, with the Federal Reserve System not yet operating, faced morebinding constraints. Seasonal swings in the demand for money, for example, triggered gold flows which couldnot be absorbed, thereby causing periods of deflation.For a critical appraisal, see Charles Goodhart (1999), “Myths about the Lender of Last Resort”, InternationalFinance, Vol. 2(3).Barry Eichengreen, op. cit.; Milton Friedman and Anna J.

For release on delivery 4:30 p.m. EDT March 28, 2017         America’s Central Bank:  The History and Structure of the Federal Reserve    Remarks by  Jerome H. Powell  Member  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the  West Virginia University College of Business and Economics Distinguished Speaker Series  Morgantown, West Virginia        March 28, 2017  
 I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak at West Virginia University.  Thanks to Brian Cushing for inviting me here today.1 Gathered in this part of West Virginia, we are located in the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which stretches down from here to South Carolina and east to the Atlantic Ocean (figure 1).  More than 100 years ago, the organizers of the Federal Reserve System divided the country into 12 of these Districts, each with its own Federal Reserve Bank.  Together, the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks are the key elements of the Federal Reserve System. Today I will discuss how the Federal Reserve came to have this unique structure.  The Fed’s organization reflects a long-standing desire in American history to ensure that power over our nation’s monetary policy and financial system is not concentrated in a few hands, whether in Washington or in high finance or in any single group or constituency.  Rather, Americans have long desired that decisions about these matters be influenced by a diverse set of voices from all parts of the country and the economy.  The structure of the Federal Reserve was designed to achieve this broad representation and promote a stronger financial system to build resiliency against the sort of periodic financial crises that had repeatedly damaged the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  This structure was forged from compromise; the result of that compromise was a vitally needed central bank whose decisions take into account a broad range of perspectives.                                                  1 My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. 
 - 2 - Before the Federal Reserve The question of how to structure our nation’s financial system arose in the early years of the republic.  In 1791, Congress created an institution known as the Bank of the United States, often considered a forerunner of the Federal Reserve.  The Bank was created in part to assist the federal government in its financial transactions, a typical responsibility of central banks at that time.  It was also designed to help America’s financial system meet the needs of a growing economy--the same purpose behind the founding of the Federal Reserve more than 100 years later.  The most famous proponent of the Bank was Alexander Hamilton, who has recently achieved the central banker’s dream of being the subject of a hit Broadway musical (figure 2). Congress gave the Bank of the United States unique powers--its notes were accepted for making payments to the federal government and it was the only bank able to branch across state lines (figure 3).  The Bank could affect the ebb and flow of credit around the country.2  People in different regions of the country came to have distinct views about the Bank.  Borrowers in the western areas--in those times, the West meant places like Ohio--desired cheap and abundant loans but were also wary of lenders.  These borrowers grew opposed to the power of the Bank in the credit market.  Northern business interests favored the Bank’s contribution to the country’s industrial development, but at times disagreed with actions taken by the Bank to constrain credit.  Southern agriculturalists viewed the Bank with suspicion but supported its occasional                                                  2 The Bank of the United States became a net creditor to state banks by holding the notes issued by those banks.  When it presented those notes for redemption, it could affect the funding position of state banks and effectively constrain credit in this manner. 
 - 3 - actions to constrain credit to non-agricultural businesses.3  The Bank’s private ownership, intended to give it independence from government control, was a source of unpopularity.  Ultimately, these disagreements undermined the Bank’s political support.  After 20 years, Congress chose not to renew the Bank’s charter.  A second Bank of the United States met a similar fate in 1836 when President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to extend its life (figure 4). These two short-lived experiments illustrate a theme in American history--of Americans from different regions holding distinct views about the structure and development of the financial system.  People in the newer western parts of the country saw themselves as starved of access to credit and viewed higher interest rates in their areas as reflecting the scarcity of funds.  Regional interest rate differentials persisted until around the time of World War I and helped shape the attitudes of Americans living in western areas toward the nation’s financial system.4 These regional differences gave rise to a major political movement in the latter part of the 19th century, as western farm borrowers increasingly demanded a reform of the U.S. monetary system.  Their chief complaints included the high interest rates they faced as well as the burdens placed on them by deflation that increased the real value of their debts.  Indeed, the economy experienced 1 to 2 percent deflation annually in the years leading up to the 1890s.  The country’s currency was linked to gold, and deflation reflected the growing scarcity of gold relative to the amount of economic activity.  The                                                  3 See John H. Wood (2005), A History of Central Banking in Great Britain and the United States (New York:  Cambridge University Press). 4 See Lance E. Davis (1965), “The Investment Market, 1870-1914:  The Evolution of a National Market,” Journal of Economic History, vol. 25 (September), pp. 355-93.  Economic historians have debated the extent to which interest rate differentials reflected market segmentation and supply versus demand in each market.  Other factors include higher risk premiums, reflecting higher expected default rates in some areas of the country, and varying levels of monopoly power. 
 - 4 - “free silver” movement grew in response to these economic forces.  Its most famous advocate, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, sought an increase in the money supply--by the coining of silver in addition to gold--as a solution to reversing this deflation (figure 5).5 The Founding of the Fed By the beginning of the 20th century, the debate about monetary policy and the nation’s financial system had been going on for over a century.  Increasingly, the shortcomings of the existing system were causing too much harm to ignore.  Like a drumbeat, the country experienced one serious financial crisis after another, with major crises in 1839, 1857, 1873, 1893, and finally in 1907.6  These panics paralyzed the financial system and led to deep and extended contractions in the economy. These episodes exposed the weakness of our 19th century financial system, which repeatedly failed to supply the money and credit needed to meet the economy’s demands.  The financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7  A                                                  5 For a sense of the regionalism of this debate, believe it or not, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been interpreted as an allegory for 19th century regional monetary problems, though there is little evidence about the intentions of its author, L. Frank Baum, in conveying this allegory.  Dorothy was from Kansas, a farm state, but after a cyclone, she found herself in a world dominated by gold, with a yellow brick road and the Land of Oz--the abbreviation for an ounce.  The story has four witches--from the West, East, North, and South.  Remember that the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately met her demise when she melted on contact with water, a symbol for the end of a drought that contributed to the economic hardships of western farmers.  But the most powerful change was brought about by Dorothy’s shoes, which were originally owned by the Wicked Witch of the East.  Importantly, these shoes were silver in the original book, not red as in the movie, symbolizing the power of bimetallism as a solution to western problems.  See Hugh Rockoff (1990), “The ‘Wizard of Oz’ as a Monetary Allegory,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 98 (August), pp. 739-60. 6 See Andrew J. Jalil (2015), “A New History of Banking Panics in the United States, 1825-1929:  Construction and Implications,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (July), pp. 295-330. 7 Contemporaries blamed these crises on the seasonality in demand for currency and credit related to planting and harvesting of crops in the spring and fall.  Modern scholars place more weight on other sources of financial tightness.  Some point to poor harvests that depressed net exports, particularly failed cotton harvests.  Net exports were an important source of increases in the money supply in this period.  In the context of the gold standard, poor money supply growth in the United States triggered certain expectations by international capital market participants that interest rates in the United States would rise 
 - 5 - financial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed to a spark.  That spark could come from losses at a well-known bank, from a disappointing harvest, or from mere rumors.  In response, depositors or other investors would seek the return of their funds, which would force financial institutions to sell assets quickly to generate the necessary cash (figure 6).  That liquidation could lead banks to cut credit and force borrowers to repay debt sooner than expected. Simply put, the monetary system did not meet the country’s needs.  It was a system in crisis, boiling over repeatedly, harming the country. Central banks are designed in part to help the financial system meet occasional liquidity strains.  When demands for liquidity rise, central banks can respond by increasing the supply of money and thus adding liquidity to the system.  Central banks have a particularly important role in avoiding or mitigating extreme demands for liquidity during financial crises.  They do this by making loans to solvent financial institutions so they can meet their liquidity demands and avoid forced sales of their assets.  These ideas about central banks’ lending role were developed over the course of the 19th century but not yet implemented in the United States, which at the time remained without a central bank.8  By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States was behind the game.                                                  relative to the rest of the world.  As a result, interest rates on American commercial paper (a key rate affected by international financial conditions) rose following poor harvests, stock and bond prices fell, and deposits flowed out of the New York banking system.  Industrial production decreased as well, with a lag.  This set of effects created tight financial conditions of the sort that could lead to financial crises.  (See Christopher Hanes and Paul W. Rhode (2013), “Harvests and Financial Crises in Gold Standard America,” Journal of Economic History, vol. 73 (March), pp. 201-46.)  Other scholars focus on business cycle downturns as creating conditions favorable to financial crises, as depositors viewed the downturns as affecting the solvency prospects of their banks, leading to withdrawals and panics.  (See Gary Gorton (1988), “Banking Panics and Business Cycles,” Oxford Economic Papers, vol. 40 (December), pp. 751-81.) 8 See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of the Money Market (New York:  Charles Scribner’s Sons). 
 - 6 - The final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe Panic of 1907, which caused inflation-adjusted gross national product to decline by 12 percent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.9  After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although consensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive.  Some called for an institution similar in structure to the Bank of England at the time, with centralized power, owned and operated by the banking system.  Some wanted control to be lodged with the federal government in Washington instead.  Others proposed that power be distributed to regional bodies with no central or coordinating board.  Still others resisted any sort of central bank.10  This debate reflected the many and diverse interests in the United States--farmers, laborers, businessmen, small-town bankers, big-city bankers, technocrats, populists, and more--that experienced different conditions across a large geographic expanse. The resulting institution was a compromise, created by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.  The Federal Reserve was not structured to be entirely private in its ownership and operation.  It was also not structured to have a single headquarters in Washington or New York with branches across the country, a structure that was proposed but failed to attract enough political support.  Instead, a more federated system was created, establishing the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks located around the country.                                                  9 See Nathan S. Balke and Robert J. Gordon (1989), “Appendix B:  Historical Data,” in Robert J. Gordon, ed., The American Business Cycle:  Continuity and Change (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), pp. 781-850.

 - 7 - The Board was the part of the System intended to be most directly accountable to the public (figure 7).  The Board is an independent agency within the federal government, and members of the Board--now called Governors--are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.11  Governors serve 14 year terms that expire at 2-year intervals and are not linked to election cycles.  The Federal Reserve Board is charged with general oversight of the Reserve Banks. The Reserve Banks combine both public and private elements in their makeup and organization (figure 8).  Like the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks operate with the public interest in mind.  Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are required to purchase stock in their District’s Reserve Bank.12  These shares are nontransferable and yield only limited powers and benefits.  Dividends are set by federal law.  The commercial bank shareholders elect two-thirds of the directors that oversee the Reserve Banks; the Board in Washington appoints the remaining one-third.  Only three bankers can serve on a Reserve Bank’s board of directors, and only one of those can be from a large commercial bank in the District.  The remaining six directors represent the interests of the public.  The Federal Reserve System benefits enormously from the insights and support of the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and their                                                  11 As originally enacted, Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act required that the President, in nominating Board members, “have due regard to a fair representation of the different commercial, industrial and geographical divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, § 10, 38 Stat. 260 (1913), p. 12, www.federalreservehistory.org/Media/Material/Event/10-58).  In 1922, this representational requirement was expanded to its current form, which provides, in Section 10(1), that the President “have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 241 as amended by an act of June 3, 1922 (42 Stat. 620), paragraph on appointment and qualification of members, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section%2010.htm).  In addition, Section 10(1) provides that no two members of the Board may be from the same Reserve Bank District. 12 All national banks chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency are required to be members of the Federal Reserve System, and state-chartered banks may choose to become members. 
 - 8 - Branches.  Directors include prominent private-sector leaders who represent a wide and growing diversity of backgrounds and views about the economy.13 The federated structure of the Federal Reserve System earned the endorsement of even the populist hero of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, William Jennings Bryan.  The compromise created an institution that could address the shortcomings of the American financial system while assuring that control of the Federal Reserve would be shared widely.14  The structure was different from those of the first and second Banks of the United States, and from those of foreign central banks at the time.  Congressman Carter Glass, who worked to win passage of the Federal Reserve Act in Congress, called the Federal Reserve’s uniquely American design “an adventure in constructive finance” (figure 9).15 The Modern Federal Reserve In the System’s early years, the decentralized structure gave the Reserve Banks considerable scope to make independent decisions that applied to their own Districts, which made it difficult to effect policy.  For example, one Bank’s purchases of securities could be offset by another Bank’s sale, given that the market for securities was national                                                  13 Directors are chosen, according to Sections 4(11) and 4(12) of the Federal Reserve Act, “with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers” (see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 302 as amended by an act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1388), paragraphs on class B and class C directors, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section4.htm). 14 Authors Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell write, “Throughout much of American history there has been a deep and abiding mistrust of bankers and a widespread fear of a ‘money monopoly’--a fear that those needing to borrow would be taken advantage of by those able to lend.  Such questions had figured prominently in the debates over the fates of the First Bank and Second Bank of the United States, and they played a role in the popular support of free banking legislation.  They had also led to the almost universal adoption of usury ceilings on interest rates (typically 6 percent) that were more honored in name than reality.  These concerns were the subject of congressional inquiries, the most famous of which were the Pujo hearings into the Money Trust in the wake of the 1907 panic.”  See Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell (1994), A New Economic View of American History:  From Colonial Times to 1940, 2nd ed. (New York:  Norton), p. 510.

 - 9 - in scope.  As a result, the Reserve Banks created a committee to coordinate these “open market operations.”  But in these years, the Reserve Banks were not bound by that committee’s decisions and could derail any attempt at coordinated action. This decentralization was thought by some to have undermined the Federal Reserve’s response to the Great Depression.16  With that experience in mind, the 1935 Banking Act modified the distribution of power within the Federal Reserve System, giving the Board of Governors 7 of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) (figure 10).17  The other 5 seats are held by the Reserve Banks.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a permanent seat, and the other Reserve Banks share the remaining 4 seats on a rotating basis.18  While FOMC members are free to dissent from the majority decision about open market operations, the Reserve Banks are nevertheless required to adhere to that decision in conducting open market operations. The structure set out in 1935 has been essentially unchanged to this day and has served the country well.  As intended by the framers, the federal nature of the system has ensured a diversity of views and promotes a healthy debate over policy.  My strong view is that this institutionalized diversity of thinking is a strength of our System.  In my experience, the best outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and strongly presented before decisions are made.                                                  16 For a discussion of these issues, see David C. Wheelock (2000), “National Monetary Policy by Regional Design:  The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks in Federal Reserve System Policy,” in Jürgen von Hagen and Christopher J. Waller, eds., Regional Aspects of Monetary Policy in Europe (Boston:  Kluwer Academic), pp. 241-74. 17 The FOMC was created by the Banking Act of 1933 but was restructured in 1935 to include members of the Board of Governors. 18 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was made a permanent member of the FOMC in 1942.  From 1935 to 1942, it alternated annually with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a member. 
 - 10 - Members of the Board of Governors and Presidents of the Reserve Banks arrive at their own independent viewpoints about the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy. Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices and maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to achieve those goals.19  The System’s structure encourages exploration of a diverse range of views and promotes a healthy policy debate.20  In the modern Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external publications.  In addition, while the members of the Board tend to focus on developments in the nation as a whole, the Reserve Bank Presidents bring specialized information about their regional economies to the FOMC discussion.  Before each FOMC meeting, Reserve Bank Presidents consult with their staff of economists as well as their boards of directors, business contacts in their Districts, and market experts to develop their independent views of appropriate monetary policy. The FOMC works to achieve a consensus policy by blending inputs from the members of the Board of Governors and from the Reserve Bank Presidents under the leadership of its Chair.  By tradition, the Chair of the Board has been chosen as the Chair of the FOMC and has had a central role in setting the agenda for the FOMC and developing consensus among the Committee’s members.  In addition, the Chair is the most visible public face of the Federal Reserve System.                                                  19 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which the Committee first issued in January 2012 and reaffirms annually, in note 26.

Duke (2010), “Come with Me to the FOMC,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, October 19, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20101019a.htm. 20 For a discussion of these issues, see Marvin Goodfriend (1999), “The Role of a Regional Bank in a System of Central Banks,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 51 (December), pp. 51-71. 
 - 11 - The Fed is accountable to Congress and the public for its activities and decisions.  Historically, the activities of central banks were shrouded in mystery.  Montagu Norman, the famously secretive Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1944, reportedly took as his personal motto, “Never explain, never excuse” (figure 11).21 In the modern era, all that has changed, as central banks have come to see transparency both as a requirement of democratic accountability and as a way of supporting the efficacy of their policies.  Over recent decades the Fed has significantly augmented its public communications, as have other major central banks.  The Chair testifies before Congress twice each year about the U.S. economy and the FOMC’s monetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of stable prices and maximum employment (figure 12).22  The Federal Reserve Board prepares a Monetary Policy Report to accompany that testimony.23  The Chair also holds press conferences after four FOMC meetings each year.   The FOMC releases statements after its meetings that explain the economic outlook and the rationale for its policy decision.  Detailed minutes of the Committee’s meetings are published three weeks later.24  Since 2007, FOMC participants have submitted quarterly macroeconomic projections that are published in the Summary of Economic Projections.25  In 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on                                                  21 Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, referenced the motto in a 2007 speech.  See Ben S. Bernanke (2007), “Federal Reserve Communications,” speech delivered at the Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference, Washington, November 14, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm. 22 The statutory mandate was added in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. 23 The Monetary Policy Report is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm. 24 FOMC statements and the minutes of FOMC meetings are available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. 25 Since 2012, the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included each individual FOMC participant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy in the form of an interest rate “dot plot.”  The SEP is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. 
 - 12 - Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed every January.  This statement discusses the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability; it indicates that the Committee judges inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.26  Transcripts of FOMC meetings are released to the public after a delay of about five years. Federal Reserve Board Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents contribute to the Federal Reserve’s transparency with frequent public speeches and other communications.  I believe that support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution is sustained by the public expression of our diverse views.27 These communications with Congress and the public are critical parts of the Federal Reserve’s institutional accountability and transparency, and are essential complements to its independence.  It is important that Federal Reserve officials regularly demonstrate that the Fed has been appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  Transparency can also make monetary policy more effective by helping to guide the public’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.                                                  26 The most recent statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf. 27 See Jon Faust (1996), “Whom Can We Trust to Run the Fed?

 - 13 - Recent Changes in Federal Reserve System Governance In recent years, the governance of the Federal Reserve System has continued to evolve. The 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provided that directors representing financial institutions--the class A directors, of which there are three on each Reserve Bank board--may not participate in the appointment of Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents.  The Federal Reserve Board has long had policies preventing Reserve Bank directors from participating in supervisory matters or in determining the appointment of any Reserve Bank officer whose primary duties involve supervisory matters.  These directors continue to provide highly valuable information about developments in their markets, and take part fully in other roles with the other six directors. Another aspect of governance involves the better representation of women and minorities in the Federal Reserve System.  Indeed, while I have focused my remarks on the history of geographical diversity in the Federal Reserve System, we also strive to have diversity in gender and race both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks.  In recent years, the Reserve Banks’ boards of directors have made significant progress along these lines.  Women now account for 34 percent of the directors, up from 24 percent five years ago.  In addition, minorities now account for 29 percent of directors, up from 19 percent five years ago. Conclusion The long history of political discourse in the United States helps explain the Federal Reserve’s unique structure, in which the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 regional Reserve Banks share power over monetary policy (as shown in figure 1).  
 - 14 - Throughout our history, Americans have questioned the structure and even, at times, the need for a central bank.  Current discussions of Fed reforms echo these past debates.  But it is important to understand that history in both advanced and emerging economies across the world has consistently demonstrated the need for a central bank, and both the existence and the structure of the Federal Reserve are products of that historical experience.  Our structure is fundamentally a compromise, shaped by American history stretching back to the first Bank of the United States and, later, by the lessons of the Great Depression.  It is designed to deliver the United States a vitally needed central bank in a country that has had a long-standing aversion to centralized power over monetary and financial affairs.  It preserves diverse regional voices while ensuring that policy can be implemented through a cooperative consensus.  The balance between national and regional interests is critical to the spirit of the original compromise that created the Federal Reserve, and to its democratic legitimacy.  The structure achieves a practical balance that should not be changed lightly, as it continues to serve the country well.

For release on delivery 12:50 p.m. EDT March 28, 2017         Addressing Workforce Development Challenges in Low-Income Communities    Remarks by  Janet L. Yellen  Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at  “Creating a Just Economy,” the 2017 annual conference of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition   Washington, D.C.        March 28, 2017  
 Thank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition’s annual conference.  It is a pleasure to address a group of organizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans and strengthening communities.  I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which marks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). As you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into communities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to community development.   We at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously.  We evaluate the CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and written evaluations public.1  We currently are improving our examination procedures and examiner training.  We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve our implementation of the law.  And, as many of you know, we recently revised our interagency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are considered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which is my topic today.2   Workforce Development Initiatives and Challenges Workforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types of initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement                                                  1 CRA information is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/crape/BankRating.aspx. 2 See the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s CRA webpage “Interagency Questions and Answers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.  
 - 2 - assistance, and other support.  Organizations dedicated to providing workforce development are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay well, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be eliminated during economic downturns.  Significant job market changes in recent years, brought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and shifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important than ever before.  As community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs are not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong neighborhoods.  As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has made it clear that banks will receive CRA recognition for lending to, investing in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives.  In fact, two Federal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce development initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy.3  While the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in lower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so essential.  For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-                                                 3 See Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development:  A Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City (Dallas:  FRB Dallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en.  
 - 3 - income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higher-income communities.4   The challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater.  The average unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.  Also, a much smaller share of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with smaller minority populations.5  These elevated unemployment rates and depressed employment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce development options for these communities.  Education as a Workforce Development Strategy Probably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the quality of general education.  The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century, facilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the century and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed enormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period.6  But, unfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk, education levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities,                                                  4 Low- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent of the area median income.  Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80 percent of the area median income or greater.  Statistics represent the average of census tract unemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined. 5 Prime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54.  Statistics are from the American Community Survey (ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs. 6 See Claudia Goldin (2001), “The Human-Capital Century and American Leadership:  Virtues of the Past,” Journal of Economic History, vol. 61 (June), pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0022050701028017. 
 - 4 - particularly communities of color.  Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school was 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income communities during that period.7    When students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high school, they are less likely to pursue a college degree.  And when they do attend college, those students are less likely to graduate.8  Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities.9  As a result, the proportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015 who had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higher-income communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10   This educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings.  In December 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a bachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent.  However, the rate was nearly double,                                                  7 Adults are defined here as individuals aged 25 and older.  Statistics are from the ACS data releases from 2011 through 2015; see note 5. 8 Following a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high socioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s degree.  Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and 14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree.  Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’ education.  See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment:  Differences by Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington:  NCES), https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf.  9 Many people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to work, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education difficult.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington:  Board of Governors, May), https://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.  10 See note 7. 
 - 5 - 5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11   While high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12  The advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for African Americans and Hispanics.   Improving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a long-term task.  At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the sometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially lower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.13  Thus, a starting point is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality of primary and secondary schooling.                                                  11 Moreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some college education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the introduction on the webpage for Anthony P. Carnevale, Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish (2016), America’s Divided Recovery:  College Haves and Have-Nots (Washington:  Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery).

These amounts compare with median weekly earnings of $1,501 for men and $1,117 for women with a bachelor’s or higher degree. 13 See Sean F.

 - 6 - We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderate-income students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by their more well-off peers.  First, these students often do not have friends or family who have achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents did not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves.14  Even so, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can assist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will help them complete their degrees.  And they can benefit from help in picking majors and degrees that lead to higher earnings. 15   Second, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to support themselves and family members.  Educational programs that help students balance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates.  In recognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants to postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs primarily serving the needs of low-income students.16 I want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of lower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term                                                  14 For example, 65 percent of young adults (aged 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree completed one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no education beyond high school.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S Households in 2015 (Washington:  Board of Governors, May), https://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf.  15 See Brad Hershbein and Melissa S.

 - 7 - strategy.  However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the financial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree.  To support programs aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages for workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas.17  The Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers online and in workshops.  Educational programs and training that lead to better paying and more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-income workers.   Workforce Development Programs in Action In the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful initiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development.18  As you know, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable effort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw                                                  17 Top occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors of office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business operations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system analysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and construction laborers.  See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland:  FSB of Cleveland), available at https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifying-opportunity-occupations.aspx.  18 For a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015 publication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.  In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are currently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives from employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education.  This initiative will include a series of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a capstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.   
 - 8 - on the knowledge and experience of our staff.  In discussing the examples, I would like to make five points.  First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to employment early in their work lives.  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young Workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19  Other studies have found that students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs improved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20  The findings point to some of the reasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called Pocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-olds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.  In its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of them in jobs.  The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that                                                  19 The survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a permanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession:  Experiences and Perspectives of Young Workers (Washington:  Board of Governors, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-experiences-and-perspectives-of-young-workers-201411.pdf. 20 Baum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the senior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts.  See Charles L. Baum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,” Southern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63. 
 - 9 - focus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the initiative.21 My second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs, which have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential.  For some time, vocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it was associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that denied them the opportunity for the best education.  But more recently, CTE has been refined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers gain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires technical proficiency.  These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields such as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and financial services.   This point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE programs and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and training to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training process.  WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example.  It delivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for unemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22  An evaluation of the program last year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective                                                  21 For more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities Challenge webpage at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html. 22 Aligned services may include intensive screening, occupational skills training, job development and placement services, and retention and advancement services.  
 - 10 - because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, and it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other countries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our country as part of broader career and technical education efforts.  For instance, a state-run program in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop apprenticeships at no cost to them.  Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per apprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs, paperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges.  The program has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24  Similarly, Washington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term increases in employment rates and hourly wages.25  My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a greater role in workforce development.  Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the American economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer income, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job and family commitments.  Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income                                                  23 For more on the WorkAdvance program, see the MDRC website at www.mdrc.org/project/workadvance#overview, and for information on that program in Northeast Ohio, see the Towards Employment website at http://towardsemployment.org/strategic-initiatives/workadvance.  24 See Harry J.

 - 11 - communities.26  Moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely to have paid employees.27  These findings speak to the opportunities that could be realized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their businesses.  Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they need to start and operate a successful small business can help.  Relevant and effective training can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes.28  These programs are especially critical in low-income and rural communities where other resources to support small business development may be scarce. As part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have small business development initiatives.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a small business protection and education series last year in partnership with the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local development corporation.  Participants learned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for small businesses, and the risks of handling large volumes of cash.  In another example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a guide to help rural and smaller                                                  26 From 2011 through 2015, only 8 percent of households in low- and moderate-income communities reported self-employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households (see ACS data releases in note 5).  27 Only 4 percent of African American-owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic-owned firms have paid employees, compared with 22 percent of non-minority-owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce, Minority Business Development Agency (2016), “U.S. Minority-Owned Firms,” fact sheet (Washington:  MBDA, January), www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/2012SBO_MBEFactSheet020216.pdf. 28 See Glenn Muske and Nancy Stanforth (2000), “The Educational Needs of Small Business Owners:  A Look into the Future,” Journal of Extension, vol. 38 (December), https://www.joe.org/joe/2000december/a4.php. 
 - 12 - metropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to growing local businesses rather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies.29   Of course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing.  But, as many of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor credit history and limited collateral--for example, home equity--make it difficult for the owners of small enterprises to access traditional business credit.  This situation is true for many minority, women, and low-income borrowers.30  Nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000 Community Development Financial Institutions around the country, help fill the gap.31   Conclusion To conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as well as other challenges, remain.  Fortunately, programs such as the ones I have highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the Federal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy.  I want you to know that we applaud your work, and we thank you for doing all that you do to serve the needs of lower-income communities across the country.  Whether you work to provide affordable housing, homeownership counseling, small business credit and technical support, or workforce development, I hope you know that you have a partner in the Federal Reserve.  In the ways we can, with the different tools we each have, our aim is the same:  to make                                                  29 Grow Your Own Guide:  Entrepreneurship-Based Economic Development is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s website at https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/community/gyo/gyo-guide.pdf.  30 See Joyce A.

Benoît Cœuré: Setting standards for granular dataOpening remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the Third OFR-ECB-Bank of England workshop on “Setting Global Standards forGranular Data: Sharing the Challenge”, Frankfurt am Main, 28 March 2017.*   *   *It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to this joint workshop on “Setting Global Standardsfor Granular Data”, organised by the US Office of Financial Research (OFR), the Bank ofEngland and the ECB.The event is subtitled “Sharing the Challenge”. This is not mere rhetoric.It rather reflects a strong belief that data standardisation requires a well-coordinated effort byauthorities – as key end-users of data – and by the industry. Only if both parties work closelytogether can we be sure that efforts are channelled in the right direction and that desired andactual outcomes are in sync.In my remarks today, I will first give a short overview of why authorities and the industry needhigh-quality granular data and why data should be based on global standards. I will then focus myremarks on a few areas where progress has been achieved and discuss the challenges we stillface. And I will try to sum up some of the lessons we learnt along the way.Why do we need (high-quality) data?Let me start with the obvious: data are crucial for policymakers.Every day countless decisions are made based on the analysis of data. Some of them areimportant, some of them are less so.But the truth is that without reliable data policymakers would be “flying blind”.This was a challenge particularly in the early days of the euro area when a lack of aggregatedstandardised data, tailored to the new currency union, made it difficult for policymakers to drawthe correct lessons. The efforts undertaken over the past two decades or so to fill this gap aretruly tremendous.And although there are still pockets in parts of the economic and financial landscape where welack data, the challenge has clearly shifted: the focus today is on managing high volumes of dataand in producing high-quality and granular data. In other words, to refine the data we have,expand it in its micro-dimension where needed and to make it more reliable, timelier and easierto access.The need for high-quality granular data is particularly acute in the financial sector.Authorities – including central banks – need high-quality financial data at a granular andaggregate level to perform several of their functions, including: conducting monetary policy,assessing systemic risks, supervising banks, performing market surveillance and enforcing andconducting resolution activities.The private sector too is in need of high-quality data: for their regulatory reporting obligations, forexample, and to underpin risk management and operational efficiency and – ultimately – tosupport successful decision-making.And the need for high-quality data does not end at our borders. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
The interconnectedness of financial markets establishes an obvious need to improveour global ability to collect, aggregate, disseminate and share data. This is a prerequisite fordeveloping a coherent view of the global financial system so that emerging vulnerabilities can bedealt with promptly and effectively. Good data are essential for global systemic risk assessmentand for global financial stability.Standards for granular data should therefore be agreed on and implemented at a global level –the international dimension of this conference is therefore no coincidence. It rather is a reflectionof our experience that global standardisation results in large efficiency gains for both users andproviders of data.And it’s about much more than efficiency. Often external observers question the appropriatenessof policy decisions because they do not trust the underlying data. Global standards can fostertrust across borders by removing one important source of uncertainty.There is thus a shared interest in promoting the efficient production and processing of datathrough the use of globally accepted open standards applied by all relevant stakeholders.But setting global standards is of course not enough. Coordinated and consistent implementationof agreed standards is an equally important determinant of success – as is the management anddissemination of data.What progress has been made and what challenges do we face?Now, where do we currently stand in terms of setting and implementing standards?As you are well aware, there are a number of ongoing international initiatives aimed at improvingthe information frameworks on which policy decisions are based.I would like to focus on two sets of initiatives, both of which aim to make financial transactionseasier to track and more transparent: the launch of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and theongoing reforms to improve the transparency of the over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets.LEIThe LEI initiative, as you might know, dates back to November 2011, when the G20 leaderssupported the establishment of a global legal entity identifier that would uniquely identify parties tofinancial transactions. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) helped to coordinate work within theregulatory community on the governance framework for the Global LEI System. It therebycomplemented private sector efforts to develop a technical solution, some via the InternationalOrganization for Standardization (ISO).The fruits of this important initiative are clearly visible: thanks to the efficient public/privatecollaboration, the LEI is live and in use. And it is also being extended. About 470,000 LEIs hadbeen issued by end-2016. And those jurisdictions which host the largest shares of derivativesactivity already require that all counterparties to reportable derivatives transactions have LEIs.The benefits of adopting LEIs for financial stability are clear. For example, the use of the LEI inregulatory reporting facilitates the consistent identification of reporting entities and theircounterparties. LEIs also put regulators in a position to more effectively evaluate and assesscounterparty exposure and financial risks.LEIs also serve the industry in a number of important ways: for instance, they help banks tomanage risk, identify their customers, and counter money laundering and the financing ofterrorism (AML/CFT).Indeed, in its July 2016 report on Correspondent banking, the Committee on Payments and 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Market Infrastructures (CPMI) recommends the use of LEIs for all banks involved incorrespondent banking and as additional information in payment messages to ensureunambiguous identification of parties to payment transactions and help alleviate some of thecosts associated with complying with AML/CFT regulations.As I mentioned earlier, the LEI framework is still being improved. This year, implementation of theso-called relationship data will be an important milestone.Relationship data will provide additional reference data on the direct and ultimate parent(s) oflegal entities, which will give users consolidated information at group level and not just at legalentity level. Such information is essential for risk aggregation for banking supervision andsecurities regulation.Relationship data are also important for any analysis of interconnectedness within the financialsystem. Today, it is still extremely difficult and time-consuming to carry out interconnectednessstudies in a cross-border context – not only because of remaining legal impediments to dataaccess, but also because the data are not easily comparable in the absence of commonly usedidentifiers with relationship information on counterparties.More therefore remains to be done to transform the LEI into a richer tool for policy analysis, e.g.by also including sector classification as part of the information set that characterises a legalentity.And although improving the richness of the LEI is important, it is arguably even more important tosponsor a more widespread use of the LEI across jurisdictions. In that respect, the EU is settinga good example, representing around 60% of LEIs that have been issued so far, with severalregulations referencing the LEI and stipulating its use. Other jurisdictions too should make moreuse of the LEI, possibly through mandatory adoption in new regulations.Transparency of the OTC derivatives marketsLet me now turn to the derivatives market.G20 leaders agreed in 2009 that all OTC derivatives contracts should be reported to traderepositories as part of their commitment to reform OTC derivatives markets. The aim was andremains to improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk and prevent market abuse.Today, rules for trade reporting (TR) are in place in most jurisdictions and, worldwide, more than90% of trades are reported to trade repositories. Trade reporting has therefore increased thetransparency of OTC derivatives markets for authorities with access to TR data. And it hasenhanced authorities’ ability to identify and monitor systemic risk.But despite this progress, very significant challenges remain for authorities to be able to compileand fully use TR data for their regulatory or supervisory mandates. These challenges includelegal barriers to access data, lack of data format harmonisation and data quality issues.Important efforts are under way in these areas to increase the use of TR data.I would like to spend a few more words on one of these challenges: data harmonisation.The CPMI and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have set up agroup to take charge of developing global guidance for harmonising key OTC derivatives dataelements. This move followed the publication of the FSB’s Aggregation Feasibility Study inSeptember 2014, which described the steps to be taken so that data reported across TRs canbe aggregated and authorities can obtain a comprehensive view of the OTC derivatives marketand activity.12 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
The report noted that it is critical for any aggregation option that the work on standardisation andharmonisation of important data elements be completed, in particular through the adoption of theLEI worldwide and the establishment of a unique transaction identifier (UTI) and unique productidentifier (UPI).The CPMI and IOSCO have recently published technical guidance on the harmonisation of theUTI, and they plan to do so for the UPI too within the next couple of months.The UTI, by uniquely identifying each transaction, is essential to avoid double-counting undunder-counting of transactions when aggregating data. The UTI structure will be based on the LEIof the generating entity, thus ensuring the uniqueness of each issued UTI while allowing aplurality of generating entities.The UPI – meanwhile – will allow flexible aggregation of different types of derivatives products bygrouping various reference data elements, which are important for a specific analysis.Consistent with the global dimension I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the CPMI-IOSCO guidance refers to international standards, in particular ISO, when applicable, in order toensure international standardisation and a process for adapting the standard if needed. And theCPMI and IOSCO will also harmonise definitions and formats for a wide range of other criticaldata elements in the coming months.Of course, this work is highly relevant to the global OTC derivatives data aggregation effort, andfor achieving the outcomes initially expected from TR reporting. Yet, it could also serve purposesadditional to the regulatory ones by, for example, simplifying pre- and post-trade processesperformed by market participants and financial market infrastructures.Additionally, the industry could easily leverage the UPI by including more granular information onproducts, as needed for confirmation, risk management or other purposes. Of course, globallyharmonised data are of great interest to global market players, which would then have just onerule for all the jurisdictions in which they operate.The harmonisation approach followed by the CPMI and IOSCO is intended to be flexible andscalable to accommodate the evolution of markets, such as new products being traded,regulatory regimes and messaging standards. Some jurisdictions such as the EU haveintroduced data harmonisation in contexts other than trade reporting – MIFID II for example – tosupport pre- and post-trade transparency. This reflects the fact that the same harmonised datamay be used in different regulatory contexts and that such an approach simplifies datamanagement by both authorities and the industry.Consistent implementation of these standards should now be our priority. The FSB has set up aworking group in charge of the governance for the UTI and the UPI, working in close collaborationwith CPMI and IOSCO, so that implementation is achieved as swiftly and as consistently aspossible across jurisdictions. The FSB has just started to publically consult on governancearrangements for a global UTI. In the case of the UPI, a governance arrangement might involvesome public/private interaction and collaboration, as seen with the LEI.Full implementation also requires removing legal barriers. In 2015, an FSB trade reporting peerreview highlighted the need for FSB jurisdictions to remove legal barriers to the reporting of OTCderivatives transactions to TRs and to have legal frameworks in place to permit both domesticand foreign authorities’ access to data held in a domestic TR by 2018. Authorities announced lastyear their plans to remove such barriers. Progress in that area is vital if we want theharmonisation efforts to bear fruit so that authorities are able to compile and make full use of TRdata for their regulatory and/or supervisory mandates.3 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
ConclusionLet me conclude.The benefits of data harmonisation and standardisation are clear: it will help authorities bettermonitor risks and give the private sector the basis for a deeper understanding of the financialmarkets, sounder decision-making, and increased process efficiency for industry participants.A lot has been done, but a lot more remains to be done.For example, more than three years since the start of EMIR data reporting, users and producerscontinue to face challenges. These challenges include data quality aspects such as missing ormisreported values, the double-reporting regime and the multiplicity of TRs as well as the lack ofstandardisation and harmonisation across trade repositories and counterparties. Other issuesrelate to the reporting framework. For example, although some derivatives contracts, such asswaptions, have two maturity dates, there is only a single field for a maturity date.While work is ongoing to address some specific issues, a close, timely and effective interactionbetween users and drafters of statistical regulation will continue to be important.In my view, public/private collaboration remains the best approach for data harmonisationbecause both authorities and the financial industry alike are interested in achieving efficiency andquality. The use of international standards, where they exist or can be introduced, is likewise agood approach. This is particularly the case with a view to achieving worldwide recognition andadoption.For example, as a private sector mechanism, the ISO has proven to be very effective, thanks toits strong governance and consultation process, involving most jurisdictions. Such a mechanismcould be one possible answer to the challenge of maintaining standardised data elements,provided that authorities are strongly and continuously involved.And, finally, there are still many implementation gaps to fill if the intended benefits of the dataharmonisation reforms are to be fully achieved. As I said earlier, appropriate governancearrangements for key identifiers will need to be set up. Commitments by authorities to removelegal barriers to reporting and accessing data on a cross-border basis will need to bestrengthened. And efforts to set up an efficient mechanism for sharing and aggregating dataglobally will need to be supported over time.This is a long journey. Today and tomorrow you will take one step further in this journey: you willdiscuss the benefits, challenges and priorities related to setting global standards for granulardata.I wish you all a stimulating exchange of views and experience.CPMI, Correspondent banking, July 2016.FSB, Feasibility study on aggregation of OTC derivatives data, September 2014.FSB, Proposed governance arrangements for the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) – Consultationdocument, March 2017.See also ECB, Article - Looking back at OTC derivative reforms – objectives, progress and gaps, 20 December2016, Economic Bulletin Issue 8, 2016.See, for instance, Final Report, Review of the Regulatory and Implementing Technical Standards on reportingunder Article 9 of EMIR, ESMA, November 2015.4512345 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Stephen S Poloz: Canada at 150 – it takes a world to raise a nationRemarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the 50th Anniversary ofDurham College, Oshawa, Ontario, 28 March 2017.*   *   *It is a real pleasure for me to be back in my home town of Oshawa, particularly given thatDurham College reaches its 50th anniversary this year.From 205 students in 1967, Durham has flourished. The college developed partnerships withboth Trent and York universities and added the University of Ontario Institute of Technology as aneducational partner on campus. Today, Durham College has well over 50,000 alumni.As we all know, Canada, too, is hitting a big milestone this year—150 years of Confederation. Letme ask you this: Where in the world would you rather live? Over the past 150 years—not long byglobal standards—Canada has progressed to become one of the wealthiest and happiestcountries in the world. The average income, adjusted for inflation, is about 20 times higher todaythan it was at Confederation.It is worth thinking about how this progress arose. Essentially, Canada’s economic growth up toaround the end of the Second World War depended primarily on exploiting our natural resources.To accomplish this, we needed three things: foreign investment, immigration and access toforeign markets. Of course, being open to the world also meant that Canada would be affectedby global events, including policies in other countries, and this occasionally caused us toquestion our commitment to openness. But over time, the evidence leads to a clear conclusion:Canada fares better when we are open.Today, I want to illustrate this by looking at six episodes in our history and talk about how ourwillingness to be open to trade, investment and people has ebbed and flowed over the years.   Our Economic StoryThe economic benefits of international trade have been understood for about 200 years. Buttrade itself has been going on throughout history, including here in North America. At numeroussites, such as the junction of the Gatineau and Ottawa rivers near what is now Parliament Hill,evidence of trading stretches back centuries. Goods—and better methods of producing them—spread via trade among First Nations—such as the Mississaugas of Scugog Island, on whosetraditional territories Durham College sits.Trade grew even more following the arrival of Europeans. The colonial powers of Britain andFrance had a strong interest in Canada’s natural resources. Trade in resources like fish, furs andtimber, which was established long before Confederation, shaped how Canada would develop,as the economist Harold Innis clearly spelled out more than 80 years ago in his seminal studiesof our economic history.Colonial resourcesSo rather than start in 1867, let us set the scene by going back further, to see how Confederationactually happened. In the years following the War of 1812, the area that would unite atConfederation was still divided into four colonies: Upper Canada, part of today’s Ontario; LowerCanada, part of today’s Quebec; and the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.At the time, our economic ties with the United States were frayed. No doubt that had much to dowith the fact that the Americans had just tried to invade Canada, but they had also imposed hightariffs on our exports. In contrast, we had strong ties to Britain, which had a policy of preferential 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
tariffs—very low taxes levied on imports—on goods from the colonies.Tariffs served a dual purpose in the 19th century. Until the First World War, governments reliedon tariffs for most of their revenue. But the second purpose of tariffs was the protection ofdomestic business from foreign competition. Over the years, tension developed between thosewho sought higher tariffs to provide protection from import competition and those who advocatedlower tariffs and open markets. In Canada, this tension has often had a regional component, withconsumers outside the protected industries resenting paying higher prices. This tension hasebbed and flowed for the past 200 years.During the first episode of our story, economic growth for the colonies depended on shippingresources primarily, but not exclusively, to Britain. In Upper and Lower Canada, that meantbuilding canals, such as the Welland and Lachine canals. Immigration from Europe was crucialto supply the labour needed for construction. And with little local capital to finance the projects,governments looked abroad—mainly to Britain—for foreign investment. The uniting of Upper andLower Canada in 1841 was an important step in attracting the funds needed to build the canalsthat would allow ships to travel efficiently from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The newwaterway allowed wheat shipments from Upper Canada to boom. It also attracted shipments ofUS grain, because Britain considered everything sent through the St. Lawrence to be Canadian,applying the same preferential tariff regardless of origin.So, by the early 1840s our colonies were making economic progress, aided by foreigninvestment, immigration and trade with the British Empire. But this business model wasdisrupted in 1846, when the British government eliminated all tariffs on grain imports to reducefood prices. That meant that grain shipped through the St. Lawrence no longer had preferentialaccess to the UK market compared with, say, shipments from New York.Prelude to ConfederationThe hard feelings from the War of 1812 had faded as our second episode began. The Canadiancolonies reacted to the loss of preferential access to Britain by becoming more open to tradewith the United States. After several years of negotiations, and after overcoming significantprotectionist sentiment on both sides, the Province of Canada struck a reciprocity agreementwith the United States in 1854—essentially, a free-trade agreement in resources.Meanwhile, the Irish famine touched off waves of immigration into the colonies and the UnitedStates, fuelling growth. The colonies actively sought foreign investment to support theconstruction of railways, so goods could move in winter as well as in summer. Most of theinvestment to finance these projects came from overseas, primarily from Britain.With growing trade, an expanding population, foreign investment and improved transportationlinks in the colonies, the years just before Confederation were generally a time of economicgrowth. However, the fiscal cost of supporting the railroads was high. The Province of Canadafound itself forced to raise revenue, and it did so by imposing tariffs on some imported factorygoods. Not surprisingly, this did not sit well with manufacturers in the northern United States.This resentment grew as Britain continued to trade with the southern states during the Civil War.After the war, with the northern states in the driver’s seat, protectionist sentiment carried the day,and the United States backed out of the reciprocity treaty with Canada in 1866.Once again, Canada’s business model was disrupted as we lost preferential access to a majormarket. This was a key driver to the event that we are celebrating this year: the founding of theDominion of Canada 150 years ago. Back in 1867, we became a nation of 3.5 million people, withmore than 80 per cent of the workforce involved in agriculture or other natural resources.Nation building and struggles after Confederation 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Our third episode begins at Confederation. With access to US markets restricted by high tariffs,Canada needed railways more than ever to move goods and people over long distances, East–West rather than North–South.It is no exaggeration to say that without railways, there would have been no Dominion. In theEast, construction of the Intercolonial Railway was a condition for Nova Scotia and NewBrunswick to join Confederation in the first place. In the West, amid American dreams ofnorthern expansion, the Canadian government needed a railroad to assert sovereignty over thePrairies. And it enticed the colony of British Columbia to join Confederation with the promise of atranscontinental railway. When completed, Canada would have railways running from sea to sea.The nation, and its economy, would not have worked without them.However, building a railway with an all-Canadian route over the vast Canadian Shield would betremendously difficult and expensive. To get this done, Canada again had to turn to foreigninvestment to help fund construction. Over its first 20 years, Canada was routinely runningcurrent account deficits of between 7 and 10 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP),financed by foreign borrowing. This was not a problem, of course, as the borrowing was beingused to increase the economy’s capacity.To complete the railroad, the government turned to a group that included Donald Smith—alsoknown as Lord Strathcona—and his cousin George Stephen, president of the Bank of Montrealand, as it happens, an ancestor of mine. (Stephen is my mother’s family name.) Just as therewould be no Dominion without the railroad, it is also fair to say there would be no railroad withoutthe effort and skill of these early entrepreneurs and financiers who helped attract foreign capitaland channel it where it was needed. The people who developed what has become the world’ssoundest banking system were vital to Canada’s development. In fact, the Bank of Montrealserved as fiscal agent for the Canadian government in the years after Confederation, a role theBank of Canada now fulfills.The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) was completed by 1885, opening up the West to flows ofgoods and people. This link may have been necessary for growth, but it would prove insufficienton its own. The world was in the grips of the Victorian Depression, a generation-long economicslump that followed the financial crisis of 1873. Looking back on the period, it is a wonder that theCPR was completed during such difficult times. Even though thousands of immigrants continuedto arrive in Canada each year, a greater number of people were leaving Canada for the UnitedStates, where economic conditions seemed better.In these difficult circumstances, the Canadian government turned insular. Weak revenues andconcerns about the future of manufacturing led it to raise tariffs. By 1890, the average Canadiantariff for manufactured goods had reached 23 per cent, with imported clothing subject to a 30 percent tariff. However, growth remained modest until just before the end of the century.The tide turns with the centuryThe tide turned in our fourth episode, which begins just before the turn of the 20th century. Therailroads that now criss-crossed the land supported openness in both directions. They allowedthe trickle of immigrants into the West to turn into a flood. And they were the conduit for rapidlygrowing exports. With rising grain prices, the country’s income soared.On the tariff front, the US market remained essentially closed. And in the 1911 elections,Canadian voters rejected a renewed attempt at reciprocity with the United States. However,Canada’s natural inclination toward open markets asserted itself. The government launched whatbecame known as the Imperial Preference, which allowed for tariff rebates on goods of Britishorigin. And over time, Canada pointed the way toward openness by negotiating lower tariffsthrough “most-favoured-nation” agreements with several other countries. Today, the concept of“most-favoured-nation” is at the heart of the global trading system. 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
So, with tariffs starting to trend downward globally, market access rising and population growthaccelerating, the Canadian economy boomed early in the century. Foreign investment remaineda key ingredient, hitting a record 18 per cent of GDP in 1911. By 1913, more than $2 billion hadbeen invested in railways alone, equal to about $43 billion today, in a country of just 7.5 millionpeople.Another important trend began to emerge during this period—our economy was becoming morediverse. Canada’s manufacturing sector, centred here in Southern Ontario, began to expandrapidly. Several factors helped this rise, including the development of technologies that raisedproductivity in agriculture, allowing workers to leave farms for new emerging jobs in cities. In thefledgling auto industry, Ford opened its first Canadian plant in Walkerville in 1904. In Oshawa,McLaughlin Carriage Company began making cars in 1907. McLaughlin later merged with Buickand evolved into General Motors. This industrialization would, in time, help encourage a moreopen trading relationship between the United States and Canada.Wars and the DepressionOur fifth episode starts with the outbreak of the First World War and continues until the SecondWorld War. The First World War led to higher tariffs as governments scrambled to raiserevenue. Income tax was introduced in 1917, which finally gave governments another importantsource of revenue and made tariffs what they are today—purely a tool of protectionism. Foreigninvestment into Canada slowed sharply, immigration came almost to a halt and a majorrecession followed the First World War.Things improved briefly during the Roaring Twenties amid industrialization in both Canada andthe United States. But the US stock market crashed in 1929, and shortly afterward, the Westernworld fell into the Great Depression.Foreign investment and immigration to Canada slowed again during the Depression. From 1929to 1932, Canada’s economy shrank by 25 per cent. With public sentiment turning against thebanking system, then-Prime Minister R. B. Bennett set up a Royal Commission, leading to theestablishment of a central bank to act in the public’s interest. And since 1935, the Bank ofCanada has been operating with a mandate to promote the economic and financial welfare ofCanada.Meanwhile, in a bid to protect American workers and farmers from foreign competition, the USCongress pushed up the average tariff rate on dutiable goods to nearly 60 per cent by 1932. Thispolicy backfired spectacularly. Most other countries, including Canada, retaliated with tariffs oftheir own. The trade war had no winners; everyone suffered as international shipmentscollapsed. Canadian trade fell by more than 50 per cent during the Depression; US trade, by 70per cent. Unhappily, the Second World War is what happened next.Post-war successOur final episode follows the Second World War. After the Depression and war, many countries—including Canada—were determined to create international institutions aimed at preventingsuch disasters from happening again. At the 1944 international conference at Bretton Woods,Canadian economist and future Bank of Canada Governor, Louis Rasminsky, not only led thedrafting of many of the documents but was also credited with breaking deadlocks between theBritish and American delegations. Canada would benefit greatly from this international pushtoward openness.A consensus emerged on the wisdom of an open trading system, and three years after BrettonWoods we saw the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Over the next 50 years,successive rounds of GATT talks led to lower and lower tariffs, from the roughly 22 per centaverage seen before the war to about 4 per cent following the Uruguay Round in the 1990s, 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
reducing costs for consumers everywhere.Here in Canada, the government co-operated with the US government to invest almost half abillion dollars in the St. Lawrence Seaway, and it invested another billion dollars to build theTrans-Canada Highway. To get an idea of what these figures would be today, multiply them byroughly 10. The pattern of importing capital resumed, while the banking industry, along with theBank of Canada, facilitated the development of domestic financial markets. These markets wouldprovide a link to global financial markets and help attract and channel foreign capital.During the 1950s and 1960s, large numbers of people immigrated to Canada, and this hascontinued to be the case, more or less, until today. Simple arithmetic shows just how importantimmigration has been to Canada. Take away the force of international migration sinceConfederation, and Canada would be around 10 million people, not 36 million as we are today.With all of the right ingredients in place, Canada enjoyed years of sustained, strong economicgrowth in the post-war period. It is not a surprise that some of Canada’s most famouseconomists made their mark during this time. I am thinking of Nobel laureate Robert Mundell,whose work with British economist Marcus Fleming led to a greater understanding of how smallopen economies such as Canada’s function, and why flexible exchange rates are a keyingredient of success, especially for an economy reliant on foreign capital flows. Other Canadianeconomists who gained prominence around this time include John Kenneth Galbraith, with hisinternational work and insights into economic cycles and financial bubbles, and Jacob Viner andHarry Johnson, both of whom did pioneering work on international trade.With industrialization continuing during the post-war period, Canada’s economic ties with theUnited States strengthened. The 1965 Auto Pact created a single, tightly linked market forautomobiles and parts between the two countries. This gave Canadian producers both theopportunity to develop economies of scale and the ability to specialize production. Over theagreement’s first 40 years, auto production in Canada roughly tripled, while employment in theindustry doubled.The next step in strengthening these ties was the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in1988, which was expanded five years later to include Mexico in the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA). As had been the case in earlier attempts at reciprocity, these agreementswould not come easily. Many Canadians resisted continental free trade, fearing job losses, thepossible loss of our health care system, and a general loss of Canadian economic or evenpolitical sovereignty. None of these concerns have come to pass, although heightenedcompetition did result in job losses in some sectors. But these losses were more than offset bygains in other areas, and consumers have continued to benefit from lower prices and increasedpurchasing power as most tariffs were eliminated.Beyond the FTA and NAFTA, Canada has kept pursuing other opportunities for openness.Canada has continued to push for reduced barriers through the World Trade Organization—which succeeded the GATT framework—and through agreements with other individual countriesor trading blocs.Lessons of the StorySo what can we say about the lessons of our story, and how can we apply them today? Now, Iknow that I have greatly oversimplified matters and have not taken into account a host of otherfactors in Canada’s development. But I find the correlation between economic progress andopenness to be striking. When trade barriers are falling, when people are coming to our shoresand when investment is rising, Canadians prosper. We saw this before Confederation, in theearly 1900s and after the Second World War. The flip side is that responding to tough economictimes by turning inward rarely succeeds. We saw this after Confederation and during the GreatDepression. The bottom line of our history is that openness and economic progress go hand in 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
hand.It is intuitive that a country like Canada would want open access to foreign markets. Indeed, givenour abundance of natural resources, we have needed export markets to pay for the imports andthe investment required for our development. Similarly, it is not hard to see how we have beenbolstered by a growing population that includes immigrants who bring their skills, labour anddemand. Canada is not unique in this.It is less intuitive to see the same point from the other direction. Historically, there has alwaysbeen some resistance within Canada to lowering tariffs and exposing our businesses to foreigncompetition. But what experience has shown is that the fears of openness are misplaced.Protectionism does not promote growth and its costs are steep. First and foremost, higher tariffsand other trade barriers make things more expensive for people and limit their choices, whilelower tariffs make things cheaper and increase choice. Specific companies might benefit fromprotectionism, but that imposes a cost on everyone else. Conversely, the gains from free tradeare spread throughout the economy.Beyond this, exposure to competition has been an important driver of innovation. Throughcompetition, companies are exposed to new technologies, which they can then adapt for theirown use. And higher productivity leads to sustained employment and rising living standards. Sothere are compelling reasons why Canada should continue pushing for open markets, both hereand abroad.Similarly, there are compelling reasons to keep our borders open to immigration. Last month,Statistics Canada issued a report projecting that in less than 30 years, Canada will rely entirelyon immigration to keep its population growing. Along with productivity, we need continued labourforce growth to keep our economic potential expanding.There are also compelling reasons to ensure that Canada remains open to foreign capital flows.Because of our vast geography and relatively small population, we have always had majorinfrastructure needs. Historically, our domestic savings base has not been large enough tofinance these infrastructure projects, so we have needed foreign capital.A final, related point: this quick romp through our history illustrates the importance of dreamersand visionaries, leaders who can turn difficult odds into win-win outcomes. In short, success isnot guaranteed, but the key ingredients must be there for the entrepreneurial to capitalize upon:open markets, immigration and foreign investment.ConclusionAllow me to conclude. Canada’s development owes much to people who had a vision of what ittakes to build a great nation, and the willingness to take risks to achieve that goal. Our historyshows that it takes a world to raise a nation, and nation building works best in an environment ofopenness for trade, people and investment. Canada has prospered by looking outward and beingengaged, bilaterally and multilaterally.It can be hard to remember this in times of global stress such as we have seen in recent years.The quest for progress and higher productivity can disrupt people’s lives. Automation has meantthat workers in some specific industries have borne the cost of change in a very difficult andconcentrated way, and we can expect this to continue.But remember that we have been through similar disruptions before, and turning inward hasnever been the answer. Rather, committing to openness has always been the right choice. Whatis crucial is that we deploy some of the benefits of being open to assist those who need helpadjusting to global forces. Failing to do so invites doubt and puts everyone’s progress at risk. 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Canada has prospered over its first 150 years. Mistakes have been made, and lessons havebeen learned. But overall, our openness to the world has helped us build a nation that I believe isthe best place to live in the world. Imagine what we can build over the next 150 years.I would like to thank James Powell for his help in preparing this speech. 7 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
1    IEMed Forum The Mediterranean economies in a changing world Lessons learned in economic and financial instability:  what scenarios can we envisage? The role of Central Banks at present.  Monetary policies and exchange rates in the Mediterranean countries Address by Dr Mario Vella Governor of the Central Bank of Malta Barcelona, 24 February 2017  Dear Governor Linde, dear fellow Governors, ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for the invitation to participate in this forum on monetary and exchange rate policy in Mediterranean countries.  The Central Bank of Malta is both a Mediterranean central bank, which once pursued a monetary policy regime similar to that followed by many Mediterranean central banks today, as well as a member of the Eurosystem.  Since January 2008, when Malta adopted the euro, the Central Bank of Malta is an integral part of the Eurosystem.  This comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banks of those EU member states that have adopted the euro as their currency.  For us, therefore, our monetary and exchange rate policy is that of the euro area as a whole.  The primary objective of monetary policy in the euro area is price stability.1  The Governing Council has defined price stability as an average annual rate of inflation of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  This  focus on price stability is based on the knowledge that money is neutral in the long run, meaning that it can affect nominal variables, such as the price level or the exchange rate, but not real variables, such as income and employment.  It also reflects the historical experience of many countries, which clearly shows that inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.  The existence of a single currency, the euro, entails a single exchange rate.  This has both internal and external implications. From an internal perspective, the single exchange rate means that the euro shields its member countries from exchange rate volatility between them.  Indeed, the desire to eliminate such volatility was one of the main driving forces behind the creation of the euro itself.  Prior to the existence of the                                                            1  See European Central Bank (2011) The Monetary Policy of the ECB.   
2 euro, exchange rate arrangements in Europe were subject to the risk of destabilising currency crises.  This instability was seen as incompatible with the existence of a single market and an integrated European economy.2  From an external perspective, like most major currencies, the euro is a freely floating currency.  The external value of the euro is determined by the interaction of demand and supply in the foreign exchange market.  Of course, the exchange rate remains an important indicator for the Governing Council, in so far as exchange rate movements affect developments in economic activity and inflation. At the same time, the monetary policy stance of the ECB, while fully oriented towards the price stability objective, does influence the exchange rate.   From a theoretical viewpoint, one can argue that the member countries of the euro area have chosen to go beyond a fixed exchange rate by adopting a single currency.  The adoption of the euro implies the irreversible abolition of national currencies and, hence, of national exchange rates themselves. This choice involves a trade-off.  On one hand, a single currency, as we have seen, eliminates the volatility of exchange rates within the monetary union.  The euro, as a freely-floating currency, helps protect the economies of its member countries from external shocks.  The single currency also facilitates trade between them, deepening economic integration. However, the elimination of national currencies implies that market signals regarding domestic economic imbalances are lost, allowing such imbalances to build up.  More importantly, the absence of national currencies also implies that a valuable tool for stabilising the economy in the short term in the face of asymmetric shocks is no longer available.  The sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has brought home the implications, both positive and negative, of membership of a single currency area.  It remains my firm opinion, however, that the gains outweigh the losses. It is also my firm opinion that greater efforts need to be made to reduce and eventually eliminate internal imbalances within the monetary union in order to protect its sustainability. I would now like to turn briefly to the experience of the Central Bank of Malta in dealing with these policy issues over almost 50 years of its existence.   Malta is an extremely small, open economy, highly dependent on international trade for its prosperity.  The Bank’s monetary policy objective was initially set as the promotion of “the orderly and balanced development of Malta and a rising level of employment and income consistent with the maintenance of monetary stability in Malta and the external value of the currency”.   In practice, among these multiple objectives, the Bank gave priority to maintaining stability in the external value of the Maltese lira (or pound as it was initially known).  An exchange rate peg was seen as necessary to support foreign trade and inward investment from abroad.  Moreover, given Malta’s                                                            2  For an account of the euro area’s exchange rate policy during the first decade of its existence, see Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, “The euro area’s exchange rate policy and the experience with international monetary co-ordination during the crisis”. Speech delivered on 6 April 2009 in Brussels.   
3 dependence on imported goods to satisfy domestic consumer demand, the peg was also seen as a prerequisite to safeguard domestic purchasing power.3  Throughout its existence, therefore, the Bank’s monetary policy orientation was always focused on a fixed exchange rate as the nominal policy anchor.   When the Bank was founded in 1968, Malta formed part of the sterling area, reflecting its past as a British colony and its strong ties with the United Kingdom.  When the Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1972, the Maltese monetary authorities decided to break the exclusive link with the pound sterling and to peg the lira to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.  During the 1980s the composition of the basket was revised on several occasions until, in 1989, the number of component currencies was reduced to three, the ECU - which had replaced several European currencies - the pound sterling and the US dollar.  In 2002, the weight of the euro was raised to 70%, while those of the dollar and the pound were set at 20% and 10%, respectively.   Following Malta’s accession to the European Union, in May 2004, the authorities resolved to move swiftly to adopt the euro.  A year later, the Maltese lira entered Exchange Rate Mechanism Mark II (ERM II) with a unilateral commitment by the Maltese authorities to maintain its value unchanged at the central parity rate.  This central parity rate then became the conversion rate between the Maltese lira and the euro when Malta adopted the single currency at the beginning of 2008.  In effect, Malta has moved from a currency union with the pound sterling to membership of the euro area, with a period characterised by a basically fixed exchange rate in between.   Maintaining an exchange rate peg over such a long time span is hard, though changes to the composition of the currency basket allowed some flexibility.  Throughout this period, the lira was only devalued once, in 1992, in the wake of the turbulence seen in Europe, which saw the pound sterling ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and the devaluation of the Italian lira among others.  Otherwise, the Bank’s determination to maintain the peg never wavered. We never blinked. The ability to maintain the peg may have been partly due to restrictions on trade and stringent controls on capital movements, at least in the early decades.  By the mid-1990s, however, trade and financial market liberalisation meant that these factors became less and less important.  Instead, major reforms in 1994 brought about fuller independence for the Central Bank and a gradual liberalisation of interest rates amid increasing recognition that, in the absence of capital controls, monetary policy had to be more actively oriented towards maintaining the peg.   Throughout, the lira was buttressed by a healthy stock of external reserves.  The Central Bank of Malta was legally bound to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 60% of the monetary base, but in                                                            3  For a review of Malta’s monetary and exchange rate policy over the years, see Anton Caruana Galizia (1989) “Malta’s exchange rate policy since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system” in the Central Bank of Malta Quarterly Review, June 1989 and Aaron G Grech (2003) “The framework of monetary policy in Malta”. MPRA Paper No 33464.   
4 practice this ratio normally exceeded 100%.  As capital controls were eased, interest rate policy was increasingly set with an eye on the spread vis-à-vis interest rates offered on the basket currencies (and, later, the euro). More profoundly, maintaining the exchange rate peg required discipline in domestic wage and price setting to safeguard Malta’s external competitiveness.  Despite an element of wage indexation, the labour market was fairly flexible, with relatively low coverage of collective bargaining in the private sector and with wage negotiations being handled at the level of the individual firm.  Broadly speaking, fiscal discipline was also maintained.  The government debt to GDP ratio remained below 60% until the late 1990s, peaked at around 72% in 2004, and is now just at about the 60% threshold again.   This discipline helped establish the credibility of the exchange rate peg, which became embedded in the decision-making process across the economy.  For this reason, the Bank never adopted policy options that would have entailed greater exchange rate flexibility, even when this became possible, for instance in ERM II.   Subsequently, this internal discipline also served in good stead after euro adoption, which, as we have seen before, entails the loss of the exchange rate and interest rates as a policy tool.  Despite the several shocks that have hit the euro area since 2008, the Maltese economy has performed well.  Malta has taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by EU accession and euro adoption to diversify its economic base, from an economy driven mainly by export-oriented manufacturing industry to one characterised by the increasing importance of export-oriented services. It also engaged in structural reforms to increase competition in key markets and to encourage labour market participation.  Malta now enjoys rapid growth, full employment and moderate inflation.   The latest Economic Forecast by the European Commission, that of Winter 2017, shows that Malta’s economy is expected to remain on a sustained positive trajectory. According to the Commission: “Malta’s economic growth has settled down from the exceptional levels of 2014 and 2015 but is forecast to remain well above the EU average. Unemployment is set to remain at record lows while productivity gains contain unit labour costs and preserve competitiveness.”  Malta’s real GDP growth is estimated to remain robust. For both 2017 and 2018, the Maltese economy is estimated to expand at the rate of 3.7%. This places Malta amongst the top performers in the EU. During 2017, GDP in the euro area and the EU is expected to grow at the rate of 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. For 2018 growth in the euro area is expected to increase to 1.8% whilst average growth in the EU will remain as in the previous year (1.8%). Malta’s historical low unemployment rates are envisaged to be maintained over the coming period. The EC forecast shows that both for 2017 and 2018, Malta’s unemployment rate will be 4.9%, which is extremely low when compared to the both the euro area and the EU.  During 2017, it is expected that unemployment in the euro area and the EU will be 9.6% and 8.1% respectively. For 2018, 
5 unemployment in the euro area is expected to go down to 9.1% whilst that in the EU will also decline to 7.8%.    Malta’s general government deficit as a percentage of GDP is also expected to continue on the positive trajectory it has embarked on the in the previous years. It is expected to narrow further to 0.6% in 2017 and remain at this level in 2018.  This figure is also compares favourably to the average deficit ratios projected in the euro area19 (2017 and 2018: -1.4%) and the EU (2017:= -1.7% and 2018= -1.6%). For the first time in many years, Malta’s gross government debt to GDP is expected to fall below the 60% threshold. In fact, for 2017 the debt ratio is expected to be 58.0% and to decline even further in 2018 (55.6%). In my view, the main lesson to be learnt from this half a century of experience is that while a flexible exchange rate policy may afford some leeway in the short term, allowing the economy to withstand economic shocks, it is no substitute for structural reforms that achieve greater flexibility in product and labour markets. This is especially the case for small open economies.  In such economies the internal market is far too small for firms to enjoy sufficient economies of scale that enable them to be competitive internationally.  Moreover, these economies wield little market power in the global economy.  Ultimately, the realities of rigid labour and product markets and unsound fiscal policies always catch up.  Exchange rate adjustment alone is unable to restore or improve living standards.  Therefore, a fixed exchange rate policy provides incentives for prudent fiscal behaviour as well as for policies that promote productivity and competitiveness.  These policies are crucial to avoid large current account deficits, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, and currency depreciation.  Depreciation increases inflation and deters investment if market-oriented reforms in product and labour market policies remain absent and fiscal discipline is missing.  Diversification of an economy’s production base and of the markets it targets insulate an economy from shocks more effectively than exchange rate flexibility. In conclusion, I hope I have shown how the Central Bank of Malta has journeyed from a monetary and exchange rate policy based on a currency peg – an arrangement common to many Mediterranean central banks today – to membership of a single currency area.  I contend that we have managed this transition successfully.  At the same time, we cannot afford to lose the focus on internal discipline and external competitiveness that served us so well over the last five decades.  The former exchange rate peg policy, as well as our current membership of the euro area, are not ends in themselves, but are a means to ensure the economic well-being of our citizens. 
Peter Praet: The economic situation in the euro area and theimplications for monetary policyKeynote speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the IE Business School Leadership Forum, Madrid, 27 March 2017.*   *   *Today I will discuss the macroeconomic situation and monetary policy in the euro area. As acentral bank with a clear price stability mandate, we need to ultimately judge economicdevelopments in the light of their implications for price stability. Despite the recent increase inheadline inflation, largely on account of rising energy and food prices, underlying inflationpressures remain subdued. Furthermore, convincing signs of a self-sustained convergence ininflation towards levels that are consistent with the Governing Council’s objective of below, butclose to, 2% have yet to materialise. To ensure price stability over the medium term, we mustlook through changes in headline inflation to the extent that they are transient. In the near future,we will have to assess how the forces that are driving prices today can influence the outlook forprice stability in the medium term and help durably stabilise inflation around our goal.The economic recovery will support domestic price pressures. Indeed, the upswing is continuingat a steadily firming pace and is broadening across sectors and countries. The recovery hasproven to be resilient against past external shocks and influences. In fact, real GDP growth in theeuro area has expanded for 15 consecutive quarters, growing by 0.4% during the final quarter of2016. Economic sentiment is at its highest level in nearly six years and unemployment is at itslowest level in nearly eight years. Looking beyond the euro area, there are signs of a somewhatstronger global recovery and increasing global trade. So overall, as economic conditions areimproving, also the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become lesspronounced, although they remain tilted to the downside, mainly because of global factors.Our monetary policy measures have been instrumental in these positive developments in theeuro area economy, as well as in supporting the resilience of the recovery in the face of externalinfluences and prevailing uncertainties. The comprehensive set of measures introduced sinceJune 2014 has worked its way through the financial system, leading to a significant easing offinancing conditions for consumers and firms. Together with improving financial and non-financialsector balance sheets, this has strengthened credit dynamics and supported domestic demand.Since June of that year, bank lending rates for both euro area households and non-financialcorporations have fallen by around 110 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, whichcan be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declinedby around 180 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs isespecially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euroarea.The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding,as recent surveys have shown These positive developments have been supported by thesecond series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, as a result of which banks arepassing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers. Moreover, these improvementsare not limited to interest rates: bank lending volumes have also been gradually recovering sinceearly 2014. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to thecorporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016.Looking forward, we are confident that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm andbroaden. Incoming data, as well as improving consumer and business sentiment indicators,suggest that the cyclical recovery is gaining momentum. Private consumption growth continuesto be a key driver of the ongoing recovery, which is underpinned by improvements in labour1 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
market conditions, with unemployment steadily falling despite a rise in participation. Thesedevelopments increase households’ real disposable income, which in turn boosts their spending.Business investment is also expected to continue recovering amid support from better corporateprofitability and the very favourable financing conditions.As for price developments, after hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasionaldips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last yearand reached 2% in February. This upward movement of inflation mainly reflects increases inenergy and food prices.Underlying inflation – which relates more to domestic price pressures – continues to remain verysubdued and has yet to show clear signs of trend inversion as unutilised resources still weigh onwage and price growth. For example, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energyhas mostly remained below 1% since late 2013.Concerning the outlook for price developments, our latest staff macroeconomic projectionssuggest that the strong upward pressures on headline inflation from recent increases in energyand food price inflation are not expected to fundamentally change the medium-term outlook forprice stability. In fact, while the staff projections indicate that the recent price pressures willcause a hump in the inflation path in 2017 and 2018 relative to the trajectory expected inDecember last year, the projection for headline inflation for 2019 has remained largely unaltered.By ensuring accommodative financing conditions, monetary policy will continue to supportdomestic demand by mobilising idle resources. This will lead to a build-up of domestic pricepressures and ultimately pull underlying inflation up as remaining slack in the economy isgradually reabsorbed and the output gap narrows further. In turn, this will facilitate a durablereturn of inflation back to a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Today, an important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued is muted wagedynamics, which are shaped by many factors. At this stage, besides weak productivitydevelopments, there is still a significant degree of labour market slack that keeps a lid on wagegrowth. Furthermore, the process of setting wages is to some extent backward-looking in anumber of euro area countries, reflecting formal and informal indexationmechanisms. Additionally, the timing of wage negotiations plays a role in postponing the point intime when growing confidence that inflation is approaching the ECB’s intended medium-termlevel starts to become more visible in aggregate wage figures. Moreover, weak wage growthcould also reflect previous downward wage rigidities: difficulties in reducing wages during earlierstages of the crisis may result, symmetrically, in a slower upward adjustment of wages as labourmarket conditions improve.Overall, while we are certainly seeing a firming, broadening and more resilient economicrecovery, we still need to create a sufficiently broad and solid information basis to buildconfidence that the projected path of inflation is robust, durable and self-sustained. Underlyinginflation pressures still give scant indications of a convincing upward trend as domestic costpressures, notably wage growth, remain subdued. Importantly, the economic recovery and theoutlook for price stability are still predicated on the very favourable financing conditions that to alarge extent depend on continued monetary policy support. Absent that quantum of support, theprogress towards a sustained adjustment that we see in our projections is likely to be slower oreven stall.Therefore, we need to look through the recent surge in inflation, which is driven by transientfactors that will probably fade before long. Our conclusion that a very substantial degree ofmonetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up andsupport headline inflation in the medium term remains valid.Of course, monetary policy cannot be the only source of support for growth: action from other23 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
policy areas is needed to ensure a sustainable economic recovery. Structural reforms can play akey role in turning the cyclical recovery into a structural recovery and the current low interest rateenvironment makes it politically and economically easier to implement them. Such reforms, ifcarried out now, will help to promote favourable economic conditions down the road.See ECB Bank Lending Survey, January 2017, and ECB Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in theeuro area, April to September 2016.For further discussion, see “Recent wage trends in the euro area”, Box 2, ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 3 /2016.See, for example, “Wage dynamics amid high euro-area unemployment”, Deutsche Bundesbank MonthlyReport, December 2016.123 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Andreas Dombret: Banks spellbound by innovation? Lessonslearnt from digitalisationIntroductory address by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the Baden-Baden Entrepreneur Talks, Baden Baden, 22 March 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenMr HolleJohn CryanI’m sure you’re all just as curious about today as I am. We will, after all, be talking about nothingless than innovation in the financial industry – a subject which, by its very definition, cannot beboring. Innovation basically boils down to the introduction of something new. But is that all thereis to it? Edward de Bono, thinking about progress in the world of transport, once described a keyelement of innovation with the following words. "Removing the faults in a stage-coach mayproduce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car."Whenever we talk about innovation, it’s not, then, a question of perfecting habitual modes ofthought and action but about harnessing inspiration and thinking laterally. I trust our variedprogramme today will serve to stimulate the latter.I would like to kick off today’s event by posing three questions that have greatly occupied merecently in my capacity as a banking supervisor.1. Why have innovations in the financial industry become a hot topic now, of all times?2. What do we mean, exactly, when we talk about innovation in banking business?3. Can banks even be innovative? 2. Innovation: why now, of all times?Let’s start with the first question: innovations in the financial industry – why now, of all times? Iwould like to begin by saying that this question is not an inappropriate one. After all, you could saythat, given the lessons learned from the financial crisis, it should not be in our interest to urgebanks to churn out one innovation after another. Someone who is often quoted in this regard isPaul Volcker, who once said that the industry’s "single most important" contribution in the last 25years has been automatic telling machines.Let me be quite clear on this point. Innovations which are no more than smoke and mirrors arenot what I came to speak about today. I am here to talk about innovations which offer newsolutions, because they are exactly what the banking sector needs for a host of questions it isfacing.At first glance, Germany’s banking sector would appear to be faring quite well: the country’sbanks and savings banks have managed to keep their earnings steady recently, and they haverigorously built up their capital buffers. Yet the outlook for profitability is gloomy, and there are amultitude of reasons for this. There are two particular factors I would like to single out because1 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
they shine a harsh light on what needs to be done.The first concerns interest business: it is no secret that the low-interest-rate environment issqueezing margins and deteriorating the outlook for earnings. But saying that, rising interestrates are not a panacea either. Contrary to what is often assumed, they do not bring relief initially,but exacerbate interest rate risk, and that is particularly the case in Germany. Institutions willneed to provide for this.The second reason why profitability is weak is, of course – and I won’t shy away from it –regulation. Regulatory standards were made far tighter in response to the financial crisis, settingthe bar higher for banks. That was the right move, and it was an important move – I think you willagree that a stable financial system is in everyone’s interest. But it is also right to say that tighterregulation is taking its toll on many banks. These shifts in the framework conditions are makingthemselves felt on banks, of course.Time and again, institutions have raised these two points in an effort to pin the blame for theirwoes on monetary policy and regulation. But this "we’d be better off without you" mindset is of nohelp to anyone. Albert Einstein once even said that "insanity is doing the same thing over andover again and expecting different results". Because there’s no getting around the fact that therules of the game of banking have changed. There is little to be gained from coming over allhelpless – it is up to everyone to adapt to the new environment. Actionable areas include differentpricing models, cost reductions or also consolidation.But innovation is an actionable area, too. And given the huge splash made by digitalisation inrecent years, it is a field that has garnered a great deal of attention. If nothing else, the wave ofdigitalisation has unleashed a strong sense of optimism about the future – fintechs bursting withfresh ideas and business models, customers keen to adopt digital banking, and, not least, thenecessary technical capabilities such as broadband internet, especially, have certainly seen tothat. The centuries-old banking business has seen the emergence of a kind of virgin territory – aplace where, all of a sudden, lateral thinking counts again and where perfecting mathematicalmodels isn’t necessarily one of the best strategies for earning money any more. Innovation, then,is booming in banking business at the moment, and there are two reasons for that: first, thegloomy prospects for many traditional business fields; and second, the challenges andopportunities presented by digitalisation. 3. What does innovation (not) mean?What exactly does innovation mean in the age of the digital bank? The digitalisation of thefinancial sector would not have become such a hyped-up topic, were it not for the existence ofthree visionary, but at the same time, ominous scenarios: I am talking about disruption, revolutionand the infinite freedom of digital banking.Let me talk you through these scenarios one by one.The first scenario was, and still is, disruption. Disruption means the fear that fintechs, andespecially tech giants as well, might offer far more innovative financial services far more cheaply,which would very quickly transform them into overpowering rivals for traditional institutions.That is not entirely a far-fetched scenario – just take exchange trading, for example, much ofwhich left the trading floor quite some time ago. What you will instead find in Frankfurt and atother exchanges are vast spaces filled with high-performance computers. This example showsus that when it comes to high frequency trading, machines are making ever greater inroads intothe services sector. Decisions which were once the preserve of floor traders are now beingmade by algorithms. The chief difference is that algorithms make up their minds in milliseconds 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
– that is, around the clock – and they can communicate worldwide. Their main cost factor is theelectric bill.But so far, disruption has only affected individual components of the banking business. As yet,not a single technological innovation has managed to fully replicate the economic functions of abank or savings bank. And even if there have already been instances, such as online payments,where the well-established institutions fell far behind the pace of developments within a relativelyshort space of time, it is often the case that innovations are beset by what is known as the "curseof the first mover". That is, the first player to come up with a bright idea frequently foundersbecause that idea is not market-ready. Silicon Valley’s tech giants, on the other hand, often buyup ideas, but they make them a success. So time to market is not everything.I don’t see widespread disruption happening today or in the foreseeable future. Right now, day-to-day relations between fintechs and banks in Germany can best be described by the relationshipstatus "It’s complicated." We are currently seeing almost every model conceivable in thebusiness world, from a traditional fintech takeover and white label banking to the idea of the bankas a digital ecosystem. While fintechs started off being quite feisty towards the establishedinstitutions, we are now seeing a diverse coexistence based on competition, cooperation andexpanding the service offering.The second scenario is the one I dubbed “revolution". That is another scenario which has notmaterialised so far. Digitalisation, it seemed, held out the prospect of creating alternatives totoday’s financial system which would be less error-prone and more closely aligned with whatcustomers really want. That is why fintechs presented themselves as a counterpoint to traditionalinstitutions, dressed in hoodies rather than a suit and tie, and claiming to be “small, no-frillsoutfits” rather than “too big to fail". But do a sense of a new dawn breaking and a customer-centric culture alone really make such a huge difference? Does the image which fintechs have ofthemselves really justify supervising them less strictly?Perceived differences never did have a bearing for supervisory authorities, and the same is trueto this very day. It is concrete evidence of safety and reliability that counts. News of glitches andfailures, combined with isolated cases of fraud at fintechs around the world, just go to show thataccidents and misconduct cannot be eliminated through technology and a fresh appearancealone.From a prudential vantage point, then, there is little to be gained from constructing an artificialdistinction between innovative start-ups and established institutions as long as they both run thesame business model. That is also why regulators and supervisors only have eyes for abusiness’s actual business model. If you’re engaged in banking business, say – that is, you takein deposits and grant loans – you’re going to be treated as a bank by supervisors. You’ll need alicence and be expected to satisfy supervisory standards. Whether a bank only appears on asmartphone screen or it is a well-established institution with a number of branches is neitherhere nor there. The same reasoning applies to the business activity of financial servicesinstitutions and payment institutions. So if a fintech in Germany remains exempt fromsupervision, that is simply because its business model contains nothing which, from today’sperspective, presents a risk that needs to be supervised by us. The notion of “same business,same risk, same rules” therefore remains the guiding principle for supervisors.Let me now briefly touch upon the third digitalisation scenario I mentioned earlier: the desire forinfinite freedom in financial services, too. A trendsetter some years ago in this regard was bitcoin– a virtual currency, made up entirely of bits and bytes and not managed or controlled by anexternal authority. Could the underlying idea, to use a computer program to make humaninteraction manipulation-proof and trustworthy, work across the entire financial community?I would initially like to state that I regard technical innovations – the best-known of which areblockchain and the distributed ledger – as being highly sophisticated. If combined correctly, they 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
make it impossible for anyone to forge a transaction, a contract or a document, and transactionscan be settled in a matter of seconds. In that regard, blockchain can be very attractive as abusiness factor. It can replace, in part, onerous administrative procedures and external controlmechanisms.But, once the initial excitement has dissipated, one thing becomes clear: there is nothingdeveloping here which will exist outside the current financial system as an unregulated area. Ofcourse, people can, and will, use “blockchains". But, by the same token, people in the financialsystem of the future will also rely on the security afforded by our legal system. Financialquestions are often existential, and by no means will it be possible to resolve every conflict by aruling issued by a computer program. There is thus no doubt that technology will have to submitto the law. For banks, this means that they are permitted to use blockchain technology as long asthis technology is in line with the legal framework and the bank’s management is willing to takeresponsibility for the risks of such applications.Ladies and gentlemen, my remarks should have made one thing clear regarding the question of“What is innovation in the digital banking industry?": the extreme scenarios of digitalisation havelargely converged towards the middle. These days, most companies are not concerned aboutreinventing the wheel but instead doing many things more practically, quickly and, in particular,more cost-effectively. The question is no longer “bank or fintech?” but programming interfacesand calculating costs.  It is no longer a race to become the “most digital” bank or savings bankbut to create an innovative – and therefore convincing – overall package. 4. Can banks be innovative?Let me now come to the third question I asked in my introductory remarks: "Can banks beinnovative?" In recent times, credit institutions have not exactly distinguished themselves ashotbeds of innovation – at least relative to fintechs. Though banks have, in the meantime, initiatedtheir own innovations – up to now, fintechs have proven to be the drivers of digitalisation.That said: it is not individual ideas we are talking about, but a bank’s overall package. And it isless about inspiration and more, above all, about perspiration. Innovation is thus manageable. It isnot my job, as a banking supervisor, to dictate to institutions how they should evolve. We are,and shall remain, neutral to innovation: our job is merely to ensure that banks and savings banksare able to shoulder the risks of their specific business themselves. But our supervisors are, ofcourse, monitoring developments. In the process, we have identified three aspects which areimportant for making innovation a success.First: innovation presupposes openness to new ideas and developments. A not-inconsiderableshare of change to date has taken place in peoples’ heads. Many senior bank executives first hadto learn to take digitalisation and the new competitive situation seriously and to put themselvestime and again in the place of their customers. I’m not saying that bank executives have to startlearning to understand programming languages or memorise network plans. However, theyshould generally be able to understand the language of digitalisation.Second: innovation presupposes the ability to do justice to complexity. Banks’ cyber defencesare a good example. Credit institutions are certainly a particularly popular target for attackbecause the rewards are huge. Given the mounting threats, institutions are in a state of highalert.But being on high alert is just not enough. For cyber defence is by no means a trivial matter. Inthe Middle Ages, it was relatively easy to defend castles: by building moats and fortresses. And itwas mostly clear from what direction the enemy – often the same enemy – would advance. Thereality of IT is a different matter altogether: enemies are unknown and almost never come out into 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
the open. In some cases, professional hackers hide for months on end within a company’sfortress walls. And even if the company has detected a system breach, this does not mean for aminute that the assailant has been driven out of the system – this requires, in some cases, top-of-the-line criminology techniques. IT security must therefore be more akin to an immune systemthan to a fortress. And you can very well imagine that a good antivirus scanner and a firewall arefar from enough to protect this immune system sufficiently.For a bank’s immune system to be healthy, it has to have suitable corporate structures. Putsimply: governance has to be good. Our supervisors therefore order some institutions to teardown the responsibility “firewall", where no one is willing to assume responsibility for the manyinterlinked aspects of cyber risk. In addition, the “human” factor has to be taken into account as aweak link in IT and cyber risk.Therefore, this IT security aspect has to be directly factored into any new projects on to which aninstitution embarks. By the way, the same goes for financial services start-ups. Despite theirreputation for having more state-of-the-art IT knowledge, in the absence of comprehensivesecurity management, they can easily fall prey to dangers from the internet.I still owe you a third point: innovation often has to be a matter for each individual institution. In thepatchwork quilt of banks here in Germany, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution: each and everyinstitution, be it large or small, rural or urban, special-purpose financing vehicle or universal bank,has to find and go its own way. 5. ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, to briefly sum up the content of my remarks:Can banks sit out the current situation using a strategy that was successful in the past? I amconvinced that the answer is: no.What type of innovation is being called for here? In my view, digitalisation will reward not thosewho “reinvent the wheel” but those who are generally more competent at what they do.Can banks be innovative? Yes; at the very least, there are enough starting points and actionableareas. For it will not be possible to “sit out” digitalisation. To put it very clearly, in the words ofGraham Horton: "Innovation is not compulsory, but neither is survival."Thank you for your attention.British physician, cognitive researcher and author (born in 1933).1 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

Peter Praet: Interview in VDI NachrichtenInterview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, inVDI Nachrichten, conducted by Ms Sabine Seeger and published on 24 March 2017.*   *   *Mr Praet, the European Union is celebrating its 60th anniversary on 25 March in Rome.After a brilliant start and major achievements, the Community is now in a crisis. Can it beovercome, do you think?The people of the European Union (EU) have got so used to the benefits of open borders and theSingle Market that they can no longer imagine what it was like before or what it would be likewithout it. They live in a stable world and are not always aware that it’s a great asset, and onethat needs to be preserved.What has to be done now?We have to re-convince people that the EU market, with more than 500 million people, forms thebasis for our prosperity. When we laid the foundation for it in 1992 with the Maastricht Treaty, theEU was a grouping of relatively homogeneous states. However, as a result of the enlargement,countries were integrated [into the EU] which had much lower income levels or much weakersocial safety nets. This has led to distortions which we have to address.Some examples?There can be no doubt that trade and a larger market foster prosperity. But we should notoverlook the fact that this progress does not benefit everyone to the same extent. This may leadto resentment. Such feelings cannot simply be brushed aside; people’s concerns have to betaken seriously. Moreover, the enlargement was linked to the expectation that the Communitywould continue to come together and that people’s circumstances would steadily improve. Thishas happened for many, but not for all. Also, the financial crisis which occurred at the start of therecession in 2009 has led to a crisis of credibility. So there are reasons for many people to feeldiscontent. On the other hand, the EU is willingly used as a scapegoat. Some find this a cheapway to distract from national problems, such as undesirable developments on the labour market,in social security systems or in debilitating bureaucracies.The world is less safe because of politicians such as Trump, Putin and Erdogan.Shouldn’t this make people think again?We have been able to progress peacefully for a long time under the protection of the UnitedStates. We have set ourselves up in a multilateral world. But the old world order is beingchallenged. In the worst-case scenario, there is a risk that power and size will matter above all. Insuch a system the great powers, the US, Russia and China, would dominate. The voices ofsmaller countries would lose their relevance if they act in isolation. And let’s face it, even thebiggest European countries fall into this category if left to their own devices. If we want to protectour interests and our conception of how we want to live together, then we have to stand together.And that’s only possible through the EU.One of the biggest challenges is populism, which takes aim at the EU in many ways. Howcan we convince people that populism will lead to our undoing?We are seeing mistrust in and scepticism about the elites. All too often, problems andgrievances, which of course exist in our societies, are no longer being addressed in order toseek the right solutions, but are becoming the expression of a general rejection. Populistspromise supposedly simple solutions which are, at the same time, specious and ultimately 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
harmful. How can you take a stand against them? First of all, you should listen and take people’sconcerns seriously, because it’s essential to consider carefully the real and supposedgrievances and, if possible, resolve them. Lastly, it’s necessary to explain the consequences ofpolitical action: if people vote for populists who idealise the nation state and make its sovereigntyabsolute, then those voters have to know that, although they would live in smaller, easier-to-control markets, it would also mean much higher prices for consumers and reduced prosperity.Basically, as I see it, people vote for populists in order to protest, but not to reject the EU assuch.Given the current mood, do you still see any opportunities for further steps towardsintegration?Yes, we are working on a deepening of the Single Market to facilitate free trade. For example, ifthe EU harmonises the performance of vacuum cleaners, then they can be marketed rightacross Europe, in addition to being a factor in energy efficiency. But people see this as“Brussels” wanting to impose a diktat, as almost some kind of “harassment”. Harmonisation cutsthe cost of our products, which would otherwise have to be adjusted separately for each nationalmarket. So when the talk is about a deeper EU, greater harmonisation and fewer barriers totrade, then inevitably that is at the expense of the Member States’ freedom to decide. But inareas where national or even regional institutions are better suited to establish the right rules,then the principle of subsidiarity should be applied to a greater extent. It’s not about integration asa value per se, but about integration that’s appropriate and necessary. I think there is thenecessary consensus on this point.Now that the euro area has wriggled its way out of the crisis, things are improvingeconomically.Things are getting better but the economic situation still varies a lot. Germany, which hasweathered the crisis well because of the low level of government debt and household debt, is in avery good position. But other countries were severely hit and still have some serious challenges.The good news is that the recovery is firming up in all the countries of the euro area andexpanding into more and more sectors. Consumer and business confidence is rising, despite allthe political uncertainties. That’s encouraging. After all the years of crisis progress is being madeand people have trust in it.Is the upturn a result of the ECB’s low interest rate policy?In 2009 we had the biggest recession in the post-war era, with a sharp increase inunemployment. Since that low more than four million new jobs have been created in the euroarea. Our monetary policy has supported the recovery as it has made financing conditions forbanks and thus also for households and businesses easier. But let us take a step back andconsider the economic slump. The sovereign debt crisis resulted from it and caused thecountries to fall into a recession again in 2011 and 2012. The ECB’s monetary policy and itsintervention played a decisive stabilising role. It averted a depression.If there had been no intervention, what would have happened?To give an example: if the ECB had not given the Spanish banks liquidity assistance in 2012,when a lot of money was withdrawn, capital controls would have resulted and creditors fromother euro area countries would have found it difficult to gain access to their assets. People haveforgotten just how dangerous the situation was at that time. Many are unaware that the ECB andgovernments too acted in a carefully considered, reasonable way and prevented a worseoutcome. The European institutions were not at all prepared for such a crisis, which is whydecisions were also quite chaotic at the outset. But in the end, also thanks to the creation of theEuropean Stability Mechanism (ESM), a collapse of the Single Market was prevented. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
And yet, the ECB’s role remains controversial and its expansionary monetary policyheavily criticised.The ECB has played a leading role, not least because of the fact that it was capable of acting atany time during the crisis. The decisions were never simple and there was much discussionabout the right course to follow. But at the ECB we were always aware of our responsibility andmanaged to craft a monetary policy supported by all members of the Governing Council. Thispaid off during the crisis. But this success has been double-edged: the ECB has not only had torepeatedly take on new tasks, such as banking supervision. But also it is being held responsiblefor problems the more it is seen as an especially influential European institution that can takeaction. This is the case even if in reality it is not responsible.But you are now facing the challenge of finding a way out of the expansionary monetarypolicy. This includes an increase in interest rates, as has just happened in the US. Is theFed’s step a signal for the ECB?We have a clear mandate and it relates to the euro area. And we have to watch developmentsclosely before we take action. So far, we can only say that the economic situation is improving.That gives us confidence, but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are stillvery dependent on monetary policy stimulus. While inflation is temporarily close to the desiredtarget, it is based to a large extent on short-term fluctuations in energy prices. The underlyinginflation trend is still noticeably weak, and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in asustainable way.Inflation in Germany is over 2%. Shouldn’t that be taken into account and the low interestrate policy, which has a serious cost for German savers, be brought to an end?We are indeed very aware of the criticism – and by the way it exists in other countries – and wetake it seriously. Of course, interest rates could be higher for Germany’s economy and in someother countries as well, if they were alone. But they aren’t – we have a single currency.Therefore, the ECB is committed to conducting a monetary policy for the euro area as a whole,and sometimes that requires everyone to be patient. As always, there are some for whommonetary policy is too loose, while others would specifically like to see more support. But let’snot forget the times before monetary union, when we had fluctuating exchange rates, whichbrought a lot of instability. That was very costly for economies such as Germany’s. Today, byway of our monetary policy, we are contributing to the continued existence, stability andfunctioning of the Single Market. That’s really important for Member States that are majorexporters. And that’s even more relevant in times when free trade is being called into questioninternationally.But the low interest rate policy is creating market distortions, as we see in Germany’shousing market. Aren’t there dangers looming?The price increases should be seen in context. They were preceded by an unusually long periodof stagnating house prices in Germany. This has changed in the last seven years. And thequestion now arises as to whether there is some overheating. That may be the case in the mostpopular cities, but overall there are no clear signs of that. A dangerously speculative, destabilisingoverheating would, moreover, only occur if the price rises were being increasingly andexcessively financed by credit. One would see that from strongly growing home loans, but whichis not the case. And if it got to that point, then it would not in the first place be the task ofmonetary policy to react, as its primary commitment is to price stability. But there are othermeans available to national governments and supervisory authorities to curb overheating, shoulda worst-case scenario arise. For instance, by tightening the rules on lending or via fiscal policy.The UK’s exit from the EU now lies ahead. Could Brexit endanger the financial stability ofthe euro area? 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
No, I don’t think that Brexit poses a risk to financial stability. First, it will be a thoroughly controlledexit and, second, we have learnt from the crisis how to handle dangerous situations. One mustalways be concerned about stability should there be abrupt events which have an immediateimpact. But with the UK’s expected exit this is precisely not the case. We will have time toorganise the break and the related adjustment. And from a purely organisational perspective theadjustment brings for the regulators such as the supervisory authorities an enormous amount ofwork. What concerns me are the massive costs that the withdrawal will cause for the EU27 and,above all, for the UK.But there could also be winners. Frankfurt could become the EU’s largest financialcentre. Do you agree?Frankfurt is a friendly place, multinational, well-organised and convenient. The city offers a goodworking environment. I value that, as do some private sector bankers. But no doubt you couldsay that about Madrid, Dublin, Paris or other European cities. In my view, what matters issomething different: if the financial centres of the euro area hope to play a more prominent role,then they will have the best chance of doing so only in the context of a fully fledged Europeanbanking union. And there’s no point in hoping for that in some distant future. We need a strongand complete banking union within the next four to five years.What’s needed to complete it?We need a clear road map, showing where we want to be in four or five years’ time. Brexit isregrettable and harmful, but it is also an opportunity for the banking union. Having a strong andreliable regulatory framework and a single supervisory body that is both strict and fair are bigcompetitive advantages in the banking sector – for that creates trust of a sustainable kind, thebankers’ most important “currency”.How optimistic are you then that the banking union can be completed before the nextfinancial crisis?Banks are now much better capitalised than before the crisis. Furthermore, the supervisoryauthorities have also learnt to respond quickly to avert risks to financial market stability. Abankruptcy like that of Lehman Brothers in 2008 is much less likely nowadays. The banks protectthemselves as well by making better provisions.What does it mean that some banks are withdrawing from the European market andfocusing on their domestic market? That there’s no European banking system after all?I am also concerned about that, because we in the monetary union need cross-border bankswhich are subject to common supervisory and resolution rules. When there is common bankingsupervision, you also need burden-sharing in case something goes wrong. We don’t have that atthe moment. We indeed have common supervision, but if something starts keeling over, theindividual states still have to step in. We won’t have a banking union with real risk sharing until wehave a common backstop, i.e. a credit line from the European Stability Mechanism, for instance. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Sabine Lautenschläger: Taming the fireStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, atthe Credit Risk 2017 forum, Vienna, 23 March 2017.*   *   *Theodore Roosevelt is supposed to have said: “Risk is like fire: if controlled it will help us; ifuncontrolled it will rise up and destroy us”. I think that describes quite well the modern financialworld and its risks. Managing financial risks is a bit like controlling a fire.It’s the job of chief risk officers, the CROs, to constantly remind decision-makers about the “firesafety rules”.The recent financial crisis showed how important that job is. It’s a job that requires CROs to besteadfast and to speak unpleasant truths from time to time – just like banking supervisors have todo.It’s regulation that helps us to do our job. Regulation seeks to control risks as well. Following thedevastating “fire” of the financial crisis, we have overhauled the rules for banks. We havemended them, strengthened them, and expanded them.That was the correct and necessary thing to do. But now it is time to finish the job. More thaneight years after the crisis, banks need regulatory certainty.But the job needs be finished at the global level. The financial system is global and so should bethe rules that govern it. You cannot enjoy fresh air on your patch of land while there is a fireraging on your neighbour’s – sooner or later the wind will blow smoke and sparks over the fence.Against that backdrop, I welcome the fact that, last weekend, the G20 have confirmed theirsupport for the work to finalise Basel III.But there are still some voices who question the general extent of the regulation. To be crystalclear: it would be wrong to soften the rules. This would just prepare the ground for the next crisis.I cannot deny, though, that rules put a burden on those who have to comply – the banks, that is.In that regard, it is often claimed that the burden on banks translates into a burden on theeconomy.It’s said that banks could no longer pursue their traditional business because the capitalrequirements are too strict. It’s also said that new business models would not make economicsense because of the regulatory cost. All that would hurt the economy.There are two things I can say in response.First, I do not see that regulation keeps banks from their traditional business of financing theeconomy. Loans to private households and smaller companies are treated very favourably whenit comes to capital requirements. Think of the support factor in Article 501 of the CapitalRequirements Regulation. This factor was introduced to facilitate the financing of small andmedium-sized enterprises.I also do not see that regulation keeps banks from developing new business models – those, forinstance, that follow from digitalisation.Second, critics neglect the benefits of strong rules. Strong rules prevent crises, and crises hurtthe economy. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
At the end of the day, it is only well-managed and well-capitalised banks that are able to financethe economy – even when the going gets tough. They can finance the economy throughout theentire business cycle.Poorly capitalised and poorly managed banks, on the other hand, cannot support the economyduring downturns – they get into difficulty themselves. Strong rules therefore help the economy ina sustainable way.And even if we only consider the banks, we still see benefits. Stronger rules increase trust. Andas a result of the crisis, a great deal of trust was lost. And that’s a problem for banks becausetrust is a crucial asset for them.Trust has a positive impact on funding costs for banks, and it determines how attractive a bank isfor business partners who think long-term.Strong rules thus help the banks, too.Altogether, I am convinced that the benefits of regulation are greater than the costs. But rules canonly take us so far.Ultimately, it is people who make good or bad decisions. And this is where banks’ risk managerscome into play. They are the first line of defence against excessive risks.Thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Sabine Lautenschläger: Caution should be the life of bankingIntroductory statement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of theEuropean Central Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single SupervisoryMechanism, at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) Board Meeting, Frankfurtam Main, 22 March 2017.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen,Taking risks is at the heart of any healthy business, including banks. After all, it is the job of banksto take and allocate risks. But as Walter Bagehot said: “Adventure is the life of commerce, butcaution is the life of banking”.I agree with him.Banks are far too important for the economy to indulge in adventures. They enable business byproviding loans to companies or by helping them to tap the capital markets. And they alsofacilitate business by providing services in fields such as payments, mergers and acquisitions,and global trade.Banks help the economy to grow and prosper. But they can also badly hurt it; we saw that in thefinancial crisis. That’s why banks need to be cautious. In practical terms that requires, amongother things, sound risk management.And this sets the scene for my short statement today. The topic is risk management. I will beginwith some smaller, or rather bank-specific, risk management topics and end with a few bigissues.Sound risk management depends on good data. It also depends on firm-wide risk aggregationand reporting. Those who take decisions must be in the picture.But are they? Well, in the crisis we learnt that decision-makers often were not. IT systems, dataarchitecture and related processes were not up to the mark.Against that backdrop, we assessed how banks aggregate data and report risks. The yardstickwas a set of global best practices that were defined by the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision. These are known as the BCBS 239 principles.The result of our review: many banks do not meet the global standards. As usual, we willtherefore be very explicit on how these banks should improve. And we will closely monitor theprogress made by the respective banks to ensure that they meet relevant standards.Ladies and gentlemen, good risk data is one thing. But processing such data is another matter.And that leads me to my next topic: internal models. Many large banks use these models tocalculate their risk-weighted assets, which then serve as a basis for calculating capitalrequirements. Over the past years, internal models have diverged greatly, not least due to thefact that supervisors applied different standards when authorising them.In response, we have launched a project called TRIM. That stands for “targeted review of internalmodels”. It aims to ensure two things: first, that the playing field is level; second, that internalmodels produce reliable and comparable results. The calculation of risk-weighted assets shouldbe driven by actual risks rather than by modelling choices. TRIM will help to raise trust in howbanks calculate their risks.Ladies and gentlemen, there are small risks and big risks. There are risks that affect a single 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
bank and risks that affect the entire sector. And then there are risks that stretch across sectorsand even countries. In that regard, there is one thing that comes to mind: Brexit.Right now, it is still very unclear how the world will look after the UK has left the EU. Still, banksand supervisors must prepare for any scenario. The worst case would certainly be a “hardBrexit”. In that scenario, the UK would become a “third country” from the viewpoint of the EU.As a result, UK banks might lose their European passport and, with it, access to the SingleMarket. This would affect many of the 40 UK banking groups that currently operate in the SingleMarket. They would then have to find another way in.Most likely, they would seek to obtain a banking licence in an EU country to regain the passport.In the euro area, these licences are granted by the ECB. We obviously don’t care whether UKbanks move to Frankfurt, Dublin, Paris or some other location in the euro area. What we careabout are safe and sound banks.We will therefore resist any supervisory or regulatory race to the bottom. Any bank that moves tothe euro area will have to meet our standards – regardless of whether it comes from the UK orany other place.Most importantly, we will not accept empty shell companies. All entities in the euro area musthave adequate local risk management, sufficient local staff and operational independence. Allthat should be self-evident.Banks which seek to permanently book all exposures back-to-back with another entity in Londonshould change their plans. And so should banks that plan to book all exposures with a euro areaentity while having their risk management somewhere else.We are aware that it is a burden for UK banks to apply for a new licence in the EU. With a view tointernal models, we would aim to be accommodating regarding the timing. There will be atransitional period in which new euro area entities might use internal models that have not yetbeen approved by the ECB.But of course, there are conditions attached. First, the relevant models must have beenapproved by the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority. We would also reflect on any commentson the quality of the models from our UK colleagues. Second, the banks must have applied forinternal model approval in the euro area. The transitional period will cease as soon as we haveapproved or rejected the bank’s model application.Ladies and gentlemen, sound banks are at the heart of a strong economy. Banks thereforeshould note Walter Bagehot’s words and remain cautious. It is our job as supervisors to helpthem do so and steer clear of risky adventures.Thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
 "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control": After Half a Year since Its Introduction Speech at a Reuters Newsmaker Event in Tokyo Bank of Japan March 24, 2017   Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan 
1 Introduction I would like to express my sincerest gratitude for the opportunity today to explain the Bank's monetary policy. Half a year has passed since the Bank introduced "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control" in September 2016. This new framework has been working smoothly. Today, looking back at developments in the global economy and the global financial markets since 2015, I would like to explain the background to and thinking behind the adoption of the new policy framework, following the introduction of a negative interest rate. Then, I would like to talk about the current situation of and outlook for Japan's economy, as well as the Bank's stance on monetary policy going forward. I. The Background to the Adoption of "QQE with Yield Curve Control" and Thinking behind It A. Turbulence in Global Financial Markets and the Introduction of a Negative Interest Rate Turbulence in Global Financial Markets Let me look back at developments in the global financial markets since summer 2015. Investors' risk sentiment started to worsen against the background of the slowdown in emerging economies, including China, and uncertainties regarding those economies. In particular, after the turn of 2016, the global financial markets rapidly became destabilized due to heightened concerns regarding emerging economies, which were triggered by the significant decline in the Shanghai stock prices (Chart 1). The decline in commodity prices, including crude oil prices, exacerbated the situation. Under such circumstances, pessimistic views about the outlook for the global economy prevailed, such as the "secular stagnation" hypothesis. Major economies faced the common policy challenges of how to address low growth, as well as low inflation under low interest rates, and this topic was hotly debated at international fora such as the Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting. Naturally, such headwinds for the global economy had a significant negative impact on Japan's economy as well. In financial markets, the yen appreciated and stock prices declined. On the inflation front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) 
2 excluding fresh food turned negative in 2016 for the first time in three years, due to the effects of the decline in crude oil prices since summer 2014. Inflation expectations -- which play a key role in achieving the price stability target of 2 percent -- weakened, reflecting the headwinds for the global economy that I mentioned earlier, after having remained more or less flat amid the significant decline in crude oil prices (Chart 2). The Introduction of a Negative Interest Rate and Its Effects It was against these backgrounds that the Bank introduced "QQE with a Negative Interest Rate" in January 2016 in order to address these strong headwinds and achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. To reduce real interest rates amid weakening inflation expectations, nominal interest rates needed to be lowered further. The negative interest rate aimed at an additional reduction in the levels of short- and long-term interest rates by pushing down the short end of the yield curve, in combination with purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). The introduction of a negative interest rate produced significant effects in terms of lowering nominal interest rates. Specifically, JGB yields declined considerably across the entire yield curve (Chart 3). As a consequence, lending rates as well as issuance rates for CP and corporate bonds also declined clearly. The lending attitude of financial institutions became more positive. There was no doubt that the negative interest rate made financial conditions more accommodative, supporting firms' and households' economic activities in Japan against the headwinds for the global economy. At the same time, however, it became necessary to take account of the impact of the negative interest rate on the functioning of financial intermediation in a broad sense as the yield curve had headed toward flattening by more than expected. Specifically, Banks' basic business model consists of raising short-term funds and investing in long-term assets, and there was little room for declines in interest rates on deposits, which are the main funding tools. This means that the flattening of the yield curve at a low level reduces the spread between deposit and lending rates, thereby squeezing banks' profits. If profits were squeezed for a long period of time, this would affect their financial soundness cumulatively and exert adverse effects on 
3 the functioning of financial intermediation. In addition, an excessive decline in the levels of interest rates such as those with long and super-long maturities lowers the rate of return on insurance and pension products and might have a negative impact on economic activity by leading to a deterioration in people's sentiment. B. Thinking behind "QQE with Yield Curve Control" Based on such recognition, the Bank conducted in September 2016 a comprehensive assessment of developments in economic activity and prices as well as policy effects since the introduction of QQE. In light of the findings of the assessment, it introduced "QQE with Yield Curve Control" as a means of enhancing and strengthening the previous policy frameworks. The new framework consists of two components (Chart 4). The first is an inflation-overshooting commitment. Specifically, this is a commitment that the Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. The key point is that the commitment is based on the observed CPI, and not the outlook. The price stability target needs to be achieved on average over the business cycle. Thus, it naturally is assumed that there would be phases when the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent. Considering that it takes some time for monetary policy to have an impact on economic activity and prices, it is exceptional for a central bank to make such a strong commitment that is based on the observed CPI. Since the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve in the United States and some other central banks introduced "forward guidance," in which a central bank provides information about the future course of monetary policy. It is common for a central bank to design the forward guidance based on its forecast. However, in Japan, where the observed CPI has been below 2 percent for a long period, in order to raise inflation expectations to around 2 percent and anchor them firmly at that level, it is essential that the public actually experiences inflation at or above 2 percent for some time and thereby the perception takes hold among them that prices of goods and services tend to go up every year by around 2 percent. With this in mind, the Bank committed itself to continue with large-scale monetary expansion until such situation is achieved through this unique inflation-overshooting commitment. 
4  The second component of the new policy framework is yield curve control. Under this framework, the Bank sets the levels of short- and long-term interest rates as the operating targets in the guideline for market operations, instead of the amount of increase in the monetary base and the amount of JGB purchases in the previous frameworks. It will facilitate the formation of a yield curve that is considered most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. In the current guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent.  Yield curve control is designed to enable the Bank to conduct monetary policy in a more flexible manner, depending on the situation, compared to the previous frameworks in which the amount of JGB purchases was fixed. For example, the impact of a unit amount of the Bank's JGB purchases on long-term yields varies depending on the economic and inflation conditions as well as the state of the JGB market. In the previous frameworks that set the amount of JGB purchases as the operating target, the yield curve could deviate either upward or downward from the one that the Bank deemed appropriate. In contrast, yield curve control -- by setting the specific target level of the 10-year JGB yields -- enables the Bank to conduct JGB purchases in a flexible and effective manner to achieve the target, making the policy framework more sustainable.  It often is argued that the Bank's JGB purchases are approaching the limit. My response to this argument is as follows. First of all, the Bank has been conducting JGB purchases smoothly so far, and I do not think it will face difficulties in the near future. Even if JGBs to be purchased by the Bank become scarce at some point in the future as the supply-demand conditions in the JGB market tighten, the impact of a unit amount of its JGB purchases on long-term yields accordingly should become more significant, with all else being equal. Put differently, the Bank can have the same degree of effect in lowering interest rates with a smaller amount of JGB purchases. In financial markets, some argue that the Bank will have difficulties with JGB purchases in the future and lose its control over long-term interest rates eventually. That will not happen. In fact, yield curve control is designed to be highly sustainable. 
5  II. Improvement in the Global Economy and Current Situation of and Outlook for Japan's Economy A. Current Business Conditions and Outlook Next, I would like to talk about developments in the global economy since the second half of last year, as well as the current situation of and outlook for Japan's economy and prices amid these global economic developments.  Up until around last autumn, financial markets were dominated by pessimistic views regarding the outlook for the global economy. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the global economy hit bottom in the first half of last year. Since the middle of last year, various economic indicators have improved, and a salient feature is that improvement in manufacturing activities and international trade has become clear in both advanced and emerging economies (Chart 5). The global economy since the outbreak of the global financial crisis has been characterized by what has been labeled "slow trade," a phenomenon of the trade volume having remained sluggish relative to the economic growth rate, but this trend now appears to be changing. In addition, following the presidential election in the United States, business sentiment -- especially among U.S. firms -- has greatly increased, reflecting expectations that the growth rate will accelerate on the basis of proactive economic policies by the new administration. As a result, the growth momentum of the global economy is steadily gathering pace (Chart 6).  Amid these favorable developments in the global economy, improvements have been observed in Japan's economy as well. One is that a pick-up in exports and production is becoming evident. Against the backdrop of strong global IT-related demand and progress in inventory and capital stock adjustments in emerging economies, the range of items in which exports are increasing has steadily widened and the growth in exports is gradually becoming more sustained. Production is picking up as well, reflecting moderate increases in domestic and overseas demand as well as progress in inventory adjustments. Under these circumstances, corporate profits are improving and business fixed investment is on a moderate increasing trend.  
6  Another is that private consumption is picking up. Despite steady improvements in the employment and income situation, such as the drop in the unemployment rate to about 3 percent and moderate wage growth, private consumption showed relatively weak developments in the first half of last year. This was likely due mainly to the impact on consumer sentiment of the negative wealth effects resulting from the decline in stock prices. In recent months, consumer sentiment has been improving steadily, partly due to the recovery in stock prices, and the Consumption Activity Index (CAI), which the Bank compiles by combining various sales and supply-side statistics, has picked up since last summer (Chart 7).  Japan's economy is more firmly making steps toward a recovery. Going forward, with the virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, the economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential.  B. The Current Situation of and Outlook for Prices Next, I would like to turn to inflation. As mentioned earlier, partly as a result of the decline in crude oil prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food had been in negative territory during 2016, and most recently it is 0.1 percent. However, looking at the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, while this was around minus 0.5 percent before the introduction of QQE, it turned positive in autumn 2013 and has remained so for more than three years since then. This is the first time this has occurred since Japan's economy fell into deflation in the late 1990s. Japan is no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in general prices (Chart 8).   That being said, even in terms of the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, the rate of increase in prices has been slowing since the beginning of last year, and stagnant in recent months. This is perhaps because firms have refrained from revising prices upward in response to the lackluster private consumption mentioned earlier, and because the yen's appreciation during last year affected the prices of consumer durable goods and other items.   As a result, recent price developments have been somewhat sluggish, but we believe that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent has been maintained and the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food is likely to increase toward 2 
7  percent. Let me mention three channels for higher inflation going forward. First, improvement in the output gap, as seen in the tightening of labor market conditions, will lead to an increase in the inflation rate mainly through wage increases. Second, energy prices will start to push up the CPI, while the downward pressure of the past yen appreciation will gradually abate. Third, these developments, with the Bank's strong commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, will lead to higher medium- to long-term inflation expectations among the public.  Let me elaborate on these factors. The tightening of labor market conditions is exerting upward pressure on wages. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the Bank aims at a moderate rise in the CPI inflation accompanied by a rise in corporate profits and wages. Recently, private consumption is picking up amid the steady improvement in the employment and income situation. If this situation continues, firms are expected to be more proactive in their price setting again.  Meanwhile, the contribution of energy prices to the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, which was more than minus 1 percentage point, has been shrinking gradually and is currently more or less neutral. Going forward, assuming that crude oil prices will remain roughly flat, as indicated by prices in futures markets, the contribution will turn slightly positive in fiscal 2017. It should be noted, however, that this will be temporary and fall off again in fiscal 2018. The Bank does not intend to achieve the 2 percent target by simply depending on rising energy prices. In order to achieve the 2 percent price stability target in a sustainable manner, it is necessary for actual increases in prices to lead to higher medium- to long-term inflation expectations through the adaptive formation mechanism, resulting in an increase in the underlying trend of the inflation rate.   III. The Bank's Stance on Monetary Policy Going Forward Lastly, I would like to explain the Bank's stance on monetary policy going forward.  As I explained earlier, yield curve control can facilitate the formation of the yield curve that is deemed most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as 
8  financial conditions. The Bank will continue to conduct monetary policy based on this principle.  Let me elaborate on this point. In assessing developments in economic activity and prices, the Bank takes into account both its outlook for those developments and risk factors as presented in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). Regarding financial conditions, it takes into consideration the effects of the prevailing interest rate environment on the functioning of financial intermediation.  Based on this framework, the current situation can be explained as follows. With regard to economic and price developments, there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, although an improvement has been observed. As described in the January 2017 Outlook Report, the momentum toward achieving the 2 percent target is maintained but not yet sufficiently firm. As for risk factors, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, and developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations warrant particular attention. According to the Policy Board members' forecasts for prices presented in the Outlook Report, which are higher than those of private-sector economists, the timing of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI reaching 2 percent will likely be around fiscal 2018. Taking all of these elements into account, there is no reason to reduce the level of monetary accommodation at the moment in terms of economic and price developments. In this regard, let me add that the Bank's monetary policy should be designed to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, responding to the situation in Japan's economy. The Bank will not raise the target level of the long-term interest rates just because of a rise in such rates in other countries.  Next, let me make an assessment of the current situation in terms of financial conditions, or the effects on the functioning of financial intermediation. There is no need for now to raise interest rates, either in terms of the short-term policy interest rate or the target level of the long-term interest rates. The investment environment for insurance and pension products has become more favorable as super-long-term interest rates have increased compared to those in September 2016 (Chart 9). Banks have maintained their positive lending attitude, although yields in the short- to medium-term zone -- which affect banks' profits to a large extent -- have 
9  remained negative and the spread between deposit and lending rates has been on a declining trend (Chart 10). The amount outstanding of bank lending has been increasing at an annual rate of around 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent. These developments show that the functioning of financial intermediation for supporting economic activity has not been impaired. Nevertheless, the effects of low interest rates on the functioning of financial intermediation would be cumulative with the passage of time. The Bank will continue to examine such effects while keeping in close communication with financial institutions.  Let me summarize our assessment. From any of three aspects -- the economy, prices, and financial conditions -- it is obvious that the Bank should maintain the current yield curve and thereby make the most of the improvement in the global economy, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time.  I would like to add one thing on this point. The guideline for market operations is decided at each Monetary Policy Meeting in line with the thinking that I have just explained. The conduct of market operations including JGB purchases is determined practically to implement the guideline in a smooth manner. As a result, such factors as the amount of JGB purchases at each individual auction may vary depending on financial market conditions. However, this has no implications for monetary policy going forward.  Conclusion Since the introduction of QQE in April 2013, the Bank has reviewed the framework of monetary easing several times, in response to changes in the environment. However, there has been absolutely no change in its commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. I believe that "QQE with Yield Curve Control," consisting of an "inflation-overshooting commitment" and "yield curve control," is the best possible framework that we can devise at present, given the situation in Japan -- the formation mechanism of inflation expectations, transmission channels of monetary easing, and the conditions in the financial system. Under this framework, the Bank will realize the maximum effects of monetary easing.  Thank you very much for your attention.

Guy Debelle: Regulatory overview: The FX Global Code - definingthe next steps towards a standard industry Code of ConductOpening remarks by Mr Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at theTradeTech FX Asia Conference (appearance via video link), Singapore, 22 March 2017.*   *   *Today I am going to talk about the FX Global Code. The Code is on track to be released in twomonths’ time at the end of May. This is a culmination of two years’ effort, involving considerableinput from a sizeable number of foreign exchange market participants, both public and private.Today I will reiterate the motivation for the work we have been doing on the Code, why you allshould be interested in it, and then update you on where we are at with the process and outlinethe way forward.As I hope most of you know, Phase 1 of the Code was launched in May last year in NewYork. The Code is pretty easy to find. It is available via the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) website or on the website of a number of foreign exchange committees (FXCs), includingboth the Australian Foreign Exchange Committee (AFXC) website and the Singaporean FXC.The text of the complete Code will be available in the same places from 25 May, following itspublic release.Why is the work going on? As I have stated before, the foreign exchange (FX) industry has beensuffering from a lack of trust in its functioning. This lack of trust is evident both betweenparticipants in the market and, at least as importantly, between the public and the market. Themarket needs to move toward a more favourable and desirable location, and allow participants tohave much greater confidence that the market is functioning appropriately.A well-functioning foreign exchange market is very much in the interest of all market participants.This clearly includes central banks, both in their own role as market participants but also as theexchange rate is an important channel of monetary policy transmission. In a globalised world, theforeign exchange market is one of the most vital parts of the financial plumbing.The Code sets out global principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market to provide acommon set of guidance to the market, including in areas where there is a degree of uncertaintyabout what sort of practices are acceptable, and what are not. This should help to restoreconfidence and promote the effective functioning of the wholesale FX market.To that end, one of the guiding principles underpinning our work is that the Code should promotea robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent market. A diverse set of buyers and sellers, supportedby resilient infrastructure, should be able to confidently and effectively transact at competitiveprices that reflect available market information and in a manner that conforms to acceptablestandards of behaviour.The work to develop the Code commenced two years ago, in May 2015, when the BIS Governorscommissioned a working group of the Markets Committee of the BIS (which I chaired until earlyJanuary this year) to facilitate the establishment of a single global code of conduct for thewholesale FX market and to come up with mechanisms to promote greater adherence to theCode.Our group comprises representatives of the central banks of all the major FX centres. Cindy Mokfrom the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has made a major contribution to the process,and is very much the person you should speak to in the Singapore market about the Code. Thecentral banks of China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, as well as my country, Australia, are theother Asian central banks on the group.12 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
This work is also very much a public sector–private sector partnership. We have been ably andvigorously supported in this work by a group of market participants, chaired by David Puth, CEOof CLS. David’s group contains people from all around the world on the buy side, includingcorporates and asset managers, and the sell side, along with trading platforms, ECNs and non-bank participants, drawing from the various Foreign Exchange Committees and beyond. All partsof the market have been involved in the drafting of the Code to make sure all perspectives areheard and appropriately reflected.There are two important points worth highlighting: first, it’s a single code for the whole industryand second, it’s a global code.On the first point, the Code is supplanting the existing codes that have been present in the FXmarket, including the Blue Book that is used in Singapore, and the ACI model code that is used inAustralia.Importantly, the Code covers all of the wholesale FX industry. This is not a code for just the sellside. It is there for the sell side, the buy side, non-bank participants and the platforms; its breadthis both across the globe and across the whole structure of the industry.Hence the Code is relevant for all of you here at this conference. The way it is relevant willdepend on your engagement with the market. The guidelines for appropriate conduct are relevantfor the buy side as well as the sell side. On the buy side it will also help to give you guidance asto what you can reasonably expect from your counterparty as you transact your FX business.What this means in practice is that the steps different market participants take to align theiractivities with the principles of the Code will necessarily reflect the size, complexity, type andextent of their engagement with the FX market.As I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Code was released in May 2016. It covers areassuch as ethics, information sharing, aspects of execution and confirmation and settlement. Thesecond phase covers further aspects of execution including e-trading and platforms, primebrokerage, as well as governance, and risk management and compliance.We have provided market participants with a number of opportunities to comment on the Code,in addition to receiving the direct input of the Market Participants Group led by David Puth. Overthe past few months, drafts of the full text of the Code have been distributed to marketparticipants for their review, principally through the various FXCs, but also through other industryassociations to ensure all perspectives are appropriately reflected in the Code. Through thisprocess, quite a few thousand comments were received.In my view, the text of the Code provides the best and most appropriate guidance we could give,given the sometimes wide range of feedback received, particularly on those small number ofissues which are most controversial in the market. The most obvious example of this is ‘lastlook’. This issue has generated considerable passionate discussion. I would expect thatdiscussion to continue after the release of the Code in May and that the Code might evolve as afunction of that discussion. I would like to make the point that if market participants think it wouldbe preferable for the Code to have gone further, they are welcome to go down that path in theiroperations. On the other hand, it would not be desirable for the converse to occur, namely formarket participants’ practices to fall short of the principles described in the Code. That said, Ithink it is good outcome of the process that we were able to distil the points of contention down toa small number of (not insignificant) issues. Outside of a small number of contentious areas, thefeedback was reflective of a widely held consensus. Market participants have recognised theCode’s aim of helping move the FX market to a better place.I will illustrate that with a couple of the areas that were addressed in the first phase of the Code,which is already in the public domain. In the first phase, topics were covered that the market waslooking for guidance on sooner rather than later and that were potentially having an adverse effect 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
on market functioning.One example of this is around information sharing, where many market participants havehighlighted that they are unsure what information can be conveyed to counterparties and othermarket participants. While it is clear (or at least should be) that disclosing the details of a client’sorder book to a counterparty is not acceptable, market participants have noted that there is muchless clarity around what level of aggregation, say, is necessary in order to convey market colourappropriately.As a result, it appears some market participants are being very conservative in sharinginformation, which can have implications for the effective functioning of the market. This isnotwithstanding the guidance provided in this area in the Global Preamble put out by the globalForeign Exchange Committee, in March 2015. The Global Code takes the material in the GlobalPreamble and fleshes it out a bit more, including with some examples of what is, and isn’t,appropriate communication, and why.Similarly, there have been diverse opinions around what is appropriate behaviour in terms oforder handling. There have been some very public instances of inappropriate behaviour aroundorder handling that have come to light in recent years. The market is seeking greater guidance asto what principles should be followed, including the different standards that may apply dependingon whether an intermediary is functioning as principal or agent.This is one area that was not adequately covered in the pre-existing codes that the various FXCshad endorsed for the FX market. It is an area where we are aiming to provide the sought-afterguidance. But we are not writing a procedures manual for order handling. Rather we arearticulating principles that need to be taken into account. Individual firms may then take theseprinciples and reflect them in their own procedures manual. Our aim in articulating theseprinciples is to provide market participants with the framework in which to think about how theyhandle stop-loss orders. The emphasis here is very much on the word ‘think’. The Global Codewill not provide the answers to all your questions, but it should help you ask the right questions.Adherence to the CodeAlongside drafting the Code, we have also been devoting considerable time and effort to thinkingabout how to ensure widespread adoption of the Code by market participants. Clearly, that hasbeen an issue with the various existing codes that have been in place in a number of marketsover many years. It is evident that they were ignored on occasion, wilfully or otherwise.One of our central aims in drafting the Code is for it to be principles-based rather than rules-based. There are a number of reasons why this is so but, for me, an important reason is that themore prescriptive the Code is, the easier it is to get around. Rules are easier to arbitrage thanprinciples. If it’s not expressly prohibited or explicitly discouraged, then it must be okay seems tobe the historical experience. Moreover, the more prescriptive and the more precise the Code, theless people will think about what they are doing. If it’s principles-based and less prescriptive then,as I just said, market participants will have to think about whether their actions are consistentwith the principles of the Code.So, we are working with the industry to produce a principles-based code rather than a set ofprescriptive regulatory standards. It will not impose legal or regulatory obligations on marketparticipants, nor will it supplant existing regulatory standards or expectations. But we do expectthe principles in the Code to be understood and adopted across the entire FX market.Our approach to adherence has a number of dimensions. We laid out our overall approach toadherence to the Code in New York in May last year. We will provide a more comprehensivedescription of the suite of mechanisms to support adherence to the Code alongside the releaseof the Code in May.34 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
One critical dimension is market-based adherence mechanisms. An important element ofdiscipline should come from the market itself and we are working closely with market participantson this. The adherence to a voluntary code will only come about if firms judge it to be in theirinterest and take the practical steps to ensure the code is embedded in their practices.Firms will need to take practical steps such as training their staff and putting in appropriatepolicies and procedures. We have provided a draft Statement of Commitment for firms topublicly demonstrate their adherence to the Code. One reason for a public demonstration is thatfirms are more likely to adhere to the Code if they believe that their peers are doing so too.Without blaming them for what occurred, more scrutiny from counterparties about how their FXtransactions were being executed may have helped to reduce the incidence and severity of themarket abuses that occurred in the past. FX transactions were sometimes regarded as ancillaryto the core business, notwithstanding their potential impact on returns.Ultimately the success of the Code in promoting integrity and restoring confidence in thewholesale FX market lies in the hands of its participants. That is why the Global FXCs issued ajoint statement of support at the launch of the Code in New York as well as stating their intentionto make adherence to the Code a likely requirement of FXC membership. That would ensurethe Code is embedded at the core of the FX market, but it is also important that it extends beyondthat, and that there is, at the very least, an awareness of it across all market participants.A second dimension of adherence is that the BIS central banks have signalled their commitmentby announcing that they themselves will follow the Code, and that they expect that theircounterparties will do so too. To that end, the RBA will no longer transact in the FX market withthose that don’t commit to adhere to the Code after its release in May.A third dimension of adherence is that we are talking to regulators in our various jurisdictions asto how they might use the Code in monitoring market conduct. In Australia, the securitiesregulator, ASIC is very supportive of the development of the Code and is considering how it mightutilise the Code in its market surveillance. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK isconsidering how they might incorporate the Code in the Senior Managers Regime there.Given that we are only providing the full text of the Code to the market in May, there will be aperiod of time for market participants to adjust their practices where necessary (which shouldhopefully not be much) to be in line with the principles in the Code. This period of time mightpotentially be as short as six months, but no more than twelve months for the vast majority ofmarket participants. How much effort this might require will in part depend on the nature andextent of your engagement with the FX market. In drafting the Code, we have always kept theprinciple of proportionality at front of mind.ConclusionWe are on track to complete the Code so that it will be released in London in May. At the end ofthat process, for the Code to be effective and for it to achieve what we want it to achieve, it willneed to be accepted and endorsed across the full spectrum of market participants. I ask you allas participants in the foreign exchange market to familiarise yourself with the principles of theCode and verify that your operations in the market align with them.That said, the process does not really end, because as the foreign exchange market continues toevolve, the Code will need to evolve with it.The work to date has reflected a very constructive and cooperative effort between the centralbanks and market participants. I would particularly like to acknowledge the enormous time andenergy contributed by David Puth and the Market Participants Group as well as the team of myfellow central bankers. All of us recognise the need to restore the public’s faith in the foreign56 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
exchange market and the value of the Global Code in assisting that process and also in helpingimprove market functioning and confidence in the market.Let me finish with three things to take away with you:Read the FX Global Code when it is released on May 25th.Adapt your business where appropriate to conform with the principles of the Global Code.Ask your FX counterparties whether they are committed to the principles of the Global Code.See <www.bis.org/mktc/fxwg/gc_may16.pdf>.See <www.bis.org/press/p150511.htm>.See <www.rba.gov.au/afxc/about-us/pdf/global-preamble.pdf>.See <www.bis.org/mktc/fxwg/am_may16.pdf>.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   Good morning.   The UK has a world-leading insurance sector which provides a wide range of vital services to the real economy and society.  It promotes growth and employment, has proved its mettle in turbulent times and the country can be proud of it.   A necessary precondition to such success is world-class insurance supervision.  That is what we aim to deliver at the PRA. Like insurers, our job is to be forward-looking and prudent about risk. Where we differ from private firms is that we do this motivated solely by the public interest.    The recent debate about insurance regulation – while timely and important – must seem to some like a cacophony of acronyms, statistics, models and assumptions. But strip this back and you’ll see there is an essential, irreducible human core to it all.  Some of the oldest and most vulnerable in our society have invested their life savings into long-term annuity contracts.  By pooling and transferring many kinds of  risks – from cyber to marine – insurers provide cover which is essential for economic activity.  And by protecting for critical illness or personal accident, insurers commit to being there when you need them most.   So when we talk about promoting insurers’ safety and soundness, and protecting their policyholders, this is what we have in mind.   The PRA has squeezed much into its short life since it began supervising insurance companies in 2013, not least the enormous undertaking of implementing Solvency II, and knitting insurance supervision into the wider Bank, where there are obvious connections with areas like monetary analysis.   And today, the Bank of England’s Independent Evaluation Office has published its thinking on the PRA objective which is unique to insurance, of contributing to the protection of policyholders.  All this makes now the ideal time to refresh our approach to insurance supervision.  I will begin by taking stock of insurance regulation. These are the rules and standards which apply across the board, and have been recently the subject of ongoing and lively debate.  Now that Solvency II has applied, how do we take it forward?    From there I would like to explore our approach to insurance supervision – the day-to-day business of understanding, assessing and challenging the 4691 firms we are responsible for. In particular, how do we at the PRA think about policyholder protection?                                                          1 This is a consolidated view of insurance groups – there are approximately 600 insurance entities, including solos that are part of groups.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   And what is the point of all this? Our aim is to maintain a resilient insurance sector which does not pass risks back to policyholders when they crystallise.    Solvency II: a stocktake  For the uninitiated, Solvency II is a new regulatory regime for insurance companies across the EU, introduced on 1 January 2016 after years of wrangling.  There is now a lively debate about how the new regime is working out here in the UK. It seems that almost every day the specialist press contains new opinion pieces from industry insiders or consultants about how Solvency II is constraining their business or turning out not to be as bad as feared. There is also the important review by the Treasury Select Committee, at which I gave evidence recently. And very occasionally others outside the magic circle of insurance enthusiasts (of which I count myself one) take a passing interest. Inevitably, on a subject as complex as Solvency II, there will be a wide range of opinions. And I think that a degree of constructive tension between regulator and regulated firms is a sign of a healthy and properly functioning relationship. But in any debate it pays to consider both sides.  So what does the insurance industry think about Solvency II? Unsurprisingly, there is a range of views. Lord Turnbull, former board member at Prudential, was unequivocal in his comment that Solvency II was “an absolutely dreadful piece of legislation”. Others,  particularly those working in general insurance, are more sanguine - for instance John Parry of Lloyd’s of London told the TSC that “in terms of Solvency II…damaging competitiveness or returns on capital, no, we have not seen that”.    Written submissions from the industry to the TSC generally reveal two themes. First, having just consumed this sizeable piece of new regulation, the industry has no desire whatsoever to sit back down at the regulatory table and consume another, radically different, meal. By my reckoning, only one submission to the TSC calls for a fundamental change of regime. And second, that while the PRA has done a reasonable job in steering everyone across the implementation line, it has in the view of some parts of the industry been  over-zealous in places. I’ll comment on each of these themes in turn.  Solvency II indigestion  I very much agree that having another big meal at this stage would be most unwise. However, I acknowledge that the size and variety of the Solvency II meal has left all of us facing some degree of indigestion. When faced with live market conditions and commercial realities, some aspects of the regime have been found wanting.  So I agree with most industry commentators that it is in nobody’s best interests – not firms, policyholders or regulators – to make wholesale changes. But that does not mean that we cannot make a series of tweaks and improvements to the overall system, by way of a digestif.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   For example, there has been considerable criticism of the Risk Margin - a new feature of Solvency II which aims to allow for uncertainty in liability valuations - and I agree that its current design and implementation does not achieve the intended goals.  The concept of a risk margin is a sensible one, but its current implementation in Solvency II is flawed. Because the root causes of the problems are baked into European legislation, we need to fix them at source, and are actively and constructively engaged with our European colleagues to design a more sensible solution.   Some firms would like us to ‘break glass’ and implement a unilateral quick fix here in the UK. But I think that would be a mistake at this stage, not least because in the short-term there is a mechanism available to firms to mitigate the impact on business written before the introduction of Solvency II, namely the Transitional Measure on Technical Provisions, or TMTPs. We have allowed all firms that applied and qualified to use this measure. And data reported to us by firms indicates that the TMTP benefit across the life industry at the inception of Solvency II almost entirely offset the aggregate Risk Margin. I will also reiterate a point I’ve made previously, which is that when we consider whether or not firms are in a position to pay dividends, one of the main quantitative yardsticks we use is capital levels after the benefit of transitionals2. In other words, we regard transitionals as creating high quality capital.  Given the substantial benefit arising from TMTPs, it is important for both firms and the PRA that their level remains appropriate over time. And there is a mechanism to ensure just that, whereby firms may apply for a recalculation following a material change in their risk profile, or every two years. Our goal is that the maintenance of TMTPs should be as straightforward as possible and not onerous for any of those involved. The PRA recently closed a consultation3 on proposals for this process and we expect to issue a supervisory statement on the subject later in 2017.   Another industry complaint is about the quantity of data firms must report, and the compressed timetables for doing so.  It is a plain fact both that the volume of reported data is higher than under the previous regime and that regulatory returns are due to the PRA more quickly. I view both of these things as a significant improvement, which will enable better delivery of the PRA’s objectives of policyholder protection and firm safety and soundness. To be frank, the situation we sometimes faced as regulators in the past, where firms were unable quickly to tell us their asset exposures, and solvency reviews sometimes occurred 18 months in arrears, was unacceptable, particularly given the fast pace at which serious economic and financial crises can develop in the modern interconnected world. However, I keep an open mind about whether we have struck the right balance – there may be a case for lowering the burden, if it turns out that some of the new reporting doesn’t deliver supervisory benefits commensurate with its cost. We are also investigating the potential for publication of selected statistics to provide an overview for market participants.                                                        2 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/861.aspx  3 CP47/16, issued December 2016, consultation closed 15 March 2017, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/cp/2016/cp4716.aspx  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   On 16 November 2016, the Bank published its first edition of a new quarterly Statistical Release for the UK banking sector4. We are considering the potential for issuing something similar for the UK insurance sector, derived from the data insurers submit to us. We plan to engage with industry soon to discuss what format and content would be of most use and interest, with a first release potentially in the autumn.  A third topic of rumbling discontent relates to how easy insurers find it to invest in illiquid assets, and then to receive appropriate regulatory recognition. In my view, there are two quite separate issues at play here. The first is a certain ‘clunkiness’ in the design of the Solvency II Matching Adjustment (MA), a feature of the regime which gives insurers a capital benefit if they can match asset cashflows with liability cashflows. The rules were written on the assumption that insurers generally match annuities with simple securities, such as liquid corporate or sovereign bonds. This assumption was broadly true when the rules were agreed several years ago, but more recently insurers have increasingly turned their attention to other classes of investments that, generally speaking, have appropriate characteristics for meeting long-term insurance liabilities. But those types of investments often fail to meet certain rather prescriptive rules.  Some in the industry argue that we have the flexibility to ignore some elements of the rules. I don’t think that is right. The directive is quite clear that cashflows from MA-eligible assets must be “fixed”, not “predictable” or some other more flexible term. Now, it is not our job to unpick the law. But we should apply it sensibly. And I think there is plenty of evidence that that is what we are doing, whether in our approach to certain assets (for instance in allowing pairing of variable cashflow assets with derivatives, and restructuring of assets like equity release mortgages) or in the fact that we have allowed infrastructure assets in sectors like healthcare, social housing and telecoms infrastructure to achieve MA-eligibility. Now, given a completely free hand I would probably make modest design changes to the MA, perhaps with slightly greater flexibility around the definition of “fixity” and a greater allowance for unexpected credit defaults. But I contend that we are implementing the regime we have today intelligently, with appropriate recognition of asset and liability matching leading to a £59bn reduction in capital requirements for the industry. But the MA design itself is not the only reason that we at the PRA sometimes pause when firms discuss new investment opportunities with us. By their very nature, illiquid bespoke loans require very specific skills in terms of structuring, valuation and ongoing risk management. In particular, experience has taught us that the risk firms face from making such loans is related to how skilfully firms can manage any impairment process. These are not traditional areas of expertise for most UK insurers and, in my view, firms must clear a high bar in order to demonstrate that they have adequate systems and controls in place to manage these types of risks and exposures. We recently consulted on this topic5 and look forward to further engagement with industry. As a final word on this subject, when we have asked insurers directly about the impediments to investing in infrastructure assets, the number one problem raised is the lack of suitable investment opportunities, and not the regulatory framework. Perhaps they are just being polite but it seems to me that, when faced with the                                                       4 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/regulatorydata/capital/2016/sep/bsrcrelease1609.pdf  5 CP48/16, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/publications/cp/2016/cp4816.aspx

An over-zealous approach from the PRA? I now turn to the other general theme from TSC submissions – whether or not we at the PRA have implemented Solvency II over-zealously. Or put another way, have we ‘gold–plated’ the directive? You will be unsurprised to hear that I say not. As I said earlier, it is only natural that there will be tension between the regulator and firms, because our objectives may be consistent but they are different. But rather than ask you to take my word on trust, let me provide some practical examples and attempt to explain how and why we have acted in the ways we have.  First, consider the challenge that the Association of British Insurers (ABI) made in its written evidence to the TSC6, that the Senior Insurance Managers Regime (SIMR) that we have introduced “extensively ‘gold plates’ pillar 3 requirements of Solvency II”. The SIMR is designed to ensure the individual accountability of senior managers and directors of insurers for their own conduct, for overseeing the business conduct of key individuals reporting to them, and for the ongoing safety and soundness of their firms and the protection of their policyholders. As such, it is a key tool that the PRA uses to deliver its objectives. The SIMR is consistent with the provisions of the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016. So whilst the ABI is correct in its assertion that SIMR is not required by the Solvency II directive, it is the consequence of UK legislative choices and not simply an invention of the PRA.  Second, there is the thorny topic of approvals under Solvency II and, in particular, internal model approvals. The industry is quite right to point out that the overhead to gaining model approval is considerable. In some cases, weight rather than page length would have been a more appropriate measure of application size. But remember that firms with approved internal models in effect set their own regulatory capital requirements. Once we grant model approval, the PRA has only a very limited ability to adjust a firm’s Solvency Capital Requirement. And as my colleague David Rule previously commented7 “even acting in good faith, business pressure may create the risk that model changes generating lower capital requirements are favoured over time, and therefore that solvency standards might deteriorate”. In designing our approach, we were also mindful of the FSA’s experience in approving internal models for banks under Basel II, where promised future improvements tended not to materialise. It should therefore come as a surprise to no-one that we approach model approval diligently, sceptically and rigorously.  Third, and relating to model approvals, is the issue of the PRA’s own internal views on model calibration. We have previously commented on our use of quantitative indicators8, or QIs, but I think it is worth repeating that they are indicators and not pass/ fail standards. In particular, the standard for model approval is that firms must meet the tests and standards laid out under the Solvency II directive, and that is the basis for our                                                       6 http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/eu-insurance-regulation/written/47301.pdf  7 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/921.aspx  8 SS17/16, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/publications/ss/2016/ss1716.pdf.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   assessments. We do not operate QIs as a minimum standard, but rather as an indication of the sort of calibration level we would expect to see for standard portfolios. Models falling outside of our QI ranges (both above and below) attract increased scrutiny.  Take as an example our QIs for corporate bonds. We feel that it is hard to argue that a model calibrated below the levels of credit spread increase we saw as recently as 2008-2009 meets the one-in-200-year standard required by the Directive. And so we set our QIs accordingly. But modelling credit risk is a complex business, subject to nuance and considerable expert judgement. Indeed, reasonable, knowledgeable experts might perfectly well disagree on some of the key assumptions. For those reasons, we have actually approved internal models with credit components that do not meet our QIs, where the firms in question demonstrated that their exposure is atypical and hence warrants a non-standard calibration, or provided  off-setting conservatism in other aspects of the model.  PRA’s approach to insurance supervision I’d like to turn now to some broader thoughts about what it means for the PRA to supervise insurance companies. I’ve previously spoken9 about the history of insurance regulation in the UK and won’t re-hash that here, since I’ve not yet reached the age where it is acceptable simply to repeat myself. Happily, according to our longevity QI I should have plenty of time for that further down the track. But I would like to provide some insights into why and how the PRA operates in the way it does.  The UK insurance industry is the fourth largest in the world. It employs 300,000 people in the UK, provides cover for nearly 27 million households10, and has £2.4 trillion11 of assets.  It is therefore unsurprising that Parliament has given the PRA a General Objective of delivering safety and soundness of insurers, as well as banks. But for insurers only, Parliament has also given us an additional Insurance Objective – of equal weight to our General Objective – which is to contribute to securing an appropriate degree of policyholder protection. Now that sounds like rather a mouthful, but fortunately the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) has today published a thorough evaluation of the PRA’s approach to its Insurance Objective.  The Bank set up the IEO in 2014 to help Court evaluate the Bank’s performance. Early last year, Court asked the IEO to consider whether we are doing enough of the right sorts of things to deliver the Insurance Objective. The IEO’s report includes a number of interesting findings, which I welcome and find consistent with my own observations from my time as Executive Director of Insurance Supervision.  In particular, the IEO found that there is a lot of activity going on in pursuit of policyholder protection. This comes as no surprise to me. The PRA’s insurance supervisors, actuaries and other professionals have in my                                                       9 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech877.pdf  10 Source: ABI factsheet https://www.abi.org.uk/~/media/Files/Documents/Publications/Public/2016/KeyFacts/ABI-UKInsuranceAndLongTermSavings-KeyFacts.pdf  11 As at 2016Q2, based on insurers’ reporting to the PRA 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   experience a strong public-service ethos. They are strongly motivated to protect insurance policyholders, which is for some a more human motivation than safety and soundness.  However, the IEO found that we could do more to explain what we mean by “policyholder protection”. Some of this is straightforward, such as ensuring staff have clear legal analysis and understand where and when the PRA should and should not act, and we confirm in our response to the IEO’s report that we will improve that analysis and training where required. But the IEO also raises some deeper questions about how much protection the PRA should seek to deliver, for which sorts of policyholders, and with what confidence. And it is those deeper questions that I intend to consider briefly in the remainder of my comments today.  Insurers are subject to what is known as “twin peaks” regulation in the UK. In addition to supervision from us in the PRA, the Financial Conduct Authority also supervises insurers. And the IEO report makes it clear that, in the context of securing policyholder protection, the FCA has the primary role. The key word of the PRA’s objective is “contribute”. We should only act when there are prudential concerns, whereas the FCA acts on wider matters of fairness. To give an example: the PRA might intervene to prevent an insurer from selling new policies if it had inadequate financial resources, but it would be for the FCA to consider whether those policies contained unfair terms and conditions. In most circumstances the split of responsibilities is clear, but we need to be sure we are sufficiently explicit about the limits of the PRA’s role in respect of areas such as with-profits business, corporate restructurings and firms that close to new business and go into run-off.  Another important consideration for us is whether the PRA should seek to protect all policyholders equally. The insurers we supervise received £260bn of gross written premium in 2016.  Some might say that the PRA acts as though “all policyholders are equal, but some are more equal than others”. But in my view there is no need to obfuscate in this manner and we should be quite clear that while the regulatory standard set in Solvency II is uniform, we do not in supervision attempt to cover all policyholders equally. It is in my view entirely appropriate that we should direct more of our resources towards policyholders who will suffer greater financial hardship if their policies do not pay out as promised, or those for whom there is the greatest asymmetry of information between company and customer, or who face  the highest possibility of being unable to replace cover if it is lost.  For example, five million households have life insurance and two million have personal pensions.  Some of the oldest and most vulnerable people in our society are reliant upon income provided by insurers under very long-term annuity contracts, into which they have invested their life savings. While the FSCS plays a vital role, the financial harm caused by the failure of an insurer in this space would be considerable and it is quite right that the PRA devotes significant resources to supervision of this sector, and that we have a very low appetite for any firm being unable to honour its promises.  In contrast, there is a range of other insurance contracts for which the consequences of firm failure are less severe, and hence with limited resource to spread around the PRA’s supervisory approach can be somewhat less intense. For example, there are various classes of property insurance, such as mobile phone, for which an argument could be made that the PRA should restrict itself to a lower level of supervision. Our resourcing 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   model already works to some extent in this way, but the IEO has challenged us to think more deeply about this question. Another interesting area is insurance bought by commercial or corporate customers. In these cases, the information asymmetry between buyer and seller is lower, or sometimes reversed, and contracts are typically renewable annually, meaning that there are lower concerns about customers being locked into long-term policies. In circumstances where buyers often choose their cover provider based on third-party measures of financial strength (such as opinions from rating agencies or insurance brokers), there is a case to be made that the need for the regulator is reduced. Indeed, many in the London Market have made this very point (somewhat less subtly!). But before anyone excitedly hears this as confirmation that the PRA will no longer regulate certain types of insurer, remember that we have a statutory objective to contribute to protecting policyholders of all stripes. So the debate is about ‘how’, not ‘whether’.  In fact, the PRA’s resourcing model already works to focus our resources on those areas of most concern. We categorise each regulated firm according to its size and the potential harm customers would suffer should it fail. The majority of firms we regulate are assigned the lowest category, reflecting the low level of risk they pose to our objectives. Firms in higher categories receive more supervisory and specialist resources, and decisions for those firms are approved at more senior levels within the PRA’s decision –making framework. The IEO have challenged us to look at this system again and we will do so. Our Executive Director for Insurance Supervision, David Rule, will take forward discussion of all of these issues with the Prudential Regulation Committee. We will then revise our Approach to Insurance Supervision document to explain any changes we decide to make.  In doing this we will of course need fully to factor in our third objective, to facilitate effective competition – which was also recently reviewed by the IEO12. Although this is a secondary objective, it is given a high priority in the PRA and is also quite rightly a topic in which the Treasury Select Committee takes a strong interest. Our competition work spans banking and insurance, but there has been much more public debate about the former. We have, however, been pursuing our objective assiduously on the insurance side – to pick out some examples of steps we have taken to facilitate competition:  we have created a very proportionate regime for the 40% of firms we regulate who are not covered by Solvency II;   we have given around 85% of Solvency II firms in the UK the opportunity to avoid around 70% of the quarterly reporting burden they would otherwise face;   we are working with HMT, HMRC and the London Market to introduce a new structure for  insurance-linked securities; and                                                        12 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Documents/ieo/evaluation0316.pdf

Conclusion  Financial regulation and supervision can sometimes be a dry business. And in insurance in particular, some of the more arcane aspects of the regulatory framework can rapidly turn off everyone except us and the industry. I have therefore spent some time looking into individual policyholder cases, to remind myself about what is going on at the frontline. One in particular made a powerful impression on me. A young man got in touch with an insurance company to claim on his critical illness cover. The reason for the claim was that his 4-year old son had brain cancer. The cancer was in a difficult place, and the best-case outcome from a forthcoming operation was grim. The worst-case was the grimmest of all. The father was calling to claim on the policy in order to help cover the ancillary costs to the family while the NHS took forward this procedure. The company did the right thing, and it had enough money to do the right thing. I and others were only exposed to this case in a wholly anonymised way, for data protection reasons. Despite this I have never been in a meeting where so many people wept.  This is what policyholder protection is really about. It’s not about the Risk Margin, the view to ultimate, the Matching Adjustment or corporate bond spreads. It’s about making sure that insurance companies are there to help when disaster strikes. That’s why we take this part of our job so seriously.     
SPEECH BY:  Loi M Bakani CMG, Governor, Bank of PNG At the UNCDF 50th Anniversary 19 January 2017 Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to address you all at this momentous occasion marking UNCDF’s 50th Anniversary. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has had a close relationship with UNCDF through the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP) since its inception in 2008.  I would like to share with you some of PFIP’s highlights over the past 9 years. On a regional level, PFIP has been instrumental in supporting the role of the Central Banks in driving the Financial Inclusion agenda, and actively contributes to the Pacific Islands Regional Initiative, a knowledge-sharing platform for the Central Banks in the Pacific region.  By the end of September 2016, PFIP had reached an impressive cumulative total of over 1.1 million clients across the Pacific, already surpassing the programme’s 2019 goal of 1 million clients. These clients are now connected with financial service providers through a 
variety of financial services including bank accounts, mobile money, micro insurance, microfinance and more. Closer to home for us, in Papua New Guinea alone, PFIP partnerships have led to over 400,000 clients receiving some form of financial service.  In Papua New Guinea, PFIP has been supporting the Bank of PNG and the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion through support for development and implementation of the country’s National Financial Inclusion Strategic Plans, the second of which (spanning from 2016-2020), you may be aware, was launched recently in December 2016. This new plan has the ambitious target of reaching 2 million more unbanked low-income Papua New Guineans, 50% of whom are women, by 2020.  BIMA is one example showing the tremendous need and potential for financial service in Papua New Guinea. A recent entrant into the insurance market, BIMA provides convenient, affordable life and hospitalization insurance cover via a mobile platform to nearly 400,000 often low-income, financially underserved Papua New Guineans, the majority are receiving the economic safety net of insurance cover for the first time. PFIP’s investment grant helped BIMA expand outreach in the Highlands region, reducing delivery costs and improving customer service through and expanded agent network.  PFIP is currently working with the with Department of Education, Provincial Government and Bank of PNG to develop a pilot for Financial Education integration into technical and vocational college curriculums.  PFIP is testing a new model with Kamaliki Technical Vocational College and Goroka Technical College in the Highlands, working specifically with technical and vocational training institutions to produce labor market-ready graduates who are better equipped to deal with financial decision-making.  PFIP is also partnering with MiBank on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ solar energy kit loan pilot. This product has huge potential in Papua New Guinea, as you may be aware that 82% of our population are still ‘off-grid’. Besides enabling them to access electricity in a convenient, 
cost effective-way, the project has the potential to introduce 100,000 unbanked Papua New Guineans into the formal financial sector, boost financial literacy and give them opportunities to access additional financial products.  In summary, it seems that UNCDF, through PFIP has been very busy! We would like to acknowledge the EU in particular for supporting the second phase of PFIP’s work in Papua New Guinea through the RED 2 Programme, without which, many of the above-mentioned achievements would not have been possible. We would like to thank PFIP, UNCDF and UNDP and for their support in advancing financial inclusion in Papua New Guinea and more broadly in the Pacific. And finally, we wish to congratulate UNCDF of reaching the milestone of its 50th birthday.  
    24.02.2017 The Mediterranean economies in a changing world. Lessons learned in economic and financial instability: what scenarios can we envisage? IEMED Conference/Barcelona Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/4 Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is for me a great pleasure to make the opening remarks in this conference organised by IEMED, to discuss economic and financial matters in the Mediterranean region. The two previous conferences took place in Barcelona, in October 2014, and in Rabat, in November 2015, and were very successful as, I am sure, it will the case again this time.  The idea behind these conferences is to provide a forum in which different parties from Mediterranean countries interested in exchanging ideas on monetary, economic and financial matters in the region --central banks, public officials, representatives of the private sector and international organisations- can do so in a friendly and forthcoming environment. I think the diversity of participants, with presence of some central banks, is one of the clues for the success and the continuity of this initiative.  For the “Introductory session” we are joined by leading representatives of three multilateral organisations with an important involvement in the region. The Union for the Mediterranean gathers together the countries at both shores of this sea; it is always of the highest interest to listen to his Secretary General, Mr. Fathallahh SijiImassi. The European Investment Bank has made in recent years a huge effort to increase its activities, financing and support in the South and East Mediterranean countries; we have today the presence of its Vice President, Mr. Román Escolano. Finally, the OECD, one of the leading institutions in economic analysis and policy advice, represented by former Portuguese Minister of Finance, Mr. Alvaro Pereira. With their presence the session devoted to the discussion of “the role of central banks at present and of monetary and exchange rates policies in Mediterranean countries” promises to be of a great interest. In 2015, in Rabat, we had the opportunity to benefit from the support and hospitality of Bank Al-Maghrib, and this year we are again privileged by the presence of Governor Al-Jouahri. It is also a great honour to have here today the Governor of the central bank of Malta, my colleague at ECB Governing Council, Mr Mario Vella, and the former Governor from the central bank of Tunisia, Mr. Mustapha Kamel Nabli. The following sessions of the Conference deal with two topics of fundamental importance for the region: the need of structural reforms to enhance the business climate and improve productivity and the most adequate fiscal policy to be adopted in the present context. Finally, the economic scenarios that the region can be confronted to within the next few years, will be analysed in the last session. The title of the Conference is “Lessons learned in economic and financial instability”. Indeed, over the last decade the world, and the Mediterranean region, have been confronted with a very important and serious unexpected political, economic and financial events. After the Financial Crisis exploded in 2008 a profound feeling of vulnerability and lack of confidence spread globally, not the less in Europe, shaken also by a sovereign debt crisis. In the South and East Mediterranean countries instability in the last few years has had mainly a political origin but its effects in terms of economic uncertainty and increased fragility have been huge. This challenging environment has led to a rethinking of the way we design and implement economic policies, be it in the monetary, financial or fiscal fronts, and also to a renewed emphasis on enhancing the stability and the resilience of the economies, as well as on reducing their vulnerabilities. Stability and certainty are probably the main attributes with 
 4/4  which economic policy can contribute to economic prosperity. But I am sure that the participants in the different sessions of the Conference will elaborate more on this topic on lessons learned and will enlighten us with their ideas on the economic policies needed to attain a better economic future in our Region.   Ladies and gentlemen, I leave the floor to the Executive President of IEMED, Mr. Senén Florensa, congratulating him for the organisation of this event and of course thanking you all for your presence here today.  
Peter Praet: How does monetary policy secure price stability overthe medium term?Intervention by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe 4th European Technical Consumer Goods Retail Summit, Berlin, 30 March 2017.*   *   *The origin of the global financial crisisIn 2008 the global economy faced a calamity unparalleled since the Second World War. Thecrisis had been preceded by a mood of over-optimism in several advanced economies.Expectations about future income were at odds with slowing underlying growth, giving rise to an“expectations gap”. In the euro area, expectations were reinforced by a revived sense ofeconomic prosperity that was associated with the introduction of monetary union. Firms wereborrowing against their future income expectations in some countries; households andgovernments were doing likewise in other countries. Also, considerable financial liberalisationand deregulation had taken place which made debt accumulation easier. In the euro area, thiswas compounded by increased financial integration which led to a substantial rise in intra-euroarea cross-border flows. As banks acted as intermediaries in both debtor and creditor countries,they too had become overexposed.When the cycle did turn, central banks were confronted with a multifaceted and perniciouschallenge. The “expectations gap” had left a number of economic agents overindebted and inneed of balance sheet repair. Overextended banks needed to deleverage. And with this, a so-called balance sheet recession ensued.Monetary policy responses to the crisisThe euro area crisis evolved in three main phases, each of which required a different monetarypolicy response.The first phase was an abrupt liquidity crisis triggered by the turning of the global financial cycleand the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. Banks suddenly became very uncertain aboutthe underlying health of other banks and stopped lending to each other. Consequently, globalcentral banks stepped in with forceful and coordinated interventions to provide essential liquidityto the banking sector. Without this response, the financial system would have collapsed and a fardeeper recession would have occurred.This phase of the crisis had profound effects on the banking sector – effects which in the euroarea were not addressed as swiftly as in other jurisdictions due to the incompleteness of itsinstitutional set-up. Sovereigns needed to support their national banking sectors even though theylacked the fiscal capacity to do so, aggravating the link between banks and governments in theeuro area.This paved the way for the second phase of the crisis: the sovereign debt crisis and itsamplification through the “bank-sovereign” nexus. As the cost of borrowing for certaingovernments increased, banks with exposures to this debt came under intense market pressure,ultimately leading to entire national banking systems losing market access. This in turn resultedin financial fragmentation and a serious disruption to the monetary transmission mechanism. Inother words, as the ECB lowered interest rates, these reductions were not being passed on tofirms and households to the same extent in every euro area country.First, to ensure banks could depend on longer-term funding, central bank liquidity was madeavailable for up to three years and the list of eligible collateral that could be used to access 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
central bank money was expanded. This eased the pressure on banks to sell less liquid assetsat depressed prices to access obtain cash, a process which would have rapidly reduced the flowof credit to the economy.Second, the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) in 2012 removed the euroarea break-up risk which was being priced into governments’ borrowing costs and the severeeconomic dislocation that would have occurred. Second, the announcement of Outright MonetaryTransactions (OMT) in 2012 reduced the likelihood of a break-up of the euro area. This risk wasbeing priced into governments’ borrowing costs and would have resulted in severe economicdislocation. Nonetheless, the sovereign debt crisis left a damaging legacy on the euro areaeconomy and laid the groundwork for the third phase of the crisis.In the subsequent years, as the euro area recovery struggled to gain traction, banks in largeparts of the euro area – particularly in vulnerable countries – were engaged in a drawn-outprocess of deleveraging their balance sheets on account of the legacy from [impact of] thesecond phase of the crisis. In early 2014 the third phase of the crisis started and by thatsummer, it was clear that additional monetary policy measures would be required. Inflation hadbegun to drift downwards and there was a palpable risk of a self-sustained period of deflation.As the main policy interest rate, the interest rate on the deposit facility, was already at zero, theGoverning Council needed to introduce new measures to provide additional stimulus to theeconomy and steer inflation back to levels below, but close to 2%. To this end, the ECB soughtto affect the range of interest rates which are relevant for private sector financing conditions.Starting in June 2014, the Governing Council introduced a negative deposit rate of –0.1%, andreduced it by a further 10 basis points in September 2014. This marked the first round of cutsinto negative territory and was viewed as a way of providing additional stimulus to the economyas it extended the scope of conventional monetary policy.Over the same period, a credit easing package was announced which included targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs I), a third covered bond purchases programme (CBPP3)and an asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP). The overarching motivationunderpinning the design of this package was twofold. First, to improve the pass-through for eacheuro of liquidity injected into the financial system to private sector borrowing costs and second, toreinforce the accommodative monetary policy stance.Credit easing measures influence the economy via three main transmission channels: directpass-through, portfolio rebalancing and signalling. The direct pass-through channel is the mostprominent one. It directly lowers banks borrowing costs, which in turn lower lending rates forfirms and households, and this supports consumption and investment. In the case of theTLTROs I, which were specifically aimed at encouraging bank lending to the private sector in anenvironment of deleveraging, banks were able to borrow at a very favourable interest rate fromthe Eurosystem. The cheaper funding costs were intended to increase competition in the marketfor bank loans, which would consequently lower borrowing costs for firms and households. Forthe CBPP3 and ABSPP, purchases increase the demand for these securities and as a resultlead to higher prices and lower yields. As these securities are backed by loans to firms andhouseholds, the price increase encourages banks to issue more loans so that they can be usedto issue more asset-backed securities and covered bonds. This increase in loan issuance alsofosters competition and lowers borrowing costs for firms and households.At the beginning of 2015, the inflation outlook had deteriorated and there was an increasing risk ofa too prolonged period of low inflation. As a result, in January 2015 the Governing Councilannounced the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), which encompassed the CBPP3and the ABSPP as well as the introduction of a public sector purchase programme (PSPP). Themonetary stimulus from the PSPP works through several transmission channels, but the most12 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
powerful is via portfolio rebalancing. For example, this can mean that not only the asset pricesincrease in market segments where direct purchases occur, but higher prices can also spill overinto non-targeted market segments. This leads to a decline in yields and lowers the cost ofborrowing on capital markets for firms. At the same time, the general compression of yieldsacross all asset classes incentivises banks to rebalance their portfolios towards assets withhigher risk-adjusted returns, such as loans to firms and households.Not long after the APP became operational, the Governing Council introduced the second roundof cuts to the deposit interest rate. This decrease into more negative territory meant that thenegative deposit rate was now viewed as an instrument to empower the portfolio rebalancingchannel of the APP, as it incentivised banks to invest the proceeds they received from sellingassets in higher yielding assets.Overall, these measures have been designed to complement each other and have provedadaptable and effective to the series of shocks which have buffeted the euro area economy sincetheir introduction. Indeed, the APP has been recalibrated three times since its introduction and inMarch 2016 the Governing Council announced four more targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTROs II) to further support credit availability to euro area firms and households.The economic impact of monetary policy measuresOur measures are working their way through the financial system and have led to a major easingof financing conditions for euro area firms and households, benefited credit creation andcontributed to a more robust and sustained economic recovery.A week ago we conducted the fourth and last operation under the second round of TargetedLong-term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), the so-called TLTRO-II, which we announced inMarch 2016 as part of an effort to forestall the risks of renewed transmission impairments thatwe saw early last year – in the wake of another episode of acute financial instability – and theconsequences that a break-down in bank transmission could have had for price stability in theeuro area. The total amount borrowed under TLTRO-II, EUR 740 billion, has surpassed ourinternal expectations by far. Together with its predecessor, TLTRO-I, these instruments wereamong the most effective components of the policy package which we have been enacting sinceJune 2014. The main channel through which they played through to the broad economy has beenthe interest rate channel. When the facility was announced in June 2014 the ECB had beeneasing its monetary policy stance for almost three years. Yet, despite a reduction of the overnightinterest rate to levels close to zero, banks in a large fraction of the euro area economy had notbeen reducing their lending rates at the same pace and, in some countries, in fact they hadtightened credit conditions dramatically. The stimulus was not moving downstream to reach thereal economy.That trend was reversed almost instantly after the June 2014 announcement. Already over thesummer of 2014 – even before the first operation was allotted in September of that year – lendingrates plunged to levels unseen since 2010. Why did this happen? The new facility gave banks along-term source of funding at a very moderate cost on condition that they would lend the fundson to the economy. This turned up the competitiveness temperature in the market for bank creditwhich, up to that point in time, had become polarised between banks with scarce access tofunding and limited capacity to create credit, on the one hand, and banks with normal access tofunding on the other. None of the two types of banks had a capacity or an incentive to providecredit to the economy on affordable conditions. The new operation put all banks on the samefunding footing and thus created the conditions for the banking industry as a whole to startcompeting again for good credit.As a result of TLTROs and, in due time, the other instruments that were added, bank lendingrates for both firms and households have dropped by more than 110 basis points since 2014 andare now at historical lows. Encouragingly, the improvement in credit conditions is occurring both 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
within and across euro area countries. Borrowing costs in vulnerable countries are nowapproaching levels observed in the less vulnerable countries. Euro area small and medium-sizedenterprises (SMEs) appear to have particularly benefited from the increasing pass-through ofpolicy rates. Lending rates on very small loans (below €250,000) have declined by 177 basispoints, and bank lending rates on all non-financial corporation (NFC) loans have declined by 113basis points.This sharp decline in bank lending rates has also been accompanied by improvements in accessto credit for firms and households. Bank lending volumes have been on an upward trend. InJanuary, lending to households recorded its fastest growth rate since May 2011, while corporatelending, as in the previous month, recorded its highest reading since 2009. Since September2014, when the first TLTRO was conducted, bank loans to households have increased by 3.8%,while bank loans to non-financial companies have increased by 3.1%.As overall financing conditions have eased and credit growth increased, improvements in theeuro area’s economic performance have followed. Indeed, the current recovery is showingconsiderable resilience, which to a large extent reflects the fact that domestic demand is theprimary driver of growth. At the same time, there are encouraging signs that both global growthprospects and world trade are strengthening and may well act as tailwinds to further support therecovery.Monetary policy is playing a central role in supporting consumption: lower interest rates areensuring favourable borrowing conditions and encouraging households to bring forward durableconsumption as well as firms’ investment. Consumption of durable goods has rebounded inrecent years, and especially in countries where credit was previously very tight. While investmenthas responded more slowly, monetary policy is helping create the conditions for a strongerinvestment revival through its overall effect on the economy.The euro area cyclical recovery is gaining momentum, broadening across sectors and countries.While the economic outlook is now better than it has been for many years, downside risksremain, albeit less pronounced than they once were.The firming of the recovery has not yet translated into a durable strengthening of inflationdynamics. Headline inflation has increased, but for the most part this reflects rising energy andfood price inflation. Underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued. According to ourlatest projections, inflation is expected to move towards levels below, but close to, 2% over theforecast horizon. We are not yet sufficiently confident that inflation will converge to levelsconsistent with our aim in a durable manner. Inflation dynamics still remain reliant on the verysubstantial degree of monetary accommodation which prevails.Against this background, the Governing Council has reaffirmed its monetary policy stance,including its forward guidance, in order to secure a sustained convergence in inflation towardsour aim objective.The first TLTROs took place in September 2014. In September 2014, the ECB announced the launch of theCBPP3 and the ABSPP.For more details see “The transmission of the ECB’s recent non-standard monetary policy measures” ECBEconomic Bulletin, Issue 7/2015.12 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: Central bank communication in a low interest rateenvironmentSpeech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atan event organised by Bruegel, Brussels, 31 March 2017.*   *   *It is a great pleasure to be here today at Bruegel, a think tank that has always been at theforefront of the policy debate in Europe, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to thediscussion in this forum.Today, I would like to share with you a few thoughts on central bank communication in a lowinterest rate environment. In particular, I will discuss, drawing on the ECB’s experience, thecommunication challenges central banks face when rates are negative and when there isuncertainty on the reaction function of policymakers. I will conclude with some remarks on thecurrent policy debate.Let me start on a more general note, however.The relationship of central banks with the outside world has evolved over the years. From astarting point of near-complete secrecy, central banks have come all the way to usingcommunication explicitly as a tool of monetary policy. Especially during the financial crisis, thecommunication efforts of central banks around the world expanded.There are good reasons for this. To fulfil their mandates, central banks have injected largeamounts of monetary stimulus, while also making use of novel instruments. The monetary policyresponse has been unprecedented in both scale and scope. This has certainly added furtherimpetus to central banks’ drive for accountability and transparency – something that we at theECB have always taken very seriously. Earlier this week, at an event organised by TransparencyInternational, also here in Brussels, I explained in more detail how the ECB goes about fulfilling itsaccountability and transparency duties.Today, I will not discuss these institutional factors. Rather, I will focus onthe functional dimension behind the increased importance of communication for central banks.This functional dimension derives from the relationship between the monetary authority andfinancial markets.Central bank communication as a tool for monetary policyIn today’s economy, the transmission of monetary impulses starts with asset prices. Atransparent policy framework greatly enhances our ability to steer financial conditions and,hence, ultimately ensures the effective transmission of monetary policy in the pursuit of our pricestability objective.The relationship between central banks’ policy communication and financial market conditionsreceived even greater attention when central banks were approaching interest rate levels thatwere generally judged to offer limited or no further room for manoeuvre.I will argue that in the vicinity of the effective lower bound for policy interest rates, communicationbecomes even more important, and while there are similarities to communication further awayfrom the lower bound, there are also peculiar challenges.I said before that monetary policy is transmitted mainly through asset prices. Since financialmarkets exist to price future cash flows, they are inherently forward-looking. This meansmonetary policy works largely by affecting expectations of future policy interest rates – this is true123 1 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
both at, and away from, the effective lower bound.Away from the lower bound, monetary policy steers such expectations mainly by sending signalsthrough the current level of central bank interest rates and by communicating on the centralbank’s assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.At the lower bound, the ability of central banks to ease the stance of monetary policy in this wayis constrained. Instead, central banks must increasingly rely on influencing expectations directly.This they can do by communicating about the likely path of future policy rates – by providingforward guidance.In other words, the lower bound puts a premium on clear communication not only because itrepresents unusual circumstances that require the central bank to explain itself carefully, but alsobecause it elevates the importance of communication in the monetary policy toolbox.Indeed, with frictionless capital markets, at the effective lower bound forward guidance would bethe only way to ease the monetary policy stance. In this setup, central bank asset purchaseswould be ineffective: whether assets are held on the balance sheet of the public or private sectorwould not affect term premia and, hence, long-term interest rates.Of course we know that capital markets are not frictionless. This opens up an important role forcentral banks to intervene in asset markets via outright purchases and to act on the termpremium. So, forward guidance is one tool, but not the only one, central banks can resort to inconditions where the space for changes in policy-makers’ traditional instrument – the short-termpolicy rate – is constrained.The ECB’s forward guidanceBut let me focus on the workings of forward guidance by looking at the case of the ECB. I willstart with some general remarks before explaining our current forward guidance framework.For forward guidance to be credible, it ultimately has to be anchored in the central bank’smandate. Any pronouncement we make about the likely path of our policy instruments isinevitably based on current information and conveys our assessment of where the economy ismost likely headed over the policy-relevant horizon. This type of forward guidance is sometimestermed “Delphic” , because, like the Oracle of Delphi, it basically consists of a forecast, in thiscase a forecast by the central bank of how the economy will likely evolve.But our forward guidance is also intended to clarify our reaction function. The reaction functionmaps the economic environment into our instrument space. To put it simply, it relates whatwe think will happen to what we will do if it happens. To continue with the Greek mythologytheme, this means there is also an “Odyssean” element to forward guidance: like Odysseustying himself to his ship’s mast in order to resist the songs of the Sirens, it conveysa commitment to react in specific ways to the contingencies that might arise.An extreme form of Odyssean forward guidance, which I will not discuss today because I believethat it is not consistent with our mandate, would consist in committing to an unconditional interestpath, irrespective of contingencies.This is how far theory goes.In practice, and applying the distinction between Delphic and Odyssean guidance to theECB’s rate forward guidance, when we say that we “expect interest rates to remain at present orlower levels for an extended period of time …”, we convey both our assessment of how we seeinflation most likely evolving over the policy-relevant horizon and how we intend to map thisoutlook into the level of our key policy rates.4567 2 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
You can now easily see that our rate forward guidance entails two key components:a structural component that corresponds to our reaction function – our monetary policy strategy– which is firmly anchored in our primary mandate. In today’s world, where central banks makeuse of different instruments, our reaction function also includes the mapping of any desiredmonetary policy stance into instruments, such as policy rates and asset purchases. Think of it,ideally, as a finely tuned machine that we constantly feed with our assessment of the likely futurepath of inflation, which itself is the variable component, for it evolves as a result of the incomingdata stream.The same two components – a structural and a variable one – also apply to our forwardguidance on the asset purchase programme (APP), which contains three main elements:First, clear Delphic communication on expected volumes and the purchase horizon,currently “until December 2017 …”.Second, an Odyssean element of state contingency that clarifies the Governing Council’sreaction function should it not see “a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistentwith its inflation aim.”And third, since last December an additional Odyssean clarification that expresses ourpreparedness to increase the size and/or duration of the APP under certain conditions, i.e. “ifthe outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent withfurther progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation …”.Taken together, the ECB’s current forward guidance encompasses a carefully expounded seriesof expectations involving both key policy rates and asset purchases.Indeed, guidance on policy rates is linked to the APP timeline, with the Governing Council’sexpectation being that they will remain at present or lower levels “well past the horizon of our netasset purchases.” The logic behind this guidance, in very simple terms, is that it may bebeneficial to retain full control over the expected path of future short-term policy rates, whileallowing a gradual decompression of the term premium if and when we see solid progresstowards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.At any rate, for our forward guidance, both on rates and the APP, to be credible, we need to keepour policy expectations well aligned with our evolving assessment of the balance of risks and theoutlook for inflation – this is the Delphic part of our forward guidance. We would pay a high pricein terms of our credibility if we failed to adapt our forward guidance once we had changed ourviews on the outlook.I will come back to this point later but let me note, for now, that a too gradual adjustment of ourguidance could ultimately be quite costly. Indeed, central banks and markets may have movedtowards what Jeremy Stein and co-author have called a “gradualist” equilibrium.This is a situation in which central banks make gradual changes to policy tools andcommunication in order not to upset the market. In such an environment, any change to thecentral bank’s policy inclination will have a major effect on asset prices. The reason is thatmarkets have come to expect the initial central bank move – no matter how incremental – to befollowed by many similar moves in the same direction.This effect is likely to be greater in conditions where there is an exceptionally large amount ofmonetary stimulus in place. It makes the expectations of an announcement of a change in themonetary policy stance much more important for markets.The ECB’s experience with forward guidance: successes and challengesWith this in mind, what has been our experience with forward guidance?8 3 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
It is too early to draw definitive conclusions – after all, we are still in a lower bound environment.But we do have some evidence that our forward guidance has been successful – in the followingrespects.First, it has had a stabilising influence on certain market prices that reflect expectations of ourpolicy instruments and are important in the chain of transmission. We have evidence that thesensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news declined at the time of our (very first)forward guidance announcement in July 2013, and that sensitivity has remained lower thanhistorical regularities ever since. In other words, markets trust our assessment of the economyand the implied path of policy rates.Second, by stating that domestic policies are likely to differ from those elsewhere, forwardguidance has insulated euro area financial conditions from external shocks that would haveresulted in an unwarranted tightening and facilitated nominal exchange rate adjustmentsconsistent with different monetary conditions, which themselves reflect different circumstances.Third, it has been a source of additional monetary policy accommodation at a time when theroom for cuts in key policy rates has been very limited.Let me explain this last point in more detail, referring back to our forward guidance on the APP.The impact of asset purchases on market prices is likely to depend critically on how thesepurchases are communicated to the market. The fact that we chose to communicate, as part ofour forward guidance, and from the very beginning, an expectation of the intended horizon of APPpurchases is likely to have been a key determinant of the success of the programme. Thereason is that providing guidance on the horizon helps markets to form more accurateexpectations about the likely amount of purchases – conditional on the price stability outlook –thereby reducing uncertainty and hence term/risk premia.This has been confirmed by recent research: when flanked by communication on the likely size,announcements of purchase programmes have been found to lead to a much greater decline instock market uncertainty compared with announcements that omit a size indication.This first element of our APP guidance was reinforced by the second element – the state-contingent leg of our forward guidance. By establishing an intimate link to our price stabilityobjective, we made clear that the expected volume could well be larger should it take longer forinflation to converge back to levels closer to 2%.In practice, this means that by clarifying our reaction function in this way, markets were able tobetter anticipate our actions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy by frontloading therequired accommodation. This has not always been a gentle ride as I will explain in a minute but Ithink it is fair to say that the state-contingent leg of APP forward guidance has supported andcontinues to support the important price discovery function of markets.Overall, therefore, the combination of time and state-contingent forward guidance has beenhighly instrumental in supporting powerful portfolio rebalancing effects and a compression ofterm premia, and in turn has led to a broad-based easing of financial conditions.I think the evidence speaks for itself.Euro area bank lending rates to firms have fallen by some 80 basis points since we startedpurchasing covered bonds in October 2014, a step which was succeeded shortly afterwards bypurchases of asset-backed securities (ABS) and government securities. ECB analysis attributesa significant portion of this fall to the workings of our asset purchase programme.And effective forward guidance on and implementation of the APP may have also helped to91011 4 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
reinforce forward guidance on rates – a channel famously labelled the “signalling” channel. Theargument goes that large-scale bond purchases would be perceived by markets as preventingpolicy-makers from raising rates quickly, as this would cause losses on central banks’ balancesheet. In other words, central banks purchasing assets “put their money where their mouth is”.At the same time, I will not deny that communication on policy intentions has been, and remains,challenging and that we cannot always be sure how our forward guidance works.Much of the challenge arises of course from the fact that communication is not a one-way streetas I alluded to before. There is an interaction between central bank communication and financialmarkets which creates a well-known risk that financial conditions would become de-anchored.Paul Samuelson famously compared the central banker who reads too much from movementsin the bond markets to a monkey who “discovers his reflection in the mirror and thinks that bylooking at the reactions of that monkey – including its surprises – he is getting newinformation”.Let me explain by giving you two concrete examples.The first one refers to our decision of December 2015, when we announced a substantialpackage of policy measures, including a six-month extension of the APP, a 10 basis point cut inthe deposit facility rate (DFR) and the reinvestment of the principal payments on the maturingbonds. To give you an idea of the size, the additional purchases alone, including thereinvestment, amounted to almost €700 billion of bonds that we expected to extract from themarket – an appreciable amount of stimulus.Yet, the market paid little heed and bond yields tightened measurably on the day. We observed ahawkish revision of expectations about the trajectory of ECB policy rates and increaseduncertainty about our reaction function. Market intelligence following the decision suggested thatthe absence of clearer forward guidance on the possibility of further cuts in the DFR led to asharp repricing in the EONIA forward market.This suggests two things: first, the introduction of negative rates, while having a powerful easingeffect on the monetary policy stance, has created uncertainty about how low we are prepared togo with our key interest rates.Second, any perceived communication on the lower bound is a strong signal. Recall thatmarkets on that day undertook a repricing, although the Governing Council, in each and everyIntroductory Statement, has kept an implicit reference to its initial rate forward guidance of July2013, namely that it expects rates to remain at present or lower levels.Incidentally, this experience squares with recent findings in the literature. Researchers at theECB have shown that if central bank communication leads to different interpretations by marketparticipants – in this case about the willingness to cut the DFR further and the likely lower bound– they tend to look to financial market prices to find out about how their peers have interpreted thesame statement. This makes it more likely that they react to exogenous disturbances, which inturn increases uncertainty.At face value, this would call for self-standing forward guidance on the lower bound. But as Iexplained in my remarks in Yale last year, there is great uncertainty about the estimates of theso-called “economic” lower bound, the level at which further reductions in rates would be morelikely to lead to a tightening rather than an easing of the stance.Would it be credible for central banks to provide guidance on such sketchy, and probably time-varying, estimates? My answer would be no, at least not until we can say with much moreconfidence where the lower bound might be.12131415 5 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
But in respect of what we do know, communication should be as clear as possible, in particularwhen uncertainty about non-standard measures is considerable.This brings me to my next observation: the market’s reception of our decision last December toextend the intended horizon of APP purchases to December 2017, but to reduce the monthlypurchases from €80 billion to €60 billion.It was feared that a reduction in the pace of purchases – despite the longer purchase horizon –could cause instabilities in financial markets, similar to those during the so-called “taper tantrum”episode in the US in 2013.These risks were ingrained in market surveys which suggested that the market was almostunanimous in believing that the ECB would continue purchases at €80 billion per month, alsobeyond March 2017.With the benefit of hindsight, these fears proved unfounded. The December 2016 policyannouncement was met with broad approval by market participants, thereby safeguarding thecontinued support for the recovery in the euro area through very accommodative financingconditions.I see two potential trains of thought that could square the benign market response with thesignals from surveys and the Fed’s experience: the success of the December 2016 decision inpreserving the favourable market conditions could be attributed to the additional “easing bias”attached to the APP that I mentioned earlier; the other line of thinking would be that the availablemarket surveys painted a biased and misleading picture of true investor expectations.Which line of thinking is likely to be closer to reality?In my view, both are equally relevant. The decision to communicate that we stand ready toincrease the size and/or duration of the programme under certain conditions assured investorsthat there was no change in our reaction function. Rather, the reduction in the pace of purchaseswas a mere reflection of the diminished deflationary tail risks – a Delphic signal embedded inclearer Odyssean forward guidance, if you wish.But the additional easing bias, however important it may be, is unlikely to explain the whole story.One reason is that some market participants voice concerns about our ability to increase themonthly pace of purchases given the scarcity of bonds available in the market and theconstraints on our purchase programme. Others doubt our willingness to step up purchasesonce more.Both concerns seem to cast doubt on the credibility of this part of our forward guidance –wrongly, in my view, considering our proven track record of decisive action in the face of adverseshocks that threaten to jeopardise the achievement of our price stability objective.But if we take these doubts seriously, it means that markets might have discounted morestrongly the possibility of a more abrupt end to the APP post-March 2017 than what availablesurveys might have suggested – a view that would seem to corroborate, at least at face value,the argument put forward by Hyun Shin.He argues that we should not think of the market as a homogenous entity with its own coherentset of beliefs and expectations. Rather, the marketplace is diverse, and prices at any given pointin time aggregate many different – indeed opposing – opinions. Investors with the most stridentviews – that is, with the highest degree of conviction – may have the largest influence on pricingin the short term. It is because these market participants are willing to make the strongestcommitment, both in terms of the size of the positions they take, and in terms of leverage.1617 6 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
You can see what I’m getting at. Perhaps the overall benign market response to our December2016 announcement may have frustrated those who expected an outright tapering decision,perhaps because they doubted our willingness or ability to continue purchasing.This suggests that expectations gleaned from market surveys may be imperfect reflections of“true” market expectations. Of course, it may also be that we have not been clear enough in ourcommunication – that investors misunderstood our forward guidance or our reaction function,which is different from doubts about our willingness to act. To some extent, when there are toomany disparate voices, such risks of miscommunication – the danger of cacophony, as AlanBlinder once put it – can be mitigated by putting discipline on communication by monetarypolicy committees – the Governing Council in the case of the ECB. In fact, the case fordisciplined communication is even stronger at the lower bound.All this is not to say that we should ignore what investors think and expect. Market intelligence isan important input into the analysis of financial market developments. It rather means that thesuccessful sequence of policymaking – in particular in the presence of unconventional policymeasures – is (i) to be clear about our reaction function, including how the expected monetarypolicy stance would be mapped into different policy instruments, (ii) to disclose frequently ourassessment of the state of the economy and its likely evolution, and (iii) to act accordingly.In doing so, central banks can lead the markets and minimise the risk of being led by them. Andby fostering the markets’ understanding of our reaction function, we reduce market volatility andsupport both the effectiveness and predictability of monetary policy actions.Conclusions and outlookWith these experiences and challenges in mind, allow me a few thoughts on the current state ofour forward guidance – and with this I will conclude.As you know, earlier this month the Governing Council decided to leave its forward guidanceunchanged. Thus, we have maintained both “easing biases” – the one on purchases and the oneon key interest rates, i.e. meaning that rates could go lower.The euro area economy has undoubtedly made a great deal of progress. The recovery has beensteadily broadening, firming, and may even have gained some further momentum since thebeginning of this year. In fact, we may now see the full potential of our policy measures unfolding.That of course raises the question as to whether the time has come to communicate a change inour policy expectations.As I said earlier, our forward guidance framework consists of two key components: a structuraland a variable one. Changing the structural part is not an option as it would leave markets in astate of uncertainty, with risks of excess volatility and even of a de-stabilisation of financialconditions.But the variable component of our guidance demands that we: (i) regularly re-assess themedium-term price stability outlook, (ii) run this assessment through our reaction function, and(iii) decide whether or not our policy expectations on the horizon and pace of our asset purchaseprogrammes, on the level of our policy rates (“present or lower”) and on their expectedendurance (“well past …”) need adjustment.Should we conclude that an adjustment is needed, we should not hesitate to adapt ourcommunication. After all, abandoning the intimate link between our policy expectations and ourassessment of the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation would riskcreating the false impression that we had changed our reaction function – a dangerous pathtowards time-inconsistency.1819 7 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Of course, should we decide to change our policy expectations on the back of an improvingeconomic landscape, this does not mean that we would not lower interest rates or increase thepace of purchases in any state of the world. It just means that – given the current outlook – itseems increasingly less likely that we will have to do so.In a similar way, any decision to change our policy expectations does not prejudice further policysteps. There are no automatic implications for our policy tools. It is natural that a potential changein expectations first has to withstand the test of time.Ultimately, also the choice of sequencing of policy instruments will be the outcome of our regularassessment of the medium-term price stability outlook, reflecting the state-dependent nature ofour expectations of the horizon over which our policy instruments are likely to be maintained.And here, let me be clear.The latest incoming data have shifted the balance of risks for growth towards neutral territory inmy view. But at the same time, measures of underlying inflation in the euro area remain subduedand our projected path of inflation still remains highly conditional on our policy stance. In line withour forward guidance on the APP, this clearly suggests that current expectations on the intendedhorizon of our purchases, as encapsulated in our Introductory Statement, and on the sequencingof policy instruments, remain valid today.Thank you for your attention.ReferencesAltavilla, C., G.

Carl-Ludwig Thiele: Closing remarks - Focus Session by theEuropean Central Bank and Deutsche BundesbankClosing remarks by Mr Carl-Ludwig Thiele, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the Focus Session by the European Central Bank and Deutsche Bundesbank,Frankfurt am Main, 28 March 2017.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemenYou were invited to this Focus Session today by the European Central Bank and the DeutscheBundesbank. As is customary at these sessions, discussions centred around our commonobjective of improving the security and efficiency of payments and securities settlementoperations.A joint task is most certainly what this is, in our opinion. It is for that reason that we seek topromote dialogue between central banks and market participants and between infrastructureproviders and users. You will be aware, I imagine, that the term “central bank” originally cameabout on account of the central role which the institution plays in the world of payments. Theother functions performed by central banks – issuing currency and acting as the lender of lastresort – didn’t come along until later.That central role is one we continue to perform to this day. And I don’t mean that in the sense ofbeing a central agent wielding control over developments, but more in terms of bearing a highdegree of responsibility for efficiency and security in the payments and settlement space.Our mission is to serve the market with secure and efficient infrastructures. And with a stablecurrency and robust supervision, too, of course.The most important asset we can draw on in this regard is trust. And trust is forged by actingcredibly and transparently and in the spirit of mutual understanding. Technology alone will notnurture trust – I’m certain of that.That’s why events like today’s, which promote lively interaction, are so important to us. What canwe take away from today’s Focus Session? 1. What does the market need?We spoke today about the needs of the market.One major talking point, of course, was instant payments. The market consultation on TIPS,which will pave the way for settling instant payments in safe central bank money, was the cue forour discussion today.I would use the words approving and encouraging to sum up the outcome of the consultation.Judging by your market responses, I am confident that we can come up with solutions which willalso be attractive in terms of the cost of settlement.One major hurdle which instant payments face is the question of liquidity management. Inaddition, due to the new regulations and due to the general interest in reducing exposuresmarkets will need more collateral in the future.That is why the Eurosystem will roll out solutions which help the market cope with the liquidity 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
challenges.Our thoughts are not confined to the Eurosystem, of course. Multi-currency capability is anenduring system feature which might prove worthwhile in the integration of European markets,for example.The issue of TARGET2 and T2S consolidation was another area in which we discussed theoutcome of the consultation. Ladies and gentlemen, your numerous contributions today wereinsightful and thought-provoking. The Eurosystem is currently liaising with the potential users ofour services to formulate a set of user requirements. We cannot, of course, make every wishcome true, nor would it be right for us to do so, because at the end of the day, we are a providerthat needs to cover its costs, and those wishes will have to be paid for.The trick will mainly be to use consolidation as a way of driving down costs. Investment inconsolidation will push costs higher initially, but over the medium-term horizon, it will yieldsignificant savings in the running of T2 and T2S. All our projects can’t go live overnight, of course, and building Rome in one day is something wecan’t be expected to achieve, either. 2. Technical innovationAnother topic we spoke about today was innovation and transformation. There are a great manytechnological innovations which could potentially unleash change in the market. Blockchain,distributed ledger technology, cloud computing, big data analytics and artificial intelligence arealready firmly established in the way we think and, in some cases, how we act, too.Plato once said that “necessity is the mother of invention". But in the case of blockchain, it is theexact opposite we are seeing. The invention, ie blockchain, has already been born. Now people inmany quarters are looking for the necessity – that is, for specific areas where it can be put intopractice.The initial sense of euphoria over the potential which blockchain and distributed ledgertechnology offer has now given way to disillusionment over the problems surrounding theirpractical implementation.Central banks, too, are testing a variety of ways in which the potential offered by blockchain canbe harnessed. At the Bundesbank, it’s all about moving further along the learning curve. We arerunning hands-on, practical experiments to explore whether, and if so, how, a blockchain-basedapplication can feasibly be used to settle securities transactions.The prototype we have developed in conjunction with Deutsche Börse works. It can settlepayments, both delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and free-of-payment (FoP) securitiestransactions, and it can process straightforward capital measures such as interest paymentsand redemptions of maturing bonds.The challenge we are facing now is to engineer the prototype to a degree that yields robustinsights into its performance. Being a provider of market infrastructure, we are naturally curiousto know whether the technology is scalable, what it will really cost when it’s up and running,which technical issues might crop up when settling large numbers of trades, and much morebesides.In our view, it has not yet been proven beyond doubt that blockchain-based settlement systemsare superior to the methods in use today. That’s why we’re open-minded about this issue – as Isaid earlier, we are looking to learn more. But we’re not looking to compare apples and oranges, 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
hence our efforts to base the experiment on today’s real-world conditions. Blockchain needs to fitinto the real world, not vice versa.Earlier on, I mentioned the sense of disillusionment which has now clouded many blockchainprojects. But let me reiterate our commitment to exploring these issues with an open mind – itwould be wrong to overlook any opportunities that might arise.Just remember: the first motorised seagoing vessels lagged behind the fastest sailing boats ofthe day. But field testing improved that technology to such an extent that no-one today wouldseriously regard sailing boats as a realistic means of transporting goods by sea.Remember, too, that we tend to follow set behavioural patterns and pigeonhole issues accordingto our existing business models and processes. It might be that we don’t yet grasp the merits ofa new technology because they only really come to the fore in different business models orprocesses. Perhaps merely discussing the new technology will spark the emergence of newbusiness models and more efficient settlement models.In short, new technologies – and by that I mean blockchain and beyond – offer opportunitieswhich we need to explore with an open mind, but without losing touch with reality. 3. German market migrates to T2ST2S showed us just how complex innovations can be in the settlement world. We all breathed ahuge sigh of relief when the German market, with its central securities depository ClearstreamBanking AG, migrated to the single shared platform (SSP) as scheduled at the close of businesson 6 February 2017. Transition work went smoothly, as did the first days of business.It truly was a resounding success – a masterpiece in cooperation across an entire industry. It’salways the case that success has many fathers, and that bon mot really is quite apt when itcomes to the settlement of securities which, after all, is a network industry.Every single stakeholder – the 4CB, Clearstream, all the banks and other customers ofClearstream – had to migrate simultaneously and adjust their systems accordingly. That’s whythanks are also due to everyone involved. I firmly believe it was an impressive accomplishment.All in all, 18 central securities depositories and their markets have now migrated to T2S since theplatform was launched in June 2015. This means that T2S is a major step closer to the vision ofit becoming a hub for European securities settlement.This migration was particularly noteworthy because the size of the German market effectivelydoubled the volume of business settled via the T2S platform.T2S has demonstrated that it can cater for whatever standards market participants expect aEuropean securities settlement platform to meet.For German market participants, the SSP not only eases settlement by standardising andharmonising procedures but also offers them opportunities to optimise their liquidity and collateralmanagement. 4. Invitation to receptionLadies and gentlemen 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Today’s Focus Session was a very special one for me. We made a conscious decision to hostthis session, following the German market’s transition to T2S, here in Frankfurt am Main. Themigration of Wave 4 to the SSP marks a huge step forward for each and every one of us. Ofcourse, that’s an achievement we need to celebrate.However, today’s session did more than just dwell on past achievements – we also looked to thefuture and the challenges it holds in store. Because as a Chinese saying goes, the roads oftomorrow must be built today.We, the central banks, organised this Focus Session for you, the market participants. Youengaged with us, and you debated with us. Thank you all for getting involved. My gratitude alsogoes out to all those who made our Focus Session such a success – everyone who spoke andparticipated in discussions, and of course the many helping hands in the background whose jobit was to prepare and organise today’s event.Ladies and gentlemenSecurities settlement and payments are a network industry. What would be more apt, then, tonetwork at a joint reception to which you are now all cordially invited.Join me there in celebrating the successful migration of the German market to T2S.Thank you for your attention. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Takehiro Sato Member of the Policy Board Lessons of Japan: Focusing on Issues regarding Long-Term Inflation Expectations Speech at Yale University in New Haven Bank of Japan March 28, 2017   
1 Introduction First of all, I thank Senior Fellow Stephen Roach for giving me the opportunity to talk to this esteemed audience at Yale. I understand that he teaches macroeconomic policy issues, focusing on the lessons Japan learned from deflation. The Bank of Japan is the frontrunner in combating deflation. As one of its board members, I hope that my remarks today will help stimulate academic discussion.  Deflation has prevailed for almost a quarter century in Japan. To overcome deflation, theory and practice were introduced and tested, and the policy effects were examined. As a result, a range of knowledge and wisdom has been acquired. The Bank, on its part, conducted a comprehensive assessment of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing -- or QQE for short -- in September last year, and learned some important lessons. Among these, I will today focus on the issues regarding long-term inflation expectations. This is because they are the key factor in overcoming deflation. I admit that conceiving such expectations is a somewhat elusive task, but it is worth discussing.  I. Lessons of Japan A. Determinants of Long-Term Inflation Expectations Japan's experience refutes the premise for monetary policy that long-term inflation expectations are determined by a central bank (Chart 1).1 This is because monetary policy effects are asymmetric when a central bank decreases long-term inflation expectations toward the target and when it raises them toward the target.  In other words, once long-term inflation expectations -- the norm of prices -- are de-anchored, a central bank's ability to influence inflation is constrained significantly due to the zero interest rate bound. Those in academia might feel that this is somewhat troublesome. In fact, however, when a central bank re-anchors long-term inflation                                                    1 In its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (adopted effective January 24, 2012; as amended effective January 26, 2016), the Federal Reserve indicated that "The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation." See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016). 
2 expectations toward the target, there will be a limit if monetary policy is the only game in town. What is needed, in addition to continued powerful monetary easing, is a raise in the potential growth rate, which roughly equals the natural rate of interest. This should be achieved through structural policies including labor market reform.2  Academic discussion is seriously needed on this point. This is because Japan is not the only country that has learned lessons on deflation. Namely, simultaneous declines in the potential growth rate and long-term inflation expectations have been observed in many countries since the latest global financial crisis (Chart 2).  B. Negative Effects of Excessively Low Long-Term Inflation Expectations Let me elaborate. The more fundamental lesson we learned was that central banks should not allow long-term inflation expectations to decline to excessively low levels.  Central banks can lower excessively high long-term inflation expectations because of the credibility they have earned through the past achievements. The fight against inflation is easier and the strategy can be simpler compared with combating deflation. There is a premise for economic theory that holds true with the fight against inflation; namely, long-term inflation expectations are determined by inflation targets set by central banks.  By contrast, an inflation target will not be the basis for an economic model when set by a central bank that has lost credibility due to excessively low inflation. For example, the declines in the potential growth rate and long-term inflation expectations occurred simultaneously in Japan. However, the academic side of economics has yet to provide an answer as to whether it is possible to raise excessively low long-term inflation expectations through monetary policy. This is because of the present unique situation in Japan -- as I will touch on later -- that long-term inflation expectations are at virtually 0 percent and the potential growth rate is at slightly above 0 percent, while there is a zero nominal interest rate bound to usual economic transactions.                                                     2 The original "three-arrows" strategy of the Abe administration had a positive implication that fiscal and monetary policies combined would support structural policies. 
3 In reality, even under a large-scale unconventional monetary policy, both the mechanism of Friedman's quantity theory of money and the New Keynesian model of a jump in expectations have operated insufficiently so far. In terms of re-anchoring long-term inflation expectations, the glass is both half full and half empty. If the potential growth rate and long-term inflation expectations had not declined to the current low levels, monetary policy would have been more effective.  Next, I will discuss long-term inflation expectations in the following aspects: (1) their formation mechanism; (2) reasons for low expectations in Japan; (3) the relationship with Japan's financial crisis; and (4) the relationship with labor market reform.  II. Issues regarding Long-Term Inflation Expectations A. Formation Mechanism In economics theory, long-term inflation expectations are irrelevant to the potential growth rate. However, I doubt that this holds true in reality, in light of what is happening in Japan. Rather, I think that long-term inflation expectations and the potential growth rate do have a correlation, although it may not be strong (Chart 3).  Long-term inflation expectations declined sharply in Japan, before and after the financial crisis in the late 1990s. Economic fundamentals already had been weak before the crisis because of the negative interaction between demand and supply conditions; specifically, (1) a negative financial accelerator on the demand side due to the dire asset price deflation, and (2) the impairment of the financial intermediary function, as well as the distortion of economic resource allocation caused by the bubble economy on the supply side. The financial crisis triggered further weakening of economic fundamentals (Chart 4). In this situation, pessimism about the future led to a decline in people's expectations for medium- to long-term growth, and the potential growth rate remained low over a long period of time. As a result, people's perception of prices became excessively conservative. In other words, long-term inflation expectations turned downward.  
4 B. Reasons for Low Expectations in Japan Next, let us take a look at developments in survey-based measures of expected long-term inflation in Japan. A survey-based rate marked a sharp decline during the period of the financial crisis in the late 1990s, and then leveled out at around 1 percent. Since then, even throughout the period of the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, it has been more or less unchanged at around 1 percent (Chart 5). However, I am somewhat doubtful about this figure.3 I believe that it is more persuasive to say that long-term inflation expectations in Japan have actually declined to around 0 percent, for the following four reasons.4  First, the frequency of micro-level price changes suggests that the mode value remains zero. In other words, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of sample items concentrated on 0 percent. Therefore, people are likely to consider that zero inflation is a steady and constant state. It is helpful to see the comparison with the U.S. situation (Chart 6).5  Second, administered prices are excessively sticky (Chart 7).6,7 For example, the starting subway fare in Tokyo has been unchanged for over 20 years since 1995 -- disregarding the effects of the consumption tax hikes.                                                     3 Market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations -- such as the 5-year, 5-year forward inflation swap rate -- have less credibility than survey-based ones in Japan, due to a lack of market liquidity and depth, and therefore do not represent a useful reference. 4 On this point, it seems intuitively unlikely that many of the surveyed economists project that the inflation rate will remain at about 0 percent over the next 5-10 years. On the other hand, there might be a disparity between the perception of prices of economists and that of households and firms, i.e., long-term inflation expectations of households and firms might be lower than those of economists. 5 See Watanabe and Watanabe (2016). 6 In reality, amid the prolonged economic stagnation in Japan, a mechanism was established firmly in which the rise in costs for administered prices was compensated for by fiscal deficits reflecting the increasing political pressure to avoid the rise in administered prices. Such a process itself suggests a decline in long-term inflation expectations, which is the norm of prices. 7 See Shintani, Kurachi, and Nishioka (2016). 
5 Third, the rate of increase in wages resulting from the wage negotiations between labor and management continued to be 0 percent for a long time. Even after the recent resumption of base pay increases, the rate is less than 1 percent (Chart 8).8  Fourth, Japan's deflation equilibrium cannot be theoretically explained on the basis of the 1 percent long-term inflation expectations (Chart 9). I will elaborate on the fourth point. Let us assume that there is a zero nominal interest rate bound. Even if that is the case, as long as long-term inflation expectations are meaningfully positive, the real interest rate will fall below the natural rate of interest, which is around 0 percent, by making the real interest rate negative. In this case, monetary policy should be effective, and Japan's economy should be able to get out of deflation equilibrium. This suggests that, if long-term inflation expectations are at least around 1 percent, monetary policy can be more effective.  C. Relationship with Japan's Financial Crisis Looking back, if Japan's financial crisis in the late 1990s had been settled more promptly with ample liquidity provision and capital injection, the large-scale credit crunch could have been avoided, and thus the subsequent path of Japan's economy might have been different. This widely shared lesson was put to good use at the time of the global financial crisis afterwards. I note that it is important to address the private sector's solvency problem through provision of a massive scale of liquidity and through credit enhancement by means of swift capital injection.  In Japan, the bailout of financial institutions with taxpayers' money experienced a strong backlash from the public. It took a considerable amount of time before public funds were actually injected into financial institutions. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the injection of public funds was carried out several times. However, it actually took several years before concern about the stability of the financial system subsided (Chart 10).                                                     8 It also can be said that the resumption of base pay increases under the Abe administration might prove that long-term inflation expectations have started to rise from 0 percent. 
6 It was only after the introduction of the zero interest rate policy in 1999 and the introduction of quantitative monetary easing in 2001 that the market's liquidity concern was alleviated through the Bank's provision of ample funds (Charts 11-1 and 11-2).9  Quantitative monetary easing was a pioneering attempt in increasing the predictability of monetary policy. It was conducted both by lowering market interest rates to virtually 0 percent through the provision of ample funds surpassing the required reserves and by introducing forward guidance. Nevertheless, I have a feeling that the Bank could have addressed liquidity concern in the late 1990s at a much earlier stage. In that regard, I somewhat have understanding toward the criticism that the Bank's monetary easing was insufficient at that time, and as a result the financial crisis was prolonged and the economy fell into a deflationary trap.10  I also note that the Bank paid particular attention to the negative feedback loop between asset price deflation and the real economy. It did not pay due attention to mild deflation for a long period. In fact, the Bank repeatedly explained that the deflation was mild and the economy was not falling into a deflationary spiral, unlike at the time of the Great Depression in the 1930s.11  It is true that the Bank's provision of ample funds and the government's capital injection helped avoid a deflationary spiral, although these were somewhat delayed. Long-term inflation expectations were declining, but not much attention was paid by the Bank or those in academia to their potential effects on monetary policy.                                                     9 In response to Japan's financial crisis in the 1990s, the Bank expanded its balance sheet and conducted both funds-supplying and funds-absorbing operations -- i.e., it actively provided funds to money markets and at the same time absorbed excess reserves by selling bills. However, this does not mean that the Bank provided excess reserves and allowed the decline in market interest rates to 0 percent. After all, there was no such concept of quantitative easing at that time. 10 Another significant lesson was that the excessive monetary easing before the financial crisis was the source of the huge economic bubble. In the United States as well, large-scale monetary easing after the bursting of the IT bubble and subsequent moderate tightening at a measured pace became the source of the housing bubble, which led to the global financial crisis. 11 See Bank of Japan (2006). 
7 With hindsight, the Bank at least should have clarified its firm determination not to allow the decline in long-term inflation expectations, as was done by the Federal Reserve after the global financial crisis and by the European Central Bank after the sovereign debt crisis.  D. Relationship with Labor Market Reform In my view, as a measure to raise long-term inflation expectations that already have declined to a low level, it is important to have structural policies, particularly labor market reform.  If long-term inflation expectations have some kind of relevance to the potential growth rate, it is necessary to raise both at the same time. To this end, one important measure is labor market reform. If such reform leads to rises in labor productivity and the labor force participation rate, the potential growth rate will increase from a longer-term perspective and firms' expected rates of return and households' permanent income also will increase. This will strengthen monetary easing effects and the inflation rate will increase. Then, the adaptive formation mechanism of inflation expectations, which is unique to Japan, will bring about a positive influence on long-term inflation expectations.  In Japan, some labor market practices could be constraints on raising long-term inflation expectations. Therefore, labor market reform should be actively pursued. Given that there is an increasing sense of labor shortage caused by the population decline, now is an ideal time to take a step forward in labor market reform. I will next focus on three possible reform measures.  First, a more flexible adjustment mechanism should be implemented in Japan's labor market. Let me elaborate on this point. The way people form their expectations could be affected by how labor market adjustments are made during periods of recession -- i.e., whether to have quantity adjustments in terms of headcount or price adjustments in terms of wages. For example, in the U.S. labor market, quantity adjustments are mainly made in the form of layoffs. Japan's labor market mostly makes price adjustments and layoffs tend to be avoided (Chart 12).  
8 Let me add a few things about wage adjustments in Japan. In the face of the past shocks, including oil crises during early 1970s and 1980s, Japan's labor unions had a practice of prioritizing the job security of regular workers and accepting management's proposal to set lower wages. Under such coordination between labor and management, restraining wage increases of regular workers was effective in controlling inflation. Afterwards, the base pay of regular workers significantly shifted downward following Japan's financial crisis, and then became sticky at low levels. Since then, non-regular workers have acted as a buffer against wage adjustments as they are outside the protection of labor unions.  As illustrated, Japanese-style employment and wage practices of prioritizing the job security of regular workers and restraining wage increases may have influenced long-term inflation expectations to shift downward. If that is the case, the solution is to implement dynamic U.S.-style employment practices and allow the compensation of regular workers to reflect risk premiums.  I note that, in Japan's labor market, job mobility and a social safety net are not necessarily sufficient. In this situation, the U.S.-style employment system is unlikely to be socially acceptable. In fact, it has been difficult to reach a consensus between labor and management, and thus progress in labor market reform has been moderate.  I believe that a key to success in labor market reform is to implement dynamic U.S.-style employment practices while modifying them to fit Japan's own circumstances. For example, it is important to gain the understanding of labor unions by establishing a social safety net that leads to economic growth. One option is to build a framework for employment and reemployment assistance in coordination with the government, labor, and management.  Second, a forward-looking wage negotiation system should be established. Let me elaborate on this point. In Japan's wage negotiations, the observed rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) of the previous year is used as a benchmark in determining the rate of increase in wages for the following year (Chart 13). For this reason, even when a decline in the CPI is attributed to external factors, including a decline in crude oil prices, the low inflation rate tends to be referred to in wage negotiations. That said, such a price decline is a 
9 positive factor in corporate profits with an improvement in the terms of trade at a macroeconomic level.12  In my view, it is necessary to replace the existing practice of referring to the observed CPI in the past and negotiating the wage increases for only one year in an adaptive manner. Instead, it is necessary to implement the practice of negotiating wage increases for several years in a forward-looking manner by sharing the outlook on the path of price changes over several years, or over the medium to long term.13  Third, there should be a change in the practice of applying the result of labor-management wage negotiations at large manufacturers to other industries. In Japan, the result of wage negotiations at large manufacturers -- especially automobile, steel, and other major manufacturers -- tends to be used as a benchmark for such negotiations in other industries, including non-manufacturing. Therefore, even when the terms of trade at a macroeconomic level improve due to the yen's appreciation, if a higher yen causes major manufacturers to have lower profits and depress the rate of wage increases, such a rate for non-manufacturers also tends to be depressed accordingly.  In Japan, the share of manufacturing in gross output is less than 20 percent. Therefore, it is not suitable at this time to use wages at major manufacturers as a benchmark for wage negotiations in other industries. I believe that wage increases should reflect individual firms' profits with forward-looking inflation expectations being used as a basis.  III. Addendum: Recent Discussion on Fiscal Policy Measures The roles of fiscal policy measures have regained attention in Japan recently, following the insufficient increase in expectations even with the large-scale unconventional monetary                                                    12 The Bank has conducted a quantitative analysis on this point. See Appendix 4, Bank of Japan (2016). 13 The Japanese government also recognizes the importance of forward-looking wage negotiations. At the Council for the Realization of Work Style Reform, Prime Minister Abe has asked the business community for wage increases that take inflation expectations into consideration. 
10 policy. "Helicopter money" and the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) are examples of this (Chart 14).  The issue they have in common is whether or not additional fiscal expenditure will exert positive effects on the way people form their positive expectations in a sustainable manner. Households do not act as rationally as Ricardian equivalence assumes. Meanwhile, it also is plausible to assume that their concerns over possible tax hikes and an increase in social security tax burden provide a reason for their cautious outlook. These arguments might have given rise to the idea that it is desirable to have permanent fiscal policy expansion without an accompanying future tax hike.  Even if government debts are assumed to be financed in the future through inflation that will be triggered by fiscal expansion, empirical research on related theoretical models is still insufficient. Therefore, the models cannot be applied to the actual policy formulation, nor used as the basis for macroeconomic forecast for such formulation.  Economic policy is implemented based on a critical decision that takes account of more than just gains and losses for various economic entities. This is because it is difficult to obtain the consent of stakeholders based on an economic model that considers future inflation to be inevitable but cannot predict when it will occur. Let me also note that actual policy management cannot help being prudent. The reason for this is that the policy authorities have to strongly recognize various constraints. In fact, macroeconomic policy is managed under various constraints -- such as those in terms of legal, accounting, and practical affairs, as well as the need for parliamentary consent.  Concluding Remarks I will close by noting the lesson learned from the 4-year experience since the introduction of QQE. Once long-term inflation expectations decline, it is not easy to raise them, even through the large-scale unconventional monetary policy. Given that monetary policy on its own has limited effects, it is vital to make steady efforts, such as through the labor market reform that I discussed earlier, in order to change conservative inflation expectations that 
11 are deeply rooted in people's mindsets. In particular, I consider it important to produce a change in the wage determination mechanism.  In the process of wage determination, it is desired that inflation targets set by central banks be the basis for the medium- to long-term path of inflation. For this purpose, central banks' inflation targets should gain sufficient credibility with the public. To this end, it is necessary to see achievements that prove monetary policy is able to change the inflation trend. It is not easy to regain credibility. As the frontrunner in combating deflation, however, the Bank of Japan will continue to endeavor to do so, always deliberating on what can be accomplished through monetary policy.  Thank you.

François Villeroy de Galhau: The future of the finance industry -between austerity and innovationSpeech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at the SüddeutscheZeitung Finance Day 2017, Frankfurt am Main, 22 March 2017.*   *   *I am grateful to Marine Dujardin and Banque de France and ACPR staff for their assistance inpreparing these remarks.It is a great pleasure to be with you today and I’d like to thank you sincerely for inviting me.I am here in Frankfurt as a committed European and as a friend of Germany; and not justbecause I travel here at least once a fortnight for the meetings of the ECB Governing Council! Ona more personal level, I am French but my roots are in Saarland. My family has lived there sincethe end of the 18th century and its porcelain manufacturing company Villeroy & Boch is part ofthe German “Mittelstand”.But today, to discuss the future of the finance industry, I’m going to be talking in my capacity as amember of the Governing Council and President of the French supervisory authority (the ACPR,which I’m sure some of you know). First I would first to say a few words on the Eurosystem’smonetary policy and our latest decisions. Then I’ll share with you my thoughts on how to respondto the current challenges facing the finance industry. This is not a side issue for central bankers,as we are now in charge of financial stability as well as price stability. Moreover, a robust andprofitable financial sector is one of the prerequisites for the proper transmission of our monetarypolicy.1. Where do we stand in the euro area with respect to monetary policy?I am fully aware of the heated debate here in Germany surrounding our monetary policy.A debate that is fully legitimate, but let us try to keep it rational, and avoid getting emotional. “MehrLicht!” (more light!) if you allow me to quote Goethe’s last words. This is exactly what I would liketo do today: to shed light on our reasons and our progress.As you know, the ECB was shaped according to the model of the Bundesbank, and I do believethat the Eurosystem’s collective monetary policy is very much aligned with the German valuesthat I fully share and admire: independence, respect of the Treaties, price stability and a long-term approach. As price stability is the mission entrusted to us by the European Treaties, wehave a duty to make it our primary focus. Price stability means an inflation rate of close to, butbelow, 2% over the medium-term. This has been our definition since 2003, and it is a definitionthat most central banks in developed countries share – what Jean-Claude Trichet rightly termsas “a great convergence". So our inflation targeting in the euro area is nothing new or specific;and our present monetary policy is not some uncontrolled Latin flight of fancy.In practice, the euro area experienced a remarkable period of price stability up until the crisis. Butas of 2013, inflation dropped well below the 2% mark. Our mandate meant we had to react inorder to bring inflation back to healthier levels for our economies. And we are clearly progressingtowards our objectives. Our monetary policy works; the measures we have put in place since2014 have already been successful.First, [slide 2] we have warded off the mortal danger of deflation, and inflation is graduallyrecovering in the euro area. Headline inflation peaked at 2% last month, up from –0.2% in April2016. The sharp – and partly temporary – uptick at the beginning of this year is mainly due to therebound in energy and food prices, as underlying inflation remains below 1% (and 1.2% in 1 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
Germany). However underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually to 1.8% in 2019. We arereasonably confident that both headline and underlying inflation will converge, close to our targetin 2019; and this convergence, which is not often stressed, is a key element in our forecasts, asit is crucial to the mid-term sustainability​ of the inflation path.Second, our accommodative monetary policy has ensured very favourable financial conditions:lending to firms and households has continued to grow in the euro area, although at a reasonablepace – +2.3% for firms and +2.2% for households in January 2017 – and borrowing costs havesignificantly declined. Third, [slide 3] the economic recovery is firming and broadening.Fortunately, this appears to be a worldwide trend: our G20 communiquéin Baden-Baden last week started with the words “We met at a time when the global economicrecovery is progressing", while also stressing that significant risks and uncertainties remain.Euro area monetary policy has played its part in this recovery, and the latest ECB staffprojections foresee higher GDP growth for the region, at 1.8% in 2017. The euro areaunemployment rate dropped to 9.6% in January of this year, its lowest level since 2009. And therecovery is also broadening across euro area countries, including in France: despite sometemporary political uncertainty generated by the upcoming elections, France’s economic outlookis improving. The country has also not been inactive over the past few years when it comes toreforms: pensions have been reformed, corporate charges have been cut considerably, andlabour laws have been made more flexible. Like you, I would like France to pick up the pace ofreform; I say it frequently in my own country. But you shall not regard your French neighbour as“unreformable”. These reforms are crucial, as monetary policy can obviously not be theonly game in town, and less and less so as we progressively close the output gap.Now, the question that comes to mind, especially here in Germany, is: given this progress,should we stop pursuing an accommodative monetary policy? At this stage, the answer is clearlyno. Without monetary stimulus, the recovery in inflation would not yet be self-sustained ordurable throughout the euro area. That is why we are maintaining an accommodative stancewhile adapting its intensity. Regarding this intensity, we decided to cut our monthly assetpurchases by €20bn – from €80bn to €60bn – starting next month.We did not deem it necessary to launch a new series of targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTROs) after the last one today. And we – including Mario Draghi and myself –clearly stressed the limits of negative interest rates. Let me add the following: I often read comments describing our debate within the GoverningCouncil as a “predetermined” one, between the hawks on one side and the doves on the other. Idon’t think this is accurate: in all our monetary policy decisions, what I believe matters is to take apragmatic approach, based on a thorough assessment of the present economic environment inthe euro area and of the specific structure of its financing channels.This is why our forward guidance now is this one, based on our current information. But what weclearly did is to give the financial and economic sectors visibility over our monthly purchasevolume for the whole of 2017.2. What are the challenges facing the finance industry and how should we tackle them?A healthy financial sector is key for a robust economic recovery. I’d like to remind you of thesignificant progress that has been made in this area since the financial crisis. We shouldn’t judgethe European financial sector only on the basis of its difficult cases, or those “trailing at the rear”.On average, the sector is now far more resilient than before the crisis. This is the result ofconsiderable work carried out to strengthen regulation and to harmonise supervision in the euroarea, notably with the Banking Union which is a significant step forward. It also comes from theindustry’s remarkable efforts: European banks are now in a much stronger position than adecade ago, in terms of capital, liquidity or risk-taking. Regarding their capital for instance, the 2 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of significant euro area banking groups has risen from less than 7%in 2008 to more than 14% today. Overall, banks are now less risky, and investors should takeinto account this progress by reducing their expected rates of return: banks’ cost of equity shouldgo down.However, while solvency has improved, there is still one challenge facing Europeanbanks: profitability [slide 4]. The average return on equity varies significantly across countries –and France ranks among those with the most solid in the euro area – but on average it hasstagnated at around 5%. This situation raises three questions, about three possible factors: lowrates, non-performing loans and the digital transformation.The first factor, and the one most frequently mentioned, although sometimes to excess, is thelow interest rate environment. Insurers and pension funds with a high level of fixed rateguarantees may suffer. As for banks, their net margins have been squeezed by the low interestrates and the flattening of the yield curve. However this question needs to be examined from allangles [slide 5]. Monetary policy has also had offsetting effects: lending volumes have picked upagain; banks have booked significant capital gains; the cost of risk has fallen as borrowersolvency has improved; the cost of funding including market and ECB financing has becomecheaper. All in all, the overall impact of our non-standard monetary policy measures on bankprofitability is expected to be modest for the period 2014–17. Furthermore, nominal interest ratesare slightly on the rise since the turning point in August 2016, and nominal rates are the ones –not real ones – which matter for bank profitability, as well as the slope of the yield curve.The second factor putting pressure on profitability is the level of non-performing loans [slide6]. This is not a widespread issue: the average NPL ratio is 5.4% in the European Union as ofSeptember 2016, and in many countries, including France and Germany, it is below 4%. But it isa challenge which seriously affects specific banks in certain countries, mainly Italy and Portugal.So this challenge is manageable, but it needs to be actually managed: the quicker the better.Recent initiatives by Italian authorities are a step in the right direction, with the active involvementof European supervisory authorities.Third factor: the digital transformation. It is true that digitalisation is disrupting traditionalcustomer relationship models. But it also creates opportunities: for instance, more diverse andaccessible financial services, more complete customer satisfaction, greater valorisation of data.Yet, in order to succeed in the digital transition, financial companies need first to place innovationat the heart of their strategic management; and second to examine ways of transforming theirbusiness models, mainly in Retail. Obviously these are difficult choices that need to be made bythe companies themselves. The strategic way forward is not up to regulators, and will not beuniform. That said, let me share some thoughts with you.On the income side, the response could be twofold: diversifying the range of services – bothproprietary and via partnerships – that are offered to customers; and adjusting existing pricingpolicies, with fewer flat-rate prices and more pricing by use. On the costs side, the digitaltransition involves preparing for shifts in jobs and in skills, through enhanced dialogue with socialpartners. Moreover, it calls for major IT investment aimed at providing services that remainaligned with customer needs, reducing structural costs and improving regulatory compliance. ITsystems will need to be – and this is far from simple – more secure so that they provide strongprotection against cyber-risks, but at the same time more flexible and open to interconnectivity. Our duty as regulators in this revolution is obviously not to discourage innovation, but to ensure alevel playing field with FinTechs – taking into account their lifecycle according to a “proportionalityprinciple” – and still more tomorrow with bigger data platforms, be they GAFAs or theirequivalents. This level playing field will have to apply for capital or liquidity requirements, forprudential supervision as well as for data protection: if you play the same game, you have to obeythe same rules. 3 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
In addition to adjustments to business models, cross-border bank consolidations in the euro areawould also help tackle this efficiency issue. The Banking Union provides both the justification andthe framework for such a financial integration – we still lag far behind the American market in thisrespect. Cross-border consolidations on a sound and safe basis would make banks better ableto diversify their risks across the euro area, and channel savings more effectively towardsinvestments across borders.As regulators, we obviously have a part to play in helping the finance industry adapt.We should strive to reduce uncertainties as much as possible.One source of uncertainty today is the regulatory framework. Nearly ten years after the crisis, ourpriority must be to stabilise the rules. The main elements of the Basel III package have alreadybeen approved in 2010–11 and have largely entered into force. But there are still ongoingdiscussions regarding the measurement of risk on bank balance sheets. The objective, as youknow, is to reduce the unwarranted variability of results between banks and across jurisdictions.And as the German G20 reiterated last week, the completion of reforms must not result in a“significant increase in overall capital requirements”. We have not yet reached an agreement.Thanks to our mobilisation and that of our European partners, we have avoided a bad agreement.For the coming months then, our objective is to reach a good one.Another source of uncertainty is Brexit. With article 50 about to be triggered, we obviously cannotprejudge the outcome of the future negotiations. But it is essential to bear one principle in mind:in the single market, you cannot separate access and rules. In financial services in particular,you can hardly expect to have a European passport if you don’t accept the single market’s rules.Let us be clear: we are saddened by Brexit, and we are not the ones who have decided to have aso-called “clean Brexit". But if this is the case, then there can be no cherry-picking, no “Europe ala carte”, no “Rosinenpickerei”.It has been nearly ten years since the global financial and economic crisis. We have come salong way, but there are still challenges ahead of us for the ten years to come. Yet the challengesfor the financial industry are gradually changing in nature: they could shift from adapting to theregulatory or monetary policy environment to reflecting on new business model strategies. In thisregard, the expected strengthening of the economic recovery will hopefully make the pathsmoother. Austerity – or rigour – will remain necessary, but innovation will be the game changer.Thank you for your attention. 4 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches

Benoît Cœuré: Independence and accountability in a changingworldIntroductory remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank, at the Transparency International EU Event "Two sides of the same coin?Independence and accountability of the European Central Bank", Brussels, 28 March 2017.*   *   *General considerationsThank you for your invitation to today’s event. I am looking forward to a discussion with a panelrepresenting such a wide range of stakeholders and views.The ECB fully shares the values that underpin Transparency International’s work, such asintegrity and accountability. At a time when many people are expressing doubts about publicinstitutions, it is clear that these principles are vital for their legitimacy. And we are convincedthat greater responsibility and integration at euro area level, which are much needed tostrengthen our Economic and Monetary Union, should go hand in hand with greater democraticaccountability.So Transparency International’s work regarding the EU’s economic governance is certainlyuseful. This is why the ECB has facilitated this project by inviting the researchers to a series ofmeetings with senior staff. We were offered the opportunity to comment on the draft of the report.But as the study and its recommendations are entirely owned by Transparency International, weexclusively provided factual observations and abstained from commenting on the substance.Before offering some observations on the four chapters of the report – independence,transparency, accountability and integrity – I would like to make two preliminary, more generalremarks:First, and to answer the question raised in the title of the report: yes, for the ECBindependence and accountability are two sides of the same coin. The ECB was given ademocratic mandate. Independence ensures that the ECB can act in line with itsmandate. Accountability, on the other hand, ensures that the ECB does act in line with itsmandate. This can be measured ex post against outcomes – the ECB did indeed takedecisive action to preserve price stability during the crisis – and it relies ex ante on having astrong accountability framework.Second, the ECB is quite unique in the EU institutional context. I understand thatTransparency International has published similar reports on the European Investment Bankand the European Stability Mechanism. There are important differences between the threebodies – not only as regards their mandate and purpose, but also in terms of theirinstitutional setup, governance structures, funding and, in this context more importantly,accountability. Of course, we are an EU institution (like the European Parliament or theEuropean Commission). But we are also a central bank and, as of 2014, a bankingsupervisor. These specific tasks require a dedicated governance framework considered socrucial by the EU legislators that it was laid down in the EU Treaty and, as regards bankingsupervision, in the regulation establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).In my remarks I will cover each aspect of the report briefly.IndependenceIn the European Union, the principle of central bank independence has a quasi-constitutionalbasis. Article 108 of the Treaty establishing the European Community states that: “neither the123 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
ECB, nor a national central bank … shall seek or take instructions from Community institutionsor bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body”.Looking at the debate around independence, which is also taking place outside the EU, itbecomes clear that safeguarding our independence requires more than a series of legalprovisions.It requires an explanation of why independence is important for a central bank. As guardians ofprice stability in the euro area, the ECB creates the foundation for a healthy and stable Europeaneconomy. Independence is essential in that respect, as it protects the ECB from any temptationby governments to seek changes in monetary policy to favour short-term economic gains overprice stability, or to pander to private interest groups.It is equally important to correct misperceptions, and all stakeholders do have a responsibility inthis respect. The ECB communicates clear conditions for accepting credit institutions ascounterparts, for quality of collateral, for emergency liquidity assistance extended by nationalcentral banks so as not to interfere with monetary policy, for accepting securities under its assetpurchase programme, etc. These conditions are transparent and equal for all counterparties inthe euro area. Therefore, the ECB does not aim for political buy in, it merely clarifies theconditions which govern its monetary policy for all euro area countries, and this is needed toensure that it stays within its mandate and, thus, to safeguard its independence.As for the ECB’s current role in the macroeconomic adjustment programmes, this is enshrinedin a legal framework that is not for the ECB to alter. We believe that financial issues are wherethe ECB’s advice is of particular relevance. If there were political willingness to change theframework, we would be happy to engage and, based on our experience, help clarify how best tosupport the other institutions while safeguarding our independence.AccountabilityIndependence does not mean arbitrariness. The ECB was given a democratic mandate. It is heldaccountable for acting in line with this mandate, both democratically and legally.From a democratic perspective, the ECB is accountable for its policies to the representation ofEU citizens. As described in the Report, the ECB’s President participates in quarterly hearings ofthe Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament. As MEP Tremosai Balcells knows very well, these are not “dialogues de sourds”. The MEPs do not shy away fromasking critical questions. As the President emphasised at his September 2016 hearing, the ECBtakes these exchanges very seriously.In addition to the regular quarterly hearings, my Executive Board colleagues and I also participatein hearings of this Committee to explain the ECB’s reasoning and decisions on specific topics.Just last year, I visited the European Parliament twice to discuss the proposal for a euro areabudgetary capacity and the ECB’s involvement in Greece.In about ten days’ time the ECB, as it does every year, will publish its Annual Report and theVice-President will present it before the European Parliament. Later in the year, the President willalso attend the plenary debate on it, which precedes the Parliament adopting its official positionon our activities.This European Parliament Resolution is an important contribution for our work, as it summarisesthe views of the representatives of the European people on our actions and policies, also in thefields of independence, transparency, accountability and integrity. We take the EuropeanParliament’s comments and suggestions very seriously.I could continue with other examples showing the health of the relationship between the456 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
European Parliament and the ECB: from the Governing Council decision to adopt principles thatincrease transparency in developing ECB regulations on European statistics, to the ECB’sreadiness to discuss questions on the work it is engaged in in the Basel Committee, of coursewithin the confines imposed by confidentiality requirements. And I could mention the separateaccountability channels foreseen with the establishment of ECB Banking Supervision, based onthe Interinstitutional Agreement (2013/694/EU) between the European Parliament and the ECB.Last week, the Chair of the ECB Supervisory Board was at the European Parliament to presentthe ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities 2016.Of course, I leave it to MEP Tremosa i Balcells to express the Parliament’s judgement on therobustness of our accountability framework towards the Parliament. From the ECB’sperspective, our accountability framework as defined in the Treaty is working well, and has beenadapted to the challenges we have faced in recent years by expanding our interactions whereand when necessary.TransparencyTransparency is crucial to the ECB’s work and it attaches great importance to communicatingeffectively with the public. Transparency helps people understand the ECB’s monetary policy,and better public understanding, in turn, makes the ECB’s monetary policy more credible andeffective.Against this background, communication with financial market participants deserves particularattention. I see it as a double-edged sword. Clear communication with financial marketsenhances the implementation and transmission of monetary policy, but on the other hand it mayrisk central banks being captured by private interests, or worse, disclosing privileged information.And even the perception of such risks would be harmful.Please allow me to present some examples.The European Central Bank has made significant progress on matters of transparency and goodgovernance. This was noted by the European Ombudsman, who commended the ECB foradopting the “Guiding principles for external communication by members of the Executive Board”and “encourage[d] it to lead the field on all aspects of good governance”. The Ombudsman moregenerally acknowledged, when presenting her Annual Report for 2015 to the EuropeanParliament, that the ECB has “boosted its transparency”.The Guiding Principles provide a more concrete and very practical expression of the rules thatare already binding on Executive Board members. They enshrine the ECB’s approach toensuring that financial market-sensitive information is not disclosed to select groups and avoidinggiving the impression that an event organiser has a “prestige advantage” allowing it to benefitfinancially from the perception of exclusive contacts with the members of the Executive Board.The Guiding Principles also advise the Executive Board members to include, as a matter ofprinciple, an ECB staff member in bilateral meetings. These principles have also beensubscribed to by the Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board and the other ECB Representativesto the Supervisory Board.In addition, the members of the Governing Council (including the Executive Board members)observe a “quiet period” before monetary policy meetings. This means they avoid makingcomments or attending meetings that could influence expectations about monetary policydecisions in the seven days before a scheduled meeting on this issue. This also coversmeetings with the media, market participants or any other outside parties with interests inmonetary policy matters.As you probably know, the Executive Board Members – including myself – as well as the Chair ofthe Supervisory Board have been publishing their diaries since November 2015. I find that the7 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
diaries provide a very comprehensive overview of our interactions with external parties; theycover all our professional meetings with the private and public sectors (at national andinternational level). No other EU institution – including via the Transparency Register – or centralbank provides such extensive information in terms of transparency.The ECB has also established high-level fora such as the Institutional Investor Dialogue and theBanking Industry Dialogue to collect relevant market intelligence from stakeholders in atransparent way. These fora are underpinned by a published charter that sets out theparticipation rules; the agendas and meeting summaries are also published. This makes theECB’s interactions in terms of gathering information from stakeholders highly transparent for thepublic.Since January 2015 the ECB has also been publishing regular accounts of the GoverningCouncil’s monetary policy discussions. They contain an overview of financial market, economicand monetary developments, followed by a summary of the discussion, in an unattributed form,on the economic and monetary analyses and on the monetary policy stance. In doing so, we aimto provide the rationale behind monetary policy decisions and enable anyone who is interested toread the Governing Council’s assessment of the economy within a short period of time after thediscussion takes place.IntegrityHowever, independence, accountability and transparency are not enough if they are not flankedby a robust integrity system. Or as Mario Draghi put it in an address to staff: a stronger businessculture has to be complemented by a stronger ethical culture.An enhanced ECB Ethics Framework applicable to all staff members became effective inJanuary 2015, and a dedicated Compliance and Governance Office was established toimplement this new framework, among other tasks. Mandatory ethics training for all staffmembers should further enhance our strong ethical culture. Moreover, a high-level EthicsCommittee has been established to advise Governing Council, Executive Board and SupervisoryBoard members on conduct matters.In my view the ECB’s Ethics Framework is probably the strictest of any EU institution or centralbank. All our staff members – including Executive Board members – need to provide a list of theirbank accounts and powers of attorney conferred on them by third parties, to facilitate regularcompliance checks of their private financial transactions by our external auditor.While we are convinced of the robustness of our Ethics Framework, such frameworks must, ofcourse, be regularly reviewed against international best practice. The review of ourwhistleblowing regime is just one example in that regard.Concluding remarksLet me conclude. While we certainly have to strive constantly for improvements, I believe onehas to admit that the ECB has made tremendous efforts and indeed made significant progress instrengthening its accountability, boosting its transparency and further enhancing its integritymechanisms and good governance.The ECB is, and has always been, open to a balanced dialogue with stakeholders, including thegeneral public, and strives to keep up to date with fast-evolving communication practices, suchas Q&A sessions on Twitter.This study, containing interviews of ECB senior managers and the report by TransparencyInternational, is indeed a good example of how the ECB engages in a balanced dialogue withdiverse representatives. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
As mentioned earlier, we are convinced that independence requires accountability, and thataccountability requires transparency. Integrity is a foundation of any good administration.We are confident about what we have achieved, but as central bankers we are always “vigilant”and never complacent.Thank you for listening, and I look forward to hearing your views.See The future of the euro areaSee “The Five Presidents’ Report: Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union”, 22 June 2015.A more detailed discussion of the measures taken during the crisis can be found in B.

Guy Debelle: The FX Global Code of Conduct – final phaseSpeech by Mr Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the FX Week(Australia) 2017 Conference, Sydney, 28 March 2017.*   *   *Today I am going to talk about the FX Global Code. The Code is on track to be released in twomonths’ time on 25 May. This is a culmination of two years’ effort, involving considerable inputfrom a sizeable number of foreign exchange market participants, both public and private. Today Iwill reiterate the motivation for the work we have been doing on the Code, why you all should beinterested in it, and then update you on where we are at with the process and outline the wayforward.As I hope most of you know, Phase 1 of the Code was launched in May last year in NewYork. The Code is pretty easy to find. It is available via the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) website or on the website of a number of foreign exchange committees (FXCs), includingthe Australian Foreign Exchange Committee (AFXC) website. The text of the complete Code willbe available in the same places from 25 May, following its public release.Why is the work going on? As I have stated before, the foreign exchange (FX) industry has beensuffering from a lack of trust in its functioning. This lack of trust is evident both betweenparticipants in the market and, at least as importantly, between the public and the market. Themarket needs to move toward a more favourable and desirable location, and allow participants tohave much greater confidence that the market is functioning appropriately.A well-functioning FX market is very much in the interest of all market participants. This clearlyincludes central banks, both in their own role as market participants but also as the exchangerate is an important channel of monetary policy transmission. In a globalised world, the foreignexchange market is one of the most vital parts of the financial plumbing.The Code sets out global principles of good practice in the FX market to provide a common setof guidance to the market, including in areas where there is a degree of uncertainty about whatsort of practices are acceptable, and what are not. This should help to restore confidence andpromote the effective functioning of the wholesale FX market.To that end, one of the guiding principles underpinning our work is that the Code should promotea robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent market. A diverse set of buyers and sellers, supportedby resilient infrastructure, should be able to confidently and effectively transact at competitiveprices that reflect available market information and in a manner that conforms to acceptablestandards of behaviour.The work to develop the Code commenced two years ago, in May 2015, when the BIS Governorscommissioned a working group of the Markets Committee of the BIS (which I chaired until earlyJanuary this year) to facilitate the establishment of a single global code of conduct for thewholesale FX market and to come up with mechanisms to promote greater adherence to theCode. Our group comprises representatives of the central banks of all the major FX centres. Mycolleague Matt Boge at the RBA has contributed enormous time and effort to the project.This work is also very much a public sector–private sector partnership. We have been ably andvigorously supported in this work by a group of market participants, chaired by David Puth, CEOof CLS. David’s group contains people from all around the world on the buy side, includingcorporates and asset managers, and the sell side, along with trading platforms, ECNs and non-bank participants, drawing from the various FXCs and beyond. Hugh Killen from Westpac hasbeen the representative from Australia on David’s group. All parts of the market have been123 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
involved in the drafting of the Code to make sure all perspectives are heard and appropriatelyreflected.There are two important points worth highlighting: first, it’s a single code for the whole industryand second, it’s a global code.On the first point, the Code is supplanting the existing codes that have been present in the FXmarket, including the ACI model code that is used in Australia. The ACI has recently confirmed itsintention to utilise the FX Global Code and will make it a prerequisite for members to commit toadherence to the FX Global Code.Importantly, the Code covers all of the wholesale FX industry. This is not a code for just the sellside. It is there for the sell side, the buy side, non-bank participants and the platforms; its breadthis both across the globe and across the whole structure of the industry.Hence the Code is relevant for all of you here at this conference. The way it is relevant willdepend on your engagement with the market. On the buy side it will also help to give youguidance as to what you can reasonably expect from your counterparty as you transact your FXbusiness. What this means in practice is that the steps different market participants take to aligntheir activities with the principles of the Code will necessarily reflect the size, complexity, typeand extent of their engagement with the FX market.As I mentioned earlier, the first phase of the Code was released in May 2016. It covered areassuch as ethics, information sharing, aspects of execution and confirmation and settlement. Thesecond phase covers further aspects of execution including e-trading and platforms, primebrokerage, as well as governance, and risk management and compliance.We have provided market participants with a number of opportunities to comment on the Code,in addition to receiving the direct input of the Market Participants Group led by David Puth. Overthe past few months, drafts of the full text of the Code have been distributed to marketparticipants for their review, principally through the various FXCs, but also through other industryassociations to ensure all perspectives are appropriately reflected in the Code. Through thisprocess, quite a few thousand comments were received.In my view, the text of the Code provides the best and most appropriate guidance we could give,given the sometimes wide range of feedback received, particularly on those small number ofissues that are most controversial in the market. The most obvious example of this is ‘last look’.This issue has generated considerable passionate discussion. I would expect that discussion tocontinue after the release of the Code in May and that the Code might evolve as a function of thatdiscussion. I would like to make the point that if market participants think it would be preferablefor the Code to have gone further, they are welcome to go down that path in their operations. Onthe other hand, it would not be desirable for the converse to occur, namely for marketparticipants practices to fall short of the principles described in the Code.That said, I think it is a good outcome of the process that we were able to distil the points ofcontention down to a small number of (not insignificant) issues. Outside of a small number ofcontentious areas, the feedback was reflective of a widely held consensus. Market participantshave recognised the Code’s aim of helping move the FX market to a better place.I will illustrate that with a couple of the areas that were addressed in the first phase of the Code,which is already in the public domain. One example of this is around information sharing, wheremany market participants highlighted that they are unsure what information can be conveyed tocounterparties and other market participants. While it is clear (or at least should be) thatdisclosing the details of a client’s order book to a counterparty is not acceptable, marketparticipants have noted that there is much less clarity around what level of aggregation, say, isnecessary in order to convey market colour appropriately.4 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
As a result, it appears some market participants are being very conservative in sharinginformation, which can have implications for the effective functioning of the market. This isnotwithstanding the guidance provided in this area in the Global Preamble put out by the globalFXCs, in March 2015. The Global Code takes the material in the Global Preamble and fleshes itout a bit more, including with some examples of what is, and isn’t, appropriate communication,and why.Similarly, there have been diverse opinions around what is appropriate behaviour in terms oforder handling. There have been some very public instances of inappropriate behaviour aroundorder handling that have come to light in recent years. The market is seeking greater guidance asto what principles should be followed, including the different standards that may apply dependingon whether an intermediary is functioning as principal or agent.This is one area that was not adequately covered in the pre-existing codes that the various FXCshad endorsed for the FX market. It is an area where we have provided the sought-after guidance.But we are not writing a procedures manual for order handling. Rather we are articulatingprinciples that need to be taken into account. Individual firms may then take these principles andreflect them in their own procedures manual. Our aim in articulating these principles is to providemarket participants with the framework in which to think about how they handle stop-loss orders.The emphasis here is very much on the word ‘think’. The Global Code will not provide theanswers to all your questions, but it should help you ask the right questions.Adherence to the CodeAlongside drafting the Code, we have also been devoting considerable time and effort to thinkingabout how to ensure widespread adoption of the Code by market participants. Clearly, that hasbeen an issue with the various existing codes that have been in place in a number of marketsover many years. It is evident that they were ignored on occasion, wilfully or otherwise.One of our central aims in drafting the Code is for it to be principles-based rather than rules-based. There are a number of reasons why this is so but, for me, an important reason is that themore prescriptive the Code is, the easier it is to get around. Rules are easier to arbitrage thanprinciples. Moreover, the more prescriptive and the more precise the code, the less people willthink about what they are doing. If it’s principles-based and less prescriptive then, as I just said,market participants will have to think about whether their actions are consistent with theprinciples of the Code.So, we have worked with the industry to produce a principles-based code rather than a set ofprescriptive regulatory standards. It will not impose legal or regulatory obligations on marketparticipants, nor will it supplant existing regulatory standards or expectations. But we do expectthe principles in the Code to be understood and adopted across the entire FX market.Our approach to adherence has a number of dimensions. We laid out our overall approach toadherence to the Code in New York in May last year. We will provide a more comprehensivedescription of the suite of mechanisms to support adherence alongside the release of the Codein May.One critical dimension is market-based adherence mechanisms. An important element ofdiscipline should come from the market itself and we are working closely with market participantson this. The adherence to a voluntary code will only come about if firms judge it to be in theirinterest and take the practical steps to ensure the code is embedded in their practices. Suchpractical steps would include training their staff and putting in appropriate policies andprocedures.We have provided a draft Statement of Commitment for firms to publicly demonstrate theiradherence to the Code. One reason for a public demonstration is that firms are more likely to56 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
adhere to the Code if they believe that their peers are doing so too. That is, an important sourceof pressure to adhere should come from other market participants. Without blaming them forwhat occurred, more scrutiny from counterparties about how their FX transactions were beingexecuted may have helped to reduce the incidence and severity of the market abuses thatoccurred in the past. One reason for this lack of scrutiny was that FX transactions weresometimes regarded as ancillary to the core business, notwithstanding their potential impact onreturns. This attitude seems to be in decline, though it still persists.Ultimately the success of the Code in promoting integrity and restoring confidence in thewholesale FX market lies in the hands of its participants.Another aspect of market-based adherence comes through the FXCs. The Global FXCs issued ajoint statement of support at the launch of the Code in New York as well as stating their intentionto make adherence to the Code a likely requirement of FXC membership. In Australia, acommitment to adhere to the Code will be a requirement for membership of the AFXC. Thatwould ensure the Code is embedded at the core of the FX market, but it is also important that itextends beyond that, and that there is, at the very least, an awareness of it across all marketparticipants.A second dimension of adherence is that the BIS central banks have signalled their commitmentby announcing that they themselves will follow the Code, and that they expect that theircounterparties will do so too. To that end, the RBA will no longer transact in the FX market withthose that don’t commit to adhere to the Code.A third dimension of adherence is that we are talking to regulators in our various jurisdictions asto how they might use the Code in monitoring market conduct. In Australia, the securitiesregulator, ASIC, is very supportive of the development of the Code and is considering how itmight utilise the Code in its market surveillance. In its recent enforceable undertakings againstsome local market participants, ASIC has referred explicitly to the Code. ASIC ‘encouragesmarket participants to adhere to high standards of market practice, including those set out in theGlobal Code’. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering how they mightincorporate the Code in the Senior Managers Regime there.Given that we are only providing the full text of the Code to the market in May, there will be aperiod of time for market participants to adjust their practices where necessary to be in line withthe principles in the Code. Hopefully not much time should be required to do this. This period oftime might potentially be as short as six months, but no more than twelve months for the vastmajority of market participants. How much effort this might require will in part depend on thenature and extent of your engagement with the FX market. In drafting the Code, we have alwayskept the principle of proportionality at front of mind.ConclusionWe are on track to complete the Code so that it will be released in London in May. At the end ofthat process, for the Code to be effective and for it to achieve what we want it to achieve, it willneed to be accepted and endorsed across the full spectrum of market participants. I ask you allas participants in the foreign exchange market to familiarise yourself with the principles of theCode and verify that your operations in the market align with them.That said, the process does not really end, because as the foreign exchange market continues toevolve, the Code will need to evolve with it.The work to date has reflected a very constructive and cooperative effort between the centralbanks and market participants. I would particularly like to acknowledge the enormous time andenergy contributed by David Puth and the Market Participants Group as well as the team of myfellow central bankers. All of us recognise the need to restore the public’s faith in the foreign789 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
exchange market and the value of the Global Code in assisting that process and also in helpingimprove market functioning and confidence in the market.Let me finish with three things to take away with you:Read the FX Global Code when it is released on 25 May.Adapt your business where appropriate to conform to the principles of the Global Code.Ask your FX counterparties whether they are committed to the principles of the Global Code.See <www.bis.org/mktc/fxwg/gc_may16.pdf>.See <afxc.rba.gov.au/>.See <www.bis.org/press/p150511.htm>.See <acifma.com/news-detail?page=1%2C0>.See <www.rba.gov.au/afxc/about-us/pdf/global-preamble.pdf>.See <www.bis.org/mktc/fxwg/am_may16.pdf>.

François Villeroy de Galhau: Franco-German relations -experiences and challenges in the euro eraSpeech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at the Europadialog,organized by the Investitions- und Strukturbank Rheinland-Pfalz (ISB), Mainz, 21 March 2017.*   *   *Madam Minister-President [Ms Dreyer], Madam Finance Minister [Ms Ahnen],Mr Spokesperson [M. Dexheimer], Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to be here with you today in Mainz, and I sincerely thank you for inviting me. On amore personal note, I am here as a committed European and a friend of Germany. I amparticularly attached to the Franco-German friendship: I am French and live in Paris, but myfamily’s roots are in a neighbouring Land, Saarland, where my family has lived since the end ofthe 18th century and where its porcelain manufacturing company Villeroy & Boch forms part ofthe German “Mittelstand”. When I spend my holidays in Saarland and I go north, I admire Trier; oreast, Neustadt an der Weinstraße. And when I come fortnightly to participate in the ECBGoverning Council, I am very close to your beautiful town of Mainz.There is no doubt in my mind that “we, the citizens of the European Union, have united for thebetter”, as stated in the Berlin declaration of 25 March 2007. This was for the 50th anniversary ofthe Treaty of Rome, and this is still just as true four days before we celebrate its60th anniversary. And yet, our unity may appear threatened today: euroscepticism is on the rise,driven by populism throughout Europe; Brexit triumphed in the United Kingdom last June; and thenew American government freely expresses its reservations about the European Union. In thesetimes of turmoil, we mustn’t lower the European flag. Let us remember the formidable progressthat we have made since our two countries decided to share their destinies by signing the Treatyof Rome, along with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Today, in Europe, weshare three major economic assets: the single currency, the single market and our commonsocial model.  We have built them together and we can be proud of them. This will be my firstpoint. For the future, European unity continues to be, in my view, the best answer to all thequestions. And for that, the remarkable friendship between our two countries must continue toinspire us. As Chancellor Konrad Adenauer already stated in 1963: “Imagine, if this friendship[between France and Germany] didn’t exist, any attempt to create Europe would be doomed tofail from the outset.”This will be my second point.I. What we currently share in Europe: our three economic strengths.Let me start by our shared successes. Today, in Europe, we have three major economic assets:the single currency, the single market and our common social model.First asset: the euro. It is a solid currency that is recognised worldwide. The great majority ofeuro area citizens are attached to it: 70% according to the latest Eurobarometer Survey. Andcontrary to certain claims, our monetary policy is not some Latin flight of fancy. It is very much inline with the German values that I fully share: independence, respect of the Treaties, pricestability and a long-term approach. Monetary policy is decided collectively by the GoverningCouncil, and we take the task entrusted to us of ensuring price stability very seriously. Thismeans making sure that inflation is neither too high nor too low: our target is below, but close to2% over the medium term. Our monetary policy has enabled us to prevent the mortal danger ofdeflation that has been threatening the euro area in recent times. Today, inflation is rising again inthe euro area, as we had announced: we have moved from a fall of 0.2% in April 2016 to a rise of12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
2% last month, due somewhat exceptionally to energy prices. Beyond these short-termfluctuations, inflation is expected to stand at 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.Second asset: we share a large single market that belongs collectively to the Member States ofthe European Union. This is a major step forward for European trade. It is no coincidence thatsingle market access is at the centre of the Brexit debate. Naturally, we cannot anticipate theresults of the forthcoming negotiations, but one principle of consistency must be observed:access to the single market must continue to be contingent on the strict observance of all of itsrules. There can be no cherrypicking or free-riding. And we must obviously maintain ourcommon European trade policy if we wish to retain our clout in future trade negotiations at theglobal level.Third asset: our common social model in Europe. It is less widely discussed, but it is whatfundamentally defines continental Europe, and it is what German and French society and publicopinion share. Our social model combines a high level of public service, relatively low levels ofinequality – much lower than in the United States – and a good intensity of social dialogue. Andthis has been achieved in a market economy. I would like to stress the extent to which this socialmarket economy (Soziale Marktwirtschaft) is a response to the questions raised in the Anglo-Saxon world, rather than protectionism: Germany, like many other European countries, provesthat economic success can go hand in hand with social welfare, and less inequality.We can be proud of these three assets that we have built together. But for the future, while someno longer seem to believe in the benefits of the European project, we can no longer afford to becomplacent; we cannot simply rest on our laurels.II. In order to control our common destiny we need to build a better Europe.How should we react? Not by less Europe. This would be a mistake if we want to take collectivecontrol of our destiny in this new world. But by a “better” Europe, less caught up in the detail,more focused on a few key priorities, and more efficient. To achieve this, Europe needs theenergy of Germany and France, and of their remarkable friendship. I will now cite ChancellorHelmut Kohl: “The Germans and French must together build the hard core of the European Union– a union that sees itself not merely as a common market, but as a community of values, ademocracy based on freedom, the rule of law and the social responsibility of theState”. Naturally I won’t talk to you this evening about the French election debate: I will simplysay that as friends of France, you must not underestimate the strength of its institutions. I will talkto you even less about the German election debate. But I strongly believe that after thesedemocratic elections, whatever the outcome, the governments of our two countries will have toconfer to decide on a number of shared bilateral projects, and above all prepare a commoninitiative for Europe. Because for Germany and for France, the other country is certainly the bestpossible partner: there is no serious alternative, neither in the east nor the west for Germany, norin the south for France. And because if our common initiative is not sufficient to reach aEuropean decision – indeed there are other countries and the Commission around the table –, itis nonetheless a prerequisite: without the Franco-German engine, the European car will remainat a stand-still.The projects for a better Europe must be chosen with care and prioritised; and we mustn’t justtalk about them. We must ensure that we have the actual means, through efficient governance,to achieve concrete results. To put it briefly: little, well, until the end. There are naturally somenon-economic areas such as defence, border security, climate change and youth education andtraining – an Erasmus-pro programme should be a priority to put an end to the tragedy of theunqualified and unemployed youth. But, as regards economic matters, much also remains to bedone. As Helmut Schmidt repeated frequently, we must build economic union as well asmonetary union. To my mind, we need to make headway on two projects.3 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
The first project, to be started immediately, is a “Financing Union for Investment andInnovation”. The European Commission launched the Juncker investment Plan and CapitalMarkets Union, and Banking Union is now underway. But it is now necessary to make theseinitiatives converge, in the interest of European savers and firms. Europe needs a better sharingof private sector risk, in order to channel its abundant savings more effectively towardsproductive investment. As Jens Weidmann and I wrote last year, the equity financing ofbusinesses, across European borders, must be a priority. Europe is lagging far behind in thisarea: such financing only represents 67% of GDP in the euro area compared with 125% in theUnited States. Thus, innovation, which is inherently more risky, is less well financed in Europe.The second project, on which we could make progress after the elections that will take place thisyear, is a collective economic strategy in the euro area. I know that when the French talkabout coordination in Europe, the Germans sometimes think that it may be a new way to wriggleout of reforms. This deadlock must be broken: we need both national reforms and a Europeancoordination. Growth and employment would be stronger in Europe with more structural reformswhere they are a priority, such as in France and Italy, and more fiscal or wage support incountries with room for manoeuvre, such as Germany. Regarding reforms, like you, I would likeFrance to pick up the pace; I say it frequently in my own country. But you must not consider thatyour French neighbour is “unreformable”. France has not been immobile over the past few years:pensions have been reformed, corporate charges have been cut considerably, and deficitreduction targets have been met. In practice, in order for this European coordination to exist, theeuro area needs an institution that inspires confidence between countries. This is why I haveproposed, as have others, the creation of a euro area finance minister. This person wouldembody and bring to fruition the shared commitment of our Member States. Conversely, to mymind, the priority is not to create a “transfer union” and a common fiscal capacity.*   *   *Hans-Dietrich Genscher said during a previous European crisis in the the 1980s: “scepticismand pessimism are just as poor advisers as national egoism”. Yes, we all love our country, ourNation. But the Franco-German friendship can be the defence that we need today against thereigning scepticism and pessimism. Friendship is more than a polite end-of-meal platitude, it is asometimes demanding requirement, but always concrete as it is embodied in the projects. Itmust continue to inspire the European project, this singular collective will of which we should beproud. As a central banker, it is naturally not my decision. My responsibility, together with theother euro area governors, is to conduct a monetary policy that is in line with the mandateassigned to us, and to make proposals to render other economic policies more efficient.This is what I have outlined before you with my commitment to Europe.

Sabine Lautenschläger: Digital na(t)ive? Fintechs and the future ofbankingStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, atan ECB Fintech Workshop, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2017.*   *   *We will never know who did it and when exactly it was done – all of that is lost in the mists oftime. But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the mostimportant inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped byinnovations.Some of these innovations have made our life better – just think of vaccines or the telephone.Others have had more ambivalent impact – think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hardto guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.As the President of IBM said in 1943: “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company,he predicted that “the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophicallycollapse.”The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without theinternet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and thisincludes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.It’s true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets forbanking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have receiveda lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, andthey are competing with banks – at least in some parts of the value chain.The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will itcreate new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to getit wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks thiswould be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losingrevenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmentedmarket where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, thefintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing orunidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now thatfintechs have entered the scene.A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeezeprofits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a generalconcern we have.At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat.For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending andcrowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly – banks no longer serve asmiddlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking mightemerge – just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peerlenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will needto deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the FinancialStability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are basedon vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. Butthey have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don’t know how wellthey would work in such situations.In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. Theseare computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending ontheir design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Suchherding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone –banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks anddata theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloudsolutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very awareof the risks.Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious,however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend theirdigital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfytheir needs will become dominant players.There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulatorsand supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course,that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakersshould follow the general principle of “same business, same risks, same rules”. That isimportant.As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on anumber of projects.Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs.In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policyapproach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entireeuro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately andproportionately.We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms tofacilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are twoof the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub forfintechs.We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data oreven entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did acybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up weimplemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs areamong our supervisory priorities.We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshoptoday serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all toshare our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potentialrisks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Suchexchanges are vital.I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible inthe first place!Thank you for your attention. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
William C Dudley: Worthy of trust? Law, ethics and culture inbankingPanel remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, at the Banking Standards Board Panel "Worthy of trust? Law, ethicsand culture in banking", London, 21 March 2017.*   *   *Sarah Bell, Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Thomas Noone, and Joseph Tracy assisted inthe preparation of these remarks.First, let me thank Governor Carney, the Lord Chief Justice, and Dame Colette for including mein today’s discussion.  It is an honor to be here.  As always, what I have to say reflects my ownviews and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal ReserveSystem.I also want to thank the Banking Standards Board for its important work on improving standardsof conduct in financial services.  The effects of this work will, I think, be felt throughout theindustry, not just in the City of London. We learned from the LIBOR and FX scandals that poor conduct can proliferate quicklythroughout the global marketplace.  That’s because short-term thinking—maxing out this year’scompensation bonus or this quarter’s accounting profits—is a catalyst for poor conduct.  Incontrast, good conduct may take longer to catch on.  Good conduct depends on a longer-termframe of reference.  It is building a viable career that one can be proud of, and, at the firm level,building franchise value and reputation that takes decades to accomplish.  In both cases, though,the same enabling mechanism is at work: culture. Culture—within a firm or across an industry—is not determined primarily by rules or laws, thoughcertainly rules and laws can amplify good or bad attributes.  Culture comprises, instead, whatpeople observe and do, resulting in accepted and mostly unspoken norms.  Mostly, people lookfor what succeeds and what does not, and they try to align themselves with the former.If we want to improve culture and conduct, we need to start by being realists about humanbehavior.  At the New York Fed’s culture conference last October, Dame Minouche Shafikobserved pragmatically that an end to all misconduct is not the goal of reform.  There will alwaysbe a few bad apples.  Rather, the goals should be far fewer instances of misconduct and far lessscope, magnitude and duration when such misconduct inevitably occurs.I submit that the best way to keep problems small is to encourage a culture that spots issuesand raises concerns early.  In my view, the most dangerous type of culture in finance occurswhen people see something wrong but do not say something. I think back to the chat room transcripts from the LIBOR and FX scandals.  The way traderscommunicated so openly about their manipulation of markets makes it hard to imagine thatothers in their firms did not know what was happening.  So, why didn’t those people saysomething?There are understandable, human tendencies that can cause each of us to avoid rocking theboat.  People want to be team players.   Those behavioral traits can be amplified through afirm’s culture, which can weigh on one’s willingness to do the right thing.  This is, unfortunately,what seems to have occurred at Wells Fargo, one of the largest retail banks in the UnitedStates.  Whether to obtain a bonus or simply to keep a job, employees felt they had to keep quietand meet sales targets despite the cost to customers.12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
So, how do you change a culture where silence leads to misconduct?  I will offer two ideas thatmight help and one idea that will not. Here is what will not work: Merely telling your employees to speak up.  Cultures do not changesimply by exhortation.  Eloquent speeches, a well-phrased value statement, and an annualrequirement to acknowledge the code of conduct are just not sufficient.That’s the easy one.  The two ideas that might work are harder. First, managers have to lead by example.  Senior executives must be seen within the firm toexpect and respect challenges, and in turn must challenge ideas themselves.  And, they have toexplain difficult decisions to their employees—sharing not only the news of what they have done,but why.  More important, mid-level managers have to do the same.  Of course, mid-levelmanagers will not generally behave that way unless they see their senior leadership setting theexample.Second, if your organization values people when they raise their hand, your incentives have toreflect that.  Employees who speak up should be recognized.  The courage it takes to speak up,despite the perceived costs, should be counted as a very positive factor in evaluations.  And,where raising one’s hand has saved the firm’s money and reputation by avoiding or keeping aproblem small, that action should be rewarded.It’s only natural for an economist like me to consider the issue of unintended consequences. One that comes to mind is creating a culture of distrust and suspicion, where everyone lookingover his or her shoulder.  That would be unfortunate and costly.  But, I think it is more likely that adifferent culture will result. Instead, talented and conscientious people will be happy to remain ata firm or in the industry because their personal and professional values are well aligned.  Suchemployees will feel relief that they can speak up without fear of reprisal, and they can enjoy aclear conscience for having done the right thing.  There is significant value in being able to sleepwell at night.Moreover, being receptive to diverse and dissenting views will likely yield better results. It is in theindustry’s self-interest to deter silence, not only because money will be saved on fines notincurred for misconduct, but also because better ideas will be brought to the table.  I believe thatbusiness performance will benefit from having a culture in which people feel empowered tospeak up.Let me give you a few examples from my own experience at the New York Fed.I want employees to speak up.  That’s why, at the start of my tenure as president, I made it clearthat I wanted the “best idea to win,” regardless of where it originated or whether it contradictedsomething that I thought.  In some instances, that will require people to admit mistakes.  In thatregard, I have to set the example that we all make mistakes, and that recognizing and addressingthem head on—and, importantly, learning from them—is the best approach. A few years ago we created a new group at the New York Fed called Integrated Policy Analysis. Its purpose was to consolidate teams from many parts of the organization to develop a moreintegrated view of the economic and financial environment to help inform our policyresponsibilities.  I was a strong advocate for the idea.  But, after two years of effort, it becameclear to me and others that it was not working as well as we had hoped.  There were a lot ofreasons for that, and in the end we dissolved the group and reassigned the work and staff.  I letour employees know that I took a calculated risk and it didn’t work out.  By doing this, I aimed toshow that when things do not go as planned, the best approach is to address it, not to be silent.  Ihope that, when our people are confronted with disappointing results in their work, they will do thesame. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
I mentioned earlier that we also need to reform incentives in order to encourage people to speakup.  This is hard.  I’ll share with you some of the change we have made at the New York Fed,recognizing that we do not have a monopoly on good ideas, nor can we claim to have a perfectculture.Skip-level meetings are common, and occur for the purpose of providing forums for sharingideas.  They are also a signal that escalation of problems matters to us.We offer training for new employees that emphasizes the importance of cognitive diversityand speaking up.We evaluate employees on their level of engagement with colleagues and their willingness toshare insights.  So, part of getting promoted is contributing diverse views and raising yourhand.We have created programs to encourage peer recognition of good ideas, including backingfor actionable initiatives selected by staff.  This resulted, for example, in ideas like a “shareyour story” series to create institutional memory of past experiences and lessons learned.None of these ideas is a panacea.  And, I know that we have not yet achieved our goal: a culturein which employees perceive that, by raising their hands and challenging what may be anorthodoxy or conventional wisdom, they are contributing to the mission of the New York Fed.  Ihope, however, that with the right incentives and good leadership models, we can move closer tothat ideal state: an organization characterized by fresh ideas and open dialogue.  At conferences like these, we tend to focus on the cost of misconduct. But, getting rid ofscandals should not be the sole reason for changing culture. The public expects more from thefinancial sector than a lack of another financial crisis or scandal.  The industry would do well tolisten to Baroness Onora O’Neill: Think about your purpose.   What are you for?  Surely, no onewould answer that question by saying, “We’re for a lack of misconduct.”Rather, the financial services industry should support a well-functioning, growing economy,reflecting the interests of all its stakeholders.  Banking in particular should provide criticalintermediation services—the economic infrastructure that allows businesses to grow, families tosave and invest, and standards of living to improve over generations for as broad a cross sectionof people as possible.  When society prospers, the financial services industry prospers, too. Creating a culture that encourages and rewards diversity of thought, perspective, and experienceis one means by which the industry can both do good and do well at the same time. Thank you for your kind attention.See Preet Bharara, Criminal Accountability and Culture, Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’sConference: Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, Oct.20, 2016.In re Wells Fargo, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Administrative Proceeding 2016-CFPB-0015 (Sept. 8,2016) (Consent Order) ¶¶ 8-9.To borrow from the English writer Robert Macfarlane, “proof of competence derived only from the absence ofcatastrophe.”  Robert Macfarlane, The Old Ways 133 (2012).

Ravi Menon: Financial regulation - the forward agendaKeynote address by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, atthe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Annual Forum 2017, Singapore,20 March 2017.*   *   *Mr Greg Medcraft, Chairman of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission,Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.I am happy to join you for this ASIC Annual Forum on “Future Focus”, and congratulate ASIC forthe choice of a timely topic.The global financial system experienced nine years ago a most devastating crisis.In response, we saw the implementation of perhaps the most wide-ranging set of regulatoryreforms ever.We are now at an inflection point. I see three key areas of focus in the regulatory agenda goingforward:First, take stock of the reforms to-date, with a focus on evaluating their effectiveness andeffects.Second, go beyond rule-setting to foster a culture of trust and risk governance in ourfinancial institutions and markets.Third, position regulation for the technological changes sweeping the financial industry, toharness the opportunities they present while managing their risks.Evaluating the effects of regulatory reformsLet me start with a stocktake of the regulatory reforms. Basically, the reforms set out to addressthe fault-lines that caused or exacerbated the global financial crisis of 2008. There are four keythrusts:Build resilient financial institutions. This is being done chiefly through the Basel III reforms,strengthening capital and liquidity buffers in banks.End too-big-to-fail. Frameworks are being established to identify and address the risksposed by global systemically important financial institutions.Make derivatives markets safer. Requirements are being put in place to foster centralclearing, margin requirements, and mandatory reporting of OTC derivative trades.Transform shadow banking into resilient market-based finance. Oversight of shadowbanking entities is being strengthened.The Financial Stability Board has been working to ensure that these internationally agreedregulatory reforms are implemented in a timely and consistent manner across the majorjurisdictions.While gaps remain in some areas, implementation is generally proceeding well.It is time now to begin the important task of evaluating the impact of the reforms.In fact, the FSB is developing a conceptual framework for doing this.The framework aims to answer two questions:have the regulatory reforms been effective – are they achieving their intended outcomes? 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
what are the cumulative effects of the reforms – how have the various reforms interactedwith one another, are they coherent, what are their larger social benefits and costs?This work is especially important in the current context:As memories of the crisis fade and the burden of regulatory reforms comes into sharperfocus, the pressure to unwind the reforms will grow. It is important for the credibility of thereforms that their impact be objectively evaluated.It is also incumbent on us as regulators to be accountable for the substantial changes thatwe have put in place over the last eight years.Fostering a culture of trust in the financial industryA second growing focus in the supervisory agenda is to help foster a culture that motivates theright ethical behaviour and responsible risk-taking in our financial institutions and markets. But itwill require different and novel approaches because there are limits to what externally imposedrules can do to promote the right values in financial firms.The financial industry continues to be plagued by egregious misconduct, nine years on from theglobal financial crisis.In the US and UK, major retail banks are still settling charges against them for mis-sellinginvestment and insurance products in the run-up to the financial crisis.Across financial centres, traders at several banks were found to be involved in flagrantmanipulation of key financial benchmarks.Internationally, regulators have been cracking down on illicit fund flows, with several financialinstitutions being penalised for lapses in money laundering controls.In Singapore, we have taken decisive actions against financial institutions that fell shortof our anti-money laundering standards.MAS shut down two banks and fined several others, and culpable individuals have beencharged in court and sentenced.Reform of the financial industry will not be complete until this issue of trust and ethics isaddressed. We need to “get the culture right”. This will require collective effort by regulators, theindustry, and financial institutions.The FSB and IOSCO have been driving international efforts to reduce misconduct risk, focusingon governance and incentive structures, conduct standards in wholesale markets, and thereform of financial benchmarks.National regulators have been stepping up engagement with financial institutions on issuespertaining to culture and conduct.The industry must itself take collective responsibility to promote good practices and developcodes of conduct, and hold institutions accountable to their peers.Here in Australia, you have set a good example.The Australian Bankers’ Association has commissioned an independent review of salescommissions and product-based payments in retail banking that is now in its final stages.Banks have also agreed to share information among themselves on financial advisers with ahistory of poor conduct.But ultimately it is the financial institution itself that must bear responsibility for getting the cultureright. There are a couple of things they can focus on. 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
First, set a clear tone from the top that is supported by concrete policies and leaders thatwalk the talk. Management decisions must consistently reflect the firm’s espoused values.Second, align human resource (HR) policies with the desired culture. From recruitment andtraining to rewards and penalties, compensation to career development, HR policies sendthe clearest signal to staff on the values that the firm regards as important.This is difficult but important work. We must move the financial industry to look beyond thequestion “is this legal” to the larger question “is this right”.Positioning regulation for technological innovationLet me now move to the third key thrust of financial regulation going forward – how to position fortechnological innovation.Financial technology or FinTech is transforming financial services.Digital payments are becoming more widespread, propelled by advances in near-fieldcommunications, identity authentication, digital IDs, and biometrics.Blockchains or distributed ledger systems are being tested for a wide variety of financialoperations – to settle interbank payments, reconcile trade finance invoices, executeperformance contracts.Big data is being used in many areas of finance - to gain richer insights into customerbehaviour and needs, to detect fraud or anomalies in financial transactions, to sharpensurveillance of market trends.How should regulation respond?First, we need to develop a deep understanding of these emerging technologies and therisks as well as opportunities they present.Second, we need to develop novel approaches in regulation and supervision that willpromote the safe and responsible application of these technologies without stiflinginnovation.In some ways, FinTech helps to reduce existing risks; in other ways, they may accentuate theserisks or even create new ones. Let me illustrate using robo-advisors.Robo-advisors, as you know, are software algorithms that recommend a portfolio based ona set of investor preferences and rebalance the portfolio automatically.The financial risks presented by robo-advisers are similar to traditional fund management,depending on the underlying instruments used.A common question is whether robo-advisers present prudential risks and should thereforebe subject to capital requirements.The operational risks posed by robo-advisers are more interesting.AML/CFT risks may well be reduced through transaction monitoring enhanced by big dataand pattern recognition algorithms. But technology risks may be higher, such as runaway algorithms or cyber criminals stealingcustomer information. 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
 Then there is the question of systemic or macro-financial risks. Here we simply do not knowenough. But here are a couple of points to ponder:The failure of a robo-advisor could potentially lead to contagion among other algorithm-drivenservice providers. This could present systemic risk if investors seek to withdraw theirinvestments in securities through fire sales. The pro-cyclicality arising from algorithms is another unknown, as the interaction betweenalgorithms could exacerbate market trends.Often, with these risk assessments of FinTech, there is a certain“fear of the unknown” ortendency to “imagine the worst”. A degree of conservatism and caution are indeed laudablevirtues for regulators, but we should guard against taking too pre-emptive an approach whendealing with the uncertainties of FinTech.Regulators need to keep pace with innovation but regulation itself must not front-run innovation.Introducing regulation prematurely may stifle innovation and potentially derail the adoption ofuseful technology.MAS’ approach is to apply a materiality or proportionality test.This means regulation kicks in only when the risk posed by the new technology becomesmaterial or crosses a certain threshold.And the weight of regulation must be proportionate to the risk posed.In 2015, MAS laid out a vision for a Smart Financial Centre, where innovation is pervasive andtechnology is used widely. And a Smart Financial Centre needs smart regulation – that promotesinnovation while safeguarding public confidence and financial stability.We are still learning and our approaches still evolving, but let me share with you three aspects ofour regulatory response to FinTech.First, using a regulatory sandbox to test new ideas in a confined environment.Second, harnessing supervisory technology, or SupTech as we call it, to carry outsupervision in a more efficient and effective manner.Third, strengthening cyber security across the financial industry to make it safer to use newtechnologies and instil confidence in consumers.Regulatory sandboxMAS launched a regulatory sandbox in June last year, to enable financial institutions and FinTechstart-ups to conduct live experiments with innovative financial products or services.These firms do not need to fully meet the relevant regulatory requirements at the onset.To ensure that the consequences of any failure are contained, the experiments areconducted within agreed boundaries, such as the number of clients, scope of the activity,etc.The experiment is time-bound.If successful, the entity must exit the sandbox and fully comply with all relevantregulations if it wants to roll out the innovative product to the broader market.If the experiment fails, well we all learn something.Regulatory sandboxes not only encourage FinTech innovation by providing a safe space for 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
experimentation. They also give regulators an opportunity to learn the risks associated with newtechnologies and right-size regulation accordingly.Several regulators have introduced variants of the regulatory sandbox over the past year. In fact, Iwould say the sandbox is itself an experiment for regulators. There is much we can learn bysharing experiences and lessons from our different approaches. And ASIC is one regulator thatwe admire and watch closely on this front.Take registration requirements. Most sandboxes require applicants to register prior toexperimentation.The UK FCA has two fixed cohorts of applicants a year, while the MAS sandbox is alwaysopen for application.ASIC has an interesting approach. It has a class-exemption for firms testing a specific set of services for 12 months andup to 100 clients.Interested firms are required to notify ASIC before commencing business, provided theyalso meet certain consumer protection conditions.MAS opted for an application-based approach because we wanted to closely engage eachapplicant, understand the innovation, business model, and risks so as to customise thesandbox conditions.But each application is turning out to be quite time-consuming and we are mindful thatour process does not get in the way of speed-to-market.So, we are keen to study ASIC’s experience with the class-exemption approach andsee how our own approach can be improved.There are also interesting differences in the qualifying entities.HKMA’s sandbox is restricted to authorised institutions, while ASIC’s sandbox is restricted toFinTech start-ups. The MAS and UK FCA are open to both regulated entities and FinTech start-ups.Supervisory technology or SupTechThe second aspect of our approach that I want to highlight is SupTech.Many of you are familiar with RegTech – the use of technology to enhance risk managementand regulatory compliance in financial institutions. Well, why should regulated entities have a monopoly over the use of technology? Regulatorstoo can harness technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of supervision andsurveillance.There is clearly greater scope for the use of analytics for financial surveillance and supervision:big data, machine learning, and perhaps even natural language processing. I believe securitiesregulators will increasingly harness big data to detect, enforce and prosecute misconduct.In a recent case, US SEC obtained a settlement against a broker-dealer for its failure toadequately train its representatives, when they were selling certain complex debtinstruments.Custom analytics tools, instead of traditional investigative techniques, were used to siftthrough millions of trading records, which identified over 8,000 retail customers for whom theinvestment in the debt instruments was inappropriate. 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
In MAS, we have started using techniques such as clustering and network analysis in oursupervision of the financial markets and monitoring of AML/CFT risks.We are developing algorithms to scan suspicious transaction reports (STRs) and identifythose that warrant further attention, allowing supervisors to focus their resources on higher-risk transactions.We are working to develop algorithms that can detect and identify trading accountssuspected of syndicated activities.We will soon be setting up a dedicated unit on SupTech, to synergise and strengthen theseefforts and help sharpen our supervisory practices.Cyber securityAnd last but not least, cyber security. Cyber-attacks are a growing threat to the financialecosystem, and FinTech could potentially accentuate this risk.As more financial services are delivered over the internet, there will be growing security andprivacy concerns from cyber threats.And maybe even systemic concerns. It is not inconceivable that the next financial crisis istriggered by a cyber-attack.We need to develop the regulatory and supervisory capabilities to address these emergingthreats.Cyber risk management will be the new frontier for global regulatory efforts and supervisory co-operation.The BIS has set up a taskforce to develop international guidelines on cyber-securityresponsibilities for banks and fund-transfer providers, with the aim of making globalpayments safer.More such initiatives are likely in the years ahead.Another area that will be a growing focus is information sharing. Unlike other traditional risksfacing financial institutions, cyber risks are less visible and yet often afflict multiple firms at thesame time given the interconnectedness of the financial sector.The sharing of timely and actionable cyber information among financial institutions istherefore key to building resilient cyber defences within the financial ecosystem.MAS has collaborated with the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (FS-ISAC) to establish an Asia Pacific (APAC) Regional Intelligence and Analysis Centre.The Centre will encourage regional sharing and analysis of cybersecurity information withinthe financial services sector.It is expected to begin operations soon.ConclusionLet me conclude. Financial regulation remains work-in-progress.We must press on with the reform agenda and see it through to full, timely, and consistentimplementation. At the same time, we must evaluate the effects of the reforms put in place andmake adjustments where appropriate, to maximise their effectiveness and minimise their costs.We must strengthen the foundations for sound risk management and good conduct by workingwith the industry to embed deeply a culture of responsible risk-taking and ethical conduct. 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches

Historical Archives of the European Union - European University Institute Travelling Exhibition on the Occasion of the 60th Anniversary of the Treaties of Rome       ‘EVER CLOSER UNION’ The Legacy of the Treaties of Rome for Today’s Europe     Remarks by Fabio Panetta Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy                 European Central Bank - Frankfurt, 21 March 2017 
I am delighted to speak at this commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community. Rome is not only the place where the European project came into being, but also the city that gave Europe its first ‘economic and monetary union’, more than 20 centuries ago. Indeed, if Emperor Augustus could be with us today, he would probably ask: ‘What have you guys been doing all this time? You are still at the point where we left you two thousand years ago!’  But the Emperor would be wrong. The ‘monetary union’ of the ancient Romans emerged through war, conquest and prevarication; ours is based on peace, political consensus and shared welfare. In fact, we have progressed a lot from where the ancient Romans left us.  The EEC Treaty was signed on March 25th, 1957, in the Palazzo dei Conservatori. It was an economic compact intended to transform European trade and manufacturing, but also to contribute to the construction of a political Europe. In the preamble, the signatories of the Treaty declared that they were:  - resolved to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe, […]   - anxious to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions, […]  - resolved by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty. These objectives were pursued by creating a common market and a customs union and by developing common policies. The framers of the Treaty were fully aware of the difficulties that the path towards a united Europe would encounter. The presence of less developed regions, with low incomes and inadequate infrastructures, was definitely a cause of concern.  For this reason the Rome Treaty foresaw the establishment of the European Social Fund and of the European Investment Bank, in order to provide financial support and reduce regional disparities.  For many years, the development of the European project contributed to economic growth in the Member States: the progressive abolition of tariffs favoured specialization, made it possible to reap the benefits of scale economies and stimulated efficiency and competition, with positive effects on employment and welfare.  2  
The EEC subsequently evolved into the EU, becoming an area where Member States cooperate on a wide set of policies and citizens enjoy freedom and peace. In 1999 we introduced the euro, and even during the crisis we accomplished a lot in terms of deepening the Union.  And yet, this anniversary takes place in a period of heightened uncertainty. The anxieties generated by the crisis and geopolitical tensions – including the large migrant flows and civil war in nearby countries – have aroused uneasy sentiments among European citizens, thus giving further ammunition to anti-European movements, and narrowing the focus of the economic and political debate to mostly domestic and short-term issues.  The divergent views of the Member States on fundamental issues – from migration to economic policy – weaken the EU in the eyes of the international community and in those of European citizens. The reaction of public opinion has been one of concern and rejection. The European project is sometimes perceived as a bureaucratic superstructure and a source of redundant regulations; it is seen more and more as part of the problem, less and less as the solution. Should this situation persist, the future of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and even of the EU itself, cannot – and should not – be taken for granted.  In my opinion, the necessary ingredients to strengthen the European project are precisely those that inspired the choices of the founding fathers. First, an unfailing faith in the importance of European integration. As Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has asked European leaders, somewhat rhetorically: ‘If we do not believe in ourselves, in the deeper purpose of integration, why should anyone else?’ Second, it must be clear that, as President Draghi recently affirmed, for the EMU to be viable ‘Members have to be better off inside than they would be outside…If there are parts of the euro area that are worse off inside the Union, doubts may grow about whether they might ultimately have to leave’.  Finally, we must be able to design and put in place institutional arrangements and policies to address the pragmatic and pressing needs of all European citizens.  With these objectives in mind, we must admit that up to now we have not been able to claim success. True, during the financial crisis European institutions and Member States have demonstrated their willingness to invest in the European project. Measures have been taken to 3  
strengthen the EMU, such as the establishment of the ESM, the launch of the Banking Union, the introduction of new budgetary rules and the extension of multilateral supervision to macro imbalances.  However, what we have done so far is not enough. Those measures were often enacted in emergency conditions, and risked producing overlaps, redundancies and sometimes genuine mistakes. In effect, the reaction to the crisis relied almost exclusively on monetary policy. The ECB acted boldly to preserve price stability and to support the real economy. In the absence of its monetary policy measures, economic conditions would have been much worse, possibly leading to a deflationary spiral.  Going forward, it will be necessary to increase the incentives for reform and the coordination of economic and structural policies, and shift from an intergovernmental form of management based on the peer review of national policies to the formulation of genuinely common policies. The plan published by the European Commission in November 2012 and the report of the President of the European Council in June of the same year set the stage for a further strengthening of the EMU. The SSM has been a success story. It rapidly became operational in supervising the largest banks and, in the euro area, it has contributed to stabilization, which is a prerequisite for economic growth. However, the Banking Union is still incomplete due to disagreement on the next steps to be taken. The Capital Markets Union is still embryonic, in spite of the fact that the free movement of capital is a long-standing objective of the European Union, dating back to the Treaty of Rome. Finally, some form of fiscal capacity at the euro-area level would improve the management of cyclical conditions in various economies and in the euro area overall. To be fully effective, it would require the introduction of common debt instruments. But, in order to move forward in the integration process we need, above all, to rebuild mutual trust, both at the political level and among citizens. The first step must be to tackle the weaknesses of individual countries, but such an effort must be sustained by progress in the European construction.  This is a demanding agenda, but as the late President of the Italian Republic, Ciampi, noted about thirty years ago ‘for the civilization to which we belong [European integration] is the only way to avoid losing the thread that was broken by two world wars and retied by those with the vision to 4  
imagine Europe as a community.’ Without an integrated Europe, we may not be able to influence global phenomena such as migration, terrorism, climate change or the vagaries of an increasingly interconnected economy.  Returning to my starting point, in order to make our way forward we may need to look back at our history, cherish the good we see in the past and jettison the bad. The Roman ‘economic and monetary union’ was strong because it was backed by political union, and we should strive to achieve such a union – by peaceful means, of course; at the same time it was weak, because it was designed for the benefit of a few to the detriment of many, a mistake that we should certainly try to avoid today. 5  
1     CEPS Forum: Reconstructing the Union EMU governance: a reality check Address by Dr Mario Vella Governor of the Central Bank of Malta Brussels, 23 February 2017  The Five Presidents’ Report on Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union argues that economic and political convergence underpinning EMU needs to go deeper if it is to ensure prosperity for all its members and fairer outcome for its citizens. In the first phase, which was meant to be completed in June, the report envisages a number of steps including: − a new boost to convergence, employment and growth, through the creation of a euro area system of competitiveness authorities and stronger implementation of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure; − the completion of the banking union and the launch of the capital markets union; − the establishment of a new advisory European Fiscal Board; − a reorganisation of the European Semester, with greater parliamentary control and accountability. The Commission should soon be publishing a related White Paper on the future of Europe.  Before moving forward, let’s see what’s been achieved so far.  In the twenty-five years since the Maastricht Treaty was signed, the euro has been established a successful currency. It is widely accepted as a medium of exchange and store of value, not only within the euro area itself, but also beyond it.  It enjoys popular acceptance and support.  Although the process of financial integration in the euro area was heavily disrupted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area in 2011, the single currency area has held together.  These gains should not be lightly discarded. 
2 But the double shock of the financial crisis and the subsequent fiscal crisis has hit EMU hard.  The euro area economy is currently in a moderate, gradual recovery that has been under way since the second quarter of 2013.  However, in some member states that were hit the hardest by the sovereign debt crisis, output remains considerably below the levels registered in 2008.  Unemployment rates diverge considerably across the euro area, ranging from over 20% in Greece to below 4% in Germany.  The euro area is facing pressure along four different fault lines.  First, there is the tension between euro area member states that are in different cyclical and, in some cases, secular positions and yet face the same nominal interest rate and exchange rate.  Second, there is the related tension between monetary policy that is determined at the level of the euro area as a whole and fiscal policy which has remained, in effect, largely national.  Third, there are tensions that arise from the fact that the single currency is embedded in an incomplete single market, including only a partial banking union.  Finally, at the institutional level, there is the tension between the nation state and supra-national bodies that partly stems from the fact that the euro area is a monetary union which is not under-pinned by a common Treasury. These tensions are reflected in the rise of political movements and parties that oppose and want to reverse the admittedly complex and difficult process of European integration that emerged from the ashes of the Second World War, and threaten the single currency itself.  These tensions are the source of the governance issues that EMU faces and which still have to be resolved. I would like to examine three aspects of EMU in turn: monetary policy, fiscal policy and economic integration. I believe that as far as the monetary dimension of EMU is concerned, many issues have been settled.  The Governing Council of the ECB pursues a clear mandate to maintain price stability, defined as a rate of inflation below but close to 2%, and it has consistently run monetary policy in pursuit of this goal.  However, monetary policy is facing the constraints of operating at the zero interest rate bound.  An institutional set-up that was designed to fight inflation has had to react to an unprecedented situation characterised by the absence of inflationary pressures.  In my view, some design features – such as the asymmetric response to deviations from the ECB’s target – ought to be reviewed. On the fiscal front, compliance with the existing governance framework has fallen far short of the original expectations.  Initiatives to strengthen the rules and the related institutional framework, such as the establishment of national fiscal councils and the European Fiscal Board are helpful.  But they are probably insufficient. 
3 It is my contention that we will not resolve problems related to fiscal governance in the euro area solely by adjusting the rules and strengthening the institutional set-up.   The Five President’s Report moves in the direction of a single fiscal policy, with a euro area wide budget that is large enough to contain in-built automatic stabilising mechanisms that allow for a transfer of resources from those regions in the euro area that are doing relatively well to other regions that have been hit by adverse shocks.  But if the will to abide by the existing rules was weak, there seems to be even less appetite for further integration on these lines.  On another view, one could recognise that events have shown that fiscal policy remains a vital shock absorber at the national level and that, therefore, it may be necessary to increase, rather than reduce, flexibility in the conduct of fiscal policy.   Given that the objective of a common fiscal policy and a common Treasury remains politically unrealisable, one needs to explore other interim solutions which, without creating risks of moral hazard, introduce an element of solidarity between EMU members that go beyond bail-outs and austerity.  In the end there can be no longevity in a monetary union where members are moving at very different economic tempos and sometimes even in different directions.  Another aspect of EMU governance is strengthening the economic part of EMU.  This requires structural reforms aimed at enhancing potential growth, reducing structural unemployment and increasing national economies’ resistance to shocks.  While many euro area countries undertook a wave of reforms during the crisis, today, across much of the area reforms have stalled.  This is not a uniform picture.  Malta is enjoying robust economic growth despite regional headwinds, largely as a result of reforms implemented in recent years that stimulated the development of new areas of economic activity and increased labour participation.  Malta has also taken full advantage of its membership of the EU and its adoption of the single currency. Resilience to shocks can also be built up through deeper economic integration.  Indeed, as the Five Presidents’ report argues, financial integration helps to share risk across EMU member countries.  The completion of a Banking Union, which will strengthen the European banking sector, is a key objective in this regard.  In this area, success so far has been partial.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism involving the ECB via the Supervisory Board and the national supervisory authorities is up and running, following a comprehensive health check of the euro area banks.  The Single Resolution Mechanism is also operational and is being funded according to plan.  As regards the third pillar of Banking Union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), negotiations are still under way.  We believe that EDIS is will increase confidence in banks across the euro area. In sum, we are still far from completing the steps envisaged in the first phase of the Five Presidents’ roadmap.  Achieving and maintaining responsible fiscal policies at national and euro area level still 
4 seems beyond our grasp and while certain elements of the Banking Union are now in place, more needs to be done.  Overall, the timetable is ambitious.  We must also be realistic and admit that further integration is running against headwinds of popular discontent with integration and liberalisation. We need, therefore to be more open about what we are doing, to fully engage all our citizens and to build a case for a stronger EMU that can enjoy broad popular consensus rather than being imposed from above. 
Opening Speech by Ms Caroline Abel, Governor of Central Bank of Seychelles at the Alliance for Financial Inclusion’s 13th Consumer Empowerment and Market Conduct and 8th SME Finance Working Group Meetings  March 13 – 17, 2017 Venue: Savoy Resort and Spa  Honourable Ministers, Dr Peter Larose and Mr Wallace Cosgrow,  Dr. Alfred Hannig, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion Executive Director, Distinguished Guests, Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Good morning and thank you everyone for being here today.  On behalf of the Central Bank of Seychelles, I am very pleased to welcome you all to the 8th SME Finance and 13th Consumer Empowerment and Market Conduct Working Group Meetings and the Public-Private Dialogue Training on Small Merchants.  It is indeed our pleasure to co-host an AFI event for the first time in Seychelles.    For those of you not familiar with Seychelles, we are a group of 115 islands with a land area of 456 sq. km and 1.2 m sq. km of sea.  We have a population of 93,000 with a diverse ethnicity which underscores our official languages of Creole, English and French.  About half of the area of Seychelles is protected which consists of national parks, including two World Heritage Sites as declared by UNESCO: namely the atoll of Aldabra which is home to giant tortoises and the famous botanical garden of the Vallée de Mai on Praslin which has the native Coco de Mer, the largest 
seed in the world.  Given the unique biodiversity of Seychelles, the Central Bank showcased this fact through the new family of banknotes and coins which was unveiled in December last year, which is Seychelles’ Unique Biodiversity – the Backbone of Our Economy. The new banknotes and coins represent the Seychelles’ endemic flora and fauna.  We face the limitations and constraints typical of Small Island States that have few inhabitants and limited natural resources.  We are a developing economy that is heavily dependent upon tourism and fisheries and the financial services sector is currently the third pillar of the economy.   With that said, I would like to proceed with providing a brief background on the initiatives undertaken by the authorities to develop the Seychelles’ financial sector.  Seychelles has made significant progress since 2008 in actively reforming its financial sector.  In late 2008, we embarked on a macro-economic reform program with the support of the IMF that provided the platform for fundamental changes in the country's economic and financial landscape of which the establishment of a modern payment system was seen to be a key component.  Since then, a number of milestones have been achieved including:  - The introduction of the Central Bank of Seychelles Immediate Transfer Service (CBSITS) creating an interbank platform for effecting payment transactions. - The establishment of an Electronic Cheque Clearing (ECC) system allowing for a same day cheque clearing process via the electronic exchange of cheque images.  - The Seychelles Electronic Funds Transfer (SEFT) as an alternative means for interbank funds transfer.  - The introduction of the first Securities Exchange. 
- The licensing of the first payment service provider to offer mobile payment services.  - The implementation of the electronic payment gateway for the payment of Government services.  - Commissioning of a number of feasibility/diagnostic studies in respect to Government payments, remittance market, the implementation of a Central Securities Depository and that of a Real Time Gross Settlement System.  Albeit, all the progress made, there are still important milestones that remain to be achieved in order to further develop the financial sector, especially where adoption of innovative payment systems and consumer empowerment are concerned.  In this context, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan in November, 2014. The Plan serves to provide the Government and all stakeholders with a clear guidance in key policy areas for financial sector development.  It is a nation-wide document detailing the strategies of the Seychelles Government to strengthen and deepen the financial sector with the ultimate objective of enhancing the country’s economic development.  The key strategic objectives are: - Strengthening the financial sector’s legal and regulatory framework.  - Developing the national payment system and other relevant financial infrastructures.  - Improving access to credit of small and medium enterprises.  - Strengthening the regulation and supervision of non-bank financial institutions. - Developing the capital markets.  - Other relevant cross cutting issues such as consumer protection, financial literacy and financial inclusion. 
As part of the output of the Plan, a financial literacy baseline survey was commissioned last year with the aim of gauging the level of financial literacy of the population and provide an assessment of its needs, including the identification of possible target groups.   The survey was the first of its kind to be conducted in the country and will be a crucial element in the drafting of a national strategy for financial education.  Similarly, a survey was also completed last year under the SME Development project.  The survey had as objective to provide disaggregated data about SMEs that will be used to review SMEs development issues across various population segments and training needs.  As a result, the following were identified as challenges that inhibit SMEs from access to markets:  - Where markets are present, the site are not serviced with necessary social amenities. - SMEs lack market information and marketing skills. - Lack of adequate local markets.  - Inadequate, inefficient and ineffective distribution and supply network in the local market, such that products/service takes time before reaching target markets. - Limited capacity to meet SME expectations in terms of providing finance as well as providing non-financial support.  - Entrepreneurship skills training into both practical and non-practical sector specific training in order to achieve relevancy to the needs of the small business community.  As you may all be aware, SMEs play critical role in the country’s economic development. SMEs are often considered as the drive to creating local demand and consumption. In fact, SMEs related matters are high priorities on the government agenda.  On that note, the Central Bank in coordination with government is closely working with the commercial 
banks in light of the risks associated with SME finance, to come up with a strategy for SME lending.  The Central Bank is also currently engaged in exploring the feasibility to expand participation in the Credit Information System (CIS) to all lenders not regulated by the Central Bank, including government lending agencies or programs and commercial firms that engage in hire‐purchase activities. In this regard work is being undertaken with the World Bank to enact a Credit Information System law which would broaden the scope of the CIS in Seychelles to include other entities and activities that are not regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, with the aim of modernising the national payment system, by broadening the scope of innovative payments schemes and reducing paper instruments as a means for payment, the Central Bank in collaboration with the Seychelles Banking Association are looking into the possibility of implementing a national payment switch.    Ladies and gentlemen, with no doubt, services provided by the financial system has a prime impact on economic growth.  The level of development plays a significant role in the growth of businesses, enhancing innovation and competition.  It is however, equally important that in support of the broader objective of financial sector development and financial inclusion, access to financial services are of the highest quality and convenience, affordable and also operated in an environment where consumers are adequately protected.  Ensuring that there is an effective consumer protection framework to address the balance of power between financial institutions and their consumers is vital in order to 
enhance public confidence in the financial system and the use of innovative financial services.  There is no need for me to overemphasise that consumer education, consumer empowerment is fundamental across all levels.  Financially literate and empowered consumers interact more effectively and assertively with financial services providers, ultimately leading to them attaining their financial objectives.  Essentially, consumer empowerment is instrumental in supporting financial inclusion policies.  Now, whilst it is important for consumers to assume the responsibility of acquiring the necessary financial knowledge and skills, it is important to reiterate that authorities and financial institutions should devote resources and work towards establishing mechanisms that support financial consumer empowerment.   Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank AFI for organising such forums as they provide us, policy makers with the opportunities to exchange experiences on the different policy decisions taken in our own jurisdictions.  Years ago, productivity was attributed to those who retained the most knowledge.  Today, however, productivity and efficiency is attributed to combining expertise with the experience and intelligence of peers discharging similar functions.  Let us continue to learn from each and showcase the results that our forum, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion can bring to the world stage.  We in Seychelles, we are very fortunate to have you on our shores at this present time as the subject matters on the agenda are very pertinent to our country.  I encourage my colleagues from the Central Bank and the two respective government Ministries to have maximum participation and interaction. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your attention and I wish you all fruitful deliberations over the course of the coming days and to our foreign guests an enjoyable stay in Seychelles.  Thank you. 
Janet Yellen: Strong foundations - the economic futures of kids andcommunitiesWelcoming remarks by Ms Janet L Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System, at the 10th Biennial Federal Reserve System Community DevelopmentResearch Conference "Strong Foundations: The Economic Futures of Kids and Communities",Washington DC, 23 March 2017.*   *   *I would like to welcome all of you and thank you for joining us to discuss a set of topics ofconsiderable importance to our country. This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th biennial communitydevelopment research conference, dedicated as always to issues of significance to people andcommunities around the country. The conference is cosponsored by, and includes substantivecontributions from, the community development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as wellas the Board of Governors. That united effort and level of commitment reflects howconsequential we consider these issues to be. This conference is intended to present andhighlight rigorous research that I am confident will inform how you think about your own work,whether from the perspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research.Our last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic mobility, largelyamong adults. This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures of Kids andCommunities,” and, in part, I see this topic as an extension of that earlier conversation aboutmobility.Today and tomorrow, we focus on research about the foundation or building blocks for economicsuccess that are laid even before young people enter the workforce and assume responsibilityfor their own finances.We will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children, youths, andyoung adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later to productivelycontribute to the economy and manage their finances. We can learn from what the data andanalysis tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information will lead to more effectiveprograms and policies and thus better outcomes.Considerable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as an adult, andnew research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the typical experiencesof poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult. The data come from theBoard’s latest Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which will bepublished later this spring. In the most recent survey, we asked some of the youngerrespondents—aged 25 to 39—to think about their childhoods. We asked those young adultswhether, during their childhoods, they found themselves worrying about having enough food toeat, having a stable caregiver, or about their personal safety. About 10 percent said they regularlyworried about one or more of these concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimesworried about them.We were then able to compare responses about their experiences in childhood to what theseyoung adults told us about their current circumstances. Some pretty clear patterns emerged. Ofthose young adults who regularly had one or more of these childhood concerns growing up,more than one-half say that they are currently facing challenges in getting by financially. Thisfraction compares to just over one-fourth of those who said they never, or only rarely, worriedabout these concerns as children that now experience this level of financial challenge. Youngadults who regularly or sometimes worried when they were children about their care, safety, orhaving enough to eat are also less likely to be employed, less likely to have consistent incomemonth-to-month, and less likely to be able to pay all of their current monthly bills in full, compared12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
with those who never or rarely worried about these concerns as children.Broadly speaking, children who grow up in insecure circumstances, those often experienced inpoverty, seem disproportionately likely to experience financial insecurity as adults. Thisconference is about understanding what kinds of environments and resources can best helpchildren meet with economic success after they reach adulthood. There has been a lot ofdiscussion in the aftermath of the Great Recession about how to best connect people withsteady jobs. But research presented over the next two days makes a compelling case that thereis a need to also think longer term about how to prepare people for success in the labor market.In fact, this research underscores the value of starting young to develop basic work habits andskills, like literacy, numeracy, and interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skillshelp prepare people for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more successover time, and be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academiccredentials that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Indeed, a growing bodyof economic and education literature has focused on the relative efficiency of addressingworkforce development challenges through investments in early childhood development andeducation compared with interventions later in life.I believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners think moreclearly about the implications for improving economic and life outcomes for everyone. To thisend, the speakers at this conference will focus on three broad issues. I would like to brieflymention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can be informed by the researchthat will be presented here.First, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and education. In recentyears, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever have known before aboutwhich factors and experiences in childhood can make a difference later in life. However, manyquestions demand further attention. A fundamental one is how positive developmental outcomescan be promoted among those who were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages.While we do know there are advantages to good quality early childhood education, we shouldstrive to better understand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how tomaximize these returns. The answers to these questions may influence thinking about howprograms and interventions meant to assist kids and their families should be structured formaximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success.Second, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community conditions onthe development of young people. Some presenters at this conference will share theirunderstanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development. For instance, howdo the form and quality of community institutions such as schools, community centers, andlibraries play a role? What other kinds of community characteristics—such as public safety,transportation, and environmental quality—might help or hinder general education and financialskill development? A particularly important question is how kids’ home environments affect themin ways that matter for their future economic success. It is also critically important to ask, whatkinds of interventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?Third, and finally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development of youths andyoung adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader economy. They will askhow we understand which formative experiences most affect the ability of young people tosuccessfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether that means college, a job, or otherpaths such as self-employment. What role does a range of programs—starting with earlychildhood education all the way through youth vocational or apprenticeship training—play inaffecting job readiness? How effective are different approaches, and what are the returns oninvestment? We should also pay attention to how well young people form the sorts of “softskills"—things like teamwork, communication, and the ability to handle conflict—that are sovalued by employers. And, for young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who2 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
get caught up in the juvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on theirfutures as workers and consumers, and what are the most promising approaches to foster acourse correction?I hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use to you in yourwork. Community development professionals attending this conference may consider how thedesign and implementation of their programs may be improved. Policymakers may look moreclosely at how kids are affected—purposefully or unintentionally—by public policies. Andresearchers may encounter ideas that spark new work that can shed further light on theseimportant topics.I think it is important that we better understand these issues, and I applaud you for taking the timeto be here to share your knowledge and to learn. Our young people are the future, and we allwant them to have the support they need for successful and fulfilling lives. As a central banker, Irecognize the benefits to the broader economy when more people are better prepared for workand for managing their finances. In short, ensuring that all of our kids have “strong foundations”will help build a similarly strong foundation for the U.S. economy.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (forthcoming), 2016 Survey of Household Economics andDecisionmaking (Washington: Board of Governors).

 1  Launching of the Financial Literacy Baseline Survey results Opening remarks by the Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles Time: 8:35 a.m. Venue: STC Conference Room, Victoria   Minister Jean-Paul Adam, Minister Wallace Cosgrow, Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Good morning and welcome to the presentation of the financial literacy baseline survey results.  A special welcome to Mr Abel Motsomi who will be our main presenter for the day.  May I begin these opening remarks with a few words on the background of this work:  As part of the deliverables of the Seychelles’ Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan which was approved by the Government in November 2014, it was recommended that a baseline study on financial literacy be developed and conducted, following which a national strategy on financial education will be developed and implemented.   The Central Bank of Seychelles in collaboration with the Financial Services Authority has been tasked with the mandate for financial literacy in Seychelles.  Against this backdrop, the financial literacy baseline survey was commissioned to FinMark Trust, an independent trust based in South Africa.  FinMark Trust has focused its efforts on making financial markets work for the poor by facilitating and catalysing development around access to financial services.  Much of the work of FinMark Trust is focused on supporting financial inclusion and financial education.   
 2  The financial literacy baseline survey is the first of its kind to be conducted in Seychelles and its importance needs to be emphasised. The aim of the study was to gauge the level of financial literacy of the population and provide an assessment of the needs of the population including the identification of possible target groups. Assessing the levels of financial literacy in the population is a key component of a successful national strategy for financial education which enables policy makers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses.  The results of the survey which are about to be discussed this morning, provides us with a set of data which reflects how the public are making financial decisions vis-à-vis saving, borrowing, budgeting, spending and planning for their financial future in general, amongst other factors. Accordingly, the statistics collected will guide and inform the development of the national strategy on financial education. The collected data which also provides a description of levels of financial literacy in terms of socio-demographic groups will enable policy makers to identify the needs of the population and areas where interventions and attention are most required. In addition, the information collected provides the possibility to conduct repeat surveys to identify change over time.  The Central Bank of Seychelles and the Financial Services Authority will be working in collaboration with the public and private stakeholders to achieve the development and implementation of the national strategy. In fact, the procurement for consultancy services to assist with the development of the strategy is currently being initiated.   Ladies and gentlemen, these initiatives and engagements towards financial consumer empowerment echo the recent global tempos in respect of financial education. There has been an increased focus on financial literacy internationally, particularly since the 2008 financial crisis which has exposed the effects of lack of financial education amongst consumers, leading many countries to develop or start developing national financial education strategies.  Whilst other countries are yet to roll out strategies at the national level, ample efforts are being put into designing financial education programmes or interventions for specific groups of the population. The message is clear:   
 3  Financial education matters and it matters at many levels. Primarily, from a social welfare perspective, it matters in terms of the ability of people to manage their financial affairs prudently and live within their means.  Financial education is meant to empower individuals in the financial marketplace, in terms of increasing their ability to make informed decisions and meaningful participation in the markets, allowing them to better manage personal and household finances and resources. Financially savvy consumers who interact effectively with providers of financial services are more likely to achieve their financial goals and therefore improve their households’ welfare. Moreover, financial education is instrumental in supporting financial inclusion policies through creation of awareness of the availability of financial products and services and through developing confidence in the use of such products and services.  Accordingly, financial education contributes to the development of financial systems and markets as well as to the promotion of more transparent competition amongst financial service providers. In fact, financial education is very much considered as the first line of defence and protection for consumers of financial products and services, since it complements the regulatory and supervisory measures in place.  It is widely recognised that individuals across the globe, living in different economic, financial and social circumstances have to take more responsibility for their future financial well-being and protection. It is important to consider that while Authorities will devote resources and work towards establishing mechanisms that will support financial consumer empowerment, it is important to acknowledge that the ultimate responsibility rests with the individual to ensure that financial knowledge and skills acquired are transformed into positive financial behaviour.    Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to stress that CBS and its partners remain committed to the development of the financial sector in line with our respective mandates. The successful development of the financial sector must be sustained, amongst other factors, by appropriate legislative and supervisory frameworks, including an effective regulatory framework for financial consumer protection, as recommended in the Financial Sector Development Plan. Accordingly, to further consolidate financial consumer empowerment, CBS and the FSA are working on the development of a legislative framework for financial consumer protection.   
 4  The proposed framework, which is at a preliminary drafting stage, is specifically aimed at protecting the interests of financial consumers and to fairly, reasonably, and effectively handle financial consumer disputes, thereby reinforcing the confidence of financial consumers in financial markets and promoting their sound development. Such will complement the development of the national strategy on financial education.  Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to conclude my remarks with a few words of acknowledgement. The conduct of the financial literacy baseline survey has been made possible due to the commitment of our faithful partners. May I acknowledge the role of government through the Cabinet of Ministers for approving that such an initiative be conducted.  I wish to particularly thank the Financial Services Authority for its involvement throughout the entire process and the National Bureau of Statistics which assisted with the development of the sample for the survey. May I also acknowledge our international partners which are contributing to the funding of these projects, specifically the Investment Climate Facility for Africa and the African Development Bank. The Central Bank also extends its appreciation to FinMark Trust for the work conducted.  I express my gratitude also to the Central Bank team for making sure the work program moved along smoothly and attained its objectives.  Last but not least, I wish to thank the general public for making the time available to participate in the survey.  With these remarks, it is my pleasure to invite Mr. Abel Motsomi of FinMark Trust to deliver his presentation on the results of the financial literacy baseline survey.  Thank you.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   It is a pleasure to host this Banking Standards Board event “Worthy of trust? Law, ethics and culture in banking” and to join this distinguished panel.  Over the past decade, banking has suffered twin crises of solvency and legitimacy.    The first is being addressed by comprehensive reforms.  As a consequence, large banks are now stronger, more liquid, and more focused.1   This immense progress has been overshadowed by a crisis of legitimacy.  A series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation have undermined trust in banking, the financial system, and, to some degree, markets themselves.   Multiple factors contributed to a tide of ethical drift.2  Market standards were poorly understood, often ignored and lacked teeth. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions.  Bad behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm.  The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks’ misconduct costs have now reached over $320 billion – capital that could otherwise have supported up to $5 trillion of lending to households and businesses.3   But there is a bigger cost.  An industry the scale and importance of finance needs social capital as well as economic capital.  It requires the consent of society in order to operate, innovate and grow.   Repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance into question.    In a system where trust is fundamental it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now think that banks are well-run, down from 90% in the late 1980s.4                                                            1 For example, their capital requirements have increased 10-fold. And in response these banks have raised over $1.5 trillion of capital in recent years. 2 There are multiple root causes: (i) market structures presented opportunities for abuse and were vulnerable to conflicts of interest and collusion; (ii) systems of internal governance and controls were incapable of asserting the interests of firms – and society – over those of staff; (iii) compensation packages rewarded short-term returns and ignored long-term value creation and good conduct; (iv) and dearth of personal accountability. 3 For misconduct costs see BCG report, “Global Risk 2017: Staying the Course in Banking, March 2017 http://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/financial-institutions-growth-global-risk-2017-staying-course-banking.aspx.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   From ethical drift to ethical lift  The scale of these shortcomings is why the Bank of England has been pursuing a series of measures to convert ethical drift into ethical lift.  Domestically we are working closely with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury.  Internationally, we have catalysed a series of actions at the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that will be presented to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in July.  Allow me to review the main elements before concentrating on how codes of conduct and the Senior Managers Regime (SMR) can lift standards and improve culture.  Let me be clear at the outset that the Bank of England holds itself to the highest standards.  In that spirit, I will extend my remarks to review some lessons the Bank can learn from the events surrounding Charlotte Hogg’s resignation, and the steps we are taking in response.    The UK Action Plan to improve conduct  Our action plan for the financial system begins with stronger deterrents.  In the UK, important steps have been taken to strengthen laws and regulations, though some gaps remain, most notably in the FX market.5  But authorities cannot and should not try to legislate for every circumstance, watch every transaction, or anticipate every market innovation.  So while fines and sanctions have roles in deterring misconduct, they will not, on their own, bring about the cultural change we need.   We must move from an excessive reliance on punitive, ex post fines of firms to greater emphasis on more compelling ex ante incentives for individuals, and ultimately a more solid grounding in improved firm culture.   This includes reducing opportunities for bad behaviour, for example, by overhauling the regulation of key benchmarks in FICC markets.    More fundamentally, it requires compensation rules that align better risk and reward. In the UK a significant proportion of variable compensation now must be deferred for a period of seven years.  This ensures that it can be clawed back over the time scales it generally takes for conduct issues to come to light.  To address the “rolling bad apples” problem, mechanisms are now in place in the UK to ensure that when individuals move on their history will be known to those who consider hiring them.6 The FSB is now considering whether to adopt such an approach more broadly.7                                                        5 The UK’s Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR) recommended that the EU’s market abuse regulation should be extended to cover every major fixed income and currency market, that criminal sanctions be updated, and maximum prison terms extended.  See: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/fmreview.aspx 6 The PRA has introduced requirements for regulated firms to provide employment references to one another in a mandatory template when hiring Senior Managers.  This includes information on an individual’s conduct record, and their fitness and propriety.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   This is all constructive but insufficient.  That’s why we have emphasised measures to ensure firms and their employees take responsibility – individually and collectively – for their own conduct.  These range from securing compliance with minimum standards to a common and dynamic understanding of good practice that is widely understood and collectively enforced.    UK authorities have used their convening powers to encourage market participants to establish standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with market developments.    This is what the Banking Standards Board is doing by promoting higher standards of conduct and competence across the UK banking system.  It’s why the global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is establishing readily understood standards for their markets.  And it’s why the FX Committees will launch in May the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets.  But codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows, or enforces them. This is where the UK’s Senior Managers Regime comes in.   Senior Managers Regime  The SMR addresses the common refrain of senior management that they weren’t aware that misconduct was taking place in their firms.  The SMR sets a series of requirements for the most senior decision-makers of banks, building societies and major investment firms.  The SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability.  Senior Managers are now held accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps (including training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop regulatory breaches in their areas of responsibility.8    And the SMR prescribes responsibilities – typically to the Chair and CEO respectively – for developing and embedding a firm’s culture.    Under the related Certification Regime, firms must also annually assess and certify the fitness and propriety of a wide range of risk-taking employees.  Although the SMR is only a year old and we are all learning by doing, there are encouraging signs that it is making a difference.                                                                                                                                                                                    7 See FSB press release at: http://www.fsb.org/2017/02/fsb-assesses-implementation-progress-and-effects-of-reforms/. Additionally see FSB “Stocktake of efforts to strengthen governance frameworks to mitigate misconduct risks”, forthcoming March 2017. 8 The SMR came into effect on 7 March 2016.  Insurers are required to meet similar standards under Solvency II and in future, the SMR will apply to them directly, as it will to other participants in FICC markets. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   For firms, the SMR is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making processes. Senior Managers are increasingly focusing on building cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical behaviour. In the words of one chairman “responsibility for culture has moved to the top of my agenda.”9    For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and encouraging the necessary changes.  This is particularly true in cases where authority has historically been blurred such as in cross-border banking.    Adoption is spreading.  Some international firms are voluntarily adopting elements of the SMR’s certification requirements to strengthen their global operations.  And the FSB is now explicitly reviewing the merits of such “responsibility mapping”.10  Recent events  The SMR has also been adopted by the Bank of England.11 We chose to because our mission demands that we hold ourselves to the highest standards of governance and accountability.    One of our colleagues did not meet these high standards recently.  Our newly appointed Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, Charlotte Hogg had previously not disclosed a relevant family relationship, as was required under our staff Code of Conduct.  For those who have questioned whether we “get it”, we do.  We know this honest mistake was also a serious mistake – one that was compounded by the fact that Charlotte Hogg had overseen the development of our new Code.   We were clear upfront that there must be consequences for both her and the Bank.   Our minimum response would obviously be what we would expect to see in the firms that we supervise.  Let’s be absolutely clear about this baseline. In analogous situations in the private sector, we expect:   Evidence that the firm is taking the matter seriously;  Proportionate consequences for the individual, including some form of disciplinary warning and possibly some impact on remuneration; and  A wider review of lessons learned if there was any evidence that there was a systemic problem.                                                        9 See page 16, Financial Reporting Council (FRC), “Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards: Report of observations”, July 2016. 10 See Footnote 7 for details.   11 With appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it has a very different range of functions to a commercial bank and is accountable to a different range of stakeholders, including Parliament. For further details see: www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Documents/smr.pdf  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   Now consider the Bank’s response to Charlotte Hogg’s case:   She was formally warned in the strongest – and most public – of terms.   There were consequences for her compensation.  While she couldn’t forfeit a bonus as Bank of England Governors cannot receive one, she waived her salary increase this year.  Court reassigned her COO responsibilities.  Court reconfigured reporting lines and internal structures in order to improve governance, compliance and disciplinary processes, including reassigning the SMR responsibility for implementing our Code.   And, on the basis of this one incident, the independent directors of Court have initiated a widespread review that will draw on the expertise of the Independent Evaluation Office, Internal Audit and the National Audit Office. Its results will be made public. In other words, consistent with our higher standards, the Bank planned a tougher response than we would expect in the private sector, but one that, in our judgement, was still proportionate to an honest mistake that was freely and transparently admitted.   The Treasury Select Committee (TSC) reached its own judgement, which in turn triggered Charlotte Hogg’s decision to resign.12  I fully respect both the TSC’s judgement and her decision.  I wanted to speak to this, not to continue the debate about the rights and wrongs of this case, but instead to highlight some of the lessons that the Bank and industry might draw from it.   In particular, I want to dispel the urban myth that has developed around these events.  While the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) can impose financial penalties and suspension under the SMR, we do not run for our regulated entities a disproportionate “one strike and you are out” regime for an honest mistake.  Neither explicitly nor implicitly.  Not I as Governor, not the CEO of the PRA, not the head of the FCA.  Not any of our supervisors in the PRA.    The SMR is about clear responsibilities, proportionate consequences, and developing a culture of openness and accountability.  Proportionate means taking into account the severity of the incident, the track record of the individual and their firm, as well as the firm’s wider response.  An honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence.   And here’s my point: we must not let recent events inadvertently tighten perceived standards for the industry because that could have Senior Managers running scared, drive compliance underground and undermine                                                       12 For TSC report see: https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmtreasy/.../1092.pdf

Another risk, flagged by some, is that it will also become harder to find candidates of sufficient calibre willing to take on senior roles.  This is why last week I spoke with the CEOs or Chairs of all of the major banks to reiterate our expectations as regulator. I’m glad I did because they were all concerned about precisely such unintended consequences.  The best in the industry are committed to making the SMR work – not because they have to – but because a regime with clear responsibilities, proportionate consequences and a culture of openness helps to build the culture that will over time help regain trust for the industry.   Conclusion  Changes to incentives, new codes and a clearer mapping of responsibilities will all help improve conduct and lay the groundwork for better culture.  Of course, integrity can neither be bought nor regulated. Even with the best possible framework of codes and principles, the soundest compensation schemes, and the most committed efforts to improve transparency, financiers – in both the public and private sectors - must consistently challenge themselves and the standards they uphold.  We are seeking to raise expectations and norms by using a combination of hard and soft law, with much of the latter developed by the private sector. The best view finance as a profession with a purpose to serve their clients.  They see themselves as custodians of their institutions, with a sense of responsibility for the system.   Cultural change takes time. We know this from our own efforts. We have made great strides under our ‘One Bank’ strategic plan. Two-thirds of staff now feel encouraged to try new ideas, three-quarters indicate that their managers act on their suggestions, and 60% are comfortable speaking up on an important issue. All of these metrics have significantly improved in the past few years.13    We have comprehensively overhauled our governance, openness and accountability in recent years.    With the arrival of Anthony Habgood as Chair, Court has been strengthened and now acts as a unitary board and meets the best practice found in the private sector.  Its independent members now have more tangible influence on the Bank, including through formal powers to observe the meetings of the Bank’s policy committees and to commission independent reviews into the Bank’s performance.  Its minutes are now published after a lag of six weeks rather than a hundred years.  It regularly releases reports on matters of                                                       13 ‘Reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion’ speech given by Mark Carney, 9 February 2017

That’s why the independent non-executive directors are reviewing the Bank’s response to recent events.  That’s why our next strategic plan will focus to even greater degree on changing how we work.  To maximise the potential of our people, the Bank needs to embrace fully collaborative working in diverse teams that value robust debate.  And it will focus on improving how we communicate, both internally and externally. We want all our colleagues to feel empowered to raise issues promptly, to challenge and to voice any concerns they have.    These initiatives will help us build the trust that is crucial to delivering our mission. And they will help us merit that trust by making us more effective.   The Bank will learn the lessons of these unfortunate events and apply those lessons to reinforce what’s best in banking and the Bank of England.                                                          14 For details of recent Court reports see: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/ieo/default.aspx.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   By common assent, economists do not agree on much.  I have lost count of the number of jokes about economists whose punchline ends “and they still couldn’t reach a conclusion”.  That is why Harry S Truman, when President of the United States, famously yearned for a one-handed economist.  Whether or not this critique is fair, the issue I will discuss tonight is one on which economists do agree:  productivity matters.     At this point, it is customary to wheel out the following, now rather over-used, Paul Krugman quote:  “productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.”  Despite its over-use, this quote does have one important virtue, something not to be taken lightly in this post-fact, post-truth world:  it is empirically verifiable and appears to be factually accurate.  Let me illustrate that with a simple example.  Since 1850 UK living standards, as measured by GDP per head, have risen roughly 20-fold, a huge gain. How much of that gain can be attributed to higher productivity?  Well, if productivity had flat-lined over the period, UK living standards would only have only doubled.  Or, put differently, in the absence of productivity growth, UK living standards would be an order of magnitude lower today, stuck at late-Victorian levels.     A more refined way of reaching the same conclusion is to decompose growth into the contribution from inputs into the production process – labour and capital – and the contribution from improvements in the efficiency with which these inputs are used – so-called Total Factor Productivity (TFP).  Chart 1 does that for the UK since the Industrial Revolution.  This suggests movements in TFP have accounted for the lion’s share of both the growth and variation in living standards since at least the mid-18th century.     Saying that productivity matters is not the same as saying we understand its determinants.  The past few years have served to underscore just how partial economists’ understanding of productivity remains.  As one illustration, Chart 2 plots successive forecasts by the Bank of England of UK productivity growth since 2008, while Chart 3 shows IMF forecasts of productivity across advanced economies over the same period.    These charts point to a string of material and serially-correlated forecast errors over recent years.  Productivity growth has consistently underperformed relative to expectations, since at least the global financial crisis.  This tale of productivity disappointment, in forecasting and in performance, has been extensively debated and analysed over recent years.  Some have called it the “productivity puzzle”.1    With each year that passes, and as each new turning point in productivity has failed to materialise, this mystery has deepened.  This has led some to conjecture that the world may have entered a new epoch of sub-par productivity growth, an era of secular stagnation.2  Various possible causes of this stagnation have been posited, including adverse demographic trends and diminished rates of innovation.3  The secular stagnation hypothesis is striking in its gloomy implications for future growth in living standards.                                                       1  For example, Barnett et al (2014), Bryson et al (2014) and Weale (2014) 2  For example, Gordon (2014) and Summers (2013). 3  Gordon (2014). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   It is striking, too, because of the starkness with which it contrasts with a second topical hypothesis.  This posits that we may be on the cusp of a Second Machine Age or Fourth Industrial Revolution, an era of secular innovation.4  This might arise from the rise of the robots, artificial intelligence, Big Data, the Internet of Things and the like.  Because of its impact on future living standards, the winner of this secular struggle – stagnation versus innovation – carries enormous societal implications.  A second issue, every bit as topical and important, concerns the distribution of gains in living standards.  Specifically, there has been mounting concern over a number of years about rising levels of within-country inequality across a number of countries.5  Candidate explanations for this widening dispersion in fortunes include failings in the educational system, the impact of technology and globalisation, anti-competitive practices and weaknesses in corporate governance.6  Both of these great debates – innovation versus stagnation, the widening dispersion of income and opportunity across society – have a causative link to productivity.  A household’s income depends largely on wages and these wages depend, in turn, on the productivity of the company at which households work.  So falling productivity growth among firms, and widening dispersion of productivity across firms, could in theory have contributed to stagnant household incomes and widening dispersion in these incomes.     To be clear up front, I do not have a simple explanation, much less an oven-ready solution, for these productivity puzzles.  My aims here are more modest – to draw together some of the available data on productivity to shed light on the puzzles.  Specifically, I will look at historical data for the UK, at international data from a cross-section of countries and at sectoral and firm-specific data for UK companies.    This empirical evidence suggests a long tail of countries and companies with low, slow productivity growth.  These productivity laggards have been unable to keep-up, much less catch-up, with frontier countries and companies.7  At the same time, an upper tail of companies and countries has maintained high and rising levels of productivity.  These productivity leaders are pulling ever-further away from the lower tail.  Or, put differently, rates of technological diffusion from leaders to laggards have slowed, and perhaps even stalled, recently.  This empirical pattern sheds light on the two great macro-economic debates.  It helps explain why we might see the co-existence of secular innovation (among leaders) and stagnation (among laggards).  It helps account for the fall in productivity growth rates – namely, slower rates of diffusion of new innovation to the long lower tail of companies.  And it helps explain the widening dispersion in households’ incomes, as the mirror-image of widening productivity differences across firms.                                                          4   For example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011, 2014). 5  For example, Piketty (2014), Milanovic (2016).  6  Stiglitz (2016). 7  This has been a key theme of recent work by the OECD, for example Andrews et al (2015). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   This empirical prognosis also helps when devising policy measures to tackle these productivity problems.  Even marginal improvements to productivity among the long tail of low-productivity companies – or, equivalently, a speeding up of rates of technological diffusion to these companies – could make significant inroads into the productivity puzzle.  I will discuss possible policies to do so at the end.  Explaining the Productivity Puzzle  Before diving into the data, it is helpful to set out some of the candidate explanations that have been used to explain the productivity puzzle, in the UK and internationally. These hypotheses include:  (a) Mismeasurement  There is a fairly widespread perception that the productivity puzzle may, at least in part, be no more than a statistical mirage.  It certainly seems likely that official statistics underestimate economic activity to some, perhaps significant, degree and with it potential productivity gains.8  For example, a recent review concluded that productivity growth in the UK might be under-estimated by around 0.5 percentage points per year, as a result of the failure fully to capture elements of the digital economy.9  That said, most studies have also found that mismeasurement alone is unlikely to account for the majority of the productivity puzzle, whether in the UK or internationally.10  Many of the mismeasurement problems already existed long before productivity started slowing.  These problems would need to have increased dramatically – and probably unrealistically – to explain fully the productivity slowdown.  Consistent with that, the slowdown in productivity appears to be largely unrelated to the penetration of information technologies across sectors and countries.11     (b) Crisis-related scarring  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that financial crises can have a permanent, or certainly persistent, scarring effect on output and productivity in economies.12  This time’s crisis, the largest in at least a generation, is unlikely to buck that historical trend.  There are several channels through which financial crises might permanently damage corporate sector productivity.  First, a collapse in credit availability is likely to constrict the financing of both new and existing companies and hence constrain their investment plans.  It may hit particularly hard young companies, without access to alternative sources of finance, for whom productivity growth is often fastest.

A second financial channel through which the crisis may have affected firms’ investment is asset prices.  Specifically, many small firms are reliant on property collateral to back their loans.  A fall in property prices tightens their collateral constraint and credit conditions.  Recent Bank of England research has suggested this may have been a potent crisis propagation channel for smaller businesses during the crisis.14  As asset prices have recovered, however, this channel cannot explain the persisting productivity puzzle.  A third channel through which the crisis might have slowed productivity is by hindering resource reallocation between firms and across sectors.15  Flows of capital and labour between companies are one of the key channels through which technology and ideas are diffused.16  Since the crisis, rates of labour market churn between companies have been low and the dispersion in rates of return across sectors has been high.17  Both are consistent with lower rates of factor reallocation having contributed to low productivity.    (c) Forbearance and monetary policy  Some have contended that productivity may have been held back by the actions of the authorities, in particular regulatory forbearance and accommodative monetary policies.  By supporting low-productivity companies who would otherwise have failed, policy actions may have prevented the “creative destruction” of firms.18  Certainly, the level of company liquidations and firm exits has remained low in many countries since the financial crisis, probably lower than would have been expected given the path of GDP.    A number of studies have considered the evidence on the impact of regulatory and monetary policies on firm death and productivity.19  For instance, Arrowsmith et al (2013) examine the prevalence of bank forbearance across the small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector, finding the effect to be small.  The same study finds a potentially larger impact of monetary policy on company failure and productivity.20  That said, it is important to note that employment was also higher as a result of looser monetary policy, with potentially smaller crisis-related scarring effects on labour markets.                                                             13  Chodorow-Reich (2014), Greenstone and Mas (2012) and Edgerton (2012) for the US, Amiti and Weinstein (2013) for Japan, Paravisini et al (2015) for Peru, Bentotila et al (2013) for Spain and Franklin et al (2015) for the UK. 14  Bahaj et al (2016). 15  Riley et al (2015), Barnett et al (2014). 16  For example, Newman et al (2015), Hoekman et al (2004). 17  Barnett et al (2014), Broadbent (2012), Hseih and Klenow (2008), Calligaris et al (2016).  18  For example, McGowan et al (2017) and Pessoa and Van Reenen (2014). 19 Cette et al (2016), Reis (2013), Gopinath et al (2015) and Gorton-Ordones (2015). 20  See also, Broadbent (2012).

Stifled competition in certain sectors and for certain products may have prevented the trickle-down of innovation.31  For example, restrictions on patents and intellectual property (IP) might restrict new entrants and retard replication.  A related hypothesis is that, in today’s globalised markets, network economies of scale and scope are more potent, generating natural monopolies in which single or small sets of players dominate market share.32  A third hypothesis is that the emergence of a long tail of non-frontier companies, failing to keep pace with innovation, is the result of management failings.  For example, Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen have shown that weaknesses in management processes and practices go a long way towards explaining the long                                                       21 Gordon (2012) and Cowen (2011). 22 Gordon (2012). 23 Decker et al (2016) argue there has been a fall in entrepreneurship in high tech sectors over recent decades. 24 Gordon (2014).

The data presented below do not, in the main, allow a direct empirical test of these competing hypotheses.  Many of these hypotheses are, in any case, complementary explanations.  The data do, however, lend greater weight to some, and less to other, of these explanations when accounting for the productivity puzzle.    Historical Productivity Trends  Let me start by placing the UK’s recent productivity performance in a broader historical context.  That is useful for determining just how unusual the recent period of sub-par productivity performance really is.  Since the Industrial Revolution, GDP per capita in the UK has risen almost without interruption, at an annual average rate of 1.2% per year.  In lockstep, there has been a near-monotonic rise in UK productivity.  UK TFP growth since 1750 has averaged 0.8% per year.  Since the Industrial Revolution, GDP per capita has doubled roughly every 65 years and productivity roughly every 85 years.    The implications for living standards have been profound.  Each generation has, since the Industrial Revolution, been around 25% better off than their parents.  This is a story of secular improvements in living standards.  It is also a story of secular innovation, with the two typically going hand in hand.  At least over recent centuries, secular stagnation in living standards and innovation has simply not fit the historical facts.   This is not, however, the whole story.  For a longer-term perspective, Chart 4 shows an estimate of UK TFP back to 1 AD, alongside GDP per head.  The measurement problems in GDP and productivity were probably more acute then than now.  Nonetheless, the “hockey-stick” profiles of both GDP and TFP are striking, both in their own right and in their similarity.  Over the long haul, GDP and TFP have moved in lockstep.  For many centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution, productivity and GDP growth in the UK averaged only around 0.01% per year.  Each generation was only around 0.3% better off than their parents – a scarcely noticeable improvement.  Secular stagnation in living standards and innovation persisted for many centuries.  History suggests both secular innovation and secular stagnation have, at different times, been the norm.  Although productivity growth has picked up since the Industrial Revolution, it has still been subject to significant twists and turns.  Chart 5 plots UK labour market productivity since 1760, decomposed into the contribution from additional capital per worker (“capital deepening”) and TFP.  Both have fluctuated significantly and have made substantial contributions to UK productivity growth over time.                                                        33  Bloom and Van Reenen (2007). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   Chart 6 looks more closely at the historical evolution of UK TFP growth. Trends in TFP have been far from constant, with decadal spans when productivity has averaged little more than zero and others where it has averaged close to 2%.  The latter episodes have typically been associated with periods of rapid technological change, as after the three industrial revolutions of the mid-18th, mid-19th and mid-20th centuries.  In each case, there was a significant lag between the arrival of new technologies and their impact on productivity.  Rates of technological diffusion were relatively slow and sedate.  This is typically felt to have reflected the time it takes for new technologies to find widespread use and become General Purpose Technologies (GPTs).34  After the first Industrial Revolution, it took around 70-100 years for technological diffusion to occur, GPTs to emerge and TFP and living standards to rise.35  Subsequent industrial revolutions have also seen a lag between the emergence of new technologies and their impact on productivity.  But there is evidence this diffusion lag may have shortened.  Comin and Mestieri (2014) estimate the diffusion lag during the industrial revolutions of the late 19th and 20th centuries to have been 20-30 years, roughly a third of that during the first industrial revolution.  This may have reflected increased flows of labour, capital, ideas and information between firms, regions, sectors and countries.  Table 1 looks at average rates of UK TFP growth over the past 2000 years.  It tells a tale of long waves of productivity stagnation and innovation.  The historical data do not reject either hypothesis.  Table 1 also puts into historical perspective the UK’s recent productivity slowdown.  For the past decade, average productivity growth has been negative.  This is unusual, if not unique, historically.  You would have to go right back to the 18th century to see a similarly lengthy period of stagnant productivity.     Global Productivity Trends  If UK productivity patterns are unusual relative to the past, how unusual are they relative to other countries?  To assess that, I draw on a panel of around 116 countries, advanced and emerging, going back to 1950, using data from the Penn World Tables.36  Chart 7 plots average TFP growth across the whole sample of countries, while Chart 8 does so separately for advanced and emerging economies.  Several interesting features emerge.  First, the slowdown of productivity growth has clearly been a global phenomenon, not a UK-specific one.   From 1950 to 1970, median global productivity growth averaged 1.9% per year.  Since 1980, it has averaged 0.3% per year.  Whatever is driving the productivity puzzle, it has global rather than local roots.                                                           34  Helpman et al (1998). 35  Comin and Mestieri (2014).   36  Feenstra et al (2015). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   Second, this global productivity slowdown is clearly not a recent phenomenon.  It appears to have started in many advanced countries in the 1970s.37  Certainly, the productivity puzzle is not something which has emerged since the global financial crisis, though it seems the crisis has amplified pre-existing trends.  Explanations for the productivity puzzle based on crisis-related scarring are likely to be, at best, partial.   Third, the productivity slowdown has been experienced by both advanced and emerging economies.  The slowdown in median productivity growth after the 1970s among both advanced and emerging market economies is around 1¾ percentage points (Chart 8).  Indeed, looking at country-specific trends, it is striking just how generalised the productivity slowdown has been (Chart 9).   Fourth, one way of understanding this global productivity slowdown comes from decomposing it into changes in rates of innovation among countries operating at the productivity frontier and changes in rates of diffusion from frontier to non-frontier countries.  Growth theory would predict that, over time, technological diffusion should lead to catch-up between frontier and non-frontier countries.38  And the greater the distance to the frontier, the faster these rates of catch-up are likely to be.  So what explains the 1¾ percentage point slowdown in global productivity growth since the 1970s – slower innovation at the frontier or slower diffusion to the periphery?  If the frontier country is taken to be the United States, then slowing innovation can only account for a small fraction of the global slowing, not least because the US only has about a 20% weight in world GDP.  In other words, the lion’s share of the slowing in global productivity is the result of slower diffusion of innovation from frontier to non-frontier countries.  To illustrate that, Chart 10 plots the distribution of levels of productivity across countries over a set of sample periods, where productivity is measured relative to a frontier country (the United States) indexed to one.  Comparing the distributions in the 1950s and 1970s, there is a clear rightward shift.  Cross-country productivity convergence or catch-up was underway, as the Classical growth model would suggest.  In recent decades, however, that pattern has changed.  Comparing the 1970s with the 1990s, there is a small leftward shift in the probability mass.  And in the period since the global financial crisis, there has been a further leftward shift in the distribution and a widening of its range.  Today, non-frontier countries are about as far from the technological frontier as they were in the 1950s.    Another way of illustrating the same point is by looking at differences in productivity between frontier and periphery countries over time (Chart 11).  In the decades immediately following the Second World War, the Classical growth model was operating effectively, with catch-up in productivity underway and at faster rates among emerging market countries with furthest to travel to the frontier.                                                        37  Gordon (2014). 38  Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) and Rodrik (2011). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   Since the 1980s, however, that convergence process appears to have stalled, perhaps even to have gone into reverse, in both advanced and emerging economies.  The gap to the frontier has failed to close and, in particular for emerging market countries, has widened.  Classical growth dynamics appear for some reason to have stopped operating, with the gap to the frontier widening the more so the greater the distance to it.  It is possible to quantify this slowing in convergence using a similar approach to that used to measure output convergence in the cross-country growth literature.39  Specifically, a country’s productivity growth can be linked by a convergence parameter to its productivity gap to the frontier country.  This parameter can be estimated econometrically and tracked over time.40    Chart 12 shows a time-series of this convergence coefficient estimated using a rolling regression.  In the 1980s, this coefficient averaged 0.8.  That is to say, every 10 per cent productivity gap relative to the frontier country resulted, on average, in productivity growth being 0.8 percentage points higher than in the frontier country.  By 2000, that convergence coefficient had roughly halved.  By the end of the sample, the coefficient is statistically insignificant from zero.  Convergence had not just slowed but stalled.    One of the key determinants of international technology transfer has been found to be cross-border flows of goods and services, people and money and capital.41  While they have waxed and waned historically, all of these have tended to rise rapidly since the middle of the 20th century.  Other things equal, that would have been expected to increase the speed of diffusion of innovation across countries over that period.  In practice, the opposite appears to have occurred.  Taken at face value, these patterns are both striking and puzzling.  Not only do they sit oddly with Classical growth theory.  They are also at odds with the evidence of history, which has been that rates of technological diffusion have been rising rather than falling over time, and with secular trends in international flows of factors of production.  At the very time we would have expected it to be firing on all cylinders, the technological diffusion engine globally has been misfiring.  This adds to the productivity puzzle.  Sectoral Productivity Trends  Some further insight into these puzzles comes from looking at the productivity data in more granular detail.42  We start by considering sectoral patterns of productivity among UK companies.    Sectoral shifts in the economy could plausibly account for some of the fall in productivity growth.  There has been a secular shift over time away from manufacturing and towards services, with the employment share in                                                       39 Rodrik (2011). 40 Based on the following equation:  𝑃𝑖𝑡−𝑃𝑓𝑡= 𝑎𝑖+ 𝑏𝑖∗ 𝐺𝐴𝑃𝑖  where 𝑃𝑖𝑡 is growth in TFP for country i in year t, Pft is the growth in TFP for the frontier country (US) in year t, GAPi  is the gap between the level of TFP in country i and the US as a percentage, ai is a constant capturing the average pace of convergence and bi captures how much of the speed of convergence depends on the TFP gap. 41 For example, Hoekman et al (2004), Stoyanov and Zubanov (2012) and Newman et al (2015). 42 See McCafferty (2014) for a discussion of productivity from a sectoral perspective.

Because productivity growth in manufacturing is higher than in services, this shift could plausibly account for some of the fall in aggregate productivity growth.  Even if we correct for this compositional effect, however, the slowdown in UK productivity growth remains.    Chart 13 looks at the evolution of different UK sectors’ productivity, while Table 2 looks at the contributions of various sectors to UK productivity growth in the decades either side of the global financial crisis.  Pre-crisis, the strongest rises in measured productivity were in manufacturing, information and communication and financial services, all of which experienced annual growth of over 4%.  But growth was not confined to these sectors, with virtually all sectors making a positive contribution to productivity growth.  In the period since the crisis, those pre-crisis trends have changed dramatically.  Virtually every sector has seen productivity flat-line.  The contributions of all sectors to productivity growth have fallen and most are tightly bunched around zero (Table 2).43  Whatever has caused UK productivity growth to fall, it has done so on a generalised, cross-sector basis.    It is sometimes asserted that, without the collapse in financial services output associated with the financial crisis, the UK’s productivity performance would have held up.  It is certainly true that financial sector productivity was probably over-stated in the run-up to the crisis.44  Nonetheless, the subsequent sharp fall in financial services productivity is plainly not the whole story.  Of the 1.7 percentage point fall in the UK’s productivity growth since 2008, less than a third can be accounted for by financial services (Table 2).    One sectoral story that could account for this generalised slowing is a reduced rate of factor reallocation between sectors.45  Consistent with that hypothesis, the dispersion of productivity across industries has increased significantly over the last 40 years.  And the variance in sectoral productivity gaps, relative to  pre-crisis trends, also increased sharply after the crisis (Chart 14).   Nonetheless, this pickup in the dispersion of productivity across sectors is dwarfed by the increase in productivity dispersion within sectors (Chart 15).  This suggests that any obstacles to the movement of resources within the economy have been more important within sectors than across them.  With that in mind, it is firm-by-firm data to which we now turn.  Firm-level productivity trends  A more granular lens still comes from looking at firm-by-firm productivity data.  The OECD has recently undertaken extensive analysis using company-level data to assess global productivity patterns.46  We draw on two datasets for the UK that can prospectively shed light on firm-level trends.                                                         43 See Billet and Schneider (2016) for an interactive tool for examining sectoral productivity trends. 44 Haldane et al (2010). 45 Bank of England (2016), Barnett et al (2014). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12    The first is based on the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Business Survey and employment surveys.47  The ONS combines these surveys in the form of the Annual Respondent Database (ARDx).  The sample covers around 40,000 companies per year, accounting for around 80% of UK GDP.  The data covers the period 2002 to 2014.  This survey is stratified to match the UK population of companies and so should be broadly representative of aggregate UK trends.   The second is the Bureau van Dijk (BvD) FAME database, compiled from UK company accounts.  Whereas larger firms are required to submit full annual accounts, there are exemptions for smaller firms.  So the sample is smaller, at around 20,000 firms per year, and is biased towards larger firms.  However, it contains detailed data on firm-level characteristics which are useful when exploring the determinants of productivity.  These data enable us to examine the distribution of productivity across firms.  Chart 16a plots this distribution in 2014, based on the ONS data.48  It is wide and elongated, with a long, thin upper tail of  high-productivity firms and a short, fat lower tail of low-productivity firms.  This shape means that modal productivity among UK companies is around 50% lower than mean productivity.49  One interesting question is how this distribution has evolved over time.  Chart 17 looks at different percentiles of the firm-level productivity distribution over time, both in levels terms and indexed to 2002=100.  There has been a widening dispersion in the distribution of productivity across companies over time.  In particular, there is a striking and widening divergence between frontier firms (say, the 99th percentile of firms) and the long tail of non-frontier companies.  If we define frontier firms as the top 5% of firms by productivity performance, in line with the OECD, there is clear and widening blue water between frontier and laggard companies (Chart 18).  In arithmetic terms, it is non-frontier companies that largely explain flat-lining productivity over recent years (Chart 19).   These dynamics cast the secular innovation versus stagnation debate in an interesting light.  The distribution of UK companies’ productivity suggests both forces have been operating, albeit at different points in the distribution – innovation in the upper tail, stagnation in the lower one.  Widening productivity dispersion means that secular innovation and stagnation are complementary, not competing, hypotheses.    For a relatively small cohort of frontier companies, secular innovation is clearly evident, with both high and rapidly-rising levels of productivity.  For example, around 1% of UK firms have seen average productivity growth of around 6% per year.  This poses a serious challenge to the notion that stalling innovation has been                                                                                                                                                                                 46  For example, Andrews et al (2015). 47  This work contains statistical data from ONS which is Crown Copyright.

At the same time, for a large cohort of non-frontier companies secular stagnation is evident, with low and flat-lining levels of productivity.  For example, around one-third of UK companies have seen no rise in productivity throughout this century.  This is a long tail.   A second implication of these results, consistent with the cross-country evidence, is that rates of technological diffusion from frontier to non-frontier companies appear to have slowed.  It is stalling diffusion, rather than stifled innovation, that accounts for the UK’s productivity puzzle.  These patterns are not unique to the UK.  They are shared by a number of other countries internationally.  That has led the OECD to conclude that the technological diffusion engine among companies appears to have broken.50    A comparison of the UK with other advanced countries suggests that both the degree of dispersion in productivity performance is larger in the UK, and that this dispersion has widened more in the UK, than in other countries.  The dispersion of services sector productivity is more than 50% higher in the UK than in other advanced economies (Chart 20a).  It has also widened by materially more in the UK.  Even in a world of long and lengthening tails of low-productivity companies, the UK is a striking outlier.  One potential explanation for this longer tail of UK companies than elsewhere is poor management practices.  Using the database developed by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), we can plot a normalised distribution of management skills for a subset of UK firms.51  This suggests (a lack of) management quality is a plausible candidate explanation for the UK’s long tail of companies, as Bloom and Van Reenen find (Chart 21).  Looked at quantitatively, there is a statistically significant link between the quality of firms’ management processes and practices and their productivity.  And the effect is large.  A one standard deviation improvement in the quality of management raises productivity by, on average, around 10%.  This suggests potentially high returns to policies which improve the quality of management within companies.       Decomposing the Distribution   We can go further in uncovering some of the characteristics of the companies in the upper and lower tails.  Might they simply reflect sharp regional differences in productivity, with frontier companies clustered in some regions and laggards in others?  Might it simply reflect some sectors, such as manufacturing, generating higher levels of productivity and sitting in the frontier while others, such as services, occupy the lower tail?    Charts 22a to 22f look at different cuts of the data according to:  (a) the UK region in which the company is based; (b) the sector in which the company operates;  (c) whether the company exports overseas;   (d) whether the company is foreign-owned;  (e) whether the company has introduced new products and processes in the preceding three years;  (f) the size of the firm;  and (g) the company’s leverage.                                                        50  Andrews et al (2015). 51  With thanks to John Van Reenen for making these data available to us. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   Beginning with the regional picture, it is well-known that there are sharp differences in average productivity across UK regions.52  For example, the UK’s highest productivity region (London) is around 75% more productive than its lowest (the North East).  Nonetheless, if we look at the regional distribution of productivity, the similarities are more striking than the differences (Chart 22a).  Every region has the same long, thin upper tail of frontier companies and a short, fat lower tail of laggard firms.    It is true, as a matter of arithmetic, that the upper tail of frontier companies is somewhat larger, and the lower tail of laggards shorter, in London than in, say, the North East.  But the key point is that every region has plenty of both types of firm.  Regional differences are not the main factor explaining the UK’s long tail of firms nor why this tail is longer in the UK than elsewhere.  Second, the same is true, by and large, if we move from regions to sectors.  There are some reasonably marked differences in average levels of productivity across sector.  For example, manufacturing is on average around 35% more productive than construction.  Nonetheless, these differences are dwarfed by variations within each sector (Chart 22b).  Each has a long, thin upper tail and a short, fat lower tail.  Whatever is driving slower rates of technological diffusion, sector-specific technologies are not it.    Third, if we look at the external-facing profile of firms, we begin to uncover some important differences  (Chart 22c and d).  Firms which export have systematically higher levels of productivity than  domestically-oriented firms, on average by around a third.  The same is true, even more dramatically, for foreign-owned firms.  Their average productivity is twice that of domestically-oriented firms.  This is not altogether surprising.  Firms that export are likely to be exposed to global competition and many are integrated into global supply chains.  This increases incentives to boost efficiencies and to match international best practices.53  The self-same forces are likely to be at play among foreign-owned firms.  The productivity benefits these external-facing firms bring underscore the importance of openness to trade and foreign direct investment in generating rising productivity and living standards over time.  We can quantify these benefits by looking in more detail at the relationship between firms’ productivity and their export share (Chart 23).  There is a positive and statistically-significant relationship.  Every 10 percentage point increase in a company’s export share of turnover is, on average, associated with a 3% increase in productivity.  While causation could operate in either direction, this illustrates the productivity benefits of a corporate sector which is open to trade and exposed to external competition and innovation.   Chart 22e classifies firms according to their spending on new products and processes.  The differences here are not especially surprising, with average productivity around 20% higher among firms investing in new                                                       52  For example, Haldane (2016). 53  Newman et al (2015).

Clearly, they do not explain most of the productivity differences across companies.  Firm size appears to matter somewhat more to productivity (Chart 22f).  For example, for small firms (with fewer than 50 employees) the picture is a nuanced one.  In general, their average levels of productivity are materially lower than for larger firms, on average around 7% lower.  There is, in particular, a larger lower tail of small companies with low, or even negative, levels of productivity.  Nonetheless, some smaller companies do inhabit the high-productivity, upper tail.  Moreover, small companies tend to exhibit faster rates of productivity growth than larger firms, even when it is from a lower base.  Table 3 looks at average productivity growth rates among firms of different size.  Smaller firms have higher average growth rates, and greater dispersion in these growth rates, than larger ones.   Finally, when it comes to companies’ leverage, the picture is also a nuanced one.54  High leverage is a characteristic of firms with two very distinct productivity profiles (Chart 22g).  Very low-productivity firms tend to have high leverage because their profits, repayment capacity and investment are low.  But high leverage also characterises high-productivity firms, whose profits, borrowing and investment are high.  These patterns provide an explanation for the damaging impact of the crisis on productivity growth.  The absence of credit may have affected disproportionately high leverage, high productivity companies operating in the upper tail.  The distribution of debt is also important when gauging what impact monetary policy and regulatory forbearance may have had on the lower tail of companies, to which I now turn.  The Role of Monetary Policy  These distributional data enable us to look closely at the lower tail of companies who have potentially been protected from failure since the global financial crisis by regulatory forbearance and accommodative monetary policies.  Chart 16b plots this lower tail on three dates, pre-crisis (2002), mid-crisis (2008) and post-crisis (2014).  Unsurprisingly, the crisis fattened the lower tail.    Since the crisis, however, this tail has shrunk again.  The tail of low-productivity companies today is, if anything, smaller than it was pre-crisis.  On the face of it, that is not easy to square with (regulatory and monetary) policies having had a significantly damaging impact on aggregate productivity by keeping alive a large tail of low-productivity companies.   However, these distributions cannot by themselves identify the role monetary policy has played in influencing companies’ fortunes.  To gauge that, we need to undertake a counter-factual exercise.  Specifically, we                                                       54  Bahaj, Foulis, Gal and Pinter (2016).

What impact would that have had on companies’ solvency and hence on aggregate productivity?  With data on their debts, interest payments and profits, we can simulate interest cover ratios for each company in our sample – that is to say, their profits before interest divided by interest paid (Chart 24).  And by making an assumption about the level of the interest cover ratio at which a company is forced to default, we can simulate how a different interest rate path might have affected the solvency of each firm and hence aggregate productivity.  For the purposes of the experiment, we assume a default threshold for the interest cover ratio of one.  That is to say, we assume a company that cannot cover its interest payments with profits fails.  Different assumptions are clearly possible.  The effect of higher interest rates is to shift the distribution of companies’ interest cover ratios to the left, so that a number of them now lie below the solvency threshold.  In the simulation, an extra 10% of companies go bankrupt.  This would translate into an immediate loss of around 1½ million jobs – a very significant macro-economic cost.    Nonetheless, there are also prospectively productivity benefits.  The scale of these benefits depends on the productivity characteristics of those firms going bust and specifically on their levels of debt.  As Chart 25 shows, there is a U-shaped relationship between firms’ productivity and debt, with both high-productivity (“gazelles”) and low-productivity (“zombie”) companies having high debt ratios.  Higher interest rates hit both types of company and so the net effect on productivity is an empirical question.  If we assume all firms have the same solvency threshold, more of the firms going bust are zombies than gazelles – there is more creative destruction than destructive destruction (Chart 24c).  Nonetheless, the positive impact of higher interest rates on aggregate productivity is significantly tempered by the bankruptcy of some high-leverage, high-productivity companies.  The overall effect of higher interest rates in the simulation is to boost the level of productivity by around 1 or 2% relative to the baseline.    This is a significant productivity gain.  At the same time, it does not account for the majority of the productivity shortfall since the crisis.  Moreover, it comes at a hefty employment cost.  Should monetary policymakers have sacrificed 1 ½ million jobs for the sake of an extra 1 or 2% of productivity?  Hand on heart, I can tell you this one would not knowingly have done so.      Of course, this experiment is only illustrative and is based on a number of simplifying assumptions.  For example, it assumes there is no adverse effect on the output of firms who do not go bust but who nonetheless find their cashflows squeezed.  This would tend to raise the output and employment cost of higher interest rates and make the terms of trade for productivity improvements less favourable still.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17  17   Acting in the opposite direction, gazelle firms may be able to borrow to avoid bankruptcy in the event of higher interest rates – their solvency threshold might be higher than for zombie companies.  If we assumed instead that only the lowest-productivity firms went bust, the boost to productivity is around 3% (Chart 24d).  This is more material, but would still need to be weighed against the significant output and employment cost. The Dispersion of Productivity and Wages  A final use to which the distributional data can be put is to analyse whether rising dispersion in productivity among firms is mirrored in rising dispersion of wages among households.  Have productivity differences been a contributor to rising income inequalities?  This has been the subject of a number of recent empirical studies, which have tended to find productivity to have been a significant factor.55    A useful starting point is the distribution of wages across our panel of firms (Chart 26).  There is some evidence of a widening dispersion in wages across companies over time.  The pattern broadly mirrors productivity, with wages among the top 1% of companies rising, except immediately after the financial crisis.  At the same time, pay has largely stagnated among as many as three-quarters of the firms in the distribution.   By itself, this does not tell us how closely firm-level pay and productivity have been correlated and what contribution productivity may have played in widening the dispersion of wages.56  While there is an established literature on the aggregate relationship between productivity and wages, the relationship between firms’ productivity and average pay levels is less certain. Nevertheless, looking at the distributions of pay and productivity, three points stand out (Chart 27).    First, labour productivity can explain around 60% of the variation in average pay across firms, controlling for other firm characteristics.  On average, firms with 1% higher productivity have 0.2% higher pay.  And firms with 1 percentage point faster productivity growth have 0.5 percentage points faster wage growth (Table 4).  Productivity dispersion across companies is an important, if by no means the only, driver of wage dispersion across households.  Second, the distribution of pay is materially narrower than for productivity.  The reason for this is that a significant part of firm-specific variation in productivity is absorbed by firms in their profits or reflected in their prices.  The reason is that firms’ profits and prices absorb a significant part of firm-specific variation in productivity.  Many of the workers in the more productive tail of firms are being underpaid relative to their average productivity, which results in frontier firms making a larger profit share.  The opposite is the case at the other end of the productivity distribution.                                                         55 For example, Furman and Orszag (2016) 56 There is time series evidence to suggest a strong historical relationship between aggregate productivity and real wages.  For example, Castle and Hendry, Blundell et al (2013) and Disney et al (2013). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18  18   This analysis focusses on differences in pay across firms.  But what about pay within firms?57  We can examine this by tracking differences between the average pay in each company and the pay of their highest paid director.  Chart 28 plots the median across firms of these series over time, while Chart 29 compares the variance of each series as well as the gap between average pay and the highest paid director.   Since 1998, the variance in average pay and director pay has increased across firms, although it has fallen notably since the financial crisis.  The median gap between average pay and director pay has followed a similar pattern.  Although these data are far from perfect they suggest that, while within-firm pay differentials have accounted for some of the increased dispersion in pay across households, across-firm variations have made a larger contribution.  Tackling the Productivity Puzzle  There has been no shortage of public policy ideas over recent years for boosting productivity growth.  Reports by the IMF and OECD have suggested measures ranging from increased infrastructure spending to improved education and training programmes.58   Earlier this year, the UK Government issued a Green Paper setting out various pillars to support productivity.59  And, most recently, here at the LSE the Growth Commission produced their second report on measures to boost UK productivity.60  In generic terms, these policy measures fall into three categories.  First, there are measures which support all companies, irrespective of sector, region or characteristic.  For example, last year’s Autumn Statement provided additional financial support for UK infrastructure spending, while in the Budget a couple of weeks ago the UK government announced plans for increased support for technical skills.  Second, there are measures which support technological innovation – the creation and growth of frontier firms.  One potentially important micro-economic measure supporting innovation is greater recognition of the importance of companies’ intangible assets, such as intellectual property (IP).  These constitute an increasing fraction of companies’ total assets, but are not measured or valued in as consistent and coherent a way as tangible assets such as plants and machinery.  This can have real costs for the companies concerned.  It means these assets are often not valued fully by investors and lenders.  This raises the cost of capital for these firms to sub-optimally high levels – a market failure.  Remedying that market failure, by ensuring intangible assets are consistently and coherently valued, is important if these companies are to grow to reach their full potential.61                                                        57 For example, Song et al (2015) find that virtually all the rise in earnings dispersion between workers is accounted for by increasing dispersion across the average wages paid by different firms. 58 Andrews et al (2015) and Dabla-Norris et al (2015). 59 HM Government (2013). 60 Aghion et al (2017). 61  Big Innovation Centre (2017b). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 19  19   More broadly, it is possible that current UK corporate governance practices may act as a brake on innovative companies.  A recent report by the Big Innovation Centre makes important proposals for re-purposing UK companies to support long-term investment and productivity.62  The government recently initiated a Patient Capital Review to explore how best to support the financing of innovative companies as they scale-up.63  A third category of policy measure focusses on the fortunes, not of innovative frontier companies, but the long tail of low-productivity non-frontier firms.  These companies have tended to be focussed on somewhat less historically.  Indeed, their large numbers and disparate characteristics may be one reason why this is the case.  Yet given their scale, the returns to modest improvements in these firms could be dramatic.  As a thought experiment, imagine productivity growth in the second, third and fourth quartiles of the distribution of UK firms’ productivity could be boosted to match the productivity of the quartile above.  That sounds ambitious but achievable.  Arithmetically, that would deliver a boost to aggregate UK productivity of around 13%, taking the UK to within 90-95% of German and French levels of productivity respectively.  The policy question is how to effect those improvements. One idea which offers real potential comes from the Productivity Commission chaired by Sir Charlie Mayfield.64  This starts from the assumption that not only is there a long tail of companies, but that many are unaware of that fact.  For the same reason most  car-owners believe they are above-average drivers, most companies might well believe they have  above-average levels of productivity.    In fact, we know most companies have below-average levels of productivity and a large fraction of them have seen no productivity improvement for several decades.  The Mayfield Commission aims to create an app which enables companies to measure their productivity and benchmark themselves against other companies operating in similar sectors and regions.  By shining a light on companies’ relative performance, the aim is that this would serve as a catalyst for remedial action by company management.  Indeed, the aim is to provide firms not only with a means of benchmarking themselves, but with tools to improve performance along identified areas.  These online tools would be a mechanism for speeding-up the process of technological diffusion to the long tail.    One practical way of doing so is by pairing up companies, frontier and non-frontier, to enable the sharing of best practices.  This is effectively a mentoring scheme for firms, the like of which is already common among individuals.  What would be in it for frontier companies?  A more productive supply chain is clearly in their interests.  The public sector could also play a useful nudging role in its procurement practices.                                                          62  Big Innovation Centre (2017a). 63  HM Treasury and Department for Business (2017). 64  Mayfield (2016). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 20  20   A more ambitious idea still, which I have been considering with Philip Bond, is to develop a virtual environment which would enable companies to simulate changes to their business processes and practices.  These platforms are already used by many frontier firms to assess the impact of new technologies and processes on their business.  These tools can be created, and tailored to companies’ circumstances, at relatively low cost.  This makes them a potentially cost-effective way of facilitating diffusion to the long tail.    Policy measures such as these are valuable in boosting living standards and narrowing the dispersion of incomes across households.  As a by-product, they also potentially offer benefits to monetary policymakers.  Structural measures to boost investment will tend to raise the interest rate in the economy which equilibrates investment opportunities and savings plans.  This is sometimes known colloquially as r*. Policies which boost r* mean that a given interest rate is likely to impart greater stimulus.  Or, put differently, they mean the same level of demand in the economy can be achieved with a higher interest rate.  And a “pivot” in the mix of policies, with somewhat less of a contribution from monetary policy and more from structural policies, would probably be desirable.  Not least, it could help mitigate any adverse impact of accommodative monetary policies on productivity or the distribution of income and wealth.  Conclusion  Productivity is a gift for rising living standards, perhaps the greatest gift.  It is not, however, one that always keeps on giving, as recent events attest.  Whether in supporting living standards, or in shrinking their distribution, tackling the global productivity puzzle is among the most pressing public policy issues today.   If history is any guide, there is unlikely to be any single measure which puts productivity growth back on track.  But measures which support the long tail of companies, currently operating at low levels of productivity, have the potential to do considerable good.    As Olympic athletes have shown, marginal improvements accumulated over time can deliver world-beating performance.  Applying those marginal gains to the population of UK companies could significantly improve UK living standards, even if those are harder to measure than gold medals.

William C Dudley: Reforming culture for the long termRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the Banking Standards Board, London, United Kingdom, 21 March 2017.*   *   *Thank you for your kind welcome.I am grateful to the Banking Standards Board for organizing this meeting.  For several years, theFederal Reserve Bank of New York and the Banking Standards Board have each worked toimprove culture within the financial services industry in the world’s two most important financialcenters.  I would like to especially thank Sir Richard Lambert, Dame Colette Bowe, AlisonCottrell, and the members of their team—all of whom have traveled several times to New York toattend meetings and conferences on this issue of culture.  I am very pleased to have theopportunity to reciprocate and to join you today in London.  As always, what I have to say reflectsmy own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the FederalReserve System.This morning, I would like to highlight three issues that are critical to improving culture within thefinancial services industry:First, defining and clarifying purpose, because clear goals are necessary if one is to assessperformance;Second, measurement of how firms and the industry are performing; andThird, whether incentives encourage behaviors consistent with the goals one wishes toachieve. I will then conclude by offering some thoughts on why good culture is critical to success infinancial services. Let us start with purpose because it is a prerequisite for the other two.  Baroness Onora O’Neill,a member of the Banking Standards Board, was the keynote speaker at the New York Fed’s thirdculture conference, held in October 2016.  Her message to the audience of senior bankers andregulators was a challenge to think about the purpose of their organizations.  Namely, what areyou for?I believe the question “what are you for” can be a litmus test for a firm confronted withchallenges.  Let me give you just one example, from the Salz Review in 2013.  Employees in theeight divisions of Barclays were asked to state their core values.  Three of the eight divisions didnot rank “customer service” as a core value.  Two of these divisions were retail lines—UK retailbanks and the Barclays credit card.  The third was the firm’s African subsidiary, which alsooffered retail banking services.My intent here is not to pick on Barclays. Indeed, the firm should be commended for firstcommissioning and then publishing the Salz Review—Sir David Walker set an example ofleadership in his candor and transparency.  Instead, my purpose is to make the point: If youcannot answer the question “what are you for,” or if your answers do not make sense in light ofyour business, then it is time to re-examine your purpose. For any bank, a statement of purpose should emphasize sustainable success, not short-runprofit.  This is because of the many important roles that banks play in the economy.  They arecritical intermediaries between savers and borrowers; they provide essential infrastructure; theysupport well-functioning financial markets; and they act as custodians of our wealth.  Thesefunctions require long-term commitment.  They should not be erratic or ephemeral.  The123 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
economy needs a steady supply of competent, honest, and reliable banking services in order tofunction.  That is why any bank should emphasize the long term over the short term.After purpose comes measurement.  In the context of culture, however, calculating particularmetrics is less important than the goals of such measurement.  The first goal is to assess howyou are doing compared to what you have set out to do.  In other words, are you fulfilling yourpurpose?  The second goal is to assess how you stack up against your peers.  In both ways,measurement provides critical benchmarking, without which firms and the industry cannotassess whether they are making progress. Since the beginning of our work on culture, my colleagues and I have recognized thatmeasurement is indispensable to improving bank culture.  We have not been alone in this view. At the New York Fed’s first conference on cultural reform, in October 2014, Sir David Walkerencouraged banking leaders to measure behavior within their firms in order to promoteaccountability.  Pursuing this theme, several panelists addressed the use of measurement as acorporate governance tool.  They argued that standardized metrics could help quantify thejudgment and behavior of individual employees, making the behavioral components of annualperformance reviews more objective.  The same information could also aid a firm’s seniorleaders in assessing the effectiveness of their communications about how the firm conducts itsbusiness.  For my part, I encouraged the industry to collaborate on a common culture survey thatcould serve as a benchmark for behavior.  I also agreed with Sir David that measurement andaccountability should not be decoupled.Last week, the BSB published the results of its industry-wide benchmarking survey on culture. This is a critical step forward in the industry’s effort to get better data on how firms are doing oncultural issues, to identify areas for improvement, and to demonstrate a public commitment toimprovement.  Several facets of the BSB’s report struck me as particularly significant. First, in addition to creating a benchmarking survey—which generated approximately 28,000responses—the BSB conducted focus groups with junior employees and interviews with seniorleaders to add depth to what the survey results indicated.  That represents a significantinvestment of time by the BSB and those who participated in the qualitative review.  Thatcommitment is essential for understanding the context and meaning of responses withinindividual firms.Second, the survey asked respondents to agree or disagree with a number of statements. Those statements were direct and cut to the core of cultural issues in banking.  Some of thestandouts, in my view, included:“I believe senior leaders in my organization mean what they say.”“In my organization we are encouraged to follow the spirit of the rules (what they mean, notjust the words).”“I see people in my organization turn a blind eye to inappropriate behavior.”“If I raised concerns about the way we work, I would be worried about the negativeconsequences for me.”Third, the results suggest that the respondents did not pull their punches.  Nearly 30 percentanswered that they would be worried about negative consequences if they raised concerns atwork.  That shows, perhaps more than any other finding, that there is still a long way to go increating a culture for long-term success in banking.  In addition, approximately one quarter ofemployees did not affirmatively agree that their organization puts customers at the center ofbusiness decisions.  That is also of concern if we want an industry that is sustainable over thelong term.45 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
I encourage you to read the BSB’s report, if you haven’t already.  And let me emphasize that thereport is not intended as a cudgel or to assign blame.  Rather, as I see it, the report gives theindustry an opportunity to improve against a benchmark.  Again, I want to acknowledge the BSB’scontribution and thank them for all their work.Now the burden shifts from the BSB to you, the industry.  What will you do with these results? We all want to see progress on culture and behavior.  How will you—both within firms andcollectively—move the needle on culture and behavior over the next few years? I suggest that if you want next year’s results to be better than this year’s, you might start byfocusing on incentives. As I have argued before, incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture.  If you want aculture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with thebehaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.Incentives—compensation and promotion, in particular—are powerful tools for communicatingthe conduct and culture you desire for your firm.  Of course, the cultures of firms can and shouldvary.  But, the culture of every bank should share a common theme: stewardship—a word thatimplies professional care, exercised year after year for the benefit of the firm and itsstakeholders.  A commitment to the long term must be at the core of banking.  Incentives within afirm should support that goal, not undermine it.My emphasis on incentives is not new, but it bears repeating.  Bad incentives were a keycontributing factor in the financial crisis.  In the United States, the Financial Crisis InquiryCommission concluded that “Compensation systems—designed in an environment of cheapmoney, intense competition, and light regulation—too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term gain—without proper consideration of long-term consequences.”   This theme applied to alllevels of banking organizations.  One notable example was mortgage brokers, who were paidbased on the volume of loans they generated, not their quality.The financial crisis came to a head in the fall of 2008.  Fast forward eight years to the fall of2016.  Wells Fargo’s chairman and CEO resigned after regulators uncovered what appeared tobe widespread fraud in the retail bank.  Compensation, once again, seems to be at the center ofa scandal.  Neighborhood bankers were paid based on the volume of new accounts opened,apparently with utter disregard for whether customers wanted them or even knew about them. And, like mortgage brokers in the early 2000s, it appears that job security depended almostexclusively on meeting targets, regardless of how those targets were met.  There was a seriousmismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargoemployed.Investigations into what happened at Wells Fargo are continuing, so I will wait before drawingmore definitive conclusions.  For now, though, it is sufficient to note the powerful role—for goodor for bad—that incentives can play in an organization.  I understand that making progress onculture is difficult.  But, if you want the next round of metrics to look better than the last, use apowerful lever—use incentives. Today’s discussions—here at Mansion House and later at the Bank of England—are evidencethat the issue of culture is important to the private and public sectors alike.  We have to keepworking on this.  The public sector must continue to shine a spotlight on the issue, and theindustry must continue to demonstrate that it is taking responsibility for its culture.  And, culturecannot be a subject that only receives attention because bad conduct has occurred in the recentpast. I am convinced that a good or ethical culture that is reflected in your firm’s strategy, decision-making processes, and products is also in your economic best interest, for a number of reasons:6789 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Good culture means fewer incidents of misconduct, which leads to lower internal monitoringcosts.Good culture means that employees speak up so that problems get early attention and tendto stay small.  Smaller problems lead to less reputational harm and damage to franchisevalue.  And, habits of speaking up lead to better exchanges of ideas—a hallmark ofsuccessful organizations.Good culture means greater credibility with prosecutors and regulators—and fewer andlower fines. Good culture helps to attract and retain good talent.  This creates a virtuous circle of higherperformance and greater innovation, and less pressure to cut ethical corners to generate thereturns necessary to stay in business. Good culture builds a strong organizational story that is a source of pride and that can bepassed along through generations of employees.  It is also attractive to clients.Good culture helps to rebuild public trust in finance, which could, in turn, lead to a lowerburden imposed by regulation over time.  Regulation and compliance are expensivesubstitutes for good stewardship.Good culture is, in short, a necessary condition for the long-term success of individual firms. Therefore, members of the industry must be good stewards and should seek to make progresson reforming culture in the near term. Thank you for your kind attention, and thank you again to the Banking Standards Board for invitingme to speak and to the Lord Mayor for hosting.  I would be happy to answer your questions.Sarah Bell, Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Thomas Noone, and Joseph Tracy assisted in the preparationof these remarks.Onora O’Neill, What is Banking For?, Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’sConference: Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, Oct.20, 2016.Anthony Salz, Salz Review: An Independent Review of Barclays’ Business Practices 81 (Apr. 2013).A summary of the New York Fed’s October 20, 2014, conference on reforming culture in the financial servicesindustry is available atwww.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/events/banking/2014/1020_2014.Annual Review 2016/2017: The 2016 Assessment & Evidence, Banking Standards Board, March 2017, availableat www.bankingstandardsboard.org.uk/annual-review-2016–2017/assessment.William C.

    24.02.2017 The role of Central Banks in present times. Monetary and exchange rate policies in the Mediterranean countries IEMED Conference/Barcelona Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/4 In this first session of the Conference, we will address the implications of the present situation of the global economy for central banks and, more specifically, how should central banks in the Mediterranean region manage their monetary and exchange rate policies in the present context.  Before giving the floor to our distinguished speakers let me say a few words about the global economic policy environment and the implications for monetary and exchange rate policies. The latest data tend to confirm that the global recovery is firming, including in core advanced economies, even if the rates of growth continue to be rather modest. Inflation is also coming back. In this context, and after the prolonged period of ultra-expansionary monetary policies that goes back to the global financial crisis, we are witnessing what seems to be the beginning of a shift in the policy mix in advanced economies, at least by now in the US, a shift towards a normalization of monetary policy and a somewhat more expansionary fiscal policy.  But this change in the policy mix points to the end of the so far very relaxed financial conditions at the global level; and this, in turn, may have adverse collateral consequences, mainly in the domain of financial stability, in both advanced and emerging market economies, especially if the change does not take place slowly enough. Indeed, the mere expectation of the shift in the policy mix has been one important driver behind recent increases in bond yields in mature economies and the appreciation of the US dollar. In the same way, as highly accommodative monetary policies in major advanced economies generated major challenges for policymakers in emerging market economies, the exit from such policies can have important repercussions, as previous episodes of market volatility confirm. In this context, it seems relevant to address the issue of how central banks in the Mediterranean region should cope with the potential spillovers from these policy changes in advanced economies, taking into account the different monetary and exchange rate strategies that they follow. Many countries in the South Mediterranean shore have historically relied on stable exchange rates as the nominal anchor for monetary policy, although some of them have moved or are moving towards more flexible exchange rate regimes and inflation targeting frameworks, under the advice of international financial institutions.  While there is no specific recommendation regarding the choice of the exchange rate strategy and each country will need to weigh the pros and cons of pegging versus exchange rate flexibility, we must be aware of the limitations that domestic policies have in dealing with the spillovers from external policies and events. These are clear in the case of countries with fixed exchange rates which, depending on the openness of their capital accounts, have to accept the monetary policy stance of the reference country.  But countries with more flexible exchange rates are not shielded either. Although they can disentangle their monetary conditions by allowing the depreciation of the exchange rate, this would have side effects on inflation. And the likely swings in capital flows can have implications for financial stability, as emerging market economies have repeatedly experienced. Indeed, some of them have been forced to tighten monetary conditions in a procyclical way to counter inflationary pressures, and have used their buffers of international 
 4/4  reserves and implemented macro-prudential and capital control measures in order to preserve financial stability. In any case, tighter dollar funding conditions, in particular, are challenging for emerging market economies with high levels of dollar denominated debt. This is why it has been argued that the traditional “trilemma” in international finance (i.e., in a financially integrated world it is impossible to have at the same time free capital mobility, fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policy) has been transformed into a “dilemma” by the existence of a so called “global financial cycle”, whereby an independent monetary policy pursuing domestic policy objectives (controlling inflation and promoting growth) is possible if and only if the capital account is managed. In these conditions, sound fundamentals and the use of traditional macroeconomic (fiscal and monetary) policies may not be enough; authorities may eventually need also to resort to macroprudential and capital flow management instruments to smooth financial cycles and capital flows.  Finally, another reflection from the recent experience goes to the central banks in core advanced economies: the importance of better internalizing the global spillovers of their monetary policy decisions. While it is not possible to coordinate monetary policies, given the mandates of these central banks, they should consider the effects of their decisions on the rest of the world in their decision making, as the spillovers have the potential to raise financial instability problems in other countries, and the spillback effects will hit back on their own economies. Without further ado, we are honoured to have with us today three very experienced representatives of the central bank community of the Mediterranean region to address these issues:  Mr. Abdellatif Jouahri, Governor of the Bank Al Maghrib.

Elvira Nabiullina: Review of Russia's economic and financialdevelopments in 2016Speech by Ms Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, at the plenary session of theState Duma of the Russian Federation, Moscow, 9 June 2017.*   *   *Dear Vyacheslav Volodin, and deputies of the State Duma!The Central Bank is guided in its actions by strategic objectives. I want to note that across thecountry, every employee of the Bank of Russia knows what these are. They are the basis onwhich key performance indicators for employees are formulated.These objectives are:price stability;financial market sustainability;availability of financial products and services for households and businesses;development of the national payment system;development of technologies and support of innovations in the financial market.These objectives follow directly from the functions of the Central Bank, as defined by theConstitution and by the law. Yesterday, I took another look at the speech I gave to the Duma fouryears ago. Yes, of course, life has made adjustments. No one back in 2013 expected suchnegative external factors, the sanctions, and the drop in oil prices. So the task of ensuringfinancial stability has come to the forefront of our activities. But in dealing with this problem, wehave tried not to lose sight of strategically important activities that we assigned ourselves fouryears ago, and we must continue to work towards the completion of these.As regards monetary policy, the Bank of Russia set itself the task of reducing inflation from thelevel at that time of 7% to 3-4%. But, as you will see, we also noted that the rate of decline mustbe dictated by the economic situation. Therefore, due to external shocks, achieving this targettook longer than expected. However we are already very close to the target level.The second objective in terms of monetary policy which we set ourselves four years ago was toincrease the flexibility of the exchange rate. We have moved to a floating exchange rate andconsider this to have been the right decision, as the negative experiences of other exportingcountries that did not switch to a floating exchange rate prove to us that this needed to be done.Within the banking sector, we set ourselves the tasks of strengthening supervision andwithdrawing from the market of weak players. Unfortunately, accumulated problems in thebanking sector turned out to be more serious than was assumed four years ago. And thissituation has only been aggravated by crisis. The process of cleaning up the banking sector isnot yet complete and, according to our estimates, will take another 2-3 years. Strengtheningsupervision will require us to restructure internal organisation significantly – a process we arecurrently undergoing.Four years ago we decided to establish a mega-regulator. We were handed responsibility for theregulation and supervision across all sectors of the financial market, numbering 20 thousandsupervised units. And, as in the banking sector, we have been consistently focusing on riddingthe market of unscrupulous players, and introducing new standards of regulation in order toensure the sustainability of all financial institutions and to increase businesses’ and individuals’confidence in the financial market. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Then we were set the task of developing a national payment system. This has become morepressing in connection with the sanctions, and, as I have mentioned, we managed to achieve thistask ahead of schedule, even before 2016.Further progress towards these strategic tasks constitutes the main objectives for the comingfive years.In the sphere of monetary policy, our task is to ensure a stable low rate of inflation: we want notjust to achieve a level of 4% one time, or for one or two months, but to deliver a stable level of lowinflation.This will also lead to lower interest rates, longer loans, and will give businesses and individualsthe ability to make long-term plans – in rubles, specifically, rather than foreign currency. All of thisultimately contributes to economic growth.The key task in the banking sector, as I have mentioned, is to complete the process of cleaning itup, improving the quality of supervision, increasing its proactivity in the early stages andtransitioning to consulting oversight, wherein we help conscientious financial market participantsto fix their problems, while there is still time to do so.We understand that the task of strengthening and enhancing the financial stability of bankscannot be single-handedly managed by the Bank of Russia alone. It is important to place moreresponsibility for misconduct on the owners and managers of credit organisations themselves, toensure the irreversibility of punishments for crimes.Qualitative changes are in store for the banking industry – these include a transition to a three-tierbanking system, comprised of systemically important banks, banks with universal licences, andbanks with basic licences. This is a radical change in the banking system, which we will need toimplement with care in the near future. The three main tasks set before us, which we arecurrently resolving, are: to better manage risk, so as to protect the rights of depositors andcreditors; to promote the availability of credit, including credit for small businesses; and to ensurefair competition, wherein a bank of any type will be able to work and earn within their niche in themarket.Another pressing task is the implementation of a new resolution mechanism. We hope that it willbe in place by autumn, when we will be ready to use it. This will allow us both to reduce the costand to speed up the resolution mechanism, in order to make rehabilitated banks more attractiveto investors.In the banking sector, as well as in the financial sector overall, the challenge lies not only inrehabilitating and cleaning up, but also in creating the conditions for development. This will cometo the fore over the course of the next five years.Creating conditions for development involves: introducing a system of individual pension capital –essentially a voluntary system for individuals; developing non-bank financing and the bondmarket; developing the capital market – in essence, creating long-term money for the country. Atthe moment we don’t have long-term money, and so we must and will be doing everything wecan to create it.Further development of the payment system will involve a smooth transfer of the salaries ofpublic sector employees and social payments on to a card system called “Mir". To make thistransfer smooth and orderly is our task for the near future. We will also be aiming to expand theacceptance of the Mir card outside of Russia. We have already begun plans and arrangementswith other countries on this front.Finally, I will return to the topic of financial technology development – I have also spoken about 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
this previously. The development of financial technologies will in large part determine the specificactions to be taken by us in the coming years. This will involve active joint efforts withbusinesses. Legislative support is also important here, particularly in terms of remoteauthentication, which will make new technologies and digital technologies possible. This impliesa transition to electronic document workflow in the financial market. Here indeed we have abacklog, and we need to cross over to this new system in order to reduce costs for the financialsector and ultimately reduce the cost of credit. This will also result in cheaper loans.We will be carrying out tests on the market of new technologies, such as distributed ledgertechnology based on a blockchain technology, and we have already begun this process in orderto implement the regulation of new technologies rationally, protecting the markets from risks.At the beginning of this speech I mentioned the strategic objectives of the Bank of Russia. Theseare our key priorities. You may have noticed that the tasks we set ourselves four years ago andthose for the year 2016, which I have been speaking about today, as well as challenges of thefuture, are all, of course, related to each other. We consider it to be very important to respect theprinciples of continuity, consistency and predictability. We will no doubt be responding withflexibility to any given situation. The situation is volatile, there is a lot of uncertainty in the world.We will have to react in accordance with the challenges presented to us. But the consistency ofour policy, I think, is very important. The preservation of trust is vital to development, as well as tofinancial markets. This is a key category – trust in the financial market and trust in monetarypolicy have been the most influential factors in terms of economic growth. We view our policy aspart of an overall economic policy aimed at creating conditions for sustainable long-termeconomic growth in our country.Thank you very much! 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   It is wonderful to be here in Bradford, just a few miles away from where I grew up.  The City has of course a rich commercial history dating from the Industrial Revolution.  Back then, it was a thriving hub for textiles and other manufacturing industries.  The City’s architecture bears witness to the rich civic investment that took place around this time, with the public and private sector often working in partnership.  The decline of the UK textiles industry from the mid-20th century was mirrored in Bradford’s own fortunes.  Like many industrial cities, Bradford went through a wrenching transition and still bears some of the scars.    But that retreating tide now seems, decisively, to have turned.  I am delighted to see civic and commercial investment beginning to return to Bradford over the past few years.  Those scars are starting to heal.  Of course, there is plenty still left to do with parts of the City still among the poorest in the UK.  But compared with when I last visited a few years ago, there is now a real sense of opportunity and optimism in Bradford, lifting the spirits of the businesses operating here and the people living here.  Regional visits such as these are the most useful and most interesting part of my job.  Over the course of two days, I will speak and listen to over two dozen businesses of all shapes, sizes and sectors.  I will speak and listen to a number of charities, not-for-profit enterprises and schools.  I will do a walkabout in Sunbridge Wells, an underground parade for retail and leisure and a great example of that civic investment and entrepreneurial spirit operating once again in the City.  And I will have with me a film crew, distilling some of the key bits of my visit to a wider audience across the whole of the UK.     This is part of a renewed effort by the Bank, under Mark Carney’s leadership, to engage with as wide a cross-section of people, and as broad a range of views, as possible.  Events of the past twelve months – indeed, events of the past twelve days – have illustrated just how important it is for policymakers to do so.  To listen as often as we speak;  to try and better understand the issues people tell us matter to them, rather than the issues we tell them ought to matter to them;  to close that gap between “us” and “them”.  With the fortunes of the economy uncertain, the value of this grassroots intelligence has never been greater.    So where is the UK economy at this critical juncture?  Overall, the picture is a reasonably reassuring one.  The UK economy has grown for 17 consecutive quarters.  Output has increased by around 2% over the past year, just a little below its historic trend rate.  Employment in the UK is at its highest rate since 1973.  Unemployment is currently at its lowest since 1975.  Confidence among businesses and consumers remains solid.  And inflation, which had been below its 2% target for three years, has bounced back sharply recently.  Nonetheless, the UK economy clearly does face a number of important challenges.  Consumer price inflation (CPI), at 2.9%, is currently well above the government’s inflation target of 2%.  It is likely to move further above that target during the course of this year, probably reaching 3%.  Meanwhile, growth in the UK has slowed fairly sharply since the end of last year, as higher prices squeeze households’ purchasing power in the shops.  Activity in the UK economy remains below its long-run potential.  And, of course, all of this is before the full effects of Brexit have been felt. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   Facing these uncertainties, a key issue for policymakers on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is how best to navigate these risks and the trade-offs that currently exist between wages and jobs, activity and inflation.  These risks are genuinely two-sided.  Keeping monetary policy too loose for too long, to support jobs and activity, might run unnecessary risks with the inflation target.  But tightening monetary policy too soon or too quickly, to curb inflationary pressures, might run unnecessary risks with output and jobs.      Given the lags with which it operates, these monetary policy judgements depend not just on inflation and output today, but on their expected path in the period ahead.  For example, current UK inflation is being boosted significantly, but temporarily, by price pressures arising from sterling’s depreciation last year.  Once these effects abate, the path of inflation will depend on the evolution of domestic costs.  The behaviour of wages, and developments in the jobs market more generally, will be crucial in determining that evolution.  That being the case, I wish to begin by discussing some of the factors affecting wage growth, in the recent past and in the future, including those arising from structural shifts in the nature of work.  I will then turn to the implications of recent developments in the economy for monetary policy in the period ahead.  Work and Wages  Wages have been surprisingly weak for much of the period since the global financial crisis.  Chart 1 plots successive Bank of England forecasts of wage growth since 2012.  Wage growth in the UK has persistently disappointed to the downside, on average by around 1 ¼ percentage points one year ahead.  Part of the explanation lies in weak UK productivity, a key determinant of firms’ ability to pay workers.  This, too, has persistently disappointed to the downside, with a mean error of around 1 percentage point one year ahead.    Nonetheless, it is clear that wages have been weaker than can be explained either by slow productivity growth or by the other factors which typically affect wages, including the degree of slack in the labour market.  This can be seen by looking at the unexplained components from the Bank’s wage equations (Chart 2).  These residuals have been predominantly negative over recent years.  That is despite on-going refinements to the Bank’s judgements on the labour market, as wages have come in short of expectations.    This weakness in wages is the more surprising because it has come against a backdrop of a booming jobs market in the UK.  Employment has increased by around 2.5 million people since 2011.  Unemployment in the UK has fallen from its peak of 8.5% in 2011 to almost 4.5% currently.  It has also fallen significantly in every region in the UK.  Here in Yorkshire, unemployment has fallen from 10% to around 5% over the past few years, its lowest level since the 1970s.  Historically, there has been a reasonably strong and stable relationship between unemployment and wage growth – the so-called Phillips curve.  As unemployment has fallen recently, this Phillips curve relationship would have led us to expect wage growth to pick up.  That, plainly, has not happened. Over recent years, the 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   Phillips curve relationship has been anything but strong and stable (Chart 3).  And that same flatness in the Phillips curve has been found in a number of other countries (Chart 4).    There are many potential causes of the weak wage puzzle over recent years.1  Some of these are likely to have been short-lived, such as the impact of low actual and expected levels of inflation globally.  Others are likely to have been longer-lived, such as the impact of the financial crisis on slack in the labour market and workers’ willingness to move between jobs in search of a pay rise.  A third set of factors are structural in nature.  For example, there is evidence technology and globalisation may have weakened the bargaining power of workers, leading to a secular fall in the share of income going to workers in several countries.2  Another set of longer-term factors arise from the changing nature of work and the shifting relationship between employers and employees.  One such shift, which has operated over a number of decades, is the decreasing incidence of unionisation and collective bargaining in the workforce.  Other, more recent, shifts include the increasing incidence of self-employment, flexible and part-time working and zero-hours contracts.  These shifts in the nature and quality of work have become very topical recently.  The UK government has commissioned an independent review, chaired by Matthew Taylor, to look into their impact.3    These changes in working customs, contracts and practices have been given a variety of descriptions.  Some have called them the “casualisation” of work, with jobs becoming less structured and more informal.4  Others have called them the “gig” economy, with work becoming less four-cornered and more task-oriented.5  Other still have associated these changes with heightened “insecurity” in the jobs market, with implications for households’ incomes and spending.6  All of these descriptions recognise that these shifts affect the quality of work in the economy, even as the quantity reaches levels not seen for many decades.7  Because the causes and consequences of these shifts in working practices are many and varied, no single description of them is perfect.  Surveys suggest that, for some people, the move to greater self-employment and part-time working has been a welcome development, increasing the degree of control and flexibility over their working lives.  For others, these same shifts are less a lifestyle choice than a necessity, increasing their degree of uncertainty and concern about income and jobs.  Gigging can be fun for some.  But not everyone wants to be a roadie when it comes to the world of work.  Perhaps a more neutral, if less catchy, description of these trends is needed.  In terms of their economic impact, these trends have had the effect of making work more “divisible” than in the past.  The fall in unionisation has made workers more divisible at the level of the profession, sector or firm.  Wage bargaining                                                       1  See, for example, Abel et al (2016). 2  IMF (2017). 3  See www.gov.uk/government/groups/employment-practices-in-the-modern-economy 4  Solow (2015).  5  For example, Hook (2015). 6  Hudson-Sharp and Runge (2017). 7  Chapman (2017).  Also see OECD (2017) for some discussion of ‘job quality’. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   is less likely to be collective, and more likely to be idiosyncratic, these days.  Similarly, the rise in  self-employment and part-time working has made work more divisible at the level of the individual worker.  People are more likely these days to be paid by the task or the hour.  In short, these shifts have meant work and workers may have become more diffuse, more granular, more divisible than in the past.  This increased “divisibility” of jobs and work potentially raises a number of important issues, economic and social, about the relationship between employee and employer, many of which are being tackled by the Taylor Review.  I want to explore just one dimension - the extent to which they may have influenced  wage-setting in the economy.  In particular, it is worth exploring whether these changes may have contributed, in any way, to the weak wage puzzle experienced over recent years.  And, if so, given that these trends are likely to persist, whether they carry implications for the durability of wage weakness too.    Why, in principle, might these changes affect wage behaviour?  One story here is “divide and conquer”.  There is power in numbers.  A workforce that is more easily divided than in the past may find itself more easily conquered.  In other words, a world of divisible work may reduce workers’ wage-bargaining power.  Another story is that more flexible working practices may have induced previously inactive people back into work.  With more people willing to enter employment, upward pressure on wages may be dampened even as labour demand picks up given the higher rate of labour market participation in the economy.    In either case, the downstream consequences would be similar:  weaker wage growth than in the past, for a given level of unemployment or demand in the economy.  That is the theory.  What empirical evidence is there to support these stories?  The Changing Nature of Work  Let me start by outlining some of the facts on the changing nature of work and the divisibility of labour.   At the level of the profession or sector, one clear diagnostic comes from the changing pattern of unionisation.  In 1990, around 38% of employees in Great Britain belonged to a trade union.  That membership rate has steadily declined over time, extending a broad trend apparent since at least the mid-1970s.  In 2016, membership of trade unions stood at 23% (Chart 5).  Today, around 6 million employees are members of trade unions, less than half the peak of around 13 million in the late-1970s.    That fall in union membership rates has been broadly based.  It has applied to both males and females, although the fall in membership has been greater among males with rates falling from 35% in 1995 to 21% today.  It has occurred in both the public and private sectors, although public sector employees remain around four times more likely to be union members.  And it has been true across all age groups, although rates of union membership tend to be lowest among younger cohorts, with rates among the 16-24 age cohort 8% compared with 30% for those aged 50 and over. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   The fact that unionisation rates have been falling within each age cohort over time, and are lowest among the young, suggests the downward trend in rates of unionisation may still have some distance to travel.  For example, if unionisation rates were to continue to decline at the same average rate as over the past decade, then they are likely to fall to around 10% of employees, or 3 million people, within a generation.  A more recent labour market trend is the increased importance of self-employment.  In 1980, the  self-employed accounted for less than 8% of the workforce.  In 2016, they stood at an historic high of around 15%, or around 4 ¼ million people (Chart 6).  The increase in self-employment has occurred within each age cohort, although the pick-up has been greatest among the old.  In 1990, 30% of the self-employed hired other workers.  Today, that share is around 16%, with more of the self-employed working independently.8    As with decreasing unionisation, it seems unlikely these trends will reverse.  As older workers are more likely to be self-employed, the ageing of the population will by itself generate further increases.  As a rough  ready-reckoner, were the incidence of self-employment in each age group to remain constant, the ageing of the population would by itself generate an extra 100,000 self-employed people over the next decade.  If numbers in self-employment kept on increasing at the same rate as in the past, the increase could be much more substantial, perhaps as much as an extra 1 million people over the next decade.  A more recent phenomenon in the labour market – and one which has attracted particular attention – is the “zero hours” contract.  As recently as 2010, 0.6% of those in employment were on zero hours contracts, around 170,000 people.  By 2016, that had increased to almost 3% of employees, or almost 1 million workers (Chart 7).  It is unclear how much of the measured increase in zero hours contracts is a genuine trend, rather than reflecting increased awareness and reporting.  But if those rates of expansion continued, the share of employees on zero-hours contracts would reach around 7% within a decade.  Trends in temporary and part-time work have been less striking, but have gone in the same direction.  Between 1997 and 2008, temporary work declined as a share of employment.  But since 2008 it has increased.  There are currently around 200,000 more temporary workers than before the financial crisis.  Prior to the crisis, around 25% of those in employment worked part-time.  Since the crisis, that share has increased to around 26%, or around 8 ½ million workers.    If we took together self-employment, part-time and temporary working and zero-hours contracts, their share of the workforce has probably risen to around 43%, or around 13 ½ million workers.9  The corresponding figures back in 2000 would have been around 39% of the workforce, or around 10 ½ million workers.  This is not a majority, but it is a significant and rising minority of workers.                                                        8  For example, Blanchflower and Machin (2017).  9  There needs to be caution when simply summing these categories as some of them probably overlap, generating double-counting. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   These trends in self-employment, temporary and part-time employment are based on survey data.  Those broad trends are corroborated if we look at data on job vacancies rather than employment.10  By searching for words such as “self-employed”, “flexible hours” and “contractor” in published job ads, we can track trends in the demand for jobs with these characteristics.  This suggests all three job classifiers have maintained or increased their shares of vacancies since 2008 (Chart 8).    On the face of it, these trends – less union membership, more self-employment, more zero hours contracts, more part-time and temporary work – might suggest work has become more fluid and insecure.  But we should be cautious about jumping to that conclusion.  Over the past three years, there has been a marked increase in the share of temporary workers reporting they do not want a permanent job.  And since 2012, the share of part-time workers reporting that they do not want a full-time job has also been on an upward trajectory.    Whether these trends in employment are voluntary or involuntary, good news or bad, an opportunity or a threat, they may still carry implications for wage-setting.  That is true even if it is only a (rising) minority of workers being affected by these changes.  The marginal worker is much more likely than in the past to be self-employed, to work flexibly and to not be part of a union.  And, economics and employers tell us, it is the marginal worker whose pay matters most when determining wage pressures in the economy at large.   Implications for Wages  So what does the evidence tell us about the potential effects of these changes in patterns of work on wages?  One source is empirical research on wage behaviour. This literature is best-developed in the area of unionisation.  It suggests there is a clear wage premium associated with trade union membership, even once we take account of differences in workers’ skills, sectors and regions.11  There are a number of possible reasons for this wage premium, including the greater bargaining power union membership confers.  There are also a wide range of estimates of the scale of this wage premium.  These appear to vary widely across different countries, regions and sectors.  Nonetheless, estimates of the aggregate wage premium in the UK are typically centred in the range 10-15%.12  There is evidence this wage premium may have shrunk over time, perhaps reflecting diminished union membership or increased competition in the labour market.13  And there is also evidence decreased unionisation may have made wage-setting more dispersed and localised.14                                                        10  This is based on data from Reed on around 15 million advertised job vacancies between 2008 and 2016.  There are various possible reasons for ‘self-employment’ being included within a job vacancy description.  These may include reduced National Insurance contributions and increased flexibility over working hours.   11  Lewis (1986). 12  Bryson (2014). 13  Bryson (2014). 14  Gregg et al (2014). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   Given that the number of unionised workers has been falling over time, the wage premium from unionisation will have had a direct, “batting average”, effect on wage growth as fewer workers benefit from this premium.  For example, with a wage premium of 15%, the shift in union membership since 2000 would have subtracted around 1 per cent from wages over the period, or less than 6 basis points from average annual wage growth.  This effect is modest but, to my mind, is very likely a lower bound.  For example, it takes no account of the broader spill over effects of unionised wages on the wages of other workers.   There is evidence self-employment, flexible working and zero-hours contracts also affect wages, after controlling for differences in occupations and locations.  For example, self-employment has been found to be associated with a wage discount for workers, perhaps in the region of 15%.15  The reasons given for this discount include the fact that workers may be willing to accept a lower wage in return for the increased control and flexibility that comes from self-employment.16  There may also be problems in recording accurately income from self-employment.  For workers on temporary contracts, there is also evidence of a wage discount, perhaps of around 5-6%.17  For agency workers, the wage discount is smaller, perhaps around 2 ½%.  For zero hours contract workers, it is larger at around 7%.  If we take trends in self-employment, temporary and zero-hours contract workers since 2000, we would expect these to have collectively directly subtracted from wages by around 0.6 per cent, or around 4 basis points from annual wage growth.18  Again, although these estimates are modest they probably understate the true effect, given they ignore any behavioural effects of these trends.  Wages are not the only way in which these shifts in the nature of work may have affected labour market behaviour.  As with unionisation, these shifts may also have widened the dispersion of wage rates within a given sector or occupation, with less collective-bargaining and more localised rates of pay.  Vacancies data lend some support to this hypothesis.  Charts 9 and 10 plot the distribution of offered wage rates in different occupations, comparing job vacancies containing the terms “self-employment” and “flexible hours” with those that do not.  These vacancies data probably capture a particular segment of the self-employed and flexible working population, who differentiate their pay by more than the typical self-employed worker.  Indeed, the  ‘self-employed’ vacancies here are advertised by firms who invite applicants to become self-employed before hiring them.  Nonetheless, these “violin” plots of offered wage distributions play an interesting tune.  The distribution of offered wage rates is far wider for vacancies associated with self-employment and flexible hours than those without, within a given occupation.  There is far less evidence of a “going-rate” for jobs associated with the self-employed and flexible working.  This sounds intuitively plausible.                                                       15  Inferred from Bradley (2016), using the mean pay of the self-employed compared to employees. 16  Hamilton (2000). 17  Gardiner (2016). 18  Because self-employed workers are not included in statistical measures of average weekly earnings, the self-employed effect would not have shown up arithmetically in this wages measure.  But there will still likely be general equilibrium effects on wage-setting in the economy for those who earn a salary. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   A final piece of evidence, albeit indirect, comes from historical data.  The move towards greater  self-employment and less unionisation is, in some respects, a shift back to the future in the nature of work.  Prior to the Industrial Revolution, and indeed for some years after it, most workers were self-employed or worked in small businesses.  There were no unions.  Hours were flexible, depending on what work was needed to collect the crops, milk the cows or put bread on the table.  Work was artisanal, task-based, divisible.  While the read-across to work patterns in the 21st century is far from exact, there are some parallels.  That being the case, one question is how wage- and price-setting behaviour operated during this earlier period of more “divisible” labour markets.  Were any of today’s wage patterns evident then?  The data we have on wages and output in earlier centuries are partial and imperfect, but nonetheless tell an interesting story.    Chart 11 plots UK Phillips curves over three periods:  1500-1700 (pre-Industrial Revolution);  1860-1950 (post-Industrial Revolution);  1950-1977 and 1977 to date (post-war period).  In each case, wage inflation is measured on the y-axis and an estimate of the output gap on the x-axis.  In the post-war period, the Phillips curve conforms to type.  Since 1950, it has a clearly positive slope (less slack in the economy is associated with higher wage inflation) and an intercept which is positive (reflecting positive trend inflation).    The Phillips curves covering the periods either side of the Industrial Revolution are more interesting.  They share one important similarly and have one important difference.  The similarity is that both are associated with an average inflation rate of around zero.  This is consistent with the price level being broadly stable over these periods.    The striking difference is in the slope of the Phillips curve.  The post-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve has a conventional upward slope, similar to that operating after 1950.  Higher growth or lower unemployment is associated with higher rates of wage and price inflation.  The pre-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve is altogether different;  it is as flat as a pancake.  Indeed, it bears a close resemblance to the Phillips curves which have operated, in the UK and globally, since 2008.    There are many potential explanations of this flatness in the pre-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve, including noisy data.  And its similarity with the present-day Phillips curve may be purely coincidental.  Nonetheless, this pattern is at least consistent with a shift in working practices, towards a more divisible, idiosyncratic workforce, having contributed to a flatter Phillips curve relationship.  None of this evidence is definitive or decisive.  Taken together, however, it is at least suggestive that recent trends in the nature of work may have had some bearing both on wage-setting behaviour in general and on the weak wage puzzle in particular.  Shifts in working patterns seem very unlikely, by themselves, to have been the prime-mover of weak wages.  But they have probably been a contributor in the past and, more significantly, are likely to continue to do so in the future if these trends, as seems likely, perpetuate. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   The Case for Holding Fire  Let me now turn to monetary policy.  Clearly, wages are a key factor when judging inflation pressures in the economy and the monetary policy stance.  Continuing the pattern since the crisis, recent wage growth has been, once again, surprisingly weak.  Despite unemployment falling to its lowest level, and employment rising to its highest level, in a generation, whole-economy wage growth has failed to pick-up.  Indeed, wage growth over recent months appears, if anything, to have been falling.    At the start of the year, the Bank of England Agents’ annual wage survey suggested pay settlements would slow from 2.7% last year to 2.2% this.  At the time, there was healthy scepticism within the Bank about these findings.  In the event, the Agents’ survey may, if anything, have understated the slowdown.  Annual growth in average weekly earnings peaked at 2.8% in November 2016.  It currently stands at 2.1%.  Excluding bonuses, it stands at 1.7%.  Data on pay settlements suggest that weak profile may persist.  Private sector wage settlements are currently running at around 2.0%, down from 3% a year ago.  These recent trends in wages, alongside further falls in unemployment, reinforce the impression of an exceptionally weak relationship between wages and employment, a pancake-like Phillips curve.  Indeed, it is testimony to the flatness of the Phillips curve that wage growth is at similar levels today to when unemployment was at its recent peak back in 2011.  The Bank’s May Inflation Report projections assume wage growth picks up to around 3 ¾% over the next three years.  Given that unemployment is projected to be broadly flat over that period, the tight labour market will have to exert increasing upward pressure on pay growth if this wage profile is to be realised.  Alternatively, whatever other factors have been dragging on pay growth will have to dissipate.   Of course, wages are not the only determinant of underlying inflation pressures.  That is why the Bank monitors a range of around 13 other indicators of domestically-generated inflation.  Each of these has their own imperfections, but they share the aim of filtering out temporary influences on underlying inflation.19 Chart 12 shows a summary measure of these indicators of domestically-generated inflation, based on the common volatility across these indicators.20  Two features stand out.  First, there is clear evidence of a slow build in underlying inflation pressures in the UK economy since around 2015, as slack has been absorbed.  Since then, domestically generated inflation has risen by around 0.5 percentage points.    But, second, this nominal build has been very slow, despite rapid falls in unemployment.  Underlying inflation is estimated to be around the same level it was in 2013.  That leaves it around 0.7 percentage points below                                                       19  While they will strip them out to some extent, these measures are not completely immune from external factors, such as changes in the exchange rate or commodity prices. 20  Technically speaking, it is the first principal component of the Bank’s range of domestically-generated inflation measures.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   the level consistent with hitting the inflation target.21  If it rose at similar rates to the past few years, during which slack was being eroded sharply, underlying inflation would still take another three years or so before it reached target-consistent levels.    As past rates of erosion in slack are unlikely to be replicated over the next three years, this suggests there could be downside risks to hitting the inflation target, unless the Phillips curve reasserts itself or nominal momentum in the economy picks up in the period ahead.  More generally, relatively low and slow rates of nominal build in the economy over the recent past provide one reason for caution when considering tightening the UK’s monetary stance, if the inflation target is to be hit on a sustainable basis.    A second factor which plays in the same direction is Brexit.  The Bank has already made some allowance for the effects of Brexit on the economy in its published projections for output and inflation since the referendum.  One of those effects is that changes in the UK’s future trading arrangements are likely, over time, to drag on trade volumes (exports and imports), activity and productivity in the economy.22  Necessarily, given there are no previous episodes of this type, those impacts are uncertain.  They are also based on a set of assumptions about the Brexit process and its ultimate end-state, which may or may not be realised in practice.  For instance, underlying these Brexit effects is an assumption that the process is a smooth and orderly one.  This is a strong assumption.  A number of market participants and external commentators believe there is a risk Brexit may be neither smooth nor orderly.  If so, that could prompt a discontinuous response by consumers and companies.  For example, if they were to begin building precautionary savings, this would affect growth significantly and adversely.  There could be a “Brexit break” in the economy.23  This discontinuity risk is difficult to dismiss.  Indeed, the risk of sharp, Brexit-induced, slowdown seems to be a key factor holding the sterling yield curve at its current low levels, according to market participants.  On this view, the sharp slowing of UK growth in the first quarter of this year could be the harbinger of things to come.  And there are already signs of a sharp slowdown in big-ticket discretionary purchases by consumers, including houses, cars and household goods.  If this persisted, it too could justify monetary policymakers staying their hand.  It would be imprudent to add fuel to any contractionary fire with an early interest rate rise.  A final factor which, at least in principle, could be used to justify a continuing accommodative monetary policy stance is the level of the sterling yield curve.  This is remarkably flat and has become flatter over the course of this year, despite medium-term growth expectations being revised upwards.  Only one rise in UK interest                                                       21 Based on the average of the different indicators’ deviation from their estimated “inflation target-consistent” rates.  These estimated target-consistent rates may not be an appropriate benchmark at the current juncture if the mix between domestically- and externally-generated inflation consistent with overall inflation at target has changed over time.  For example, the trade integration of China into the global economy in the 2000s dragged on core goods inflation prior to the crisis and this may not repeat itself. 22  Bank of England (2016). 23  A “Brexit break” could also be associated with a material depreciation of sterling, putting upward pressure on inflation.  In this case, the appropriate reaction of monetary policy would be ambiguous, and it is possible that tightening, rather than loosening, may be warranted. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   rates is fully priced in between now and late-2019.  Forward rates only reach 1% by 2023 and, remarkably, never reach 2%.  Given these expectations, any rise in interest rates in the immediate period ahead would come as a surprise to financial markets and, perhaps to a lesser extent, consumers and businesses.  Because people dislike nasty surprises, this increases the chances of an outsized response in spending or in asset prices, perhaps even one which catalysed a “Brexit break”.  This is a risk which, even if it is remote, is not easily dismissed.  Taken together, these factors – real, nominal, financial - make the case for maintaining the MPC’s current, accommodative, monetary policy stance.  And, until recently, it was those factors which weighed most heavily with me when framing my own view on the appropriate monetary policy stance.  The Case for Tightening  One of the keys to good policymaking is regular and critical self-examination of your arguments.  This devil’s advocacy can help expose soft spots in your policy judgement, especially at times when the data and the risks around the economy may be altering.  Those data and risks have, in my view, altered materially over the past nine months or so, for a number of reasons.  First, the world outlook is materially brighter than it has been for some time, perhaps at any time since the global financial crisis.  This year’s Spring Meetings of the IMF saw the first upgrade of world growth forecasts for six years.  As forecast errors tend to be serially correlated – forecasters’ models tend to smooth out the bumps and miss turning points - it is possible further upgrades to world growth could lie ahead.   One reason to believe stronger world growth may prove resilient is that it appears to have a broader base than in the recent past, both compositionally and regionally.  At a compositional level, there are early-stage signs that global growth may be rebalancing away from consumption and towards investment.  Since the crisis, global business investment has been structurally weak, growing around 2 percentage points below its pre-crisis average.  Meanwhile, growth in world trade has undershot world growth for the past 2 years, after a 5-year period in which the opposite was true.  There are now signs those patterns are reversing.  Investment in the US, the euro area and China appears to be picking up.  So too is world trade.  Global supply chains appear to be widening and deepening, with global trade and capital goods orders rising (Chart 13).  It is possible greater optimism about world demand may be encouraging businesses to put their fortress balance sheets to work.  If so, that could herald the beginning of the end of the protracted post-crisis super-cycle of weak investment.  At a regional level, the global recovery appears to have a broad base across the world.  Most regions of the world have seen growth upgrades over the past six months.  Currently, countries representing around 80% 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   of global output are expected to be growing above-trend, meaning the global output gap is shrinking.  The simultaneity of that uptick in regional growth should give it greater momentum, given the increased importance these days of cross-border spillovers, in trade and finance, and integrated global supply chains.  A second reason for greater resilience in world growth since the start of the year is reduced political and policy uncertainty.  For anyone who has lived through the UK’s political undulations of the past few weeks, or who is consuming a daily diet of world news, blogs and tweets, that may sound like an odd statement.  But, viewed in the round, political and policy risks in a number of countries have eased significantly since the start of the year.  At the start of the year, there was widespread media and market concern about changes to economic, trade and foreign policy in the US.  By and large, the worst of these fears have failed to materialise.  At the start of the year, there were fears of a populist surge through Europe.  These risks have failed to crystallise, first in the Netherlands, most recently in France and most probably in Germany later this year.  This is not to suggest geo-political risk has disappeared, merely that some important risks have failed to come to pass.  Alongside upgrades to growth, this fall in political risk seems to have contributed to a rise in global asset prices and a fall in global risk premia.  Equity prices in the US and euro area have each increased by around 8% since the start of the year.  The VIX, a measure of uncertainty in financial markets, has fallen to levels not seen since 2007 (Chart 14).  Media-based measures of uncertainty remain elevated.  But these measure political news, of which there has been plenty, rather than political uncertainty.  And it is the latter, rather than blogs, tweets and news feeds, that matter to most people when making decisions about spending.   Third, as the world economy has gathered pace and resilience, there are signs downside risks to global inflation have also eased.  In the middle of last year, the balance of inflation risks in the major regions seemed to be skewed to the downside.  Financial market expectations of inflation 5-to-10 years ahead were below their historic averages in the US (by around 80 basis points), the UK (40 basis points) and the  euro-area (40 basis points).  Fears of deflation were, if not quite stalking the planet, then making a nuisance of themselves in a number of countries.  Since July last year, inflation expectations have risen by around 40bp in the UK and around 25bps in the US and euro-area (Chart 15).  The downside skew in inflation expectations appears to have dissipated.  And not just among market participants.  The shift in inflation narratives among the public has been every bit as striking.  Google searches for the word “deflation” are at their lowest level in several years, having been particularly elevated in 2015.  Searches for the word “reflation” have risen fourfold comparing the first quarter of this year with last (Chart 16).  Hopes of reflation have displaced fears of deflation as the popular narrative about global inflationary trends.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   This shift in inflation expectations has important implications for monetary policy.  One of the concerns about below-target inflation was that any negative shock to demand could dislodge inflation expectations, requiring further stimulus at a time when the zero lower bound on interest rates potentially made this less effective.  This asymmetry of risks can justify holding interest rates lower for longer, on “risk management” grounds.24  With inflation expectations now having adjusted upwards, the need for such monetary policy insurance is now lower than nine months ago.    Fourth, closer to home, some of the worst of the post-referendum fears about UK growth have failed to materialise.  Growth has been more resilient than expected.  The Bank’s Inflation Report forecasts for UK growth in 2017 have been revised up by over a percentage point since last August.  Smoothing out the bumps, surveys of activity and confidence, among both consumers and businesses, have scarcely budged.  Although a little weaker than last year, those surveys continue to point to solid, around-trend, growth.   What has clearly changed recently is the composition of UK growth.  Consumer spending has slowed, perhaps sharply, while there are signs business investment is picking up (Chart 17).  Surveys also suggest a strengthening outlook for exports.  With their balance sheets strong, their cost of capital low and with demand for their products – particularly from overseas – buoyant, UK companies may be emerging from under the duvet, putting their balance sheets to work.  If so, and even if aggregate growth is somewhat slower, this will make for better balanced and more resilient growth.  None of this is to suggest that the risks of a Brexit break have disappeared.  There are still enough straws in the wind to believe a sharper slowdown than expected is possible, with consumers’ spending on houses, cars and household goods all having slowed sharply.  And it might not take much of a squeeze on consumer demand to induce companies to return to their duvets.  But there has been no consistent evidence, so far at least, of this discontinuity risk having increased significantly during this year.    As for nominal pressures, there have been some signs of a stirring.  Consumer price inflation, at 2.9% in May, exceeded market expectations, as did measures of core inflation.  Sterling has fallen a further 3% since the May Inflation Report, largely the result of political events.  Mechanically, that fall would add around 0.2% to the level of GDP and around 0.2 percentage points to inflation at the two and three year horizon. Inflation was already expected to lie above the Bank’s target, and to be rising, at the year three horizon in the May Inflation Report.       Fifth, despite all of these positives, the sterling yield curve has overall tended to be fairly unresponsive, both to data news and to MPC communications.  Estimates of the responsiveness of the UK yield curve to  macro-economic news have been below their longer-term averages throughout much of the past 18 months                                                       24  See Evans (2011), for example. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15  15   (Chart 18).  Perhaps the lesson from US experience, where interest rates have been more responsive to data news and FOMC communications, is that it is policy actions, rather than words, that matter.  Sixth and finally, any tightening in policy needs to be put in context.  The first 25 basis point rise in UK interest rates for 10 years seems like a momentous step.  But it would still leave monetary policy highly accommodative by any historical metric.  A 25 basis point rise would do no more than remove a proportion – according to our GDP ready-reckoners, around a quarter – of the incremental stimulus the MPC provided last August.  In other words, a 25 basis point tightening would still leave the UK monetary policy stance significantly more accommodative than a year ago.  Conclusion  So where does this leave the balance of arguments?  Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening “too early”, on the one hand, and “too late”, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months.  The risks of tightening “too early” have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected.  And if policy tightened “too late”, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC’s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase ‘at a gradual pace and to a limited extent’.25   As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead.  Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.  How soon is “relatively soon”?  I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC’s June meeting.  I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons.  First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth.  And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy.  Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences.  Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.  Second, there is the election.  This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty.  Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate.  It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers.  I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.                                                        25  Monetary Policy Committee (2017). 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16  16   Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.  As and when the MPC begins this process of normalising monetary policy, it will be a sign of the economy itself having begun to normalise.  Far from being a cause for concern, starting the process of withdrawing some monetary policy insurance should serve as a signal of the MPC’s confidence in the UK economy’s resilience and in inflation returning sustainably to its 2% target.  The City of Bradford is itself normalising, after a long period of painful adjustment.  It has shown real resilience and an indomitable spirit during those lean years.  There are now reasons for optimism about the City’s future, as civic and commercial investment return and confidence among businesses and residents builds.  Those characteristics – resilience, spirit, optimism, investment, confidence – are ones the UK economy has also had to exhibit of late.  They are ones it will continue to need over the next few years during what is likely to be a bumpy ride.  Thank you.

S S Mundra: Bankers & SME borrowers - the emerging mantrasKeynote address by Mr S S Mundra, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 3rdBankers Borrowers Business Summit, organized by the Associated Chambers of Commerceand Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), New Delhi, 16 June 2017.*   *   *Dignitaries on the dais; distinguished colleagues from the banking fraternity; members ofASSOCHAM; representatives from the print and electronic media; ladies and gentlemen! At theoutset, I would like to compliment ASSOCHAM for the effort in bringing the bankers and theborrowers together on a common platform to enable discussions on various issues of relevanceto the MSME sector. With changing times new trends are emerging in every sphere and at thisjuncture the theme of “10 Emerging Mantras” for the MSMEs is extremely topical.2. The role of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the economic and socialdevelopment of the country can hardly be over-emphasized. About one-third of the country’sGDP is contributed by more than 50 million MSMEs in the country. It is expected that by 2020,India will have the largest job-ready youth population in the world. However, before I get intospecifics on the theme of the Summit, let me first present the big picture on why MSME sectorneeds our support.3. First and foremost reason is that with big manufacturing companies increasingly automatingtheir operations and process flow, the number of jobs in these industries is going to decline. Arecent research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatenedin India by automation could be around 69 per cent! That is a huge number. Since MSMEs arecapable of generating plenty of jobs in segments like hospitality, apparel manufacturing, foodprocessing and so on, it is time for the policy makers as well lenders to focus on them. In thiscontext, there would also be a need for change in our perception about jobs. Work created in theformal sector alone does not constitute job. Even if entrepreneurship is promoted that also isequivalent to creation of a job. Hence, the public policy should focus on how much more work iscreated rather than how many jobs in the formal sector.4. The motivation for the bankers to lend to the MSME segment would probably come fromrelatively poor return on their advances to the large corporates. Still another push emanates fromrecent regulatory guidelines restricting banks’ exposures to single borrowers or borrowers in thesame corporate group and forcing the large borrowers to meet their fund requirements frommarket borrowings rather than from banks. Under the circumstances, it would make soundcommercial sense for the banks to look at MSME sector as a potential growth area.5. Therefore, with favourable ecosystem in the manufacturing/services sector, MSMEs can pavethe way for fulfilling entrepreneurial ambitions and in the process would be able to generatesignificant levels of employment. Yet providing adequate and timely finance at reasonable rate ofinterest to these 50 million units at the bottom of the pyramid has remained an elusive goal. Itmust be appreciated that to realize the country’s aspirations for a double-digital growth, it iscrucial that the potential of MSME sector is optimally tapped.6. Before coming to the theme of the Summit proper, let me briefly touch upon few majorreasons for the sector’s limited access to institutional credit. These include – small ticket sizeloan which renders these accounts operationally less profitable, lack of information about theoperations of these enterprises and financial illiteracy among the small enterprise owners. Due tounavailability of timely as well as flexible institutional credit, a number of MSMEs fail to tide overtemporary setbacks and eventually have to shut shop. With the above background, in myaddress today I intend to outline some mantras for the bankers and the borrowers that need to bepursued for ensuring vibrancy of the MSME sector in emerging environment. I will also dwell upon 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
few recent policy measures that RBI and Government of India have taken for the sector and alsosome measures in the pipeline.Mantras for bankers7. In my opinion developing empathy for micro, small and medium borrowers and understandingtheir financial and other related needs is the first and foremost mantra for the bankers. This canobviously be achieved if the Top Management is convinced about the potential of the sector andtreats MSME lending as a priority for sound commercial reasons. Developing business sensitivitytowards such entrepreneurs would require focused capacity building through traininginterventions.a) Appreciating the Life cycle needs of the MSMEsMicro and small units are more prone to financial difficulties than large enterprises / corporates.Often absence of timely support at crucial junctures during the operating lifecycle of MSMEsleads to their sickness. The banks need to be sensitive in providing continuous support to viableMSEs during phases of transient financial difficulties. Towards this end, Reserve Bank of Indiahas already advised banks to review their lending policies to the MSE sector and incorporateprovisions for sanctioning of Standby Credit Facility, Additional Working Capital Limits, Mid TermReview of Regular Working Capital Limits and to set timelines for credit decisions. However, acrucial piece for the success of the endeavour would be execution. Banks need to put in place astrong oversight mechanism over the field level functionaries for ensuring compliance with thepolicies. I believe this is crucial for vibrancy of the MSMEs.b) Supporting faltering MSMEsLet us recognize that failure is integral to entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, however, failure ofenterprises in our system is still not accepted graciously without attaching any stigma. Whileproviding support to the MSME firms over their life-cycle is important, it is also crucial that thebanks support the firms in distress. An enabling mechanism has already been created by theGOI and RBI has issued necessary guideline outlining a Framework on Revival andRehabilitation of MSMEs under temporary duress. Under the Framework, problem resolution isscaled up to a committee with a time bound schedule. I am told that all public sector, privatesector and 4 major foreign banks have put in place an internal policy. Until December 31, 2016,1770 committees have been formed and 41417 cases have been referred to these committeesduring the period between July-December 2016. In my opinion, these numbers need to go upsubstantially and resolution reached. Supporting MSME firms in temporary distress is extremelyimportant and hence, I would request my banker colleagues to support this initiative earnestly.c) Focusing on industrial clustersBy providing shared access to amenities like testing centers, utilities, roads, security, training toworkers, and marketing assistance, SME clusters provide substantial benefits in terms oftechnology absorption, efficiency enhancement and growth. Firms in the MSME sector whichearlier faced difficulties in achieving economies of scale, specialization and innovation due totheir small size are now increasingly benefitting from the advent of industrial clusters. Severalregional organizations have taken up cluster-based projects to promote smaller firms and this iswhere lies an opportunity for the banks. RBI has already advised banks to open more MSEfocused branch offices at MSE clusters which can also act as counseling centers for MSEs.Collaborating with SME association in these clusters can prove mutually beneficial for the banksas well as for the smaller firms. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Mantras for borrowers8. a) Bridging information asymmetryOne thing that seriously ails the MSME entrepreneurs is large-scale ignorance about bankingproducts & practices as also a lack of awareness about the unfolding economic environment.Under the circumstances, the first mantra for the borrowers is to develop awareness about thechanging economic dynamics and its impact on their businesses. The borrowers must makeefforts to be updated with the latest regulatory guidelines, schemes offered by the banks and alsoby the Government. In this context, I am not sure how many MSMEs are aware about theexistence of BCSBI Code of Bank’s Commitment to Micro and Small Enterprises. We oftenobserve many small entrepreneurs using innovative and ingenious techniques of productionwithin their enterprise but I am not sure how many of them have heard of intellectual propertyrights (IPRs), let alone making a filing for their unique technique. It is also ironical that in a countrywhere creating jobs is of utmost priority, vocational training still continues to be relativelyneglected area owing to social perception. I firmly believe that entrepreneurial skill developmentby imparting vocational training can solve the problem of unemployment to a large extent and theindustry bodies like ASSOCHAM would have a significant role to play in handholding and capacitybuilding of the new entrepreneurs in all the above areas.b) Reaping digital dividendFintech revolution is sweeping the globe and creating immense opportunities for various sectors.It has also opened new opportunities for the banks in the MSME space. Banks can support SMEsas they embrace e-invoicing or mobile payment solutions to allow their customers to makepurchases on the go. With the aid of technology there can be a paradigm shift in the approach inlending to MSMEs. The banks can collaborate with Fintech players for either lending directly orthrough these fintech companies. On the other hand, the MSMEs can adopt technology forscaling up their businesses, achieving operational efficiencies and thereby cutting costs. Dataanalytics can help the bigger MSMEs to better appreciate customer behaviour and fine-tune theirproducts, processes and services accordingly. I foresee a role for the Industry associations hereas they can help create an infrastructure which can be shared by the resource-starved MSMEsthereby helping them prune down their costs.E-commerce has disrupted the way businesses have traditionally been conducted. E-commercetechnologies have the potential to significantly increase productivity gains at firm level as theyallow automation of common processes such as distribution, sales, after-sales service andinventory management. E-Commerce has also virtually opened the entire globe for the entities tomarket their wares. So, instead of competing against large multinational companies, the MSMEscan take advantage of the opportunities afforded by e-commerce to access new and distantmarkets or global value-chains.c) Utilizing alternate sources of financeThe MSMEs have always lamented lack of institutional finance as an impediment to their growth.However, lately few alternate sources of finance have become available in the market as asupplement to bank credit. The common forms of alternative finance include crowd-funding,Invoice trading, Peer-to-peer or marketplace lending, Angel investors etc. Similarly, NSE has aSME platform for entities whose post issue paid up capital is less than or equal to Rs.25 crores.The platform allows new, early stage ventures and small companies to raise much neededgrowth capital as they grow and mature. Alternative finance tend to be more transparent aboutfees and eligibility as well as flexible in terms of payment. Alternative finance allows businessesto use different assets for security. This is particularly very handy for service industries that cansecure loans against the value of their unpaid invoices, rather than tangible assets such asproperty or stock. Spreading awareness about the availability of these alternate sources of 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
finance however, remains a challenge which must be addressed by the Industry Associations.d) Seeking credit ratingA credit rating can make a MSME unit’s access to financial services more efficient as it providestransparency, helps overcome perceived uncertainty in lending decisions and thereby reducestime and transaction costs. MSMEs can use ratings to enhance their credibility with othercounterparties too, such as technology providers, suppliers, and customers. In this context,having proper documentation would be extremely critical. A related aspect that the lenders needto be mindful of is that MSME is a vast universe comprising of several million micro enterpriseswithout elaborate system of account-keeping. Hence, standard ratio analysis would be anineffective mode while apprising their credit proposals. In such cases, the banks would need tolook to assess their credit worthiness under a credit scoring model using unconventional matrixcomprising of utility bill payments, remittance history etc. I would like to add here that adoption ofInd-AS will play a key role in enhancing the quality of ratings as better disclosures will increaseinformation availability on rated companies.Recent policy measures/Work-in progress9. The regulators and policy makers have an equal responsibility for supporting the cause ofMSME sector. It is pertinent however to mention that the regulators/policy makers are better asenablers rather than doers. Whether it is creating avenues for flow of finance to the sector,creating easy climate for doing business or assisting the firms in distress- both Government ofIndia and RBI have been extremely conscious to the needs of the MSME sector.a) Smoothening the flow of finance(i) Trade Receivables and Discounting System (TReDS)RBI’s initiative on creating a TReDS platform to serve as an exchange for electronicallyaccepting and settling bills to enable the MSMEs to encash their receivables, has borne fruition.The system seeks to facilitate financing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporate and otherbuyers, including government departments and public sector undertakings (PSUs) throughmultiple financiers. Out of the three licensed entities, two have already commenced operations. Itwould be important that the use of TReDS is made mandatory for, to begin withcorporate and PSUs and later for the Government departments. I would urgeASSOCHAM and the MSME Ministry to proactively examine this aspect as success ofTReDS initiative can be a game changer for the sector.(ii) New institutions/New processesBesides the two new universal banks, RBI has issued banking licenses to all ten Small FinanceBanks that had received in-principle approval from RBI. Seven of them have commencedoperations while the remaining three should become operational in next couple of months. Thelicensing condition of these banks entails focusing on lending to un-served and under-servedsections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industriesand unorganized sector entities. The SFBs will be required to extend 75 per cent of their loans tothe sectors eligible for classification as priority sector by the Reserve Bank with at least 50 percent of the loan portfolio constituting advances up to Rs. 25 lakh. We believe that on account oftheir prior experience as MFIs/NBFCs, these new banks would be able to serve the MSME sectorwith aplomb.Along with measures to improve accessibility, there is also a need to concentrate on new modesof delivery. Reaching out to the MSMEs in the remote corners has always been a complex issuein view of lack of brick and mortar branches across the country. One possible solution for this 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
problem is convergence of efforts between banks on one hand and the NBFCs, MFIs on theother who are more familiar with local conditions, business viability, better information about thecredit worthiness of individuals, their repayment capabilities etc. Currently, within RBI, we aredeliberating on a framework for co-origination of loans by banks and the NBFCs/MFIs withrisk participation which would leverage upon unique strength of both entities, while benefittingthe entrepreneurs in form of lower credit costs.b) Improving ease of doing business climate(i) An Udyami Mitra Portal has been set up by SIDBI, leveraging the IT architecture of their Stand-Up Mitra portal, which aims at instilling ease of access to MSMEs’ financial and non-financialservice needs. The Portal, as a virtual market place endeavours to provide ‘End to End’ solutionsnot only for credit delivery but also for the host of credit-plus services by way of hand holdingsupport, application tracking and multiple interface with stakeholders (i.e. banks, serviceproviders, applicants). I understand that the portal is far from attaining the level of patronisationthan expected. Hence, I urge the banks as well industry associations to help create awarenessabout this facility amongst the borrowers.(ii) Movable assets registryMovable assets, as opposed to fixed assets such as land or buildings, often account for most ofthe capital stock of private firms and comprise an especially large share for micro, small andmedium-size enterprises. Hence, movable assets are the main type of securities that firms canpledge to obtain bank financing. CERSAI, in active co-ordination with Government of India andReserve Bank has already established the movable asset registry, which when mature wouldhave a multiplier effect in lending to the sector. I would again request all stakeholders to makeoptimal use of this platform.(iii) Credit counsellorsMost MSMEs are typically enterprises with weak credit histories and also with inadequateexpertise in preparing financial statements. To overcome this handicap, RBI took initiatives toimplement a scheme wherein services of a set of certified credit counsellor would be available tothe MSME entrepreneurs. These counsellors will act as facilitators and enablers to micro andsmall entrepreneurs, so that they can access the formal financial system channel with greaterease and flexibility. SIDBI’s help has been taken for the purpose and I am pleased to inform thatthe operational guidelines in this regard have been finalised and the scheme is set to be rolledout in the coming days.(iv) Capacity buildingAs I mentioned earlier, capacity building with banks is extremely important as it endows themwith requisite skill-sets as well as sensitivity to the needs of customers. Realizing the gaps in thisarea, RBI launched a National Mission for Capacity Building of Bankers for financing MSMESector (NAMCABS) in collaboration with College of Agricultural Banking, Pune in August 2015.The mission involved structured training initiatives for in-charges of MSME Divisions incommercial banks, training of the trainers at training establishments of commercial bank andtraining of in-Charges of specialized branches for MSMEs. I am pleased to inform that until endMarch 2017, about 5605 bankers have been trained under the programme. Presently, we areundertaking an exercise to assess the impact of NAMCABS initiative on operational andbehavioral aspect of bankers. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
c) Resolving stress in MSME sectorBankruptcy lawAs I mentioned earlier, based on a framework approved by the GoI, RBI has issued guidelines on‘Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs’ in March 2016. Government of India has further approvedthe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 with an objective of expediting resolution of stressedassets and streamlining the process of liquidating a business. The Code also provides for a fasttrack insolvency resolution process which will be an enabler for start-ups and MSMEs tocomplete the resolution process in 90 days (extendable to 45 days in deserving cases).Conclusion10. I would like to conclude with following messages for the MSMEs and the banks:MSMEs must not fall into the lure of unrelated diversification or quick expansion. They shouldrather look to conserve capital and strengthen their balance sheet.The firms need to be open with their bankers about the problems that their enterprise isfacing at the earliest opportunity. On their part the banks would need to be pragmatic andsympathetic to the problems that the firms is facing and be willing to provide all possiblehelp. Remember, bankers and borrowers have a symbiotic relationship and one cannotprosper in isolation.Most of the MSMEs are individual-driven enterprises with no succession planning. In order tosustain an enterprise entity, it is essential even for small to mid-size firms to plan for futureby identifying a successor.11. To sum up, the strategic importance of MSME sector as a prime mover of employment andeconomic growth in the country can hardly be overemphasized. Technology and innovation willcontinue to play a pivotal role in creating a business friendly atmosphere for the MSMEs. Allstakeholders- whether banks, MSME firms or the policy makers- must make efforts in theirrespective domains to seize the opportunity that the MSME sector provides. For a healthy andmutually beneficial relationship between the banks and borrowers, it would be essential for bothparties to understand and appreciate each other’s point of view. The bottom line is that theinformation asymmetry that exists between the two parties needs to be bridged and industryassociations like ASSOCHAM would have to strive to make that possible. I once thankASSOCHAM for inviting me here to share my thoughts and wish the summit all success! 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Associazione Bancaria Italiana Unione Bancaria e Basilea 3 – Risk & Supervision 2017           The Italian banking system and the exit from the crisis Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy Fabio Panetta           Rome, 14 June 2017   
The economic situation and outlook  Growth in the euro area is firming up, driven by the accommodative monetary policy stance and increased international trade. In Italy the recovery has been under way for more than two years and is taking hold. Recently released data from Istat indicate that in the first quarter of this year GDP grew by 0.4 per cent, pushed up by household consumption and firms’ inventories. Investment, which had been accelerating strongly since the start of 2016, slowed, but this should only be temporary. Our analyses suggest that firms will expand their production capacity once again in 2017. After the sharp increase at the end of last year, exports are continuing to grow in parallel with world trade.  The recent positive performances are partly unexpected and must be analysed carefully; they will have to be confirmed in the months to come. They are, however, consistent with improvements in the labour market. Although excess labour supply depresses wage growth, the number of people in employment continues to increase, with an acceleration in April, and this despite the termination of the incentives for hiring new employees on permanent contracts.  Inflation is rising but its core component remains weak. Similar developments can be seen in the euro area. Although the risks of deflation have declined, upward pressures on prices have not emerged to the extent that they are self-sustained in the medium term or that justify a revision of the monetary policy stance.  The outlook for the Italian economy is favourable. In the forecasts published last week, we calculated that GDP could grow by 1.0 per cent in the current year and by 1.2 per cent in the two following years. The national accounts data released a few days ago (and not included in our forecasts) suggest higher growth at the end of the first quarter, which would raise GDP growth, other things equal, to 1.3 per cent on average in 2017. The gap between Italy and the other euro-area economies should continue to narrow.   The banking system has almost completely adapted to the new economic environment and to the comprehensive regulatory reform that followed the crisis. There are important open  issues that require the banks and the authorities to be fully committed. After going through an unprecedented recession and setting out on a path of capital strengthening under very difficult conditions, the positive performance of the real economy has now created the pre-conditions for Italian banks to move out of the stage where they are just reacting to the crisis.   2 
Regulatory developments and supervisory action Banking regulations introduced in response to the financial crisis are having a profound effects on prudential and accounting rules and on supervision. The new regulations are compressing the size of the banking sector. The Basel III rules raised capital requirements, limited leverage, and established stringent liquidity requirements. Additional capital requirements are envisaged for systemically important banks. Several countries have introduced measures to separate lending from the financial activities that banks carry out on their own account. Other capital measures, of which I will comment today, are in the final stages of preparation as part of the completion of Basel III.  Looking ahead, these regulatory changes will make banks less risky, increasing their capital and liquidity and lowering their leverage. However, banks’ profitability and the development of the lending market will be under pressure, with potential repercussions on the availability of credit for the real economy. In the euro area these developments are coupled with a limited role of capital markets in financing business.  Most of the new regulations have been implemented and are already producing effects. A pause is now desirable to allow time to adapt to the new system and to prevent the continuous introduction of new rules from itself becoming a source of uncertainty. Outstanding issues must be solved rapidly.  The first important issue is that of internal models. The measures currently under discussion would reduce latitude in calculating risk parameters and limit the unjustified variability of risk-weighted assets, which are the denominator in capital ratios. Differences among countries have emerged in capital requirements measured with internal models. This issue is less important for Italian banks, which have so far made limited use of such models. However, it is essential to reach an agreement on the matter to ensure a level playing field with foreign banks, which have made broad use of internal models for a long time. By taking steps to develop internal models, even within a consortium and subject to verification by the supervisory authorities, the Italian banking system could align itself with those of the other main European countries on this issue. The Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) project recently launched by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) assesses the compliance of significant banks’ internal models and ensures uniform supervisory practices. The review covers models for credit risk as well as for market and counterparty risk. Over 100 assessments are scheduled in 2017, in which Bank of Italy staff will be actively involved. The goal is to swiftly eliminate any deviation from the regulations; 3 
misalignments with the practices set out in the TRIM Guide will be assessed at a later stage.1 Italian banks must plan in advance any adjustments to their risk measurement systems, anticipating potential consequences on capital. They have already made significant progress, but much more remains to be done.  A second important issue to ensure more effective supervision and a level playing field at European level is the removal of uncertainty in the valuation of bank assets. The assets and liabilities recorded in banks’ balance sheets as Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3) instruments play a key role, as their evaluation is particularly complex. Their value is not directly inferable from market prices but must be estimated using complicated techniques. Coupled with the difficulty of distinguishing between L2 and L3 contracts, this can lead banks to make valuations whose goal is to keep down capital requirements through accounting and regulatory arbitrage.  Classifying a contract as L2 instead of L3 has several advantages. First, it is possible from the outset to book profits equal to the entire difference between the actual transaction price and the fair value estimated through internal models (known as the day-1 profit). Second, it limits the ‘stigma’ associated with holding large amounts of L3 instruments, which analysts regard as highly risky assets.  Because of their high degree of complexity and low level of standardization, L2 and L3 instruments are illiquid; their quick sale would likely entail a substantial discount on their fair value. When the high risks embedded in these financial instruments emerged in the United States in 2008, the value of L2 assets decreased by 15 per cent and that of L3 assets by 21 per cent, with troughs of 31 per cent and 57 per cent respectively.2 If not properly accounted for in the valuations, illiquidity could give rise to fictitious profits representative of hidden risks. Moreover, the actual value of L2 and L3 portfolios is difficult to assess, as it cannot be inferred from the prices recorded in the markets but is instead estimated using models based on variables whose liquidity is also low or nil.  The total value of the complex instruments held by euro-area banks is very high. L3 and L2 assets total €162 billion and €3.3 trillion respectively; L3 and L2 liabilities amount to €143 billion and €3.1 trillion. The total amount of these instruments is twelve times greater than that of net non-performing loans. Two national banking systems hold 73 per cent of the euro-area total and five banks (none of them Italian) 58 per cent. The available data do not tell us whether the risks 1 Italian banks show misalignments in the credit conversion factor and in the prudential treatment of exposures in default. As regards this last point, the estimation of the loss given default parameter must take into account the recovery processes still under way.  2 See B.W. Goh, D. Li, J. Ng, K. Ow Yong, ‘Market Pricing of Banks’ Fair Value Assets Reported under SFAS 157 since the 2008 Economic Crisis’, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 2015, 34:2, 129–145. 4                                                  
embedded in assets in these classes are covered by liabilities in the same class. Only with a “perfect hedge” would the underlying risks be offset. The uncertainty about the valuation could therefore manifest itself through both an overestimation of assets and an underestimation of liabilities, thereby compounding the risks rather than cancelling them out. Since its establishment the SSM has tackled resolutely the issue of loan valuation, especially for non-performing loans, or NPLs. Opaque, illiquid and difficult to evaluate, L2 and L3 instruments are in many ways similar to NPLs, although they require much lower capital charges. Especially in a stress scenario, a decrease in the prices of these instruments could have systemic repercussions. It is therefore crucial to enhance supervision of the accounting and prudential treatment of L2 and L3 instruments and of the appropriateness of the values recorded in banks’ balance sheets. Within the SSM the Bank of Italy will submit a specific proposal to this effect to the Supervisory Board. While most of the issues mentioned so far mainly concern large banks, many others affect smaller ones. An example is the new IFRS 9 accounting standard, which will change loan valuation starting from 2018; banks will have to recognize provisions for expected losses and no longer only in relation to defaults. This will lead to an increase in loan loss provisions as soon as credit quality worsens.  The new standard will force banks to improve the allocation and assessment of loans and to adopt new criteria to measure credit risk and calculate loan loss provisions. To make the impact on banks’ supervisory capital more gradual, the European Commission has proposed a five-year transition period. The methods and procedures, however, will have to be in effect at the beginning of next year. Supervisory authorities, both in Europe and in Italy, are closely monitoring the adjustment process, for example through ad hoc surveys. For Italian banks the progress is mixed; in many cases there are delays in project governance, information quality and model development. They must be tackled and eliminated rapidly. Starting next year the prudential filter on available for sale (AFS) exposures towards central Government will be removed for Italian less significant banks as well, following the SSM’s decision to lift them for significant banks starting from October 2016. Smaller banks must assess carefully the impact of this measure on their capital ratios and should start planning as of now any necessary countermeasures.  The move to IFRS 9 and the removal of the AFS filter will increase the volatility of regulatory capital. The effect on banks could be more pronounced in Italy owing to the high level of sovereign exposures and to the fact that securities with a lower ratings display greater volatility. 5 
Scenario analysis based on changes in the interest rate and risk premium curves is a very useful tool for capital planning. In adopting IFRS 9, banks will be allowed to decide whether to allocate government securities to portfolios other than the AFS one. The consequences of the introduction of the MREL requirements will also be far from negligible, as banks will need to issue liabilities capable of absorbing losses if a resolution procedure is initiated. When fully phased in, the rules will make crisis management easier, but in the short term they will increase costs by a factor that will depend on the choices − still being debated − regarding the calibration of the requirement and the nature of eligible liabilities. The funding instruments that qualify for compliance with the MREL requirements are costlier than those currently in the balance sheets, especially in countries like Italy characterized by a large share of bank liabilities placed with retail customers − who could become unwilling to hold instruments potentially subject to bail-in − and by the limited development of institutional investors, i.e. those more interested in liabilities of this kind. The difficulties and costs of compliance with the MREL requirements will be greater for smaller banks owing to their limited access to wholesale markets and less liquid issues. This will have to be kept in mind when setting the requirements for this type of bank. More generally, an excessive burden should not be placed on small banks, in adherence to the principle of proportionality. For example, for such banks there is a tendency to rule out the existence of a general public interest, which is necessary to initiate resolution procedures. In spite of this, the current regulatory framework calls on these banks to pay into a crisis management system from which they cannot benefit. As part of the review of EU regulations, some thought should be given to measures that respond to the needs of smaller banks, which play a key role in lending to small firms, the backbone of the Italian economy. Crisis management In the crisis years the Bank of Italy dealt with numerous cases of banks in difficulty. Since 2011 there have been 36 special administration procedures. In 17 cases where it was not possible to find a market-based solution, the process led to the start of compulsory administrative liquidation. These cases involved small banks and accounted for a combined 0.2 per cent of Italian banks’ total assets.  In market conditions where it has become difficult to transfer bank assets, the new European regulatory framework makes managing the crises of large banks problematic. Action is entrusted to 6 
a plethora of authorities and institutions − national and European − which are independent of each other, have non-aligned objectives and have no effective coordination in place between them. This extends the time necessary for a solution and makes the decision-making process inefficient and not very transparent, with the very real risk of confusing the responsibilities of the actors involved. Recent experience shows that these problems can be mitigated as long as there are concrete market solutions. The new rules have so far been interpreted in a such way as to deny recourse to some of the tools used in the past to manage problematic company cases without causing disruption. In practice, this makes crisis management more complicated. In particular, preventive intervention through deposit guarantee funds is not allowed today, as it is considered equivalent to state aid; in this regard the Italian government lodged an appeal with the European Court of Justice. Furthermore, excessively stringent limits have been established for the use of public funds, even if advantageous financially and following the full involvement of shareholders and subordinated bond holders; this is the case even in the presence of serious risks for systemic stability or contagion of financial intermediaries.  Effective crisis management requires a rapid and reliable time frame, a clear definition of priorities and responsibilities, and full cooperation between the entities involved. In respect of the European regulations, the action of all the authorities must aim to preserve the value of the banking business to the benefit of savers, employees and the companies to which they lend. In the absence of these conditions, the vulnerability of the banks in crisis will increase, as we have seen in practice.  The difficulties that preceded the agreement on the precautionary recapitalization of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and the long and troubled discussions involving Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca are not due to financial constraints, since the resources earmarked by the Italian government are much greater than those needed to restructure these banks. The difficulties stem from regulatory obstacles, which can and must be removed.  A solution for these two Veneto banks must be outlined very shortly, protecting savers and guaranteeing the continuity of the business relationships maintained by the many small and medium-sized enterprises based in an economically important area of the country. The Italian authorities are totally committed to resolving this problem.  7 
Non-performing loans The problem of non-performing loans is easing as the economy recovers. The flow of new NPLs in relation to total loans now stands at 2.7 per cent, which is lower than before the crisis. The stock, net of loan loss provisions, is also diminishing, from 10.9 to 9.4 per cent of total loans in 2016. The disposals already scheduled by the main Italian banking groups will speed up the rate of decrease.  The Bank of Italy has voiced its opinion on the matter of NPLs on several occasions. I will therefore simply mention again the key issues and refer you to other documents for a more detailed analysis.3 One of the first issues relates to the strategies adopted by banks to manage NPLs. Far-reaching changes are necessary here. The guidelines published by the SSM are an important point of reference; the Bank of Italy is extending them, with the necessary adjustments, to the banks under its direct supervision. There are a large number of options from which the banks can choose and they should take advantage of them. The Italian banking system is now more aware of the various incentives, as is clear from the initiatives already under way, but a stronger and broader commitment is needed.  Banks need to get the most out of the instruments available for out-of-court settlement with firms regarding debt restructuring and the transfer of real estate collateral. The measures will only be effective to the extent that the banks make use of them.  Complete and reliable information on NPLs also needs to be made more widely available. The new system for reporting bad loans introduced by the Bank of Italy is a step in the right direction.  There is ample scope for improvement in the quality of the data reported. In many cases the information on the status of recovery procedures and the nature of the collateral is incomplete. Approaches differ as regards ongoing procedures; not all banks act promptly. More effort is needed to reduce the backlog and exploit the new database to the full. The information must become part of the dossier provided to senior management so that strategies can be developed to maximize recovery rates. Another important issue concerns the length of judicial proceedings. The global reform of arrangements with creditors that the Government has set in motion, incorporating the Rordorf Committee’s proposal in a draft bill, will effectively lead to more efficient procedures and better 3 See I. Visco, The Governor’s Concluding Remarks, 31 May 2017; F. Panetta, Seminario istituzionale sulle tematiche legate ai non-performing loans, 15 May 2017; C. Barbagallo, I crediti deteriorati delle banche italiane: problematiche e tendenze recenti, 6 June 2017. 8                                                  
outcomes. Rationalizing and simplifying procedures – the aim of the delegated legislation – is an important step forward.  Organizational changes to encourage judicial specialization within the court system (particularly as regards arrangements with creditors) could be introduced within a short space of time. A law effectively creating specialized sections of the courts across the country – possibly by reviewing the competencies of the different courts and pooling at least the more complex proceedings – would bring further improvements.  Part of the problem of the excessive length of judicial proceedings is not due to the legislative framework. The Italian courts vary widely as to the duration of proceedings for bankruptcy and arrangements with creditors. According to data by the Ministry of Justice, comparing the situation in the north and the south of the country, at the end of 2015 the average duration of mortgage foreclosure proceedings was 2 years in the Trieste court district and 8.2 years in that of Messina. In the case of bankruptcy proceedings the duration ranges from 4.8 years in Trento to 15.4 years in Messina. Improving the efficiency of the courts where proceedings take longer than average would be of considerable help in reducing the stock of NPLs.  Large fire sales of NPLs can only be a solution when the bank’s stability is at risk. The generalized adoption of policies aimed at selling off NPLs, which would effectively lead to an unwelcome transfer of resources to the detriment of Italian banks but to the advantage of a few specialized investors, mostly foreign, operating in an oligopolistic market for NPLs must be avoided. This type of policy would erode banks’ own funds at a time when raising capital is still beset with difficulty.  A solution to the problem of NPLs is on the horizon, but as in the past it will take time.4 The banks still need to tackle it resolutely, following prudent provisioning policies and improving the way they manage internally not only NPLs but also exposures with a smaller degree of impairment. They should assess whether or not to keep impaired loans on their balance sheet according to the real likelihood of recovery.  Business models  As they overcome the legacy of the double dip recession, Italian banks must equip themselves with the means to cope with the new competitive environment, one in which technology plays a central role. The rise of Fintech companies, which provide financial services at various points of 4 After the lira crisis of 1992, the bad debt ratio jumped from 5 per cent that year to 10 per cent in 1996. The bad debts generated by the crisis were absorbed by banks’ balance sheets over the following four years, with the bad debt ratio dropping back to 5 per cent in 2001 (see Pierluigi Ciocca, ‘Sulla questione del problema bancario’, mimeo, 2017).  9                                                  
production, and the entry of major web companies in the payment services market bring strong competitive pressure to bear but also support innovation. These may represent valuable opportunities for the banks. There is no single, winning business model. Our analyses indicate that profitable banks are active in many different sectors but have in common a high efficiency and productivity. Of the 125 banking groups supervised by the SSM, about 20 have had an average ROE of at least 6 per cent in the last three years. This subset has a low cost-income ratio, mainly thanks to much higher than average unit revenues. Such results are achieved by combining technology with human capital and efficient organization. Last year, the operating costs of Italian significant banking groups were higher than the average costs of their ‘virtuous’ competitors by about 0.5 percentage points of total assets. This is a considerable gap, even adjusted to take account of non-recurring expenses; it is largely due to staff costs. Measures already taken to rationalize branch networks and reduce personnel will go some way towards reducing the discrepancy, but they must be accompanied by more efficient labour organization with the assistance of technology. In order to ensure that cost cutting does not diminish the quality of the products offered or the effectiveness of internal controls, it will be necessary to adopt strategies to increase human capital.  The need to re-assess costs and revenues is particularly pressing for small and medium-sized banks, whose reduced scale of operation limits their capacity to invest and achieve economies of scale and scope. Consolidation can be an opportunity, particularly for banks not belonging to mutual banking groups. Progress in this direction could be achieved through measures designed to forge closer bonds between banks, along the lines of the institutional protection schemes introduced by European legislation and already adopted in other countries; this would make it easier for them to obtain liquidity or capital in case of need.  Improving the structure of the financial system, with the markets playing a greater role in financing business, is part and parcel of the current transition. The Government has introduced several measures in this direction and a capital market union is one of the objectives pursued at European level. As I have pointed out in the past, it is in the banks’ interest to support these changes, which will bring benefits to our corporate sector.  10 
Conclusion Now that the economic recovery is gaining strength, progress in the Italian banking system can be pursued with determination. Gradually eliminating the risk factors that have been clouding analysts’ perception of Italian banks will facilitate this process; banks can now focus on their main objective: to restore profitability.  The conditions are now right for Italian banks to approach the challenges of the new market context with confidence, once again providing full support to the economic recovery. Those challenges can only be overcome with commitment and determination. 11 
    06.06.2017 Appearance by the Governor before the Senate in relation to the Draft State Budget for 2017  Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/8 Ladies and gentlemen,  In my appearance, which forms part of this Chamber’s discussion and approval of the State budget for 2017, I shall begin by reviewing the current macroeconomic setting and outlook for the Spanish economy. I shall then analyse the main aspects of the State budget for this year, according to the draft Law approved by the Government on 31 March, and the Updated Stability Programme for the period 2017-2020, submitted by the Council of Ministers to the European Commission on 29 April.  The external environment of the Spanish economy  The current international economic setting is characterised by an increase in uncertainty, chiefly the outcome of the political changes in the past year in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, that does not appear to have exerted a significant influence, so far, on the real economy, or on the financial markets. Both have continued to perform favourably and, despite rising in the final months of 2016, interest rates are holding at still-moderate levels at all terms. The main exception to this climate of relative stability has been oil prices, which have been highly volatile in recent months.  Recent economic developments in the euro area show a firming in the recovery, which is progressively extending to more sectors and countries. Euro area inflation stood in May at 1.4%, after several months of high volatility, the result – among other things – of the oscillations in energy prices. In the medium term, the projections published in March by the ECB, the update of which will be released this very week, suggest a continuation of the recovery in activity and inflation across the euro area.  Performance of and outlook for the Spanish economy  The Spanish economy grew by 0.8% in 2017 Q1 and the latest indicators show that the rate of expansion remained high in April and May. The increase in activity in Q1 continued to be underpinned by domestic demand, with an acceleration in investment in equipment and construction, and in government consumption, which offset the easing recorded in household consumption. The external sector was highly dynamic, with export and import growth slightly increasing their positive contribution to growth.  For 2017 as a whole, the consensus among analysts suggests GDP growth will once again clearly outpace the average for the euro area. Next week, the Banco de España will publish new projections for the Spanish economy and, on the basis of the latest indicators, it cannot be ruled out that the growth estimated for this year will be somewhat higher than anticipated some months ago, standing even above 3%.  The prolongation of the Spanish economy’s current growth phase over the coming months will essentially be based on the strong pace of expansion of national demand, although the external sector will continue – as seen since 2016 – to maintain its positive contribution. In particular, buoyant employment and the favourable conditions of access to credit are boosting household consumption and the pick-up in spending on residential investment and on equipment. 
 4/8  In the medium term, there will foreseeably be a gradual convergence towards more moderate growth rates, as a result of the disappearance of certain factors that have contributed to boosting activity. Such factors have been the declines in oil prices, the moderation of financing costs, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy, and the expansionary fiscal policy stance over the two-year period 2015-2016. As in the euro area as a whole, since late last year the year-on-year rate of change of the CPI has been highly volatile; it stood in May at 1.9%, the outcome – as earlier stated – of energy price fluctuations and, also, of the effect of the Easter holiday week in April, given that in 2016 Easter fell in March. These temporary factors will progressively peter out in the coming months, although the average rate for the year is expected to stand at around 2%. In 2018 and 2019, in the absence of further shocks, the rate of increase of the CPI might settle below this reference.  The main risks and factors of vulnerability  The scenario I have outlined also poses risks to our economy.  Firstly, the improved international setting has been affected by higher global uncertainty, the result of recent proposals to curb trade, migratory movements and policy coordination. In this respect, mention should be made of the potentially adverse impact of the Brexit negotiations, given the highly significant trade and financial ties between Spain and the UK.  Secondly, the rise in US long-term interest rates in late 2016, which partly reflects certain changes expected in the stance of its economic policies, has already impacted the European markets. While it is premature to conclude that this is the start of the normalisation of monetary conditions, it should be recalled that such normalisation will come about if, as is expected, the recovery in the advanced economies takes root.  Within Spain, the level of public debt and of that of certain segments of the households and firms sectors remains at high levels, thereby generating high dependency on financing from abroad. This is a source of vulnerability, in particular to any future tightening in monetary and financial conditions on international markets.  Finally, from a broader time perspective, the sizeable structural component of the unemployment rate, population ageing and low productivity are the main constraints on the sustained growth of our economy.  Budgetary policy in 2017 Before going on to specify the broad outlines of budgetary policy for 2017, allow me to remind you that the State and Social Security budget provides only a partial picture of general government activity. In a country as decentralised as Spain, in which more than 40% of public spending is by local and regional government, it is essential to take a broader perspective.  Since my speech to the Parliamentary Budget Committee on 25 April, the Government has published (at the end of April) the Updated Stability Programme for the period 2017-2020. This document offers an overview of the budgets of central government agencies along with those of regional and local governments. Moreover, the Stability Programme, by adopting a 
  5/8 broader time horizon, provides a medium-term plan, which is important for correcting public finance imbalances. The macroeconomic projections accompanying the Stability Programme, which update those included in the draft budget for 2017, involve an extension of the current economic recovery to 2020, albeit with GDP growth gradually slowing from the 3.2% rate recorded in both 2015 and 2016. Specifically, real GDP is projected to grow by 2.7%, 2.5%, 2.4% and 2.4% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, while prices are projected to recover, so that nominal GDP growth would stand, on average, slightly above 4% throughout the period.  These projections thus incorporate a path of slowing economic growth, which is also present in the forecasts of the Banco de España. However, as mentioned, real GDP may behave more positively in the short term than in the Stability Programme. As regards the budget, the path projected for the overall general government deficit is in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact: declining from 3.1% of GDP in 2017, to 2.2% in 2018 and 1.3% of GDP in 2019. In 2020 a budget deficit of 0.5% of GDP is projected. This path of reduction of Spain’s budget deficit needs to be achieved if the excessive deficit situation (a deficit of more than 3% of GDP) is to end in 2018. Public debt, according to the Stability Programme, is expected to fall gradually, to reach 92.5% of GDP in 2020. In the current environment of high economic growth and low general government financing costs, the budget consolidation required to achieve the deficit targets for the period 2017-2020 (as measured by the change in the primary structural balance) is relatively small. The Stability Programme includes the stability objectives for 2017 – for each sub-heading of public expenditure – that were approved by Parliament in December last year and extends them to 2020; then, budget balance is projected for all levels of general government, except the Social Security system, which would still record a deficit of 0.5% of GDP. Central government, which currently has the largest deficit, will be responsible for making the bulk of the projected adjustment. With regard to the composition of this adjustment, according to the Stability Programme the public deficit path projected for the period 2017-2020 will be achieved mainly through control of total primary public expenditure, i.e. without including public debt interest payments. Specifically, if the projections are fulfilled, the weight of primary public expenditure in GDP will be reduced by 3 pp over this period, to 36.6% in 2020. At the same time, government revenues are expected to grow moderately, by 0.9 pp of GDP over the programme’s horizon, to 2020.  On the expenditure side, the Government projects moderate growth in its wage bill, basically reflecting the 1% rise in the remuneration of public-sector employees approved for 2017 and the impact of savings arising from reforms approved in previous years.  At the same time, the Stability Programme assumes that the downward trend in spending on unemployment will continue, in line with favourable labour market developments; that the application of the adjustment factor to pensions will continue to hold down pension spending, in a positive inflation environment; and that current spending on goods and services will continue to be firmly controlled over the coming years.  
 6/8  As for public investment, the Stability Programme projects an increase in general government investment of 10% in 2017. However, after deducting the effect of certain defence-related payments outstanding from previous years, as well as the possible spending arising from liability associated with legal proceedings relating to the insolvency of the toll motorways, this item is projected to grow only very moderately this year and over the next few years. Under these plans, therefore, the downward trend in public investment as a proportion of GDP, which has already lasted more than a decade, would continue.  Interest payments are expected to continue to decline as a result of the expected favourable developments in financing conditions, although at a more moderate rate than over the last two years. The increase in revenues included in the Stability Programme is based mainly on the measures approved in December last year in Royal Decree-Law 3/2016. Notable among these is the amendment to corporate income tax to broaden the tax base, the increase in duties on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, the increase of 3% in the maximum social contribution base and the 8% increase in the minimum wage. Notwithstanding the positive impact of these measures, achievement of the government’s medium-term revenue target is subject to some uncertainty, as revenue will need to perform more favourably relative to activity than it would if the historical relationship between these two variables were to remain unchanged.  As a result, the performance of revenue and the impact on spending of the plans announced for public-sector employment will need to be monitored over the next few years, so that, in the event of any deviation from the projections, action can be taken in time to avoid the risk of failure to achieve deficit commitments. The importance of budgetary consolidation Finally, it seems to me necessary to stress the importance of completing the budgetary consolidation process.  The current environment of high growth and low interest rates is a very favourable one in which to reduce the structural budget deficit and public debt to levels more in line with those in the main euro area economies, and this opportunity should not be wasted. The cost of financing public debt (which still stands at 100% of GDP) would be reduced and there would be some scope for fiscal policy to respond to possible adverse scenarios. Moreover, consolidation is essential to address the challenge that an ageing population will pose for spending on health, dependency and, above all, pensions.  In this respect, the magnitude of the adjustment needed to achieve sound public finances in Spain is still significant. Hence the need to comply with all the domestic and European budgetary framework requirements. Following their strengthening in recent years, this means not only that the budget deficit (defined in total and structural terms) and public debt must be progressively reduced, but also that the so-called spending rule must be observed. The spending rule is especially important in the case of those government entities that have already achieved budget balance.  
  7/8 Under the rule, neither the budgeted nor the actual spending of the government entity can exceed the Spanish economy’s nominal potential growth rate. Since government revenues have an elasticity with respect to nominal GDP of approximately one, the spending rule involves linking its growth to that government revenues. Spending growth may only exceed this reference rate if there is an increase in revenues that is recurrent in nature; likewise, legal changes involving permanent losses of revenue should automatically lead to a downward revision in the spending threshold. One of the advantages of this rule is that increases in government revenues above their normal trend must be saved, such as during the upswing prior to the last crisis, when very significant extraordinary revenue increases associated with the real estate boom were recorded. Also, by linking spending to the economy’s potential rather than its actual growth, and by excluding from its definition non-discretionary spending on unemployment benefits, public spending should grow more slowly than GDP and revenues during economic upswings (when actual GDP and, therefore, revenues are growing at above their potential rate), while in recessions the opposite should occur. Thus, the spending rule requires general government to accumulate budgetary savings during economic upswings that may be used during downswings, allowing the behaviour of public finances to be disciplined and automatic stabilisers to function at the same time. Obviously, if the starting point is a structural budget deficit, then the return to budget balance will require spending to grow more slowly than nominal growth or else a discretionary increase in revenues, until balance is achieved. Evidence suggests that the application of a rule of this type during the upswing prior to the last crisis would have substantially curbed the public spending permitted each year, allowing the generation of significant room for manoeuvre that would have limited the deterioration in public finances during the crisis. Finally, pressing ahead with the various pending reforms would raise the economy’s growth potential which – through its effects on employment and productivity – is one of the basic determinants of reductions in public debt. These reforms include, in the regulatory area, revision of regulations that hinder the market entry of new firms or that limit their growth; in the labour market, reforms to reduce the degree of duality and to improve the employment prospects for the long-term unemployed; and the need to increase the efficiency of the legal system and of the education system and to promote the accumulation of technological capital, among others. Accordingly, any delay in their implementation or, worse still, a hypothetical reversal of reforms already introduced since the start of the crisis, would significantly worsen the prospects for economic growth and would make the fiscal consolidation still needed more costly. Conclusions Let me conclude by recalling the challenges and risks for the economy as a whole raised by the current fiscal imbalance in Spain.  High volumes of deficit and public debt over long periods are usually associated with higher interest rates and, therefore, lower rates of private investment and growth in the medium term. Also, correcting a very high debt-to-GDP ratio normally requires significant primary budget surpluses, which must be achieved through higher taxation or lower spending, other than on interest payments.  
 8/8  Large deficits and high levels of public debt reduce the scope for fiscal policy to play a countercyclical role in adverse economic situations, a particularly necessary and valuable lever in a monetary union. Also, the need to resort constantly to the financial markets to refinance a substantial level of debt and the current deficit increases the vulnerability of the economy to potentially adverse reactions by investor sentiment, as seen in recent years.  Facing up to these challenges and minimising these risks requires completing fiscal consolidation, by gradually correcting the budget deficit and reducing public debt. This must be one of the main priorities of economic policy in the coming years. Thank you very much for your attention.   
1 Euromoney Conferences: The Greater Mekong Investment Forum  “Confidence in Connectivity of the GMS” Speech by Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand Bangkok, June 1, 2017  Excellencies, Distinguished Speakers, Ladies and Gentlemen. A very good morning to you all. Let me first thank Mr. Tony Shale, the CEO of Euromoney Asia, for organizing this conference and inviting me to join you once again this year.  It is always a great pleasure to speak at the GMS Investment Forum.  Let me also extend a warm welcome to those of you who travelled from abroad.    *** Ladies and gentlemen, Established way back in 1992, the GMS marks a quarter of a century milestone this year.  To me, the GMS today is like a promising 25-year-old graduate from a prestigious university, full of energy and potential, on her way to making a mark in her career.  The GMS is a dynamic region, linked by the richness of the great Mekong river, with abundant endowments and opportunities awaiting to be further explored. Last year, I expressed my confidence in the future of the GMS, as a result of synergy and connectivity that had been harnessed over the years.  Today, I would like to once again reiterate the importance of regional connectivity, as prospects for trade and investment opportunities in the GMS have improved with a more positive global economic outlook.  I have three key messages on GMS connectivity to share with you today and would like to invite you to be a part of this exciting journey:  Let’s think of the young vibrant graduate I mentioned, there is so much potential and opportunity she can explore. She can broaden her skills and horizon as she gains experience and professional networks over time. She will unavoidably face some challenges along the way. But with support from her peers, together with technological advancement, she will be able to stay on course for success. This is similar for our vibrant GMS.    First: The GMS is a region full of opportunities. This is owing to its geography, complementarity and connectivity among its members and with other regions;  Second: GMS’s endowments and opportunities can be expanded through enhancing financial connectivity, technology and innovation; and  Third: Despite many challenges, policymakers and their private-sector partners can make a difference to the GMS region.  ***   
2 1. Why do I say that the GMS is a region of opportunities? Over the past 25 years, integration within the GMS has deepened, integrating a diverse group of members through physical, trade, investment as well as people-to-people connectivity.  Even more remarkable is the recent growth momentum of the GMS.  Since 1992, the PPP-adjusted GDP of the GMS has expanded almost seven-fold from $455 billion to around $3 trillion, making it, in aggregate, the eighth largest economy in the world, or the size of the British economy.1  Intra-regional trade also increased 90-fold since its inception.2  Intra-regional investment growth has also been impressive. More specifically, last year, the GMS agreed to further prioritize over 100 infrastructure investments and technical assistance projects worth over $32 billion for the next 3 years, including the Laem Chabang-Bangkok-Dawei corridor in Myanmar and Thailand, and the Vientiane-Boten railway project in Laos.3  These remarkable developments are the results of continued efforts, both from within and outside the region, on strengthening physical, trade, and investment connectivity.   While GMS’s growth prospects are promising, the strength of the GMS will depend on its ability to remain competitive.  Despite the GMS’s young population, growing middle class, increased urbanization, and rich natural resources, we cannot only rest on our endowments and past achievements.  Rather, we have to find new ways to unlock the potential of the GMS.  While physical infrastructure connectivity has seen much progress, I believe that financial integration is needed to complement infrastructure, trade, and investment connectivity.  This leads me to my second topic. *** 2. How can we harness these opportunities through greater financial connectivity? Let me introduce three potential benefits of financial connectivity: (1) lower costs, (2) broader coverage, and (3) modern choices.     On Costs:  Costs of cross-border financial transactions are still relatively high in the GMS. This is especially true for low value transactions and cross-border remittances, where fees can be as high as 13% of the value of funds transferred.4  These high costs impede not only remittances but also bilateral trade and investment. We therefore need to work on solutions that will promote competition and innovations, making these services more affordable.  While a complete solution for cross-border transfers is yet to emerge, significant progress has been made with respect to payment solutions within each GMS country.  In Vietnam, OnePay allows customers to make financial transactions on e-commerce websites, as well as deposit funds into their bank accounts without visiting a physical bank branch.  Wing in Cambodia, BCEL in Laos and Wave Money in Myanmar all provide instant money payments and transfers through mobile phones to recipients who do not have bank accounts.  In Thailand, PromptPay is a modern, faster payment system that provides free transfer services for transactions up to 5,000 baht (or about 150 US dollars), one of the cheapest rates in the world. PromptPay allows individuals and businesses to transfer money between banks and e-wallets using their mobile phone or citizen ID numbers.  The Thai government also uses PromptPay to deliver electronic welfare payments to individuals, with a                                                  1 ADB and World Bank statistics, 2015 2 ADB, 2015: from $5 billion in 1992 to $444 billion in 2015  3 Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan 2020, 2016 4 World Bank Remittance Prices, 2017 
3 view to minimizing costs, risks of fraud as well as financial leakage.  Given PromptPay’s open architecture, we hope that the system will soon be integrated into the daily lives of the Thai public.               Up to now, these payment platforms are mostly used for domestic transactions. What we need is to connect these platforms to facilitate larger cross-border financial activities in the GMS.  Having an efficient cross-border payment platform in the GMS will yield tremendous benefits for economic activities in the region, especially for border trade.  I believe that it will not take long before solutions for cross-border payments become widespread.  As of now, a partnership between a Thai telecommunication company and Myanmar businesses offers a cross-border remittance solution that allows sending money directly to recipients, including those in rural areas of Myanmar.  In Thailand, cooperation between a Thai bank and a Chinese FinTech firm will soon launch a low-cost baht-yuan cross-currency remittance platform based on blockchain technology. These initiatives are promising projects that will lower costs of financial transaction, and enhance closer financial connectivity and economic integration in the GMS region.      *** On coverage of financial services:  At present, financial services in the GMS are mainly provided by local players.  The increasing cross-border trade and investment call for broadening cross-border players.  As a result, the Bank of Thailand, together with other central banks in the region are working towards establishing a cross-border banking network through the so-called Qualified ASEAN Bank or QAB framework, which will facilitate qualified banks in ASEAN to increase their presence in another country.  The expansion of banking presence through this framework will help increase coverage and service efficiency that are needed for economic integration.  The Bank of Thailand is in the process of negotiating bilateral QAB frameworks with Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.  Turning to the capital market, Thailand is also playing a proactive role to connect capital markets in the GMS by allowing foreign entities – government and private – to raise funds in Thailand.  Last year, the Lao PDR launched 11-billion-baht issue (or about $300 million) of baht-denominated bonds, which were well-received by the investors.  In addition, Thailand has allowed firms from the GMS to be listed on the Thai Stock Exchange with a view to providing global investors with a wider coverage of investment products. Therefore, this will offer firms from the GMS with wider coverage of fund raising. *** On the choice of financial services: In June 2014, the World Bank’s Global Findex estimates that over three-quarters of adults in CLMV countries still do not have access to financial services5. There is room for improvement and we are fortunate to live in an era where technological advancement can do wonders to mankind.  Financial service providers, both old and new, can capitalize on modern technology to provide new – and perhaps once unimaginable – products and services.  These technologies will allow business to by-pass the traditional stages of financial market developments, especially those that are paper-based or those that rely on brick-and-mortar infrastructure.   Let me cite a few examples which I find very encouraging.  In Thailand, an offshoot of the TMB Bank, called ME by TMB, is a bank that does not rely on physical                                                  5 World Bank Global Findex 2014, measured by numbers of those not having bank accounts 
4 branches. Vietnam has a similar model called Timo Bank.  Businesses are conducted online, making full use of digital payment technology.  These banks pass on reduced costs to consumers in the form of better offers, such as higher deposit interest rates or better services. As technology provides more choices, there is room to provide more alternatives by easing some of our regulations. Take, for example, local currency usage for trade settlement and direct investment in our subregion.  The Bank of Thailand is currently working with  central banks in the region to relax regulations on the use of local currency for cross-border trade and investment.  Amid  volatile global financial markets, this will offer businesses more options in choosing currencies for trade settlements.  Exporters and importers are able to reduce their foreign exchange conversion costs and better manage foreign exchange risks by using their local currency for settlement.  The local currency framework that Thailand concluded with Malaysia has been operational since 2016. We are now discussing a similar framework with Indonesia, which will be implemented by the end of this year.  We also have a bilateral swap agreement in local currencies with China to facilitate the use of renminbi and Thai baht bilateral trade and investment. We hope that similar frameworks can soon be expanded to other GMS countries.   *** Ladies and Gentlemen, 3. Let me now turn to my third message – the challenges and the role of policymakers to support businesses. While the GMS was first initiated by policymakers, it is now driven mostly by businesses.  In order to further support business development, policymakers need to set proper incentives, governance structures and regulatory frameworks to foster closer market linkage.  I see two ways we can address this.  First, each individual country must ensure that its rules and regulations are sufficiently flexible to support innovative regional connectivity and technologies.  To provide regulatory flexibility and to support FinTech in Thailand, we have allowed innovative FinTech products to be offered and pre-tested under the so-called “regulatory sandbox”, which is designed to be a safe space where businesses can test innovative products, services business models and delivery mechanisms.  This arrangement will make it easier for firms to test their products, and for regulators to develop necessary regulatory requirements before these products are launched to the public. Second, in light of the diverse financial systems in the GMS, domestic regulations and policies need to converge to create a more integrated market.  Take the payment systems, for instance.  Currently, different systems among our countries mean that payment connectivity is not seamless.  In other words, “PromptPay” does not speak “Wave” and “Wave” does not speak “Wings”.  Adhering to harmonized standards and ensuring that each system is more able to link within an interoperable environment can help overcome this challenge.  As a result, I encourage GMS policymakers to cooperate on diverse aspects of banking businesses.  At the end of the day, this will make financial transactions within the subregion much easier.   ***    
5 Ladies and gentlemen,      In the current VUCA world, with rapid technological changes, we, as policymakers or central bankers, would need to adapt ourselves and ensure smooth transition into this new business-driven paradigm.  We therefore welcome those who want to seize these opportunities in the GMS.   A solid platform of road, ports, power grids, and tourism infrastructures already exist in the GMS.  Going forward, it is time to envision the GMS that is integrated in other dimensions too, particularly finance.  This is why I view that financial connectivity is an important element in the next chapter of the GMS.    As I mentioned, I see the GMS as a fresh graduate. At 25 years old, a great future is awaiting.  Let us walk with her, help her unlock her potential, and lend her necessary supports to ensure her success and prosperity.           I thank Euromoney once again for organizing this conference.  I wish you productive and engaging sessions today.  Thank you.   
Stanley Fischer: Housing and financial stabilitySpeech by Mr Stanley Fischer, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, at the DNB (Netherlands Bank) - Riksbank (Sveriges Riksbank) MacroprudentialConference Series, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 20 June 2017.*   *   *I am grateful to Elizabeth Klee, Andreas Lehnert, Mary Tian, and Alexandros Vardoulakis of theFederal Reserve Board for their assistance. Views expressed in this presentation are my ownand not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open MarketCommittee. It is often said that real estate is at the center of almost every financial crisis. That is not quiteaccurate, for financial crises can, and do, occur without a real estate crisis. But it is true thatthere is a strong link between financial crises and difficulties in the real estate sector. In theirresearch about financial crises, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff document that the six majorhistorical episodes of banking crises in advanced economies since the 1970s were allassociated with a housing bust. Plus, the drop in house prices in a bust is often bigger followingcredit-fueled housing booms, and recessions associated with housing busts are two to threetimes more severe than other recessions. And, perhaps most significantly, real estate was atthe center of the most recent crisis.In addition to its role in financial stability, or instability, housing is also a sector that draws on andfaces heavy government intervention, even in economies that generally rely on marketmechanisms. Coming out of the financial crisis, many jurisdictions are undergoing housingfinance reforms, and enacting policies to prevent the next crisis. Today I would like to focus onwhere we now stand on the role of housing and real estate in financial crises, and what weshould be doing about that situation. We shall discuss primarily the situation in the United States,and to a much lesser extent, that in other countries.Housing and governmentWhy are governments involved in housing markets? Housing is a basic human need, andpolitically importantand rightly so. Using a once-popular term, housing is a merit goodit can beproduced by the private sector, but its benefit to society is deemed by many great enough thatgovernments strive to make it widely available. As such, over the course of time, governmentshave supported homebuilding and in most countries have also encouraged homeownership.Governments are involved in housing in a myriad of ways. One way is through incentives forhomeownership. In many countries, including the United States, taxpayers can deduct interestpaid on home mortgages, and various initiatives by state and local authorities support lower-income homebuyers. France and Germany created government-subsidized home-purchasesavings accounts. And Canada allows early withdrawal from government-provided retirementpension funds for home purchases.Andas we all knowgovernments are also involved in housing finance. They guarantee credit toconsumers through housing agencies such as the U.S. Federal Housing Administration or theCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The Canadian government also guaranteesmortgages on banks’ books. And at various points in time, jurisdictions have explicitly or implicitlybackstopped various intermediaries critical to the mortgage market.Government intervention in the United States has also addressed the problem of the fundamentalilliquidity of mortgages. Going back 100 years, before the Great Depression, the U.S. mortgagesystem relied on small institutions with local deposit bases and lending markets. In the face of123456 1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
widespread runs at the start of the Great Depression, banks holding large portfolios of illiquidhome loans had to close, exacerbating the contraction. In response, the Congress establishedhousing agencies as part of the New Deal to facilitate housing market liquidity by providing a wayfor banks to mutually insure and sell mortgages.In time, the housing agencies, augmented by post-World War II efforts to increasehomeownership, grew and became the familiar government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs:Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). The GSEs bought mortgages fromboth bank and nonbank mortgage originators, and in turn, the GSEs bundled these loans andsecuritized them; these mortgage-backed securities were then sold to investors. The resultingdeep securitized market supported mortgage liquidity and led to broader homeownership.Costs of mortgage creditWhile the benefits to society from homeownership could suggest a case for governmentinvolvement in securitization and other measures to expand mortgage credit availability, thesebenefits are not without costs. A rapid increase in mortgage credit, especially when it isaccompanied by a rise in house prices, can threaten the resilience of the financial system.One particularly problematic policy is government guarantees of mortgage-related assets. Pre-crisis, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were viewed by investors as having animplicit government guarantee, despite the GSEs’ representations to the contrary. Because ofthe perceived guarantee, investors did not fully internalize the consequence of defaults, and sorisk was mispriced in the agency MBS market. This mispricing can be notable, and is attributablenot only to the improved liquidity, but also to implicit government guarantees. Taken together,the government guarantee and resulting lower mortgage rates likely boosted both mortgagecredit extended and the rise in house prices in the run-up to the crisis.Another factor boosting credit availability and house price appreciation before the crisis wasextensive securitization. In the United States, securitization through both public and privateentities weakened the housing finance system by contributing to lax lending standards, renderingthe mid-2000 house price bust more severe. Although the causes are somewhat obscure, itdoes seem that securitization weakened the link between the mortgage loan and the lender,resulting in risks that were not sufficiently calculated or internalized by institutions along theintermediation chain. For example, even without government involvement, in Spain, securitizationgrew rapidly in the early 2000s and accounted for about 45 percent of mortgage loans in 2007. Observers suggest that Spain’s broad securitization practices led to lax lending standards andfinancial instability.Yet, as the Irish experience suggests, housing finance systems are vulnerable even if they do notrely on securitization. Although securitization in Ireland amounted to only about 10 percent ofoutstanding mortgages in 2007, lax lending standards and light regulatory oversight contributed tothe housing boom and bust in Ireland.Macroprudential policiesTo summarize, murky government guarantees, lax lending terms, and securitization were someof the key factors that made the housing crisis so severe. Since then, to damp the house price-credit cycle that can lead to a housing crisis, countries worldwide have worked to create orexpand existing macroprudential policies that would, in principle, limit credit growth and the rateof house price appreciation.Most macroprudential policies focus on borrowers. Loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI)ratio limits aim to prevent borrowers from taking on excessive debt. The limits can also beadjusted in response to conditions in housing markets; for example, the Financial Policy789101112131415 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
Committee of the Bank of England has the authority to tighten LTV or DTI limits when threats tofinancial stability emerge from the U.K. housing market. Stricter LTV or DTI limits find somemeasure of success. One study conducted across 119 countries from 2000 to 2013 suggeststhat lower LTV limits lead to slower credit growth. In addition, evidence from a range of studiessuggests that decreases in the LTV ratio lead to a slowing of the rate of house priceappreciation. However, some other research suggests that the effectiveness of LTV limits isnot significant or somewhat temporary.Other macroprudential policies focus on lenders. First and foremost, tightening bank capitalregulation enhances loss-absorbing capacity, strengthening financial system resilience. Inaddition, bank capital requirements for mortgages that increase when house prices rise may beused to lean against mortgage credit growth and house price appreciation. These policies areintended to make bank mortgage lending more expensive, leading borrowers to reduce theirdemand for credit, which tends to push house prices down. Estimates of the effects of suchchanges vary widely: After consideration of a range of estimates from the literature, an increaseof 50 percentage points in the risk weights on mortgages would result in a house price decreasefrom as low as 0.6 percent to as high as 4.0 percent. These policies are more effective ifborrowers are fairly sensitive to a rise in interest rates and if migration of intermediation outsidethe banking sector to nonbanks is limited.Of course, regulatory reforms and in some countries, macroprudential policiesare still beingimplemented, and analysis is currently under way to monitor the effects. So far, researchsuggests that macroprudential tightening is associated with slower bank credit growth, slowerhousing credit growth, and less house price appreciation. Borrower, lender, and securitization-focused macroprudential policies are likely all useful in strengthening financial stability.Loan modification in a crisisEven though macroprudential policies reduce the incidence and severity of housing relatedcrises, they may still occur. When house prices drop, households with mortgages may findthemselves underwater, with the amount of their loan in excess of their home’s current price. AsAtif Mian and Amir Sufi have pointed out, this deterioration in household balance sheets can leadto a substantial drop in consumption and employment. Extensive mortgage foreclosures—thatis, undertaking the legal process to evict borrowers and repossess the house and then sellingthe house—as a response to household distress can exacerbate the downturn by imposingsubstantial dead-weight costs and, as properties are sold, causing house prices to fall further.Modifying loans rather than foreclosing on them, including measures such as reducing theprincipal balance of a loan or changing the loan terms, can allow borrowers to stay in theirhomes. In addition, it can substantially reduce the dead-weight costs of foreclosure.Yet in some countries, institutional or legal frictions impeded desired mortgage modificationsduring the recent crisis. And in many cases, governments stepped in to solve the problem. Forexample, U.S. mortgage loans that had been securitized into private-label MBS relied on theservicers of the loans to perform the modification. However, operational and legal procedures forservicers to do so were limited, and, as a result, foreclosure, rather than modification, wascommonly used in the early stages of the crisis. In 2008, new U.S. government policies wereintroduced to address the lack of modifications. These policies helped in three ways. First, theystandardized protocols for modification, which provided servicers of private-label securities somesense of common practice. Second, they provided financial incentives to servicers for modifyingloans. Third, they established key criteria for judging whether modifications were sustainable ornot, particularly limits on mortgage payments as a percentage of household income. This lastpolicy was to ensure that borrowers could actually repay the modified loans, which promptedlenders to agree more readily to the modification policies in the first place.16171819202122 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
Ireland and Spain also aimed to restructure nonperforming loans. Again, government involvementwas necessary to push these initiatives forward. In Ireland, mortgage arrears continued toaccumulate until the introduction of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets scheme in 2013,and in Spain, about 10 percent of mortgages were restructured by 2014, following governmentinitiatives to protect vulnerable households. Public initiatives promoting socially desirablemortgage modifications in times of crises tend to be accompanied by explicit public fund supporteven though government guarantees may be absent in normal times.What has been done? What needs to be done?With the recent crisis fresh in mind, a number of countries have taken steps to strengthen theresilience of their housing finance systems. Many of the most egregious practices that emergedduring the lending boom in the United Statessuch as no- or low-documentation loans ornegatively amortizing mortgageshave been severely limited. Other jurisdictions are takingactions as well. Canadian authorities withdrew government insurance backing on non-amortizinglines of credit secured by homes. The United States and the European Union required issuers ofsecurities to retain some of the credit risk in them to better align incentives among participants(although in the United States, MBS issued by Fannie and Freddie are currently exempt from thisrequirement). And post-crisis, many countries are more actively pursuing macroprudentialpolicies, particularly those targeted at the housing sector. New Zealand, Norway, and Denmarkinstituted tighter LTV limits or guidelines for areas that had overheating housing markets.Globally, the introduction of new capital and liquidity regulations has increased the resilience ofthe banking system.But memories fade. Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Housing Administration are now thedominant providers of mortgage funding, and the FHLBs have expanded their balance sheetsnotably. House prices are now high and rising in several countries, perhaps as a result ofextended periods of low interest rates.What should be done as we move ahead?First, macroprudential policies can help reduce the incidence and severity of housing crises.While some policies focus on the cost of mortgage credit, others attempt directly to restricthouseholds’ ability to borrow. Each policy has its own merits and working out their respectiveadvantages is important.Second, government involvement can promote the social benefits of homeownership, but thosebenefits come at a cost, both directly, for example through the beneficial tax treatment ofhomeownership, and indirectly through government assumption of risk. To that extent,government support, where present, should be explicit rather than implicit, and the costs shouldbe balanced against the benefits, including greater liquidity in housing finance engenderedthrough a uniform, guaranteed instrument.Third, a capital regime that takes the possibility of severe stress seriously is important to calmmarkets and restart the normal process of intermediation should a crisis materialize. A well-capitalized banking system is a necessary condition for stability in bank-based financial systemsas well as those with large nonbank sectors. This necessity points to the importance of havingresilient banking systems and also stress testing the system against scenarios with sharpdeclines in house prices.Fourth, rules and expectations for mortgage modifications and foreclosure should be clear andworkable. Past experience suggests that both lenders and borrowers benefit substantially fromavoiding costly foreclosures. Housing-sector reforms should consider polices that promoteefficient modifications in systemic crises.In the United States, as around the world, much has been done. The core of the financial system2324 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
is much stronger, the worst lending practices have been curtailed, much progress has beenmade in processes to reduce unnecessary foreclosures, and the actions associated with theHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created some improvement over the previousambiguity surrounding the status of government support for Fannie and Freddie.But there is more to be done, and much improvement to be preserved and built on, for the worldas we know it cannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the Great Recession andthe Global Financial Crisis.ReferencesAaronson, Daniel (2000). “A Note on the Benefits of Homeownership," Journal of UrbanEconomics, vol. 47 (May), pp. 356–69.Adelino, Manuel, Antoinette Schoar, and Felipe Severino (2012). “Credit Supply and HousePrices: Evidence from Mortgage Market Segmentation,” NBER Working Paper Series 17832.Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, February.Akinci, Ozge, and Jane Olmstead-Rumsey (forthcoming). “How Effective Are MacroprudentialPolicies?

Louis Kasekende: The media's role in Ugandan societyRemarks by Dr Louis Kasekende, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the 4th edition ofthe Uganda National Journalism Awards; African Centre for Media Excellence (ACME), Kampala,12 April 2017.*   *   *Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen,I would like to begin by thanking Peter Mwesige, the Executive Director of the African Centre forMedia Excellence, for inviting me to be the Chief Guest at this awards gala. This is an importantevent for journalism in Uganda and I hope it will contribute to raising standards in the professionand also inspire young people to take up a career in journalism.The theme of my remarks tonight is the role of the media in our society, and although I will focuson the worlds of business, finance and economics, I think that some of my remarks will also berelevant for journalists covering other walks of life.What are the essential functions of business and economic journalism? What are the mostimportant services it can offer to the public and society at large? I believe that there are twocritical types of services that the public should expect from the business pages or programmesof the media.The first is to provide objective reporting of the basic facts about the economy and business; forexample, what is the rate of inflation? How much profit did company X make? What alternativeinvestments are available such as Treasury bills and bonds and how can they be accessed?Many citizens need this type of information to guide the decisions which matter in their workingand private lives. Obviously, in the age of the internet, the public could obtain much of thisinformation themselves, for example through the websites of public agencies and privatecompanies, but for most people that would be very time consuming. For most members of thepublic, it is much more practical to obtain the economic data they want through the media.That means that journalists must report these data accurately, in a manner which is easilyaccessible and understandable, and also, where necessary, explain what it actually means; theymust be able to put the data into the relevant context. Obviously that is only possible if thejournalists have a good grasp of economic concepts, their relevance and how they are presentedin statistical form. On our part, we now endeavour to provide soundbites of key messages inselected local dialects; and I would like to commend the local language media for supporting ourcause of translating and interpreting these policy matters for the benefit of the rural communityand the “bottom of the pyramid”.The second type of service required of economic and business journalism is good analysis ofrelevant issues; journalists need to go beyond reporting facts and explain what is happening andwhy. This is essential if the public is to acquire any understanding, however rudimentary, of theeconomic issues which affect their lives and of economic policy. Economic analysis is muchmore demanding in terms of specialist expertise of journalists than is reporting. Journalists whospecialise in economic analysis require good academic training in economics. The media maychoose to commission non journalists, for example academics, to provide analysis for them, butthe editors who commission this work still require sufficient expertise to be able to evaluate itsquality and relevance.Well informed economic analysis in the media has a vital contribution to make to public debate inUganda. It is essential, for the health of democracy, that statements about the economy andpublic policy proposals receive critical scrutiny in the media, by those with the expertise to dothis. The media’s record in this regard is rather patchy. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
In the United States, the trade policy pronouncements of the current President have been subjectto extensive analysis in the media; anyone in that country who is interested in this aspect ofpublic policy can have no excuse for not being well informed about the pros and cons ofPresident Trump’s favoured trade policies. In contrast, in Uganda the Government’s recentlyannounced Buy Uganda Build Uganda trade policy proposal has received very little analysis andevaluation in the media. Readers and viewers looking for information and advice on what thisproposal might mean for the Ugandan economy will have been disappointed.I would like to say a few words about how the Bank of Uganda (BOU) views its relations with themedia. The BOU implements an inflation targeting monetary policy framework, the efficacy ofwhich depends on the public understanding what we are trying to achieve. The BOU uses itsmonetary policy tool – the policy interest rate (Central Bank Rate) – to target core inflation, butour ability to achieve our inflation target does not just depend on setting the policy interest rate atthe appropriate level. Public expectations about future inflation and the impact of monetary policyalso help to determine future inflation outcomes. Hence monetary policy must be transparent.The BOU must explain its monetary policy to the public and try to guide inflation expectationsthrough clear indication of its Central bank rate decision, the underlying reasons for that decisionand convincing the public that the decision taken shall deliver the publically announced inflationtarget. For example, if the public is made to expect higher inflation and does not believe in theability of the Central bank to reign in on this inflation; it will result in a self-fulfilling episode wherefirms will adjust their prices, leading to higher actual inflation. Naturally, this means that the mediais a critical component of the policy transmission mechanism and efficient communications isessential for the credibility of the entire policy framework.As a result, the BOU has revamped its communications policy to support the implementation ofthe inflation targeting-lite policy framework. We hold a press briefing immediately after the bi-monthly interest rate setting meeting to which all the media are invited. In addition to the detailedMonetary Policy report issued after the press briefing, our communications department is alwayswilling to respond to questions from the media and to arrange for senior staff to be interviewed.We regard the media as our partners. But we do not expect uncritical coverage from the mediaof the BOU as that would be counterproductive and would do little to enhance public confidencein monetary policy. Instead, we welcome well informed comment and analysis by the media ofour monetary policy, even if critical, which can enhance public understanding and contribute topublic debate.Before I conclude, I would like to make a brief comment on the overall state of the media in thiscountry. When one takes a long term perspective, it is beyond doubt that that there has beengreat progress made by the Ugandan media over the last two decades. The range of mediaoutlets has broadened and we have a much more vibrant media than many other countries in ourregion. In many respects, the media has been one of the most successful sub-sectors of oureconomy. I hope that this progress can continue and that initiatives like this one tonight will spurjournalists to greater heights. But for this to happen, journalists must jealously guard theirintegrity and intellectual independence so as not to act according to the whims or biasedpersuasions of self-interest groups or individuals, which will be to the detriment of the publicgood, institutions and the economy as a whole.Finally let me congratulate all the winners of awards tonight. I have no doubt that you havethoroughly deserved your success. Thank you for listening to me. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Partnership for capacity development in household surveys for welfare analysis LAUNCH EVENT                     Remarks by Valeria Sannucci, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy                                Rome, June 19 2017 
  Good morning ladies and gentlemen,  On behalf of Governor Visco, I am pleased to welcome you all to the Bank of Italy in Rome. It is indeed an honour today for the Bank of Italy to host the distinguished representatives of the World Bank and of all the institutions involved in this important Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).  As part of its legal mandate, the Bank of Italy currently promotes technical cooperation with central banks and other institutions in the emerging countries. Through staff training activities and consultancy, the Bank aims at helping to improve the institutional capacities of the beneficiary institutions, establishing relationships that strengthen reciprocal ties. Moreover, the Bank is Italy’s representative in numerous international organizations and institutions, such as the World Bank, cooperating with them in various ways, with the ultimate purpose of promoting international financial stability and a smooth functioning of the payment system. The partnership we are launching today is thus an integral part of this more general context.  The cooperation between the World Bank and the Bank of Italy in the field of statistics was not born today. In October 2015 another MoU between these two institutions was entered into. On that occasion, several areas of collaboration were pointed out: improving the availability, quality and cost-effectiveness of data production to inform policy making in low and middle income countries; engaging in research on subjects of common interest; promoting the harmonization of household surveys; and engaging other entities, such as research institutions and local academia, to give additional support to the abovementioned activities.  In this framework, our institutions co-founded the Center for Development Data (C4D2) in Rome, with which we have been working for the past 2 years. Let me now share with you my personal satisfaction in having contributed to launching a project that has organized such a wide and knowledgeable team of institutions which can significantly improve the statistical data for welfare analysis in developing countries and in our countries too.  Contributing to the achievement of a world free of poverty is the ultimate goal for which all economists should bear responsibility. To this end, economic growth, although necessary, may not be a sufficient condition for everyone to make progress. Nowadays there is great concern about the possible effects of technical progress and globalization on inequality. Both in developed and developing countries, political institutions must constantly monitor the different segments of their populations to ensure that no one is left behind and promote a shared prosperity. In this perspective, sample surveys acquire a strategic role. Cooperation in this field arises from the awareness that macroeconomic data are not enough for economic analysis. It is essential to look at the distribution of phenomena and not only at averages, in particular when dealing with household welfare and inequality.    Microdata derived from household surveys are not only a powerful descriptive tool; they can be employed in more complex statistical analyses to study how variables as different as an individual’s occupational status, social environment and personal values relate to consumption and 1  
saving behaviour. General models can thus be adapted to new scenarios and to the measures referring to estimated subgroups.   Throughout its history, the Bank of Italy has been an active producer of statistics, and in particular of household survey data. In June 1947 the then Governor Luigi Einaudi, during the work of the Constituent Assembly of which he was a member, advocated the need for collecting information on the standard of living of Italian citizens. By the 1950s, the Bank of Italy had already worked with Doxa, a private company, on conducting surveys on household finances. In the early sixties, the Bank of Italy conducted several pilot surveys on the income, consumption and savings of Italian households and in 1966 the first official survey was conducted. Since then, the Bank of Italy has interviewed almost 200,000 households in what is now called the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), collecting biannual data on several aspects of economic behaviour.  SHIW data have been often used in the Bank of Italy to carry out structured research projects on the main economic themes, like saving and consumption behaviour, ageing and the pension systems, distribution of wealth, measures of well-being and financial vulnerability. Moreover, the availability of a database containing a large amount of information on Italian households has enabled policy measures to be evaluated, thereby contributing to an informed public debate.  Thanks to the free availability of anonymous microdata, survey data have also been widely used for academic research. A recent bibliography of scientific works that over time have used the survey data included over 800 articles by more than 450 authors at the end of 2016. This has improved the accountability of the Bank and enriched the economic debate.  Over the years, the Bank of Italy’s statisticians have explored the methodological issues of the SHIW in detail, focusing both on its potentials and pitfalls. While a standard methodological report allowing for the analysis of standard errors is always attached to each survey report, specific studies have been carried out on various topics, like unit non-response, measurement errors, under- reporting and micro-macro reconciliation. This long experience has taught us that in sample surveys the adoption of best practices in the collection of survey data can significantly increase the reliability of estimates. Moreover, if the move towards the standards is widespread, comparisons are also positively affected by the change, adding value to each statistical source.  For a number of years the Bank of Italy has been promoting projects aimed at harmonizing SHIW data with those obtained from other surveys, such as the Luxembourg Income Study and the Luxembourg Wealth Study. In recent years our survey has become part of the Eurosystem's Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), coordinated by the European Central Bank. The HFCS includes harmonized surveys on household income and wealth from 18 euro-area countries, as well as Poland and Hungary. The network of participants has proved to be a very valuable forum for exchanging experiences in conducting surveys and fostering the adoption of uniform best practices. We hope the expertise acquired on these technical grounds can be useful for the present project. 2  
In fact, at the present time, survey data do not always share common standards regarding sampling, coverage, definition of variables or valuations and estimation methods as more standard statistics like national accounts do. This is particularly true in the developing countries, which often face peculiar difficulties in conducting sample surveys, due to a lack of population lists, logistic problems in territories, and so on. Improving the availability of reliable data production is a valuable ingredient for promoting evidence-based policy making; this is why, although it is a costly exercise, it is crucial for low and middle-income countries to invest in this field.  The cooperation starting today will initially focus on training with the objectives of improving the quality and coherence of international training for statistical capacity building on microdata, and of supporting training activities in these fields based in low and middle-income countries.  In particular, the project will implement a training program for statistical capacity building in household surveys, through some week-long training courses and workshops, to be held in the Bank of Italy’s premises, and with training sessions in various statistical training centres in Africa. By adopting a training of trainers (ToT) approach, the project will exploit a multiplier effect, spreading the ability to deal with sample surveys beyond the participants and reaching a large number of low and middle income countries.   A further and no less important aim of this project is building a network which includes experts from many developed and developing countries. The exchange of experiences can be beneficial for improving statistical capacity in household surveys and fostering convergence towards common standards.   Let me conclude with the words of Luigi Einaudi which have often been quoted by those who have succeeded him as Governors of the Bank of Italy. All policymakers, all institutions should base their modus operandi on the principle ‘Conoscere per deliberare’ (know, then decide).1 It expresses the need for a policy based both on knowledge and data, as can be derived from microsimulation model estimations when analysing alternative scenarios and policy measures.2 Einaudi would certainly have approved the efforts we are all making in pursuing this current project. He would also have appreciated the presence of a number of important Italian institutions here today. It is important that the Bank of Italy is not alone in this endeavour. Cooperation with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Italian Agency for Development  Cooperation,  the  Italian  National  Institute  of  Statistics  and  the  Italian  National Institute of Health means fostering dialogue among different disciplines and recognizing the multidimensional nature of human well-being, the measurement of which is the aim of household surveys. Yet it also testifies to the commitment of leading Italian public institutions to working together to strengthen our cooperation with developing countries.   1 L.

Natasha Ahmetaj: Interesting facts from the Treasury - art inAlbanian banknotesWelcome address by Ms Natasha Ahmetaj, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of Albania, atthe launch of “Interesting facts from the Treasury: Art in Albanian Banknotes", Tirana, 19 May2017.*   *   *Dear friends, dear guests,Today, we are together at the premises of the Bank of Albania, not only in the attribute of thisplace as the house of money, figuratively, but also in the physical sense of the word, as thisroom is next to the old treasury room.We have invited you today to enjoy another dimension of the currency, that of an authenticartwork. A work of art always speaks more broadly and deeper than its mere physical dimension.Today, we are in a Museum of works of art. Museums are more than just expositions. While youmove from one display to the other, you are not simply walking some centimetres along thestreet, but you travel through centuries of history. Those few centimetres take you through erasof social civilisation. This is a unique feeling you can only experience in a museum. A zoo or abotanical garden depicts the real world in miniature. But it shows the actual living world. Bycontrast, a museum brings together different eras, the past and the present. This is especiallytrue in a museum of banknotes and coins. Modestly, our Museum does that as well. It was onlyfounded a year ago and we believe it will continue to develop and be fully fledged as a legacy ofour national memory.In mid 1800s, announcing the competition on American banknote, the US Secretary of theTreasury, specified two obligatory requirements to participants about the design:it had to be original, and unpublished previously, andhave a national character.Since at the beginning, the banknote is thought as not only a means of exchange, but also as aneducation tool for the public. As such, it should bear important moments of the history. Thebanknote performs this function through complicated techniques of subtly fine lines, to preventreproduction, attributable also to robust security features.Although we frequently have these valuable papers on our hands, seldom do we concentrate fora few minutes and enjoy the art embedded in them. We very rarely focus on examining how thework of a talented painter is intertwined in a sort of a miniature canvas with that of a talentedengraver, turning that piece of paper into an elegant expression of creative art. The image isfamiliar, but it is hard to believe that 14% of interviewers in advanced countries are able toremember recognise the picture designed on each banknote. Even less people may recognisethe portrait depicted on 1000 Leke or 2000 Leke Albanian banknotes.Museums and various activities organised in light of promoting national values and raising thepublic awareness help to better transmit the message embedded in banknotes, and educate thepublic through the art in banknotes, featuring elements of our national identity.For this particular reason, numismatists take delight in the subtleties of colours and images ofthe banknotes. In the apparently just pieces of paper, they are able to distinguish and recognisedifferent ages, and the degree of social freedom. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
In addition, banknotes may also depict concerns of a society, of course, when the artist was ableto properly read this concern. Hence, the green of US dollar was chosen as a symbol to expressthe need of the stability in the period of civil war. The 2017 series of Norwegian currency reflectsthe concern on the return to the human basic needs, which are taken away by digitalisation. Inreflection to this concern, the portraits of distinguished people of art and science are replacedwith the symbols of natural resources, strongly related with the identity of the Norwegian people,such as the Viking ship, fish or the lighthouse.All these facts show that nothing has threatened the educational and national mission of thebanknote. Owing to this reason also, it continues to carry it out by resisting even the virtual formsof the currency. In addition, as a Harvard researcher states, the paper may disappear earlier thanthe banknote.Dear guests,The International Council of Museums was established in 1946. Every year, since 1977, theICOM organises the International Museum Day, a worldwide event held on and around 18 May. In1992, ICOM decided to choose a socially relevant theme for International Museum Day, eachyear.The theme chosen for 2017 is “Museums and contested histories: Saying the unspeakable inmuseums".Joining this worldwide celebrating day, in our museum, we have formulated it as “Interestingfacts from the treasury: Art in Albanian Banknotes".And to say the unspeakable, we have invited today Mr Mark Bundy, a master of designing workingfor over 40 years at De La Rue, pioneers of banknote printing in the world. De La Rue isfrequently heard by everyone visiting our museum, as it relates to the first company printing theAlbanian banknote.Mr Bundy will show the unspeakable on the designing, techniques and art of conceiving theAlbanian banknote, illustrated by photos and sketches.In the end, we invite you to explore our temporary exhibition on this topic and see theunspeakable through your own lens. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Guy Debelle: The Global FX Code of ConductAddress by Mr Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the ThomsonReuters Industry Event "Examining the FX Code of Conduct", Sydney, 15 June 2017.*   *   *The FX Global Code of Conduct was launched just over two weeks ago in London. It is availableon the Global Foreign Exchange Committee’s website, www.globalfxc.org. Today I will reiteratethe motivation for the work, highlight the main features of the Code and adherence, summarisehow we developed the Code and outline the way forward.Firstly, why has this work been necessary? The foreign exchange (FX) industry has beensuffering from a lack of trust. This lack of trust is evident both between participants in the marketand, at least as importantly, between the public and the market. The market needs to movetoward a more favourable and desirable location, and allow participants to have much greaterconfidence that the market is functioning appropriately.The Code sets out global principles of good practice in the FX market to provide a common setof guidance to the market. This will help to restore confidence and promote the effectivefunctioning of the wholesale FX market.A well-functioning FX market is very much in the interest of all market participants. This clearlyincludes central banks, both in their own role as market participants but also as the exchangerate is an important channel of monetary policy transmission. In a globalised world, the foreignexchange market is one of the most vital parts of the financial plumbing.One of the guiding principles that has underpinned our work in developing the Code is that theCode should promote a robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent market. A diverse set of buyersand sellers, supported by resilient infrastructure, should be able to confidently and effectivelytransact at competitive prices that reflect available market information and in a manner thatconforms to acceptable standards of behaviour. Note that I am talking about all sections of theFX market: buyers, sellers and infrastructure.The work to develop the Code began two years ago, in May 2015, when the BIS Governorscommissioned a working group of the Markets Committee of the BIS (which I chaired until earlyJanuary this year) to do two things: first, establish a single global code of conduct for thewholesale FX market and second, to come up with mechanisms to promote greater adherenceto the Code.This work was very much a public sector–private sector partnership. We were ably andvigorously supported by a group of market participants, chaired by David Puth, CEO of CLS.David’s group contained people from all around the world on the buy side, including corporatesand asset managers, and the sell side, along with trading platforms, ECNs and non-bankparticipants, drawing from the various Foreign Exchange Committees (FXCs) and beyond. Allparts of the market were involved in the drafting of the Code to make sure all perspectives wereheard and appropriately reflected.There are two important points worth highlighting: first, it’s a single code for the whole industryand second, it’s a global code.On the first point, the Code supplants the existing codes that have been present in the FXmarket. So there is now one single code. Importantly, the Code covers all of the wholesale FXindustry. This is not a code for just the sell side. It is there for the sell side, the buy side, non-bankparticipants and the platforms; it reaches around the globe and across the whole industry. Theway it is relevant will depend on the nature of the engagement with the FX market. What this12 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
means in practice is that the steps different market participants take to align their activities withthe principles of the Code will differ, reflecting the size, complexity, type and extent of theirengagement with the FX market.On the second point, it’s a global code: our group contained representatives from the centralbank and private sector from all the 16 largest FX centres, including both developed andemerging markets.The first phase of the Code was released in May 2016. It covered areas such as ethics,information sharing, aspects of execution and confirmation and settlement. The second phasecovered further aspects of execution including e-trading and platforms, prime brokerage, as wellas governance, and risk management and compliance.The complete Code comprises 55 principles spanning these issues. The principles are written inplain language and should be easily read and understood by market participants. The principlesare supplemented by a suite of examples to illustrate their practical application.Market participants had a number of opportunities to comment on the Code, in addition to thedirect input of the Market Participants Group. Before its release, drafts of the full text of the Codewere distributed to market participants for their review, principally through the various FXCs, butalso through other industry associations to ensure all perspectives were appropriately reflected inthe Code. Through this process, over 10,000 comments were received.The Code reflects our collective judgement as to what constitutes good practice in the market,taking account of the feedback received. I think it is a good outcome of the process that we wereable to distil the points of contention down to a small number of issues. Outside of these, thefeedback reflected a widely held consensus as to what is good practice. The degree ofconsensus and the willingness to contribute to the process reflect the fact that marketparticipants have recognised the Code’s aim of helping move the FX market to a better place.One of our central aims in drafting the Code is for it to be principles-based rather than rules-based. There are a number of reasons why this is so but, for me, an important reason is that themore prescriptive the Code is, the easier it is to get around. Rules are easier to arbitrage thanprinciples. The more prescriptive and the more precise the code, the less people will think aboutwhat they are doing. If it’s principles-based and less prescriptive then market participants willhave to think about whether their actions are consistent with the principles of the Code.But we have not written a procedures manual. Rather, we have articulated principles that need tobe taken into account. Individual firms may then take these principles and reflect them in theirown procedures manuals. Our aim in setting out these principles is to provide marketparticipants with the framework in which to think about how they, for example, handle stop-lossorders. The emphasis here is very much on the word ‘think’.AdherenceAlongside drafting the Code, we devoted considerable time and effort to thinking about how toensure widespread adoption of the Code by market participants. Clearly, that was an issue withthe various existing codes that had been in place in a number of markets. It is evident they wereignored on occasion in the past, wilfully or otherwise.We have worked with the industry to produce a principles-based code rather than a set ofprescriptive regulatory standards. The Code is not regulation. It will not impose legal or regulatoryobligations on market participants, nor will it supplant existing regulatory standards orexpectations.We have developed a blueprint for adherence that has been published alongside the Code and 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
sets out the key elements we think will be required for the Code to be successful – and the stepsthat have been taken, and will be taken, to ensure this is the case.One critical dimension is market-based adherence mechanisms. An important element ofdiscipline should come from the market itself. The adherence to a voluntary code will only comeabout if firms judge it to be in their interest and take the practical steps to ensure the Code isembedded in their practices. Such practical steps would include training their staff and putting inappropriate policies and procedures.We have provided a draft Statement of Commitment for firms to publicly demonstrate theiradherence to the Code. One reason for a public demonstration is that firms are more likely toadhere to the Code if they believe that their peers are doing so too. That is, an important sourceof pressure to adhere should come from other market participants. To provide visibility aroundthis, there are a number of market-based initiatives to provide public registries where marketparticipants can demonstrate their use of the Statement of Commitment. These registries will bein the public domain in the near future.More broadly, market participants have a vital interest, and a role to play, in promoting andupholding good practices in the market as a whole. This can be partly achieved through leadingby example, but can also be supported by having similar expectations of counterparties and othermarket participants and helping to raise awareness of the Code in their market interactions. Inthat regard, we have reached out to more than 120 industry associations and key marketinfrastructure providers globally. In Australia, that includes AFMA and the Finance and TreasuryAssociation, as well as the NZFMA.Ultimately the success of the Code in promoting integrity and restoring confidence in thewholesale FX market lies in the hands of its participants.Another aspect of market-based adherence comes through the FXCs. In due course, adherenceto the Code is likely to become a requirement of FXC membership. In Australia’s case,adherence to the Code will be a requirement of membership of the Australian foreign exchangecommittee by the end of this year. That would ensure the Code is embedded at the core of theFX market, given the extent of coverage of the FXCs. But it is also important that it extendsbeyond that, and that there is, at the very least, an awareness of it across all market participants.A second dimension of adherence is that the BIS central banks have signalled their commitmentby announcing that they themselves will follow the Code, and that they expect that theircounterparties will do so too. In the case of the RBA, we will require that our counterparties signthe Statement of Commitment, just as we will ourselves.Given that we provided the full text of the Code to the market only last month, there will be aperiod of time for market participants to adjust their practices where necessary to be in line withthe principles in the Code. I would not expect much time should be required to do this. Thisperiod of time might potentially be as short as six months, but no more than twelve months forthe vast majority of market participants. How much effort this might require will in part depend onthe nature and extent of engagement with the FX market. In drafting the Code, we have alwayskept the principle of proportionality at front of mind.Finally, it is vital that the Code remains up to date and evolves as the market evolves. The Codewill be collectively owned, maintained and updated by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee(GFXC), which met for the first time in London in May. This will continue the public sector –private sector partnership which has supported the development of the Code.The GFXC will regularly assess whether new information or market developments warrantupdates or additions being made to the Code. As the first example of this, given diversity of viewson the use of last look in the market, the GFXC is currently requesting feedback on trading in the34567 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
last look window. On a less frequent basis, the GFXC will oversee a more comprehensivereview of the Code.ConclusionThe Global Code is the culmination of two years of work by a group of people from both theprivate and public sectors. The work reflected a very constructive and cooperative effort betweenthe central banks and market participants. We all undertook this work in addition to our regularresponsibilities, at all hours of the day and night. This contribution of time and effort reflected thefact that all of us recognise the need to restore the public’s faith in the foreign exchange market.We share the view that the Global Code plays an important role in assisting that process andalso in helping improve market functioning and confidence in the market.An app version has also been made available by an external party: app.policystore.ch/C/FXCode/.See <www.bis.org/press/p150511.htm>.www.globalfxc.org/adopting_the_global_code.htmThe Statement of Commitment is in Annex 3 of the Code.The Banking and Finance Oath has a very similar motivation www.thebfo.org/home.See www.bis.org/press/p170525.htm.See www.globalfxc.org/consultative_process.htm71234567 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Philip Lowe: Remarks on a Panel at the Australian NationalUniversity's Crawford Australian Leadership ForumRemarks by Mr Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, on a Panel at theAustralian National University's Crawford Australian Leadership Forum, Canberra, 19 June 2017.*   *   *Thank you for the invitation to be part of this panel at the Crawford Australian Leadership Forum.The central issue is: where does the future growth in the global and Australian economy comefrom?There are four points that I would like to make.1. For a while, growth can come from a cyclical upswing in the global economy.Over 2017, the global economy has improved. It is not just a story in one or two countries,but one that is broad based. After nearly a decade, the healing process after the financialcrisis is well advanced, although there is still plenty of scar tissue. The Chinese economyhas continued to grow, although there are some fault lines. And in Europe, it has been a fewyears now since the underlying problems last erupted. Globally, monetary policy remainsaccommodative, there has been a lot of financial system repair and fiscal policy is no longercontractionary. This is all helping.So we are in a better position than we have been for some time. To be clear, we are nottalking about a boom and there are still plenty of risks out there. But globally things arebetter. Animal spirits have been missing for quite a while and they might just be starting tocome back.2. At some point, the cyclical upswing will run its course. Beyond that, much depends upondemographics and technology. Here there are reasons for pessimism and for optimism.Many developed economies, as well as China and Korea, face big demographic challenges.Populations are stagnant or declining. They are also ageing. Older societies want to save,rather than invest, especially so when there will be fewer people tomorrow than there aretoday. And older societies are likely to be more risk averse. So this is a major issue.On technology, I am more optimistic. There are great advances being made in science: inthe material sciences, in power generation and storage, in genetics and the health sciences,and in computing and artificial intelligence. It is hard to be sure how these will all play out, butadvances in these areas open up possibilities that few of us can imagine. They cantransform our economies and form the basis for a new wave of global investment and higherliving standards. We can’t be sure though: time will tell. But a clear lesson from history isthat advances in technology form the backbone upon which higher living standards are built.An obvious question is how to create and seize these opportunities that technology offers.There will be those in the audience better informed than me on how to do this. I do, though,find it hard to escape the conclusion that the starting point must be heavy investment inhuman capital and the creation of a culture that promotes innovation.A related challenge is dealing with the distributional effects of technological progress. Thesheer scale of global markets means that the potential gains to innovators who can tap intothese markets can be huge. At the same time, new technologies and globalisation createsome losers. At the moment, our societies are struggling in dealing with this tension. Wehave a strong interest in working out how to manage this better. If we don’t do this, 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
technological progress and globalisation could come to be seen as bad things, not the goodthings they are. That would surely harm prospects for long-run global growth.3. In Australia, it is likely that growth over the next couple of years will be a bit stronger than ithas been recently.The pick-up in the global economy is helping us. The return of mining investment to morenormal levels is almost complete. Monetary policy continues to provide support and survey-based measures of business conditions have improved noticeably. Employment growth hasalso strengthened over recent months. These are all positive developments.We do, though, continue to face some headwinds. Households are gradually coming to gripswith slower growth in their real incomes. Growth in wages is unusually low, average hoursworked have declined and the nature of employment is changing. So there is a recalibrationof expectations going on. Many households are also coming to grips with higher debt levelsand, in our largest cities, high housing prices. We need to watch these issues carefully.4. Australia’s longer-term prospects remain positive, but we need to keep working to keep themthat way.Over the past couple of weeks there has been much discussion of Australia’s record run of26 years without a technical recession. This is a significant achievement. We have donebetter than most countries over a long period. But just in case we are inclined to celebratetoo much, we should remember that over those 26 years we have had three periods of risingunemployment. Our strong population growth has also flattered our headline growth figures.As things currently stand, it looks likely that average growth in per capita incomes over thenext quarter of a century will be lower than over the past quarter of a century. We should,though, be capable of stronger growth than we have seen over the past few years. But wecan’t take this for granted. It is important that we have a sharp focus on the reforms that canmake a real difference to our living standards. If we don’t do this, we will fall behind. Thepositive news is that there is no shortage of good ideas here. The not-so-positive news isthat there is a shortage of good ideas that can successfully navigate the political process.As we search for the reforms that will make a difference, we need to be aware that thedrivers of growth in our economy are changing. Natural resources remain our main exportearner, but Australians are increasingly employed in service industries. Right across thespectrum, competitive advantage is increasingly built on technology and managementcapability. This trend is not going to go away and we need to capitalise on it. There is nomagic solution. But, as I said before, the central ingredient lies in investment in humancapital. If we are to grow strongly in the future, then that growth will be built just as much onthe quality of our ideas as it is on the quality of our natural resources.Thank you and I look forward to participating in the panel. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
REMARKS ON THE CHILEAN ECONOMY   Mario Marcel1/ Governor, Central Bank of Chile April 2017    1. The last few months have brought mixed signals for the Chilean economy. Recent data suggest the global outlook appears more favorable, particularly for emerging economies. On the one hand, activity data and expectations in advanced economies have been more upbeat, marked by better than expected performance by the manufacturing sector and a more positive outlook following years of stagnation. As a result, deflationary risks have dissipated, as inflation is expected to return to more normal levels. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has continued to normalize monetary policy and monetary authorities in Europe and Japan appear to have set aside the possibility of additional stimulus measures. Markets have incorporated these changes in their expectations avoiding any serious disruptions. Along with better signs in advanced economies, activity in China has remained relatively stable, which contrasts with what had been observed one year ago.   2. In this context, there has been a generalized increase in willingness to take on risk in financial markets, increasing stock market indices, reducing sovereign risk premiums and increasing capital flows to emerging markets. Commodity prices have also benefitted. Copper, our main export product, has been trading at prices near its two year highs and prospects for the next few years have improved, which has had a material impact on the Chilean terms of trade. Thus, based on better growth prospects for our trading partners, favorable external financial conditions and increased terms of trade, the baseline scenario included in our Monetary Policy Report published the first days of this month, considered that, for the next two years, the Chilean economy will receive an external impulse higher than considered at the end of 2016, when our previous report was published (figure 1).                                                    1/ Breakfast presentation at The Council of the Americas, April 20th, 2017.  
  3. On the domestic front, inflation has been consistent with what was expected in December. The annual variation of the CPI index fell to 2.7% in March, a significant drop compared to the 4.5% figure of a year ago. The behavior of the nominal exchange rate, which has appreciated relative to its level one year ago, has been a fundamental driver of inflationary dynamics. The appreciation has had a greater impact in the decline of the goods component of the CPIEFE index (our core inflation measure). In fact, the goods component of core inflation dropped from nearly 5% at the beginning of 2016 to 0.3% in March. The services component has been stickier, and has dropped from the same levels the first few month of last year to 3.3% in March. An explanation for this is that approximately ¾ of the prices included in this component are administered prices or are indexed to past inflation, a fact that enhances their inertia and, as such, makes them less sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations (figure 2).  Figure 1Source: Central Bank of Chile.(*) For comparison effects with the new 2013 Benchmark Compilation, the ToT of previous Reports are adjusted to 100 for 2013.Terms of trade (*)(index; 2013=100) Trading partners GDP(annual change, percent)2.53.03.54.04.52.53.03.54.04.5Avg.00-07Avg.10-15161718Mar.17Sep.16Dec.1690951001059095100105131415161718Mar.17Sep.16Dec.16
  4. Although in our baseline scenario headline inflation is expected to continue declining in the coming months, reaching levels in the lower bound of our tolerance range, it is foreseen to return to 3% by the end of 2017 and fluctuate close to our target towards the end of the forecast horizon in the first quarter of 2019. Market expectations are very similar to the forecasts included in our latest Report, and also point to CPI inflation fluctuating around our 3% target starting the end of this year. Convergence of inflation rests on two main assumptions. The first one, that our RER will remain relatively stable at its current levels; a level we believe is consistent with fundamentals. And the second one, that the output gap will gradually close by the end of this year (figure 3).  Figure 2Inflation indicators (*)(annual change, percent)(*)StartingfromJanuary2014thenewindexeswithbaseyear2013=100areused,andarethusnotstrictlycomparable with previous figures.Sources: Central Bank of Chile and National Statistics Institute.-4-202468-4-2024681314151617Core goodsCore CPICore servicesCPI
  5. Actually, activity has been worse than expected. According to recent data the output gap is currently somewhat larger than we anticipated in December. GDP grew by 1.6% in 2016, in line with what was anticipated then. However, revised national account data —including the publication of the new Benchmark Compilation, with base year 2013— suggest the economy was somewhat stronger towards the beginning of 2016 and weaker towards the end of the year, leaving a low starting point for 2017 and a higher base of comparison for the beginning of the year. The new data also point to weakness in investment-related areas and in sectors that tend to be more persistent, such as business services (figure 4).   Figure 3(*) The grey area, starting from the first quarter of 2017, corresponds to the forecast.

  6. On the expenditure side, domestic demand—excluding changes in inventories—also tended to decelerate throughout last year. Weakness was most evident in investment in construction and other works, which contracted by 4.9% in annual terms during the fourth quarter (average growth of 0.5% between the first and third quarters).   7. Private consumption, in line with its behavior in the previous years, supported the economy, growing by more than 2% annually throughout 2016. Private consumption has been enhanced by wage growth and a low unemployment rate. However, it must be noted that while consumption of non-durables and services has remained relatively stable, durable goods consumption has recovered, partly due to the appreciation of the peso during the last year, and the necessary replenishment of inventories following several years of weak growth and even contraction. Something similar is observed with gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment. Excluding the purchase of non-regular transport machinery, this component of investment has improved in recent months.  8. In our baseline scenario, gross fixed capital formation will experience a slightly positive growth in 2017, after three consecutive years of contraction. A key factor in the negative figures we have seen the last few years is the end of the mining investment cycle, which reached its peak in 2012. More recently the deterioration of housing construction has added, as the boom triggered by tax incentives finished and a modification of loan-to-value norms reduced home sales. Going forward, our forecasts rely on an increase in non-mining and non-residential investment (mainly machinery and equipment). While mining investment will eventually return to positive territory during 2018, the gradual adjustment in residential investment is expected to continue during the following quarters (figure 5).

  9. The labor market continues to gradually adjust and could become a drag on consumption. Wage employment declined by 2% annually in the moving quarter that ended in February, and annual wage growth moderated. In addition, the number of hours worked declined, at a time when an increasing number of workers suggest their workdays are shorter than desired. In any case, this has not translated into an increase in open unemployment, due to flexibility in the Chilean labor market: the unemployment rate is still low from an historic perspective. In fact, despite being more precarious, self-employment has acted as a significant buffer to the loss of dynamism in wage employment (figure 6).

  10. Domestic financial conditions remain favorable, particularly in terms of interest rates. Notwithstanding, credit volumes have decelerated with respect to previous years, as a result of overall subdued demand. Despite some increase in recent data, arrears ratios are still low, a clear sign that slower growth has not affected the financial health of companies and households.   11. The evolution of the local stock market has caught some attention lately, since the IPSA has increased about 17% this year and more than 30% since December 2015. Although these numbers might ring some bells, the performance of the Chilean index does not differ significantly from other regional stock markets and its recent behavior might just be a catch up from very low levels. Measured in real terms, its current value does not seem to be an outlier either (figure 7).       Figure 6(*) Both the nominal and the real correspond to the average of the annual variation of IREM and CMO.Source: National Statistics Institute (INE).Wages (*)(annual change, percent)(annual change, percent)Job creation by category-10-5051015-6-3036911121314151617WageSelf-employment 01234567801234567811121314151617NominalReal
  12. The prolonged strike at the Escondida, the open-pit copper mine with the world’s largest production, will have a very important effect on our first quarter GDP figures. It already did in the Imacec of February, which showed a yoy contraction of 1.3%, with a fall of 17.1% of its mining component. Since the strike ended in late March and resuming normal production levels is not instantaneously, the figures of that month will also be affected. If you add the continued weakness in construction, the economy could experience an expansion close to 0% in the first quarter of the year. However, one should not forget that the strike at Escondida, while very relevant to explain the first quarter figure, is a one-off event that is not expected to generate significant spillovers on activity elsewhere in the economy, nor on inflation.     13. For these reasons we reduced our growth forecast for 2017, and we are now projecting GDP will be in the 1-2% range (1.5-2.5% in December). At the same time, for 2018 we are expecting the economy to grow between 2.25 and 3.25% (table 1). The growth recovery is based on the fact that the economy does not appear to have any relevant imbalances, the mining-related investment adjustment is expected to end, and as I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation, the global outlook appears more favorable. Fiscal policy is assumed to follow the fiscal consolidation path announced by the Government.    Figure 7Sources: Central Bank of Chile and Bloomberg.Real IPSA(fixed-base index: January 2013=100)(fixed-base index: January 2001=100)MSCI: Latin America3060901203060901201314151617BrazilChileLatin AmericaMexicoPeruColombia5015025035050150250350010305070911131517
  14. Or growth scenario also assumes that monetary policy will remain expansionary throughout the policy horizon. Following our communication in December, when we signaled that an additional impulse was necessary for inflation to converge to the target, during the first months of the year, we reduced the monetary policy rate (MPR) by 50 basis points (bp), leaving it at 3%. These actions meant anticipating our December announcement. Later, in our March Report, we announced the need of a slightly greater monetary policy impulse. As a result, we used the working assumption that the MPR would follow a trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days prior to its statistical closing. In practice, this meant at least one additional 25bp cut. It is always worth remembering that this is a working assumption and as such, contingent to the new developments and their impact on projected inflation. If incoming information points at the necessity of an additional boost or, on the contrary, if this is no longer needed, we will react promptly, communicating the justification of doing so. Consistent with the assumption used in our March Report, in April we decided to lower the MPR by 25bp, to 2.75%. The press release issued then stated that we will assess the need for some additional increase in the monetary impulse, which will hinge on the medium-term inflation outlook (figure 8). This way, our monetary policy continues to be one of the most expansionary in a group of comparable economies.

   15. As usual when making forecasts, our macroeconomic scenario faces several risks. If they materialize, they may reshape the macroeconomic outlook and, therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. We have identified two types of risks in the external front facing the Chilean economy. Some of them may potentially have a material impact, yet are hard to quantify (such as political-economic uncertainty). Others risks have been mentioned for quite some time, but their likelihood have varied. Regarding the latter, the expected trajectories of fiscal and monetary policy in the U.S. may potentially generate upside or downside risks. China remains a source of concern although its authorities appear to have successfully managed a gradual deceleration without a major disruption thus far. These are probably risks for most economies of the world, but particularly for a small open economy, such as Chile.  16. On the domestic front, after several years of subdued growth, we cannot rule out that a more persistent phenomenon may be affecting the economy’s ability to grow, in which case it would be necessary to revise the public and private expenditure plans. Moreover, while the labor market has gradually adjusted without generating a significant increase in unemployment, it is possible that after several years of low growth, firms require larger personnel adjustments, especially if the expected growth recovery towards the end of the year stalls. In contrast, in the context of the absence of observable macroeconomic imbalances that hinder growth, a scenario in which the global outlook improves, combined with the end of the adjustment of mining-related investment, and a rebound in sentiment, may lead to a more dynamic recovery (figure 9).

17. In fact, several fundamentals of the Chilean economy have remained quite solid during this weaker part of the cycle. As you might know, Chile was one of the first few countries to introduce a structural fiscal policy, which has been applied consistently over more than 15 years. As part of this policy, the government has been able to save during good times and currently has two sovereign wealth funds, totaling almost 10% of GDP.     18.  Strength of our country is the fact that compared to earlier low-growth periods it has more liquid external funds available. At the same time, the financial sector is healthy and non-performing loans have diminished over time. Reforms currently under discussion, particularly a New General Banking Law, aim to bolster resilience and improve banking capital adequacy ratios (figure 10).

   The medium- and long-term outlook   19. The Chilean economy has endured a long period of slow growth, while its potential growth has dropped to a range between 2.5% and 3%, i.e., less than estimated a decade ago (4% to 5%). In principle, this change is explained by: (a) a smaller contribution of the accumulation of productive factors, inherent to a maturing economy; (b) a drop in gross fixed capital formation that has lasted several years; (c) reduced mining productivity; and (d) a limited contribution of productivity growth in the other sectors.  20. The reduced potential growth calls for closer attention to the determinants of longer-term growth. Although the incidence of monetary policy is mild, every central bank must be able to monitor the developments affecting the future path of the economy to ensure a more effective monetary policy.   21. Among Chile’s future growth possibilities is the fact that closing the output gap would allow boosting growth in a stable manner from just less than 2% in recent years to a 2.5% to 3% range. As I mentioned before, this is grounded on a better external scenario, the fading of some sectoral factors that have slowed down the pace of growth, a more expansionary monetary policy, and the lack of macroeconomic growth constraints. This requires more dynamic exports, domestic demand and investment.  22. A more significant increase in investment that brings it closer to its historical rates, coupled by increased factor mobility, would boost growth to a sustainable rate of around Figure 10(*) Shows the region’s simple average.Source: Global Financial Stability Report, IMF.NPL(percent of total loans)Regulatory Capital(percent of risk-weighted assets)0369121518036912151810111213141516Latin America (*)0123012310111213141516Chile
3.5%. This would require revitalizing mining investment, better investor expectations in the rest of the economy, favorable financial conditions, and the elimination of bottlenecks that hinder the reallocation of resources toward more competitive areas. A smooth operation of both the labor market and the capital market is essential for this.  23. Regarding productivity growth in the other sectors, the possibility of further improvements relies mainly on: (1) increasing human capital accumulation through increased labor participation, raising working skills above the already projected levels or the migration of workers with the competences required by the Chilean system; and (2) making productivity improvements via enhancing companies’ efficiency, lowering production and trading costs, and changing output composition toward more competitive and productive sectors, while advancing in terms of innovation and technological development.  24. As Chile’s concern for growth has intensified, many ideas about public policies have emerged that could help enhance productivity, with proposals coming from the government, private agents and the National Productivity Commission. In particular, policies have been developed that have permitted to diversify the energy matrix, increase supply reliability and reduce costs. There have been other factors, however, that pose a risk to productivity, including initiatives that may overburden corporate costs, generate new trading costs or reduce savings.  25. Finally, any discussion about productivity must necessarily cover technological development. This is a key driver of economies’ productivity and competitiveness around the world. It is obvious in my opinion that the new technologies, knowledge and innovation capacity are input into the productive system through new ventures, investments and restructurings.  
Jens Weidmann: Welcome remarks - "Frontiers in Central Banking -Past, Present and Future"Welcome remarks by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank andChairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the BundesbankPolicy Symposium "Frontiers in Central Banking - Past, Present and Future", Frankfurt am Main,14 June 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenI bid you all a warm welcome here today at the Bundesbank Policy Symposium entitled "Frontiersin Central Banking – Past, Present and Future".Conferences like this one feed off the knowledge and experiences of their participants. And that’swhy I’m proud that so many high-ranking academics and policymakers have accepted ourinvitation to be here today. Let me therefore extend my cordial thanks to all the panellists andmoderators who are involved in this event. I am particularly indebted to Otmar Issing, who willmake some concluding remarks at the end of today’s proceedings.But as Karl Popper once pointed out, no matter how knowledgeable we are: to find out whetherour ideas are sound, we need other people to try them out on. That’s the reason for today’ssymposium, and that is why I would like to thank the organisers of the symposium and,especially, Emanuel Mönch and his team, who arranged the programme.Ladies and gentlemen, I’m quite sure I’m telling you nothing new when I say that (modern) centralbanking is a consequence of crises.The Federal Reserve is a prominent example. It was established in 1913 as an answer tofinancial panics. When, in the 19th century, bank deposits began to emerge alongsidebanknotes, financial soundness became an issue for central banks. Banks operating in afractional reserve system are susceptible to a bank run. That is why the function of the centralbank as a lender of last resort gained importance – a development which was described inparticularly lucid terms by the British journalist, businessman, and essayist Walter Bagehot in hisbook "Lombard Street".Financial panics and bank runs were a recurring feature at the time, particularly during thesecond half of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century – not only in the UnitedKingdom but also in the United States and other countries. The sole original purpose of the Fed,then, was to preserve financial stability.According to Robert Latham Owen, one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed wasestablished to "provide a means by which periodic panics which shake the American Republicand do it enormous injury shall be stopped."Today, however, we know that placing the primary focus on financial stability turned out to beproblematic. When speculative lending ballooned in the late 1920s, the Fed, in pursuit of itsmandate, tightened monetary conditions in a situation when inflation rates were already slightlynegative.While the Fed could not stop asset prices from soaring, its interest rate moves contributed to aneconomic downturn. This disconnect threw into sharp relief the mispricing in the asset markets.The crash of October 1929 was then followed by waves of bank failures.12 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Having seen the impact of the Great Depression, central banks increasingly shifted their focustowards macroeconomic objectives: price stability and – in the case of the Fed – employment.Financial stability, by contrast, dropped off monetary policymakers’ radar.The Deutsche Bundesbank is another example of the role which crises played in the definition ofa central bank’s mandate. When the Bank was established exactly 60 years ago, there was abroad understanding that its primary objective should be to "maintain the stability of thecurrency". After the German population had suffered the loss of their savings twice in the first halfof the 20th century – in the early 1920s due to hyperinflation, and after the Second World Wardue to the suppressed inflation caused by the wartime economy and the ensuing currencyreform – they held price stability in very high store. And so it was widely appreciated by societythat the Bundesbank interpreted its mandate as meaning that it should maintain price stability.The oil crises of the 1970s and 80s were further events that shaped central banking. It wasduring this time that the merits of politically independent central banks like the Bundesbank andthe Swiss National Bank came into sharp focus. They were able to disconnect their economiesfrom the worldwide inflation train by pursuing policies which were aimed squarely at preservingprice stability. As a consequence, their institutional design formed the basis for the globalconsensus about monetary policy – a consensus which is still in place today:1.    Central banks should primarily aim to maintain price stability, that is to say, consumer pricestability.2.    Central banks should be independent of their governments.3.    The credibility of central banks’ commitment to low, but slightly positive inflation – byanchoring inflation expectations – is key to their ability to deliver on their price stability objective.This consensus shaped the statutes of many central banks, not least that of the EuropeanCentral Bank, which was agreed upon in 1991.But this view was fundamentally challenged when the crisis struck.Central banks around the world intervened on a massive scale: interest rates were slashed to all-time lows, and unprecedented non-standard measures were rolled out. This was in keeping withthe then-reigning consensus: that monetary policy cannot be used effectively to deflate a bubble,but it can clean up afterwards if a bubble bursts. A consensus which was called into questionafter the crisis.In the euro area, where the financial and economic crisis evolved into a sovereign debt crisis in2010, monetary policymakers repeatedly came under pressure to prevent the crisis fromescalating. Sometimes they went to the very limits of their mandate. 2. Benefits and boundaries of unconventional monetary policiesCentral banks all over the world reacted in classic Bagehot fashion when the financial crisiserupted. As soon as mistrust between private money market players began to take hold and thespread between the risk premiums for secured and unsecured money market transactionsskyrocketed, the volume of money market transactions fell and the number of participants inmonetary policy operations soared.The Governing Council of the ECB reacted swiftly and decisively by switching its refinancingoperations to tenders with full allotment. As long as banks were able to pledge adequatecollateral, they received unlimited amounts of liquidity from the Eurosystem. In practice, this34 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
allowed them to bypass the strained interbank market. The Governing Council also offeredadditional longer-term refinancing operations, including the three-year refinancing operations atthe end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 in particular.This way, the Eurosystem took over much of the money market's role as an intermediary. In sodoing, it made sure that monetary policy impulses would still find their way into the real economy.And by lending freely, it helped dispel concerns about banks’ liquidity and thus prevent a run.By providing oxygen to the economy, central banks are able to offer vital support. But in the longterm, an oxygen supply is no substitute for a healthy heart. Quite the opposite, in fact: if a tank ofoxygen takes the place of exercise and a healthy diet, it might prolong the condition if it isadministered for too long.Hence, if the abundant injections of central bank money are used not only to bridge temporaryliquidity shortfalls but, in extremis, to keep insolvent banks on long-term life support, matterscould get tricky.The more the central bank safeguards banks against risks and promises them central bankfunding even in dubious situations, the more they will have an incentive to take on excessiverisks, of course. Raghuram Rajan and Jean Tirole, amongst others, have convincingly arguedthat the implicit promise of a central bank to step in by lowering interest rates and injectingliquidity when banks default whets banks' appetite for risk.This also shows that selecting an appropriate strategy for liquidity provision is something of abalancing act. Being too restrictive in granting liquidity can cause a spark to turn into a fire.Granting liquidity too liberally, on the other hand, and propping up institutions without sustainablebusiness models, may also mean that the water used to extinguish the fire ends up causingmore damage than the fire itself. This is all the more relevant as it is hard to determine ex antewhether an institution is illiquid or insolvent.By the same token, another unconventional policy comes with risks attached, too. I am talkingabout the large-scale purchases of sovereign debt which have been deployed by many centralbanks in response to the crisis.By buying up large quantities of sovereign bonds, central banks are able to push down long-terminterest rates. This provides additional monetary policy stimulus, but at the cost of potentiallybecoming a sovereign’s largest creditor. In a currency union like the European one, with a singlemonetary policy but national economic and fiscal policies, sovereign bond purchases blur thoseall-important boundaries between monetary and fiscal policy.At the end of the day, this can lead to political pressure being exerted on the Eurosystem tomaintain the very accommodative monetary policy for longer than appropriate from a pricestability standpoint. After all, in the context of these asset purchases, changes in monetary policyimpact more directly on governments' funding costs than interest rate moves. And they arenaturally also more problematic in view of the disciplining effect of the capital markets ongovernment finances. This is a risk for the euro area in particular, as risk differentiation betweenthe different countries is significantly reduced. 3. The hot potato of policy interventionStill, the risk-reward profile of sovereign bond purchases certainly differs depending on theinstitutional set-up of the policy area in question. A central bank buying up federal bonds to drivedown the long-term risk-free interest rate with a view to speeding up inflation is a different kettleof fish from one acting as a lender of last resort to governments. And this brings me to the issue56 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
debated in today’s second panel: "Who is willing to act? Passing on the hot potato of policyintervention."Economists like Paul de Grauwe argue that monetary policymakers should channel their innerBagehot when it comes to sovereign debt.In his view, a sovereign that is actually solvent but suddenly falls prey to the sceptical gaze of themarket can be driven into insolvency by the rising interest burden. Downgraded marketperceptions can amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy, a phenomenon which economists refer to asmarkets with multiple equilibria.In such cases a central bank should come to a country's aid, according to de Grauwe. Just asacting as the lender of last resort to banks serves to safeguard financial stability, so, too, couldcentral bank intervention in the government bond market fulfil the same purpose.But for me, this stretches the analogy too far. Lending to governments is different in that it is notcollateralised. Walter Bagehot advised central banks to lend to banks only against adequatecollateral, such that moral hazard is minimised. Buying up sovereign bonds amounts to lendingto governments without mitigating the risks of moral hazard that come with it.A second difficulty stems from the fact that it is exceedingly difficult to determine thefundamentally justified price for sovereign debt – in other words, it is all but impossible to judgewhether the market reaction is justified or overblown. In determining the price by themselves,central banks are setting themselves up for pressure from governments who tend to think thatthey deserve better rates. It follows that the notion of central banks acting as a lender of last resort to governments is lessin keeping with the Bagehot tradition than is sometimes assumed.And it runs into arguably far greater problems with moral hazard, especially in a monetary unionwith fiscally sovereign member states, as I mentioned before.Incentives to reform public finances and the real economy are stunted. If action is taken at thenational level but accountability is located at the European level, chances are that euro areagrowth will atrophy rather than accelerate.Research also suggests that providing a central bank backstop for government finances canhave detrimental effects on capital allocation by the financial sector. A recent study by ViralAcharya and others looks at the real effects of the announcement of the OMT programme andfinds that while it stabilised the banking system, it also increased zombie lending by banks tounproductive firms. Creditworthy firms in industries with a prevalence of zombie firms sufferedsignificantly from credit misallocation, which slowed down the economic recovery.Who, then, should take on the hot potato of policy intervention to avoid the pitfalls of last resortlending when a country runs into financing troubles? It might help to look at what can be done tomitigate the ill-effects of central bank lending to banks. The answer here is an effective bankrecovery and resolution regime. If banks turn out to be not temporarily illiquid but truly insolvent,they will need to be restructured or resolved. As the late Allan Meltzer once quipped: "Capitalismwithout failure is like religion without sin. It doesn't work." This holds for banks and for companiesin general. In the euro area, progress has been made in terms of requiring banks to hold highercapital buffers as well as establishing the Single Resolution Mechanism.But similar progress is lacking when it comes to the possibility of restructuring sovereign debt.The ESM could function as a vehicle for such a regime. But crucial elements are still missing.One such element is changing the contractual terms of government bonds in the euro area by78 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
introducing an automatic maturity extension for all bonds, which would be activated the momenta government applies for an ESM programme. Ongoing deficits would therefore be financed, butoriginal creditors would not be paid off for maturing bonds.Not only would this continue to provide incentives for private creditors to lend cautiously, it wouldalso significantly reduce the need for financial aid under an ESM programme. Furthermore, itwould vastly broaden the scope of the rescue mechanism. Had it been possible to automaticallyextend the maturity of bonds back in 2011, Portugal would only have needed around €43 billion tocover its entire budget deficit until 2014, rather than the €76 billion in total that it received inassistance loans.This solution would allow the ESM to work as a restructuring regime. Automatic maturityextension buys time to figure out whether a country is merely facing a liquidity shortfall or is, infact, insolvent. Bonds bought by private creditors can still be restructured at a later date, whileofficial support can be used to smooth the economic adjustment process.Of course, the financial system must also be able to withstand a debt restructuring. Otherwise,precious little would have been gained. Because privileged regulatory treatment allows banks tobuy almost unlimited amounts of government bonds, which they are not required to back withcapital, a haircut is particularly risky for banks. That has got to change.Not until banks have begun to hold sufficient capital against government bonds and the size ofindividual exposures has been limited, will banks be able to effectively cope with the process ofrestructuring sovereign debt. And only then is there likely to be any concrete political will to takesuch action. Government bonds are far from being risk-free. Banking regulation shouldacknowledge this fact once and for all.Capping the size of individual sovereign exposures in bank balance sheets would provide muchof the diversification benefits that are envisaged by the European Safe Bond proposal theEuropean Commission has recently taken up. That proposal conceives a diversified securitywhere member state sovereign debt is pooled and divided into a safe tranche and a juniortranche, thereby providing for risk-free assets.But a European Safe Bond created by an official European entity could be perceived as astepping stone towards full-blown Eurobonds, i.e. mutual liability.To avoid that perception, European Safe Bonds would have to be constructed by marketparticipants.It would be easier still to split new sovereign bonds into senior and junior bonds at the time ofissuance, sensibly adding a maturity extension feature for the junior bond. Combined witheffective regulation of sovereign bonds, this solution would offer the same advantages ofdiversification and safe-asset generation while being arguably much more feasible politically.These are steps that would allow the potato to be taken when it’s hot. But, of course, it would bebetter still to not let matters come to the boil in the first place. And this means strengtheningsustainable growth.I’m convinced that we all share the view that it’s not central banks which can put the economy ona higher growth path. It’s up to governments to unlock economic growth. What’s needed arereforms fostering competition and innovation to make investment more profitable. With regard toEurope, the finalisation of a common services market and a single digital market are promisinginitiatives. Studies suggest that this could yield double the growth effects unleashed by thecreation of the common market for goods. By the same token, unleashing the forces of the market would not only serve growth. More910 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
geographically diversified investment would strengthen risk sharing as well, as profits and lossesare shared more across borders. The euro area has some catching up to do when it comes toprivate risk sharing, and this is why we need to press ahead with the capital markets union.  Lowering the barriers that prevent enterprises from exiting the market will likewise foster growth.It would facilitate what Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction". OECD researchsuggests that policy-induced exit barriers matter for productivity growth, because fewer exits leadto less scope for productivity spillovers and to the misallocation of labour, capital and skills. Itconcludes, for instance, that insolvency regimes should be streamlined.This is also importantwhen it comes to financial market integration and private risk sharing.  And investing more in skills and education promises to deliver rich rewards, too. This would notonly boost labour productivity, but also make workers less at risk of losing their jobs. And this inturn would be the most effective antidote to the widespread sense of being fundamentallythreatened by globalisation and technological progress.Fortunately, many of the measures that foster growth also make the economy more resilient.And more resilience is needed, because long recessions can reduce potential growth. Butmore can be done to bolster resilience, for instance, by shoring up the shock-absorbing capacityof public finances. With regard to the euro area, this implies stronger fiscal discipline andcompliance with the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. 4. How do new technologies shape the future of central banking?Ladies and gentlemen, getting the issue of policy intervention right still seems to be a formidabletask. But while no effort should be spared in addressing this topic, central banks need to beaware that, more often than not, change is not the result of crisis, but of technology.Every technology comes with technical risks – the recent WannaCry cyber attacks are a case inpoint. But the main challenge for central banks will probably lie with the tectonic shifts triggeredby digitalisation. Digitalisation will spawn new forms of financial intermediation. While this mightbe a boon to the economy, central banks will be faced with questions regarding the transmissionof their monetary policy.Some even suggest that privately issued digital currencies might do away with our currenciesaltogether. However, closer economic analysis indicates that this scenario is likely to beoverblown. As a medium of exchange and unit of account, money is subject to substantialnetwork externalities that alternative currencies seem unlikely to overcome. I am also prettyconfident that central banks are better able to deliver price stability than a rigid monetary rule oran algorithm.But even if private digital currencies do remain a fringe phenomenon, central banks are urged bysome to consider embracing the new era by issuing their own digital currencies. This wouldmean that non-financial corporations and even households would have access to the centralbank balance sheet in the form of digital balances which – unlike cash – have no noteworthystorage costs.What might appear intriguing from a technological point of view raises fundamental questionsabout the nature of the financial system and our economy at large.Allowing the public to hold claims on the central bank might make their liquid assets safer,because a central bank cannot become insolvent. This is an feature which will become relevantespecially in times of crisis – when there will be a strong incentive for money holders to switchbank deposits into the official digital currency simply at the push of a button. But what might be a1112 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
boon for savers in search of safety might be a bane for banks, as this makes a bank runpotentially even easier.But in taking deposits away from banks, it also removes their ability to engage in maturity andliquidity transformation and make loans.A new technology therefore reopens an old debate in economics: does maturity transformationenhance welfare, or should banks be prevented from creating liquidity?My personal take on this is that central banks should strive to make existing payment systemsmore efficient and still faster than they already are – instant payment is the buzzword here. I ampretty confident that this will reduce most citizens’ interest in digital currencies. 5. ConclusionAt this point I would like to conclude. (Modern) central banking itself is the consequence ofeconomic crises, but it is certainly not the answer to end all questions. And for the host of aneconomic conference like this, that is not necessarily a bad thing!On that note, I am now looking forward to the answers our esteemed participants come up with!

Muhammad bin Ibrahim: Perspectives and issues in navigating thedevelopment of the Malaysian financial marketRemarks by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank NegaraMalaysia), at the ASEAN Risk Conference 2017 “Perspectives and Issues in Navigating theDevelopment of the Malaysian Financial Market”, Kuala Lumpur, 24 May 2017.*   *   *Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Two years ago, I spoke at this very conference on ASEANintegration. Two years on, I am pleased to share that we have achieved substantial progress onthis front. Among others, the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework and the bilateralframeworks to settle trade in local currencies are two significant milestones for financialintegration.Today, I intend to speak on a few issues relating to ASEAN integration and outline the latestdevelopments and challenges in the domestic financial market.For decades, globalisation has been the cornerstone of global economic development.Globalisation was a way to bring the countries of the world together to gradually flatten the inter-country disparities in income, wealth and overall standard of living, in hope that the motivation forwar and conflict among countries would gradually reduce as disparities narrowed. Globalisationexpanded trade and the free flow of capital, allowing countries to reap the benefits of comparativeadvantage while facilitating the growth of new sources of income and the transfer of knowledgeand technologies.Truth be told, globalisation bore fruits that lead to greater economic growth, prosperity andwealth. However, in the dogmatic pursuit of inter-country convergence, intra-country disparitieshave become increasingly apparent. As nations across the globe were brought closer together,citizens within each nation were pulled further apart, separated by the rising inequality, thedeclining share of labour income versus capital, and the displacement of workers.The unfettered market openness by advanced economies had caused unintendedconsequences that have ignited the rise to populism, inward-looking tendencies and potentiallyprotectionist policies. If left to run its course, this will be a setback to global prosperity. In ASEAN,we are no stranger to this perspective. Our own experience is highly relevant.We learnt from the Asian Financial Crisis, that pushing countries to adopt policies whenreadiness is suspect is a design for failure. Without the necessary preconditions of soundinstitutional frameworks, adequate safeguards and capacity and robust domestic financialmarkets, premature financial liberalisation will expose the economy to waves of destabilisingshort-term speculative flows. When these flows leave, a trail of destruction is left behind. Wealso learnt that proper sequencing and readiness of financial liberalisation is key.The criticism that ASEAN’s ‘steam engine’ may not be ‘full speed ahead’ does not capture the fullpicture. This view fails to consider and understand that quality, not the speed and quantum ofintegration, is what really matters. The focus of integration should not be on speed, but onbuilding the collective capacity, readiness and resilience of member countries.ASEAN is committed to pursue market openness within this region, but also wants to remaindeeply integrated within the global economy. A ‘Global ASEAN’ is not an oxymoron – rather it is adeclaration of our inclinations, aspirations and direction for the future. Rather than a narrowpursuit of openness for its own sake, experience taught us that balance, readiness andinclusiveness is critical for the success for an open market economy. As a group, ASEAN hasbeen very mindful of the stage of financial and economic development of individual countries. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
ASEAN pursues ‘smart’ integration that is based on the readiness and capacity of membercountries.From the global financial crisis to the presentWe are now entering a decade after the Global Financial Crisis (more apt to be called TransAtlantic Financial Crisis) and two decades after the Asian Financial Crisis. The implementation ofunconventional policies and a prolonged period of low interest rates, led to financial andeconomic distortions, some severe, around the world. Emerging markets, including Malaysia,witnessed large waves of capital inflows into capital markets, primarily in search of better yield.For our onshore domestic market, we saw the ringgit strengthening following the demand forringgit assets. Between 2011 to 2013, the ringgit traded at its strongest levels since the AsianFinancial Crisis, between 2.90 to 3.30 against the US dollar. FX trading volume also increased,contributing to the overall liquidity of the onshore FX market. At the same time, the increasedlevels of non-resident investments in Malaysian financial assets had pushed non-residentholdings of Malaysian government bonds to rise to the height of 33.6% in May 2013.These heights came with costs, heightened risks and vulnerabilities. From the Taper Tantrum in2013 onwards, our markets went through several bouts of volatility. These were largely driven byvolatile portfolio flows. During the Taper Tantrum in 2013 itself, we saw outflows of USD19.1billion and a depreciation of 9.7% of the ringgit against the US dollar.Despite this, our capacity, capability and resilience in managing these sizable and volatilefinancial flows have been fortified in a number of ways. Our economic fundamentals haveremained healthy and our financial market is more diversified and well-developed. This enhancedthe ability of the financial system to absorb capital inflows and outflows, thereby minimisingdisruptions while ensuring that these flows can be effectively intermediated to support realeconomic activity.Malaysia’s exchange rate regime has also accorded the necessary flexibility for the exchangerate to adjust to the changing conditions. This has provided a good balance between flexibilityand stability. Our ability to manage domestic liquidity has also improved significantly, supportedby a wider range of instruments to conduct monetary operations and strengthened surveillancesystems.Pervasive impact of the offshore marketsHowever, one noticeable observation over the years was that, for each episode of volatility wefaced, the subsequent calm would see an even larger build-up of risks. In particular, with the highnon-resident investors’ participation in the onshore financial market, we saw significant growth inthe ringgit NDF market. More recently, in November 2016, non-resident investors’ holdingsreached a record high of 34.7% of Malaysian Government Bonds. While some argue that theringgit NDF market is used by non-resident investors to hedge their ringgit assets, the reality isfar more sobering. It is mostly used for speculative purposes.These speculative activities have shown to have adverse negative spillovers to the onshorefinancial market due to its volatility. More importantly, the sheer volume of this market, whichsurpassed over 300% of GDP in 2015, underscores the extent of disconnect between NDFtrading and economic reality. Given the size, onshore markets were vulnerable to the arbitraryand unpredictable nature of the offshore market.Besides this vulnerability, there was an even larger long term challenge that we faced. Theoffshore market was developing and thriving at the expense and detriment of the onshore marketand domestic stability. The recent developments following the US presidential election haveattested to this fact. Following the results of the presidential election, the ringgit NDF was traded 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
as high as 2168 pips away from the onshore market close during the New York trading hours.Such a significant move is obviously driven more by speculative activities and misplaced marketsentiment rather than any significant change in the economic fundamentals of the country.Given the divergence between offshore and onshore ringgit prices, arbitrage opportunities fornon-resident investors persisted. To make things worse, even our own market players, began toconsistently take the cue from the NDF market. This placed unwarranted downward pressure onthe ringgit. Most unfortunate is the lack of concern by regulators where the NDF activities werethriving despite of the adverse impact on the affected currencies.With the extreme destabilising effects of the offshore ringgit NDF market on domestic ringgitpricing, we took a broad spectrum of measures to reduce the speculative and damaginginfluence of these activities. Part of this was our stricter enforcement of non-facilitation rules foroffshore derivatives. The long-standing prohibition on domestic players to facilitate transactionsof offshore markets was extended to non-resident financial institutions via a compulsoryattestation requirement. We also facilitated and managed the exit of significant short-termpositions related to the NDF market. Certainly, these aggravated the immediate pressures on theringgit but were very necessary to any eventual stabilisation of the currency.I am pleased to share that a number of global financial institutions have complied with ourrequirements. But, there are still a few holdouts. We are perplexed as to how these financialinstitutions can continue to operate or facilitate an activity that clearly contravenes our rules andregulations. We will continue to enforce our measures and look at avenues to deal with thosewho facilitate the ringgit NDF activities.The destabilising implications arising from the offshore activities gave a bad name to the market-based mechanism. It corrupted the idea of market openness and the liberalisation process. Suchdestabilising risks bear upon the integration process among financial markets of this region.Developing long term solutions through the Financial Markets CommitteeAddressing the speculative impact of the NDF market is only part of the solution. Of greaterimportance is the need to put in place sustainable long-term solutions. With this in mind, theFinancial Markets Committee (FMC) was established in 2016, and tasked with the responsibilityto look into the overall development and strategy for the Malaysian financial market. The FMCalso looked into the factors that caused imbalances in the demand and supply of foreigncurrencies in the domestic market, including the reduced capacity of the market to provideliquidity to intermediate the portfolio adjustment by non-residents.The underlying motivation of the FMC is to create a deeper and more liquid onshore market thatwill enhance its capacity to intermediate these flows and strengthen our resilience againstexcessive volatility. Despite the havoc caused by episodes of volatility from the opaque,unregulated and value destroying activities of the NDF market, the FMC in identifying the possibleremedial measures have concluded that market based mechanism and solutions is still the bestway forward.Through close consultation with various stakeholders, including corporate entities and small andmedium size enterprises, the FMC developed a series of targeted initiatives to develop theonshore financial market. The first series of initiatives announced on 2 December 2016, seeks toprovide greater room for the onshore ringgit hedging for both resident and non-residents. Thefocus was on ensuring better access to the onshore financial market.In particular, residents can now hedge without providing underlying documents up to certainlimits, while registered non-resident investors have the flexibility to carry out dynamic hedging. Atthe same time, the scope of the appointed overseas office framework was widened to providegreater avenues for non-residents to access the onshore financial market. 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The second series of initiatives announced on 13 April 2017, introduced greater flexibility forinvestors to manage currency and interest rate risks. Registered investors can now conduct fulldynamic hedging and resident investors can now conduct short-selling for Malaysian governmentsecurities. All these flexibilities are expected to increase the ease of hedging business risks. Theaim is to promote a two-way liquidity in the onshore financial market. At the end of the day, weenvision that the implementation of these initiatives will make the domestic financial market amarket of choice, where prices are determined by the real economy devoid of speculative anddamaging activities. In this respect, we have introduced initiative that enables non-residentinvestors to access and hedge ringgit assets in the domestic markets.We are mindful that for the NDF market to truly reduce in significance and adverse influences,the onshore market must become highly competitive, not just the foreign exchange market butalso all aspects of the financial market. We are determined to realise the idea of having a marketthat possesses the breadth and depth to cater to the increasingly complex and diverse needs ofthe economy, and a market that is able to sustain and weather volatilities that contribute to theoverall wellbeing of the economy.The early positive results of the measures speak for themselves. The onshore foreign exchangemarket now regularly records a healthy daily volume. In addition, the ringgit exchange rate hasremained stable with volatility reducing by half since the introduction of these measures. Thedomestic bond market is now more resilient as speculative positions have mostly exited themarket. There is a larger composition of stable and longer term investors. This fact is muchmore important than just looking at the percentages or size of non-resident holdings. Ourexperience suggests that there is a threshold where non-resident investors will become adestabilising force.The success of our measures and our continued faith in the market mechanism is now validatedand restored.Ensuring trust, confidence and integrity of the financial market There are many lessons that we ought to learn. Some of the disruptions were caused from theuncompetitive market behaviors and questionable conduct by players. More evidently in recenttimes, cases of market manipulation and illegal fixing of interest rate and foreign exchangebenchmarks have surfaced globally. These cases were only possible because of collusion andhave collectively undermined the trust, integrity and confidence in the global financial market. Theconsequences are dire. As the saying goes, ‘trust takes years to build, seconds to break, andforever to repair’.One significant example of such far-reaching incidents that undermined trust, was themanipulation of the LIBOR benchmark, a benchmark rate used to price a market estimated atUSD450 trillion. Ineffective due diligence in the case of a rogue trader of a French bank and the‘London Whale’ incident has also tarnished the credibility of some international institutions.Closer to home, two Australian banks were charged for manipulating the NDF ringgit fixing rate inSingapore.For the Malaysian market, we have recently introduced the Principles for a Fair and EffectiveFinancial Market (Principles) on 13 April 2017 as part of our market development strategy touphold and maintain the trust, integrity and confidence. These principles represent the universaloverarching ideals for a fair and effective financial market. It complements the rules-basedguidelines and regulations, including the recently revised Code of Conduct.I wish to highlight these principles;1. Professionalism and integrity, through universal adoption of best market practices;2. Full transparency and accountability, in all aspects of market participation; 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
3. A competitive environment that is free from collusive, fraudulent and manipulative activities;4. Good internal governance and due diligence, supported by robust internal surveillance andreporting mechanisms; and5. Compliance to prevailing rules, regulations and market codes while extending fullcooperation to the authorities.The Principles should be universally applied, internalised and practiced by all parties that transactin the Malaysian financial market. These Principles must be demonstrated consistently in thedaily conduct of market participants.Outcomes of the Adherence to the Principles will result in a well-functioning marketThe Principles are intended to result in a fair and effective financial market that efficientlyintermediates the funding needs of the economy and resilient in the face of shocks. Oneparticular aspect of the Principles is on the adherence to rules and regulations, a critical pillar offinancial stability, and a Code of Conduct expanded to explicitly prohibit transactions inunauthorised markets. This includes, in particular, the NDF market.These Principles ought to result in three key outcomes:1. Firstly, balanced perspectives when formulating policy and assessing market development.Such balance is needed between growth and stability, whereby growth of the financialmarket must be consistent with economic fundamentals. We have seen in many instanceshow the size of the financial market can be disconnected, and has grown too large for thereal economy.Most of the activities in these outsized markets do not contribute to sustainable growth andconsist mainly of speculative activities. Speculative activity is a major source of vulnerabilitynot only for the financial market but also to the real economy, which if left unattended, couldlead to devastating financial crises. Arguments expounding that these activities provideliquidity are delusional, and at best deflective.2. Secondly, the outcome of the Principles is to level the playing field among market players.This means a market that cannot be distorted by any institution or individual. All participants,either large or small will have fair access to the market, without fear of being subjected tomarket collusion and manipulation. It ought to create an efficient, competitive andtransparent market that will contribute to economic prosperity.3. Thirdly, the outcome of the Principles is a strengthened regulatory framework. ThePrinciples of transparency, accountability and good governance will promote marketdiscipline. The Principles will serve as guidepost for us to effectively supervise and regulatethe market and is necessary, given the increasing complexity of the financial market,exacerbated by the disruptions arising from technological innovations and greaterinterconnectedness.Achieving these three outcomes is central to our development strategy and policies for thefinancial market. Together with the various FMC measures and initiatives already announced, wehave laid the foundations to redirect the growth and development of the ringgit foreign financialmarket from the offshore to the onshore market.After all, a thriving, open and robust onshore financial market is a prerequisite for a stablefinancial system and sustainable economic growth.ConclusionThis year is the 20th anniversary of the Asian Financial Crisis and close to the 10th anniversary 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
of the Global Financial Crisis. Anniversaries such as these are opportunities to pause, reflect andponder on the past, present and future. There are many lessons to be learnt from recentepisodes, and let us not repeat them. For if we do, only misery and hardship await us. 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
1    TITLE SLIDE  GREECE: A COMEBACK TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS? Are we near the finishing line?  Yannis Stournaras, Governor, Bank of Greece  Economist, Frankfurt, May 31, 2017  It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you today and have the opportunity to share my thoughts on the prospects of the Greek economy. I will focus on three issues: First, I will present the progress that has been made so far. Second, I will address to the remaining challenges. Finally, I will discuss the preconditions for a sustainable return to financial markets. 1. Progress so far Since the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis, Greece has implemented a bold programme of economic adjustment that has eliminated fiscal and external deficits and improved competitiveness. SLIDE 1   The general government balance from a deficit of 15.1% of GDP in 2009 turned into a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2016. Between 2009 and 2016, the primary balance improved by about 14 percentage points. In 2016 the primary surplus was 4.2 percent of GDP outperforming not only the 0.5 percent target for 2016, but also the 3.5 percent target for 2018. Practically, 
2  the required fiscal adjustment until the end of the programme in 2018 has nearly been made. This represents one of the largest fiscal adjustments ever undertaken.  The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 15 percentage points. For the last two years the current account has effectively been in balance.  Labour cost competitiveness has been fully restored. Price competitiveness is almost back at its 2000 level  and can be expected to continue to improve with the implementation of further product market reforms that raise competition in various sectors of the economy.   At the same time, sweeping structural reforms have been implemented covering the pension system, the health system, labour markets, product markets, the business environment, public administration, the tax system and the framework in which fiscal policy is conducted, while the privatization programme is on-going.  Recapitalisation and restructuring have taken place in the banking system, enabling it to withstand the crisis and the deterioration of banks’ asset quality. In addition, significant institutional reforms have been initiated aiming at reducing the volume of non-performing loans.  SLIDE 2 On account of these developments, there is evidence that the economy has been undergoing a rebalancing towards tradable, export-oriented sectors. A few figures are indicative of the forces exerted.  The share of exports in GDP increased from 19% in 2009 to 32% in 2016 with most of the increase stemming from exports of goods. In fact, according to Eurostat data, Greece’s exports of goods have increased by 43% since 2009 in real terms, compared to 42% for the euro area and 47% for Germany, Europe’s export engine. 
3   Between 2010 and 2015, the relative price of tradables versus non-tradables rose by about 10%. Whereas both sectors were hit hard by the recession, tradables performed better than non-tradables as outward-looking companies increased their exports, taking advantage of the improvement in competitiveness. As a result, the relative size of the tradables sector, measured by Gross Value Added, grew by approximately 12% in volume terms and by about 24% in nominal terms. Finally, in terms of employment, the size of the tradables sector increased relative to the non-tradables sector by around 8%. These figures would improve further if the reforms already implemented were enhanced by those planned under the ESM programme. Based on estimates of the OECD, full implementation of all reforms, both those undertaken and those scheduled, is expected to boost real GDP over a 10-year-horizon by about 13%. And this figure excludes further positive effects from structural reforms that cannot be easily quantified such as the modernisation of the public administration and the judiciary system, the strengthening of insolvency regulations and the resolution of non-performing loans. In-house work by the Bank of Greece provides similar estimates of the effects of structural reforms with the main effect coming from higher total factor productivity (TFP) growth. 2. Challenges remain In spite of these positive developments, considerable stock disequilibria remain:   Unemployment, though falling, remains very high (at about 23%); Job creation, although robust, is dominated by temporary and part-time jobs.  The general government debt to GDP ratio has risen to unsustainable levels (179% of GDP).  The private debt overhang hampers banks’ ability to support the recovery by granting new credit. In addition, despite the fact that structural competitiveness improved over the period 2013-2014 (according to a number of indices compiled by the OECD, the 
4  World Bank, and the World Economic Forum), Greece still ranks at the lower end of advanced economies, and progress has stalled or even retreated slightly in recent years. 3. Prospects for a sustainable comeback to financial markets SLIDE 3 In order to address the remaining challenges, to improve the future growth prospects of the Greek economy, and to ensure a comeback to financial markets in 2018, several conditions should be met. a. Implementation of 2nd review reforms First and foremost, following the closure of the second review, it is necessary that there is a smooth and timely implementation of the agreed growth enhancing reforms.  Delayed closing of the second review increased uncertainty and reduced confidence which, coupled with the high tax burden, reversed the positive course of economic activity in 2016 Q4. As a consequence, following the mild recession in 2015, the economy stagnated in 2016. However, a positive medium-term outlook is still possible, conditional on a smooth implementation of agreed reforms.  Consumption is expected to continue rebound, driven by robust employment, which is recovering faster than output, pointing to a job-rich recovery. Investment is projected to increase as confidence is restored and financial conditions improve. Exports are projected to benefit from the benign global economic outlook and past improvements in cost competitiveness. Finally, although the sizeable over-performance in 2016 is assessed to be mainly of a temporary nature, the 2017 target is expected to be met with a safe margin. Moreover, rebalancing the budget towards a more growth-friendly composition would support economic recovery. b. Implementation of further growth enhancing reforms to boost exports and attract FDI  
5  Second, further growth enhancing reforms are needed that will boost exports and attract FDI are needed. The economic adjustment and the structural improvements during the past six years made Greece more business friendly and have created significant investment opportunities. However, domestic savings are insufficient to meet the investment needs of the Greek economy that, after a long period of very low investment rates, are significant. Thus, besides restoring access of companies to capital markets, conditions should be encouraged to attract foreign capital, notably in the form of Foreign Direct Investment. In order to attract both domestic and foreign investment, further emphasis should be given to reforms that improve the business environment, enhance competition and reduce excessive regulation, protectionism, bureaucracy and complex legislation. For example, investment licensing procedures need to be simplified, the administrative burden on businesses reduced, the remaining regulated professions and network industries opened up, the public administration modernised and strengthened, judicial efficiency enhanced, court proceedings speeded up and of course personal and corporate taxation lowered. Additionally, a more effective use of the domestic high-skilled human capital (and the return of high-skilled scientists and executives who work abroad) requires the adoption of policies and reforms that encourage research, facilitate the diffusion of technology and boost entrepreneurship. Policies include providing incentives to increase investment in research and development (R&D), strengthening the links between enterprises and the academic/research community by allowing universities to commercially exploit research results and ideas, and effectively using available EU funds. Alongside structural reforms, and in order to facilitate the recovery through a normalization of financial conditions, as a matter of urgency the private debt overhang problem is addressed, since it is the greatest challenge the Greek banking system and the Greek economy faces. On the one hand, the high stock of NPLs reduces bank profitability and thus constrains the supply of credit, which primarily affects bank dependent SMEs. On the other hand, high NPLs delay corporate restructuring and thus thwart the 
6  ability of viable firms to finance new investment projects. According to research by the OECD, when more industry capital is sunk in non-viable (“zombie”) firms, the average viable firm undertakes less investment than otherwise. Simulations by the OECD suggest that reducing the share of capital of non-viable firms in Greece to the minimum across OECD countries would be associated with a gain in investment for a typical viable firm of 4.7%, improving productivity-enhancing capital reallocation in the Greek economy. A series of legislative and regulatory reforms have already been enacted as part of the strategy to reduce NPLs, such as the operational targets of individual banks, revisions of the insolvency law and the gradual setup of a secondary market for NPLs. In addition, a number of new measures have already been legislated as prior actions of the second review, such as the introduction of an out-of-court workout framework, the revision of corporate insolvency law and the launch of a platform for electronic auctions. Besides structural reforms and NPL management, growth prospects can also be improved by acting on the fiscal policy front in two ways:   First, a growth friendly fiscal policy mix can be adopted. The increased emphasis on taxation needs to be reduced in favour of policies that focus on restraining and restructuring non-productive spending and making more effective and efficient use of the public sector’s assets, especially land.  Second, the medium-term fiscal target can be reduced. According to estimates by the Bank of Greece, a lowering of the general government primary surplus target from 2021 onwards to 2 per cent of GDP, from the 3.5 per cent that is envisaged now, would be consistent with debt sustainability if combined with some mild debt relief measures and structural reforms to raise potential growth. The easing of the primary surplus targets, together with the implementation of the agreed structural reforms, would put the necessary conditions in place for a gradual lowering of tax rates, with positive multiplier effects on economic growth. 
7  c. Ensuring debt sustainability A final condition for return to financial markets is to ensure debt sustainability. The ratio of general government debt to GDP is still high. In 2008 that ratio stood at around 110%. It is now around 179%. The debt path has been strongly affected by the so-called snowball effect – that arises from interest rates on debt being much higher than growth. Indeed, from 2010 to 2016, the snowball effect is estimated at some 82% of GDP. But whatever the causes of its rise, it is crucial that it is put on a sustainable path. In the context of the above proposals in the area of fiscal policy making, the Bank of Greece recently made specific proposals to ensure the sustainability and manageability of public debt. The short-term measures decided at the Eurogroup meeting of December 5, 2016 are a positive step and are expected to reduce public debt as a ratio of GDP by 20 percentage points by 2060. However, to ensure the sustainability of public debt going forward, additional medium-term measures are necessary. When the debt-to-GDP ratio is above 100%, measures that reduce interest payments on debt can improve the ratio quicker than a rise in the primary balance. SLIDE 4 The interest burden of Greek public debt is low until 2021 but increases substantially thereafter because of payments of deferred interest on the EFSF loans and interest on new debt issued in financial markets. A simulation performed by the Bank of Greece defers interest on EFSF loans, extending their Weighted Average Maturity by 8.5 years – Option 1 in the right-hand diagram. SLIDE 5 If, in addition to interest deferment, we assume a primary surplus target of 3.5 percent in 2018-2020 and a reduction to 2 percent thereafter, we can see from the left-hand diagram that the debt path is close to that where a primary surplus of 3.5 per cent for 10 years is assumed. This exercise is indicative of how admittedly mild debt relief measures can have significant effects on the debt profile with no cost for the creditors. 
8  However, as the right-hand diagram shows, in terms of gross financing needs, option 1 makes debt sustainable at the margin. Hence, further debt relief measures are necessary in order to reduce gross financing needs significantly below the 20% threshold and bring debt to a sustainable path. Of course, were the interest smoothing accompanied by higher growth, as a consequence of lower primary surpluses, then the debt-to-GDP profile and gross financing needs would be more favourable. Alternatively, if interest rate smoothing were to occur and the costs shared equally between Greece and the ESM, this would also lead to more favourable outcomes. 4. Conclusions and final remarks The economic adjustment and the structural improvements during the past seven years have made Greece more business friendly, have created significant investment opportunities, and have generated positive prospects for the Greek economy. The realization of these positive prospects requires a consistent and determined implementation of the reform and privatization programme including tackling the private debt overhang problem. These enable the adoption of medium-term measures to ensure the sustainability of Greek public debt, which will pave the way for the inclusion of Greek government bonds in the ECB’s quantitative easing programme. Such developments will set in motion a virtuous circle leading to Greece’s return to international financial markets in 2018, the elimination of capital controls, the return to financial normality and the definite exit from the crisis. In order to capitalize on the macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment achieved so far, the institutions and our European partners must act now in a decisive and bold manner by specifying the medium-term debt relief measures for the sustainability of Greece’s public debt, which, as was agreed last year, will go into effect at the end of the current programme. This must be done because the markets on which Greece will need to borrow after the end of the programme in the summer of 2018 are demanding to know from now whether the debt will be sustainable or not. We are all aware of the fact that re-gaining access to financial 
9  markets after the end of the current programme is the only way forward. No one, neither the partners nor Greece, are in any mood for another memorandum.  Sources: McGowan A. Andrews, M.

1  What to expect from the Fed’s Monetary Policy Normalization?1 Sebastián Claro Vice‐Governor, Central Bank of Chile  I would like to start thanking the organizers for this invitation.  Let me start with a disclaimer. Next Monday, April 3rd, the board of the Central Bank of Chile will present its inflation report to the Senate. Therefore, I will not be able in this occasion to offer a detailed discussion on the macroeconomic situation and perspectives in Chile, which will be described in detailed in the report. Rather, I have decided to focus on a broader issue that is relevant for Chile and the region in the current scenario.  During 2017, we will finally witness the process of monetary policy normalization in the United States.  After almost 8 years keeping the Federal Funds rates essentially at zero, the Federal Reserve has started a gradual process of interest rate hikes. This is good news. Fundamentally, the normalization of monetary policy is the natural consequence of a normalization of the US economy after the Global Financial Crises. A normal US economy is a positive phenomenon for the world economy.  However, this transition period may become bumpy. Indeed, previous episodes of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have not been smooth at all for emerging economies. The most obvious of these examples is the debt crisis in the early 1980s. On top of a series of macroeconomic imbalances in many Latin American countries, the sharp raise in interest rates generated a strong reversal in capital flows and pressure on FX markets on the region that induced a collapse in financial markets and activity across countries.  Since the early 1990s, we can identify two main periods of interest rates rises in the United States, as seen in figure 1. The first one started in February 1994, and it comprised a hike of 300 bp in almost a year. The second one took place a decade later when, after a few quarters of the then historically‐low rates, the Fed started a process of rate normalization in June 2004, increasing almost 450 bp in about two years.2  For the sake of this presentation, I want to offer a simple comparison on these two episodes, which in some dimensions were very similar. In particular, the cyclical position of the US economy was arguably very similar in both occasions, and the process of monetary policy normalization is pretty comparable.   However, the performance of emerging markets in these two episodes was very different. Indeed, overall, the process of Fed Funds increases in early 1994 was followed by large difficulties in developing economies the following years, with the Mexican crisis of December 1994 being the first example. Thereafter, a series of banking and balance of payments crisis followed in Latin America and elsewhere3. The impact of the Fed’s tightening cycle in the 1990s on emerging markets was not as widespread as the 1980s episode had been, and countries like Chile and Colombia were able to                                                             1 Remarks at the 2017 IIF Latin America Economic Forum, Asunción, Paraguay on Saturday April 1st, 2017. I acknowledge the support of Diego Gianelli and Mauricio Hitschfeld in the preparation of this speech. These remarks do not imply endorsement by the Central Bank of Chile or any of its Board members. 2 There is a third episode between June 1999 and June 2000. This process of 150 bp hikes can be understood as the final adjustment along the 1994 episode. 3 See, for example, the discussion in García‐Herrero, A., 1997, Banking Crisis in Latin America in the 1990s: Lessons from Argentina, Paraguay and Venezuela, IMF Working Paper 97/140. See also Sachs, J., A. Tornell and A. Velasco, 1996, Financial Crisis in Emerging Markets: The Lessons from 1995, NBER Working Paper 5576.  
2  weather this period relatively well and to keep high growth rates.4 But there is ample evidence that, in a context of several macroeconomic imbalances in several emerging economies, the 1994 episode triggered a series of difficulties and crisis that configured the macroeconomic map in the developing world in the second half of the decade.  In contrast, the monetary policy normalization process starting in 2004, did not have a negative effect on emerging economies. Moreover, the 2004‐2007 period was one of prosperity and stability across the developing world. Of course, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 derailed everything, but it is difficult to argue that it was the consequence of the hiking cycle of the mid 2000s. If anything, it might have been the consequence of the lack of a timely normalization.  Hence, although there are many common features in the 1994 and 2004 cycles, the consequences were very different. What I want to do in this talk is to identify a few features that help us reflect why this was the case. I think this is useful to extract some lessons for the current process of monetary policy normalization in the US.  1994‐2004 normalization Cycles  As a starting point, it is important to notice that the 1994 and 2004 episodes are comparable for two reasons. First, the Federal Reserve started hiking in a context of inflation above 2% and the unemployment rate around 6%. This is of course a simplified characterization of the business cycle, but it offers a good base for comparison.  Beyond that, the monetary policy adjustment in the United States looks quite similar in both cases. Not only is the size and speed of the hikes in Fed Funds’ rate comparable. Also, as Panel A in Figure 2 shows, the shape of the yield curve moves similarly, with a flattening of about 150 basis points between the 10‐ and 2‐year US government bonds in the first year.5 In a related phenomenon, shown in panel B, the term premium implicit in the valuation of the 10‐year US government bond also dropped between 1 and 2 percentage points in the two years after the start of the cycle.  Essentially, the monetary policy shock and the shift in the yield curve were comparable in both episodes. Indeed, the lack of response of long term rates to short term hikes in the mid 2000s, labeled as the “conundrum” phenomenon by Alan Greenspan was, to some extent, also present in the mid 1990s.6   However, in many dimensions, these two episodes show very distinct features. (See panels C to E in figure 2.) First, during the 1994 one, there was a sharp increase in credit spreads to emerging economies, which contributed to their difficulties in the balance of payments. In less than a year, the EMBI credit spread increased, on average, more than 1,000 basis points. A decade later, Fed Funds increases were followed by secular decline in EMBI spreads for emerging markets.  This contrast strikingly with the episode a decade later, when Fed Funds increases not only did not generate an increase in credit spreads but rather it was accompanied by a secular decline in EMBI spreads. A year later, EMBI spreads had fallen about 150 basis points.   A second informative feature is the similar evolution of the dollar in both episodes. It is natural to expect that a hiking cycle in the United States would strengthen the US Dollar relative to other currencies. This is indeed what happened in the 1994 cycle, with the US Dollar Broad appreciating about 7% in 2 years and almost 30% in 4 years. In contrast, the dollar weakened about 5% in the                                                             4 It was not until the Asian crisis in 1998 when the consequences of balance of payment pressures where directly felt across the developing world. 5 Hereafter, all panels in figure 2 are centered around the month in which the hiking cycle started, labeled month 0. These correspond to February 1994, June 2004 and December 2015. 6 In this case, after a very sharp increase during 1994, the yield on the 10‐year US government bond fell significantly during 1995 to levels similar to those observed before the hiking cycle. 
3  first 12 months in the 2004‐2006 cycle, at the very same time that the Federal Reserve had increased short term rates by 200 basis points.   Because periods of dollar strength have tended to coincide with periods of weaker commodities, it is not surprising to see that commodities had a flat/declining trend in the second half of the 1990s. Indeed, high world interest rates, high credit spreads and low commodity prices all contributed to a weakening of emerging market economies. The opposite happened in the 2004 cycle. Even in a context of fast increases in short term rates in the United States, the US dollar weakened and commodity prices increased significantly.   As I just mentioned, the fact that the dollar depreciated in the 2004‐2006 cycle is very informative about other phenomena occurring in the world at the same time. Commodity prices and risk appetite were favorable for EMEs, leading to important growth gains and Real Exchange Rate appreciations. In the three years following the beginning of the hiking cycles, currencies in Latin American countries strengthened on average 13%.7 While the Federal Reserve was raising short terms rates, developing countries were doing the same.  The good performance in emerging economies during the 2004‐2006 tightening cycle in the United States, could respond to many factors. Three things stand out: o Many emerging markets were much more prepared to face restrictions in world financial conditions. The move towards more flexible exchange rates, better fiscal policies and stronger financial supervision improved their resilience. o The tightening in the United States did not worsen financial conditions to EMES. Quite the opposite; credit spreads became more favorable. o Why this happened? The natural answer is China. The increasing relevance of China in the world economy and in world trade following its accession into the WTO, generated a booming effect in commodity markets and world demand that more than compensated the negative effect of increases in world interest rates, giving important support for the balance of payment, fiscal accounts and the investment outlook in emerging economies.  We are now at the early stages of a new and historical tightening cycle in the United States. It is reasonable to ask ourselves how comparable the current situation is relative to previous experiences. I want to make a few points here.  We expect the Fed to move more gradually than on previous occasions  Why? First, the Fed prefers to err on the side of moving slowly, and markets expect so. In part, as seen in Figure 3, inflation measured as the PCE core is still low compared to its level on previous hiking cycles. Also, neutral rates are estimated to be very low this time, so the Fed considers that monetary policy is not as expansionary as the headline Fed Funds Rate suggests.   Besides, the Federal Reserve is very much aware of the financial stability risks of abrupt changes in rates. The term premium implicit in long term yields is very low, and the taper Tandrum episode of 2013 shows that it can change fast if markets misinterpret the Fed communication. The fact that in previously cycles this did not happen is good news, but a series of good output numbers in the US, a few higher‐than‐expected inflation prints, or a change in the strategy on how to manage the balance sheet of the Fed could, trigger a significant increase in long term rates.                                                                7 BIS‐based Real Exchange Rates; for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, México, Perú and Venezuela. 
4  The current trajectory of the Dollar/Commodities/Credit Spreads provide mix evidence  Other dimensions suggest we are somewhat in between the 1994 and 2004 episodes.   The dollar has strengthened in multilateral terms in the last quarters, similarly to what was seen in 1994. Commodities have shown a mild upward trend. Definitely smoother than their trend in 2004, but also markedly more bullish than in 1994. Finally, EMBI spreads have decreased in tandem to what they did in 2004. Indeed, capital inflows have returned massively to the region in the last few months. In other words, while commodities are not as supportive of emerging economies as they were in the previous decade, markets are showing a high appetite for emerging market debt.  This suggests two things. On the one hand, there is room for a recovery in emerging economies, and markets are pricing that in. But on the other hand, this recovery will not be supported by a commodity cycle as we experienced in the 2000s, so the region is more exposed to financial shocks coming from a disorderly normalization of monetary policy in the United States. Emerging economies are better prepared than in the 1990s to absorb these shocks, but we do not expect the subsidy coming from the commodity windfall.  One final point about China  China has become a source of stability in the world economy in the last few decades (isn´t this the role China played after the Global Financial Crisis in 2009 and 2010?), but it has become more interconnected with the rest of the world, and it is also subject to pressures on the capital account and its balance of payments. The very same risks that emerging economies face from US rate increases are relevant for China, too. This time, a bumpy process of monetary normalization in the US could become amplified rather than ameliorated, depending upon how China is able to adjust to it. And this time, the room looks smaller.   Thank you

Juyeol Lee: Opening address – 2017 Bank of Korea InternationalConferenceSpeech by Mr Juyeol Lee, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the 2017 Bank of Korea InternationalConference, Seoul, 1 June 2017.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen,I am delighted to bid a warm welcome to you all, our participants in this Bank of Korea2017 International Conference. I wish to express my sincerest appreciation to our keynotespeakers, Professor Thomas Sargent of New York University and President John Williams of theFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, as well as all of our moderators, presenters anddiscussants. Special thanks to Professor Sargent also for his great help to us again this yearin organizing the conference. It has been nearly a decade now since the Global Financial Crisis. And looking back over theseyears, the global economy did not emerge from conditions of low growth and low inflation for along time, even under the unprecedented accommodative fiscal and monetary policies carriedout around the world. To make matters worse, financial imbalances increased, mainly in EMEs,as international capital flows into EMEs surged, against a backdrop of continuing low interestrates worldwide, and private debt levels in these countries soared. Fortunately, the global economy seems to have regained some growth momentum, and theinternational financial markets are stable. However, trade protectionism and geopolitical risks areincreasing in some parts of the world, and the normalization of monetary policy in the US isexpected to continue. Productivity growth has also not yet returned to its pre-crisis level. In viewof all this, we cannot be sure that the current global economic recovery and financial stability willbe sustained. And the structural problems that have built up since the pre-crisis period makeit even more difficult to be confident. In this situation, I think we can take this year’s conference as a very meaningful opportunity tolook into the challenges that lie ahead for us in the next decade, and to discuss ways of dealingwith them. Today, I would like to talk just a bit about some of the challenges that many countriesface in common, and about possible policy responses to address them. First, income inequality has risen as an important global policy agenda. Income gaps among thedifferent social classes have been widening in many countries, and this could impair the virtuouscircle by which economic growth leads to increases in employment and income, which then helpgrowth to strengthen further. Recently, globalization and technological innovation are beingheld responsible for this worsening income inequality. Notably, in the era of the Fourth IndustrialRevolution, now in progress, there are concerns that the number of unskilled jobs could declinerapidly. However, we cannot go against the flow of globalization and technological innovation. Andin this regard, international organizations such as IMF and World Bank recommend that weshould pursue “inclusive” growth, which ensures that many people can share the benefits ofgrowth. More specifically, creating more jobs, increasing household incomes and expanding thesocial safety net are recognized as relevant policies for promoting inclusive growth. We can talkmore about this topic during Session Two today, on “Inclusive Growth and Employment.”Another challenge that we must tackle is population aging, which is progressing rapidly now inmany countries. Population aging is likely to undermine economic growth as it reduces the laborsupply and saps aggregate demand at the same time. For Korea, in particular, as the pace of ourpopulation aging is rapid, but our preparations for it insufficient, the negative effects of populationaging on growth seem likely to be substantial. In response to this, proper policy measures need 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
to be put in place, to ease the rapid drop in elderly consumption while we at the sametime strengthen social support related to child birth and child care. The theme of our first sessiontoday was chosen to be “Population Aging”, which I think may suggest just how important andurgent this issue is.Finally, we need to also address the issue of financial imbalances. Since the Global FinancialCrisis, international efforts to ensure financial stability have strengthened, as seen in theintroduction of global regulatory frameworks such as the Basel III accord and the OTC derivativesmarket reforms. However, the financial imbalances in major EMEs have accumulated further,driven by greater household and corporate debt leverage in these economies. Financialinstitutions have been seeking high-risk, high-return investments, in response to their worseningprofitability due to the low interest rate environment. In Korea, household debt is already at ahistoric high, and has been growing faster than incomes, so that it poses a major risk tofinancial stability. I hope that we will obtain valuable insights related to this tomorrow, in thespecial session led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on ways of securing financialstability and the role of monetary policy.So far, I have raised three policy issues — income inequality, population aging and financialimbalances. Besides these, of course, there are many other structural problems that we mustface. And the proper policy for dealing with such problems is structural reform, although that isnot so easy to carry out, due to factors such as the resulting unemployment and conflicts ofinterest among different social classes. International organizations such as the OECD, aswell as academia, have assessed the structural reforms undertaken in many countries until nowto have been insufficient. However, in order to sustain our fledgling growth momentums, ourstructural reforms need to be intensified. And of course, our macroeconomic policies should alsosupport structural reform. I believe that the theme of Session 3, “Structural Reformand Macroeconomic Policy,” will be helpful to policy makers in the government and the centralbank.Ladies and gentlemen!The world economy stands at a turning point now. It has shown signs of moving away from thelong lasting low growth and low inflation seen since the Global Financial Crisis, but we cannot besure yet that this recovery will continue going forward. It is my sincere hope that this year’s veryopportune Bank of Korea Conference will serve as a fruitful venue for looking back on the lastdecade since the Global Financial Crisis, for gaining insights into the next decade before us, andfor generating constructive policy ideas. I look forward to this Conference being a great successonce again.Thank you. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Muhammad bin Ibrahim: “State of the Industry Address”Remarks by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank NegaraMalaysia), at the Asian Strategy &amp; Leadership Institute’s (ASLI) 21st Malaysian BankingSummit, Kula Lumpur, 25 May 2017.*   *   *Thank you for the opportunity to speak again at the ASLI Malaysian Banking Summit.Around this time last year, I recall delivering the keynote address at this Summit after assumingthe office of the Governor.A year has passed, and it was indeed an eventful year. In the past year, we witnessed majorforces that shaped the world. Some improbable, others familiar. Some transformative, otherspolarising. Some deep-seated, others fleeting.In short, it has been a year of contrasts. In more ways than one, our perception of reality is alsochanging dramatically. The human brain can now communicate directly with computers, frompowering prosthetic limbs to flying drones. Months ago, both Uber and Airbus unveiled separateplans for flying cars. Additionally, just earlier this week, artificial intelligence surpassed the world’sbest player in Go, believed to be the most complex strategy game, with more possibilities thanatoms in the visible universe.On many levels, these developments contrast starkly with conventional wisdom and thetraditional state of play in respective industries. Yet, they are also driving thought leadership andgenuine innovation. This theme of contrasts will underpin my observations today on the economyand the banking industry.A World of Contrasts: Synchronous Recovery Amid Uneven Risk ProfilesSince the Global Financial Crisis almost nine years ago, the pursuit of a sustained globaleconomic expansion has eluded policymakers. Global growth has been slow, fraught with risksand shrouded by uncertainties. There have been several false starts, with uneven andsometimes divergent growth momentum among regions. In fact, 2016 marked the slowest globalGDP growth recorded since the crisis.Positive developments have, however, recently emerged. A pick-up in industrial activity andtrade, along with the increase in commodity prices, points to a quickening in growth momentum.Significantly, this growth upturn is characterised by a synchronised expansion in both theadvanced and emerging countries. This has given policy makers some cautious optimism for asustained recovery of global growth and international trade.In particular, the improvement in advanced economies is encouraging as it is led by recovery ininvestment activity. Emerging economies are benefiting from external demand, aided by theimprovements in commodity prices.Our assessment is that the global economy will continue to gradually improve. Nevertheless,many developments around globe warrant a very close surveillance. It is still too early to declarea definitive revival in the global economy. In fact, at this point, despite the emergence of a fewpositive developments, the overall risks remain tilted to the downside.Major events that could shape global growth in the near term include uncertainties in policy andpolitical spheres, especially in major economies; the potential retreat arising from backlashagainst globalisation; the rise in trade protectionism; and the volatilities of global commodityprices. Financial markets have in recent months remained eerily calm. However volatility may 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
reignite if risks re-emerge, whether real or perceived.Beyond these short-term risks, structural changes are also afoot. The ageing population, incomeinequality and youth unemployment are slow-churning yet potent structural changes that requirepolicy prescriptions. Changes in policy today are needed to secure future prospects for growth.In Malaysia, the economy has been boosted by the expansion in global demand. The strongestexport growth in 28 quarters has provided additional impetus to our domestic demand.Consequently, the Malaysian economy started 2017 with a robust growth of 5.6% in the firstquarter. We are on track for a better economic growth compared to last year. Nevertheless as anopen economy with sizable and globally connected financial markets, Malaysia cannot neglectthe risks dominating the global environment. We are certainly not immune from events unfoldingaround us.Some say central bankers are paid to worry. In good times and even more so, the bad. However Iam comforted that earlier reforms have accorded the country with strong macroeconomicfundamentals and resilience to weather these still-challenging times. However, we cannot affordto rest on our laurels. New risks and challenges continue to emerge and confront us. Animportant lesson is to continue to strengthen our resilience and buffers, especially during thegood times.A World of Contrasts: Bankers as Active Stakeholders, Not Passive BystandersThe banking sector has been a central pillar of strength for the Malaysian economy. The industrycan play a more positive role by engaging positively in conversations on economic and financialissues confronting the country. As I have experienced in the last one year, the chamber ofconversation on the economy could be further expanded. Narratives on the economy and theindustry continue to be shaped by external parties, drowning out the occasional whispers fromthe banking industry.Given the central role of banks in the economy, bankers have the equivalent of a box seat toprovide an informed view on developments in the economy and financial system. Rather thanbeing onlookers, the banking industry should weigh in on domestic economic discourse. Fromsectoral issues to macro trends, bankers’ perspectives would provide additional viewpoints andenrich assessments by the public and financial community, and help address gaps betweenreality and perception that have too often dominated the public conversation.It is therefore timely for our bankers to participate more actively in the economic discourse toshape a more balanced narrative. Bankers should be proactively offering solutions to some of thepressing economic and financial issues facing the country. A positive voice for socioeconomicchange can help instill greater public trust in the role of the banking sector in nation building.A current issue that has disproportionately drawn attention to banks is the affordable housingissue. Bank Negara Malaysia recently featured a box article on this subject in 2016 AnnualReport. The public debate largely continues to misdiagnose or ignore the root cause of theproblem, that is, affordability and accessibility, rooted by low incomes and compounded by thehuge mismatch between demand and supply of affordable houses.The popular myth, is that it is all about access to financing. I am perplexed. Actual data is self-evident. It shows the continued strength in bank financing to households for the purchase ofaffordable homes, with four in five new housing loans extended for houses priced belowRM500,000. Yet banks have done little to educate and inform the public on this financing trend.The industry ought to be at the forefront in explaining the real situation and where possible,offering suggestions to help address this issue.Affordable housing is not a problem that is unique to Malaysia. Policymakers around the world, 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
including in developed countries, continue to look for creative solutions to this delicate socio-economic challenge. A common thread across these solutions is their multi-faceteddimensions. The solution for Malaysia has to involve rebalancing the supply of housing towards the affordablesegments. We require a bold and pragmatic solution. We estimate a shortage of 960,000 units ofaffordable housing. This is projected to reach 1 million units by 2020.  A central authority and anational repository can significantly improve the ability to better distribute, monitor and managethe supply-demand imbalances. Developing a thriving rental market should also be on theagenda to temper the nation’s fixation on home ownership.Another issue that banks should be concerned with is the sizable surplus in commercialproperty. In contrast to affordable housing, the office and retail markets are in oversupply.In 2016, the vacancy rate for prime office space in the Klang Valley stood at 21.8%, outstrippingthe regional average of 6.2%. Monthly rentals of prime office space in Kuala Lumpur are thelowest among regional cities. Over the next few years, the significant incoming supply of largeprojects is likely to aggravate supply conditions in this segment.Signs of oversupply are also emerging in the retail segment in major urban centres in Malaysia.This can be traced to the abundance of shopping malls. You may be surprised to learn that thereare as many as twenty shopping malls just along the 40km stretch of the LDP highway. It isequally astonishing that the prime retail space per capita in cities like Johor, Penang and KualaLumpur is actually higher than regional megacities such as Shanghai and Beijing, and alsohigher income cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong.A significant increase in vacancy rates, and the ensuing price corrections, are risks that the Bankhas highlighted as far back as 2013. The concerns are not limited to effects within thecommercial property sector, but have broader spillovers to other economic sectors. During theGlobal Financial Crisis, commercial property was a major driver of loan losses in Australia,France, Ireland and New Zealand, despite generally accounting for a much smaller share ofbanks’ loan books, compared to residential property. This was attributable to a sharper pace ofcontraction in commercial property prices, compared to house prices.Banks are key stakeholders in this conversation. Data available within banks can be a harbingerof turns in the property cycle, and used more effectively in combination with other sources ofmarket data, to smooth out adjustments between demand and supply.Furthermore, in the same way that reporting standards are starting to move away fromprovisioning practices that were “too little too late”, there is merit in in taking a closer look atcurrent valuation practices that contribute to property boom-bust cycles. It may well be time toconsider how we might correct practices that are encouraging banks to lend “too much too early”in specific property segments, before demand drivers are firmly entrenched.At a more fundamental level, we should explore ways to moderate the lending bias towards realestate. Instead, banks should be providing more financing to new productive investments that areessential to support the transformation of our economy. As we progress, the industry has to bemore innovative in product offerings to meet the demands of the new economy.   These examples illustrate the significant scope for the banking industry to organise itself moreeffectively to weigh, expand, and ultimately galvanise action in response to emerging issues thatconcern our economy and society. There are other matters as well. Education in long-termfinancial planning among Malaysians, the impact of financial technology, expanded inclusion tofinancial services, income and productivity gaps, and labour market developments, are just someof the issues where banks ought to be much more active participants in the policy dialogue anddebate.1 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The Financial Markets Committee stands out as a forum that serves as a focal point for industryand external stakeholders on recent measures taken in the domestic financial markets. Likewise,similar initiatives can be mobilised to provide a more organised stage for the banking industry tolend its voice on a range of issues and contribute to more informed public opinion.It is time for the industry to be active stakeholders, rather than just passive participants.A World of Contrasts: Long-Term Interests Versus Myopic GainsExtending the theme of contrasts further, regulatory measures introduced in the past year havebeen the subject of much scrutiny. In many quarters, regulation is still widely perceived as anunnecessary constraint on markets. In reality, it is a means to safeguard longer-term public well-being against parochial interests. The intention behind regulatory measures may at times appearcontrary to popular wisdom. Nonetheless, viewed through a broader lens, this is motivated bypolicymakers’ duty to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability. In discharging thisresponsibility, policymakers must consider macro perspectives, be able to look further afield,evaluate risks, and take timely actions to manage these risks.The Global Financial Crisis provides a stark reminder that markets cannot be exclusively reliedon to rein in excesses. Left to the market, there is always a tendency to overshoot. Market forcescan at times deviate significantly from public interest.This is where policymakers step in to moderate these effects and steer markets back onto asustainable path. This is infamously described as, central banks ‘taking away the punch bowl,just as the party gets going’.One ‘party’ we saw developing was the imbalance in the foreign exchange market, morespecifically in the ringgit non-deliverable forward (NDF) market.Measures taken by the Bank in December last year were aimed at further developing the onshorefinancial markets and limiting the influence of speculative pricing of the ringgit in the offshoremarket which had undermined the stability of the domestic foreign exchange market. Since theimplementation of these measures, the exchange rate stabilised, with the 1-month impliedvolatility recording a lower average of 4.5%, against 9.9% before the measures were put in place.The average intraday movement recorded a daily average of 76 points while the bid-ask spreadrecorded an average of 25.0 basis points since end-February 2017. Of importance, the onshoreforeign exchange market continues to record a healthy daily average volume of USD10 billion.Prior to the measures, the daily volume was around USD8 billion.The Malaysian bond market remains resilient. The last two primary auctions of governmentbonds recorded a healthy bid-to-cover ratio of more than two times. Following higher marketdemand, MGS benchmark yields have eased lower between 8 – 32 bps across the yield curve.Non-resident holdings of government papers have also been pared down from a peak of 34.7%to 25.3% as at end April 2017.More importantly, our surveillance indicates that the composition of stable and long-terminvestors is now much higher, with previous outflows mainly due to short-term speculativepositions exiting the market. This is definitely a positive development.Malaysia remains a highly open economy and will continue to welcome the participation of long-term investors. Indeed, we remain a highly attractive destination for foreign direct investment.Returns on Malaysia’s FDI assets have averaged 12.9% per annum between 2010 to 2016,higher than nominal GDP growth of 7.7% over the same period. Payoffs from investing in thereal economy are one of the highest in the region, making Malaysia an important profit centre forinvestors.23 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
In the next seven months, the Bank will introduce further regulatory measures to strengthen thefoundations for a strong and resilient banking system.First, we will implement a mandatory employment reference check for financial industryemployees which is aimed at removing employee information asymmetries during jobtransitions.Second, we will share with the industry proposed revisions to the outsourcing policy toimprove the governance and supervision of financial institutions, especially involving cross-border arrangements. The revisions also aim to better support the development of domesticexpertise and capacity in core functions of the banking industry.Third, a shared security operations centre for the financial industry (FINSOC) will beestablished in coordination with the industry to support the continuous and proactivemonitoring of cyber threats.Finally, by 2018, we hope to operationalise an industry-wide implementation of e-KYC for theon-boarding of customers. Further progress has also been made on the development of the policy framework for domesticsystemically important banks (D-SIBs). Survey results collected from banking institutions andfinancial holding companies earlier this year are currently being analysed and will facilitate furtherrefinements to the assessment methodology to identify D-SIBs. This will form part of the D-SIBpolicy framework which will be released later this year for industry consultation.Beyond the immediate term, the Bank is also looking at introducing enhanced standards onmeasuring capital requirements and outline expectations on recovery planning, in line with globalreforms. In doing so, we will engage the industry on the potential domestic implications, andmake adjustments where necessary to ensure that these standards are phased-in seamlessly.A World of Contrasts: Shifting From Macro Masterplans to Micro-Cellular TransformationMalaysia’s transition to a high-income economy will require careful attention to the context inwhich policies are developed and pursued. In particular, behavioral changes shape the waypeople live and work.Thanks to globalisation and digitalisation, individuals are much freer to dictate their living, workingand financing arrangements. Traditional institutions and conventional policy-making have lessinfluence than before. This calls for a new approach to governing and policy making, one thatcombines high-level strategic clarity with experimentation and dynamic implementation at amicro level.Since 2000, the Government has produced 39 blueprints, roadmaps and master plans, includingthe Financial Sector Blueprint. This is more than double the number of master plans introducedbetween 1970 to 1999.From a different perspective, over the last 17 years, the country introduced two blueprints a year,compared to only one plan in every two years during the period 1970 to 1990.There is no denying that the plans have laid a great foundation for the nation to move forward.Indeed, the Economic Transformation Plan played a catalytic role in spurring, what we at theBank like to refer to, as the Investment Renaissance period between 2011 and 2014.Going forward, there is a critical need to overlay these existing master plans and blueprints withmicro-cellular transformations. We have been advocating this approach at every opportunityavailable. It is just as relevant for industry, including the banking sector. Very often,implementation pitfalls caused the failure of the strategic vision of leaders. I believe this gap canbe bridged if each component, layer, and cell, within the ecosystem, whether at an institution or 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
industry level, is empowered to support and even lead transformation.This micro transformation involves three elements: first, solving locally-nominated and definedproblems; second, employing nudges or smart incentives to induce desired behavior; and third,experimenting on specific markets, groups or products before a broad roll-out. I must admit thatthese are hardly unfamiliar concepts in business. Yet few businesses have gone further tointegrate these elements within broader transformation strategies.This has increasingly been the approach taken by the Bank, in facilitating initiatives such as theFinTech innovations in the financial sector. The Regulatory Sandbox introduced last year allowsfor the experimentation of potentially beneficial FinTech innovations that may seem inherentlyrisky at inception, but properly harnessed could be a game changer. By providing a “safe” or“contained” space for testing, the risk effects can be comfortably observed, controlled andcalibrated. Wider applications of this approach by institutions will go a long way to cultivate abalanced banking culture of innovation and resilience.Such applications are also not confined to the area of technology. It can span across a bank’sdecision to enter a new market, reform incentive structures, disrupt outdated internal processesand provoke changes in management paradigms. The possibilities are limited only by our attitudeto change, our ability to adapt, and our willingness to pursue creative solutions within acceptablerisk limits. Banks that will remain relevant in the future are those that have a deep understanding of theshifts in the economy and the consumer. This requires banks to have a finger on the pulse of theeconomy, to closely observe the micro transformations that are taking place, and to keep abreastof future financing opportunities, particularly in new areas of growth. To this end, banks will needto think ahead and begin to invest in developing the organisational capacity to study, distill andgenerate innovative solutions to effectively and efficiently meet new financing needs.With the development of alternative financing such as crowd funding, P2P, private equity, venturecapital, factoring and leasing, it will be imperative for banks to consider how they cancomplement and support these arrangements more effectively.We are living in interesting times, shaped by forces that bring to the fore contrasts in economicand financial developments. These developments have important implications on how wegovern, do business and engage externally. It has never been more important for the bankingindustry to be more engaged, agile and responsive.I do believe that our banks are well-placed to adapt to changes going forward. It is incumbent onthe banking industry to continue to strengthen its foundations and address gaps that may appearthrough business and economic cycles. Banks cannot be oblivious to the changing tide. Oureconomic prosperity is very much influenced by the ability of the industry to play itsintermediating role effectively.Bank Negara Malaysia25 May 2017 Regional average prime office vacancy rate is based on 2015 dataAttributed to William McChesney Martin Jr., the ninth Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve BankReturn on investment: measured as FDI profit over FDI stock123 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: Interview in Der SpiegelInterview with Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, inDer Spiegel, conducted by Mr Stefan Kaiser on 19 June 2017 and published on 22 June 2017.*   *   *Mr Praet, you are a Belgian who was born in Germany and who spent the first years ofyour childhood here. Can you understand why so many people here regard the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) as the greatest threat to their personal wealth?I think the German public is much more impartial on that point. Most people understand theposition we are in: we have to define the right monetary policy for a monetary union with verydifferent countries. The press often criticises us for this, but the personal discussions I have hereare much more courteous and relaxed. Even the discussions within the ECB’s GoverningCouncil are very good, even when there are critical voices.But it’s the Germans who complain most about the ECB, isn’t it?Of course, criticism in Germany is somewhat more vocal than in other countries. That also hasto do with Germany’s role in the financial and euro crisis. Because, on the one hand, it hadalready undertaken important reforms and was in a stronger position. And because, on the otherhand, the people of Germany are by tradition not so highly indebted. That’s a cultural thing – and Ivery much share it. But it’s also a factor that played a role in the origin of the crisis.How?It concerns the creditor-debtor relationship: before the crisis, Germany was a significant lender toother countries. German savers invested, mainly via their banks, a lot of money abroad – in thosecountries where households and companies had bigger debts, for example Spain. And the crisiscame and the money flowed back – €400 billion came back from Spain alone and a large part ofthat originated in German savings. The ECB made liquidity available to banks in exchange forcollateral. That prevented a meltdown of the financial system, which otherwise would have led tostrongly deflationary pressure across the euro area.So Germany was also saved by the ECB?In Germany, one might say that it’s obvious that debtors have to pay back what they owe. But thelenders also bear a responsibility. They too should be careful. The Germans are complainingabout the interest rates being so low. We understand that. But they also have to bear in mind thatlenders were very well protected in and after the crisis – and that none of Germany’s largeneighbours slipped into a depression. That too would have had a serious impact on theeconomy, not least in Germany.What do you say to those people who put money to one side month by month in order tobe able to afford a little something when they get older – but whose plans won’t work outnow because of the zero interest rates?We have studied how the low interest rates affect the disposable income of households,including in Germany. People not only earn interest on their savings, but they also borrow money– for example, if they buy a house. And the results show that the advantages offset thedisadvantages.So there’s no reason to complain?Yes there is, because of course not everyone benefits. All monetary policy decisions have 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
undesirable distributional effects as well. Consider, for example, the equity markets, whereprices have risen dramatically. In Germany, those suffering most from the low interest rates aremiddle-aged people who own a small fortune and have invested it largely in savings accountsand in interest-bearing securities – i.e. it’s not very diversified.Are you telling Germans that their money would be better invested in shares?Of course I’m not giving investment tips; I’m a central banker. And to be honest, I invest mymoney in a similar way to most Germans.In Germany, some economists are already warning about the economy overheating – andin many other countries in the euro area, the recovery is now evident. Isn’t it the righttime to exit from the policy of extremely cheap money?As a central bank, we conduct monetary policy for the whole of the euro area – and this policyhas been working. There is a broad-based recovery happening and it will probably continue.Germany has made a bit more progress than others in that respect. The output gap is closing, inother words, Germany’s economy is exploiting its potential virtually to the full. Surprisingly, pricesare still rising slowly. But this will change over the short or long term. And it will help to trigger achange in monetary policy. So there is light at the end of the tunnel.Before you raise the key interest rates, you intend to wind down government bondpurchases from the current €60 billion per month to zero. But can it be done so easily?The bond spreads for countries such as Italy might once again shoot upwards, as duringthe euro crisis.If the spreads for a particular country rise, that’s not a monetary policy problem. We are notsingling out particular countries and neither are we there to ensure governments have favourablefinancing conditions. When the day comes, we will look at inflation and act accordingly,regardless of whether governments complain. We forewarned them and they clearly understoodthat. I have just read a commentary by the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pier CarloPadoan. “When the bond purchases come to an end, we are on our own”, he writes. And he’sright.Italy is currently in any case the euro area’s problem child. Nowhere else is the economygrowing so slowly; nowhere else are the banks sitting on so many non-performing loans.How serious is the situation?Indeed, the Italian economy hasn’t grown for 20 years. Real GDP per capita – taking inflation intoaccount – has stagnated over that period. Italy therefore has a deep-seated problem. Thegovernment is addressing that, but it also has to convince people to support the reforms. In fact,the economy has great potential, with very many creative enterprises.Until now, Greece was always the euro area’s shakiest prospect. But the country has justagreed on new loans and further debt relief with its international creditors. Observersare now expecting the ECB to also accept Greek government bonds in its purchaseprogramme. They have been excluded until now because of doubts about thesustainability of the country’s debt.Before we change any aspects of the asset purchase programme, we need to conduct our ownanalysis of Greece’s debt sustainability. We will not rely on others for that. Whether it’s theEuropean Stability Mechanism or the European Commission, everyone has their ownperspective. But when it comes to buying bonds, we have to take a look for ourselves. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
That means the answer is “no”?That means we have to take a look for ourselves.The Brexit negotiations started this week. From an economist’s perspective, howimportant is it that the EU and the United Kingdom reach an agreement?Extremely important. When we say that the economic outlook for the euro area is good and thatrisks are broadly balanced, that doesn’t mean that there are no risks. There is currently a lot ofuncertainty about the direction of the United States’ economic policy in the coming months. Wenow have a good sense of how things will develop in China, but not in the United States. And it’sa fairly similar story with the United Kingdom. It shows how a country can create severedifficulties for itself. Europe offers a robust institutional framework, including for trade. Theinternal market works and is very important. And now the United Kingdom is leaving it andheading for great uncertainty.What can the negotiations achieve?In my opinion, the British have made a huge mistake. Populist forces have stirred up people’sfears and fear is not a good counsellor. The damage is done, the British economy is alreadyslowing down. Now it is just about minimising the negative impact. I hope there will still be areasonably sensible solution.Does US policy also concern you a lot?Not many major decisions have been made there yet, unlike in the United Kingdom. And I hopethat, in the end, reason will prevail. In general we should not get mixed up in power politics whereeveryone only seeks their own advantage. Ultimately, the danger is that large countries dictatedeals to the others. That would be catastrophic. We need strong international institutions. And weagain need a unified Europe. Because the weaker Europe is, the more dangerous it will be for us. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Jerome Powell: Relationship between regulation and economicgrowthSpeech by Mr Jerome H Powell, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, WashingtonDC, 22 June 2017.*   *   *Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, I appreciate theopportunity to testify at today’s hearing on the relationship between regulation and economicgrowth. We need a resilient, well-capitalized, well-regulated financial system that is strongenough to withstand even severe shocks and support economic growth by lending through theeconomic cycle. The Federal Reserve has approached the post-crisis regulatory andsupervisory reforms with that outcome in mind.As a result of an improving economy and actions taken by both the federal regulators and theindustry, the U.S. financial system is substantially stronger and more stable than it was beforethe financial crisis erupted nearly a decade ago. In this testimony, I will highlight the considerablegains made since the crisis and reflect on the principles that should guide us in the next phase. Iwill also discuss some specific actions that align with these principles that we have recentlytaken or expect to take that are designed to reduce regulatory burden without compromisingsafety and soundness and financial stability.Post-crisis regulatory and supervisory reformThere is little doubt that the U.S. financial system is stronger today than it was a decade ago. As Iwill discuss, loss-absorbing capacity among banks is substantially higher. The banking industry,and the largest banking firms in particular, face far less liquidity risk than before the crisis. Andprogress in resolution planning by the largest firms has reduced the threat that their failure wouldpose. These efforts have made U.S. banking firms both more robust and more resolvable. Andhistory shows that when U.S. banking firms are financially strong, they are able to better servetheir customers.Today I will highlight developments in the four key regulatory areas designed to improve andmaintain the resiliency of the banking industry: capital, stress testing, liquidity, and resolutionplanning.Regulatory capital reformsThe U.S. banking agencies have substantially strengthened regulatory capital requirements forlarge banking firms, improving the quality and increasing the amount of capital in the bankingsystem. High-quality common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) is important because it is availableunder all circumstances to absorb losses.Since the financial crisis, U.S. banks have been required to meet new minimum requirements forCET1 to ensure a base of protection against losses. U.S. banks also have been required to meetcapital conservation buffers that incentivize banking firms to keep their capital levels well abovethe minimums in order to maintain full flexibility to allocate profits to shareholders and employees.For the U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), we have also imposed an additionalcapital surcharge designed to reduce the threat that a failure of any of these firms would pose tofinancial stability.Stress testingThe Federal Reserve also conducts the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), a 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
stress test that assesses whether large banking firms have enough capital to withstand severelyadverse macroeconomic and financial market stress. We also use this process to assess thequality of the capital planning processes of large banking firms. The U.S. bank holdingcompanies (BHCs) subject to CCAR have more than doubled the dollar amount of their CET1from around $500 billion in 2009 to $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2017, and have more thandoubled their CET1 risk-based capital ratios from 5.5 percent to 12.4 percent over that period.Liquidity regulation reformsThe banking agencies have also required large banking firms to substantially reduce their liquidityrisk. Our key reforms in this area include a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that requires largebanking firms to keep enough high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet net stressed cashoutflows over a 30-day period. The Federal Reserve has also adopted the ComprehensiveLiquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR) supervisory program for evaluating the liquidity of the mostsystemic banking firms. In addition, the banking agencies have proposed a net stable fundingratio (NSFR) regulation that would help ensure that large banking firms maintain a stable fundingprofile over a one-year horizon.Liquidity positions within the U.S. banking system have improved substantially since the financialcrisis. The U.S. G-SIBs increased their holdings of HQLA from about $1.5 trillion to about $2.3trillion between 2011 and the first quarter of 2017. The same institutions have also reduced theirreliance on short-term wholesale funding from approximately 35 percent of assets in 2006 toabout 15 percent of assets today.Large bank resolvability reforms As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-FrankAct), the Federal Reserve has been working with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) to improve resolution planning by banks. Through thoughtful resolution planning, firms canreduce the risk that their failure would have disruptive effects on the financial system and theeconomy. The resolution planning process has caused the largest U.S. banking firms tosubstantially improve their internal structures, governance, information collection systems, andallocation of capital and liquidity in ways that both promote resolvability. The Federal Reservealso has helped improve the resolvability of the largest banking firms by requiring U.S. G-SIBsand the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign G-SIBs to meet long-term debt and totalloss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements.Effect of regulation on U.S. banksEvidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting damage tothe economy’s productive capacity and growth potential. Post-crisis reforms to financial sectorregulation and supervision have been designed to significantly reduce the likelihood and severityof future financial crises. We have sought to accomplish this goal in significant part by reducingboth the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the consequences of such a failure wereit to occur. We have substantially increased the capital, liquidity, and other prudentialrequirements for large banking firms, and these increases are not free. Stronger capitalrequirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs are passed along to bankcustomers. But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large banking firms willproduce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth. Our objective should be to setcapital and other prudential requirements for large banking firms at a level that protects financialstability and maximizes long-term, through-the-cycle credit availability and economic growth.Guiding principles to simplify and reduce regulatory burdenAs we near completion of the major post-crisis regulatory reforms, this is a good time to assessthe effectiveness and efficiency of these reforms. Several principles are guiding us in this effort.1 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
First, we should protect the core elements of the reforms for our largest banking firms in capitalregulation, stress testing, liquidity regulation, and resolvability. Second, we should continue totailor our requirements to the size, risk, and complexity of the firms subject to thoserequirements. In particular, we should always be aware that community banks face higher coststo meet complex requirements. Third, we should assess whether we can adjust regulation incommon-sense ways that will simplify rules and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden withoutcompromising safety and soundness. And finally, we should strive to provide appropriatetransparency to supervised firms and the public regarding our expectations.Areas of focus for recalibration and simplificationSmall and medium bank regulatory simplificationOver the course of the last year, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agenciesfinalized significant burden-reducing measures for smaller banks. The banking agenciessignificantly streamlined Call Report requirements for banks with less than $1 billion in totalassets. This streamlined Call Report resulted in 24 fewer pages than the previous total of 85, andreduced data items required to be reported by small banks by 40 percent. The banking agenciesalso increased the number of institutions eligible for 18-month, rather than 12-month, cycles forsafety and soundness and Bank Secrecy Act exams. And the Federal Reserve implemented adesirable statutory change to raise the threshold of its Small Bank Holding Company PolicyStatement from $500 million to $1 billion in assets.In addition, earlier this year, the U.S. banking agencies issued a report under the EconomicGrowth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) that outlined additional measuresthat the agencies committed to completing to reduce regulatory burden. Perhaps most notably,the agencies committed to developing a proposal to simplify the generally applicable capitalframework that applies to community banking organizations. Among other things, this proposal isbeing designed to simplify the current regulatory capital treatment of commercial real estateexposures, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets. The agencies would seekindustry comment on the proposal through the normal notice and comment process. Theagencies also expect to further reduce burden on small banks by additional streamlining of CallReports.The Federal Reserve has also supported increases in various statutory thresholds in the Dodd-Frank Act to more narrowly focus financial stability reforms on larger banking firms. For example,we believe that small banking organizations could be exempted from the Volcker rule and fromthe incentive compensation requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. We also would support anincrease in the $10 billion Dodd-Frank Act asset threshold for company-run stress tests and riskcommittee requirements, and in the $50 billion threshold for enhanced prudential standardsunder section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act.Resolution plansThe U.S. G-SIBs have made substantial progress in improving their resolvability and have takenconcrete steps to implement important organizational, governance, and operational measuresdeveloped in the course of their resolution planning exercises. These firms will be filing newplans on July 1 that should incorporate agency feedback and guidance. The Federal Reserve andFDIC will engage in a full review of these plans.We are exploring with the FDIC ways to improve the resolution planning process. We believe it isworthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will submissions from annual to once everytwo years, and focusing every other of these filings on key topics of interest and materialchanges from the prior full plan submission. In addition, there may be opportunities to greatlyreduce the submission requirements for a large number of firms due to their relatively small,simple, and domestically focused activities. Such an approach could limit full plan filing 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
requirements to firms that are large, complex, or have systemically critical operations.Volcker ruleThe Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing regulation mostefficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with the other fourVolcker rule agencies to find ways to improve the regulation. In our view, there is room foreliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation that do not directly bear on theVolcker rule’s main policy goals. We also believe it would be constructive for Congress toconsider focusing the Volcker rule on entities with significant trading books and eliminating therequirement that smaller firms be subject to the rule. In the meantime, we believe that it isworthwhile for the agencies to consider further tailoring of the implementing rule as it applies tosmaller firms and firms with small trading books, and to consider ways to streamline or reducethe paperwork and reporting burden associated with the rule.Enhancements to stress testing and CCARThe Federal Reserve is committed to increasing the transparency of the stress testing andCCAR processes. We will soon seek public feedback concerning possible forms of enhanceddisclosure. One such disclosure would be a range of indicative loss rates predicted by theFederal Reserve’s models for various loan and securities portfolios. We would also disclosemore information about risk characteristics that contribute to the loss-estimate ranges.When we release CCAR results next week, we will disclose more detailed information onCCAR’s qualitative assessment. We will also publish a document later this year summarizingthe performance of the industry on qualitative matters. Many of our largest banking firms havemade substantial progress toward meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning. If thatprogress continues, I believe it will be appropriate to consider removing the qualitative objectionfrom CCAR for those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities. Wewould continue to assess the capital planning practices of these firms as part of our ongoingsupervisory processes. I would also see it as appropriate to adjust CCAR’s assumptionsregarding the balance sheet and capital distributions. These adjustments would take place inconjunction with the integration of the stress test into a firm’s regulatory capital requirements.Leverage ratioIn light of the substantial progress in the build-out of our overall regulatory capital and stresstesting frameworks over the past few years, the Federal Reserve is taking a fresh look at theenhanced supplementary leverage ratio. We believe that the leverage ratio is an importantbackstop to the risk-based capital framework, but that it is important to get the relativecalibrations of the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital requirements right. Doing so is criticalto mitigating any perverse incentives and preventing distortions in money markets and other safeasset markets. Changes along these lines also could address concerns of custody banks thattheir business model is disproportionately affected by the leverage ratio.Conclusion U.S. banks today are as strong as any in the world, as shown by their solid profitability andhealthy lending over recent years. As we consider the progress that has been achieved inimproving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is important for us to look forways to reduce unnecessary burden. We must also be vigilant against new risks that maydevelop. In all of our efforts, our goal is to establish a regulatory framework that helps ensure theresiliency of our financial system, the availability of credit, economic growth, and financial marketefficiency. We look forward to working with our fellow regulatory agencies and with Congress toachieve these important goals.1 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

Gent Sejko: Monetary policy of the countries of the region -between US Federal Reserves and European Central BankSpeech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Becici Summit of the countriesof the region on "Regional financial stability in a new global environment", Becici, Montenegro, 16June 2017.*   *   *Dear Mr. Chairman,Dear Colleagues,I would like to start by thanking the organizers for this invitation. As usual, I find it highly useful toshare, among colleagues, opinions on common challenges.The title of the panel suggests our monetary policy stances are somehow shaped by the ECBand the Fed monetary policy paths. Though far from being the full picture, this is true, at someextent.The monetary policies of both these central banks are highly relevant to us. They affect externalconditions and they could dictate the directions, the speed and the price of financial flows.Furthermore, for countries with a dollarized or euroized financial system, they might also affectdomestic credit, financial conditions, balance sheets, as well as exchange rates.So, this brings us to the following questions. Where does our monetary policy sit at the currentsituation? What challenges do we face? And, how do we respond to the shifting of these externalmonetary policies? I am quite confident these issues will be broadly covered during this event.Now let me make a few remarks, regarding the monetary policy of the Bank of Albania vis-à-visthat of the ECB or the Fed.The BoA has pursued an expansionary monetary policy, which has been both supportedand facilitated by the monetary policy stance of the ECB.During the past four years, the Bank of Albania has been engaged in an extensive course ofmonetary accommodation. In the presence of weak cyclical developments and low inflationarypressures, we have decreased our policy rate to a historical minimum of 1.25%. Furthermore:We have increased our liquidity injections in the banking system;We have adopted negative rates for required reserves in euro, in line with the policy ofnegative deposit interest rates in the euro area;We have been engaged in a clear and transparent forward guidance, announcing ourpreference for accommodative policy in line with our inflation target;However, unlike the Fed and the ECB, and similarly to other central banks in the region,we have not activated unconventional monetary policy tools.This is because the monetary policy accommodation pursued by the ECB has facilitated theimplementation of our monetary policy.On one hand, the lower price of euro helped decrease the costs for foreign currency loans;On the other hand, a low policy rate by the ECB has enabled us to decrease our policy ratewithout having to worry about any exchange rate depreciation or financial stability problems. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
This last one is very important, given that around 40% of foreign currency loans are un-hedged.At this point, I would like to take the opportunity and mention that, in order to addressthe high euro exposure in our financial system, the Bank of Albania, together with otherauthorities, has drafted a plan to decrease the level of euroization in the country.Anyway, turning back to our topic, our accommodative monetary policy has been essential insupporting growth and inflationThe accommodative monetary policy has been successful in easing financial conditions andsupporting higher consumption and investments:Lending costs have decreased by approximately 400–500 basis points;Liquidity risk premia in the system have been greatly reduced;Government’ bonds yield curve has flattened somewhat;Credit growth is recovering mostly supported by lending in domestic currency;To wrap this up, from a macroeconomic perspective:The economic activity is strengthening and we are on track to meet our inflation target withinthe relevant time horizon;Our financial system remains liquid and well capitalized, while the profitability ratios arepositive;However, the external background seems about to get more complex.The Fed and the ECB are following slightly different policy paths.For the past few years, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have pursuedsomewhat diverse monetary policy stances.The Fed appears to be on the tightening side. It raised its policy rate in 2016 and 2017, after twoyears of gradually reducing its quantitative easing program. At the same time, its forwardguidance suggests a tightening path in the near future.In the meantime, the ECB is facing a different set of economic conditions, including slowergrowth, lower inflation, and higher economic and political uncertainty. As a result, the ECB is stillholding to its accommodative monetary policy for longer. The forward guidance suggests thatthis path will continue at least for the current year.These bring us to the conclusion that there are potential international spillovers fromthese divergent policies, for small open economies.As a result of financial globalization, monetary policy in major advanced economies hassignificant spillovers to the global economy. Likewise, changes in market expectations about thefuture course of their policies have a high impact on financial market volatility.Furthermore, the region’s economies are small and open economies, whose main trading andeconomic partner is the Euro Area. In addition, the banking systems in our countries aredominated by EU-based banking groups. So, even though the Fed and the ECB’s monetarypolicy decisions affect their domestic economies and financial systems, they might have adelayed, but probably longer lasting effect on our economies. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Depending on their intensity, both the trading and banking channels might affect our monetarypolicy stance and our monetary policy decisions.Given our exposure to the dollar and the euro , the ECB monetary policy stance is morerelevant to our economy. In other words, it has a stronger and more direct impact on ourmonetary conditions and our financial systems.Let me take Albania as an example, whose main trading partners are EU countries:Roughly three quarters of our trade is directed to Eurozone countries.Over 60% of FDIs originate from the EU.The euro is the main foreign currency in our financial system – more than 4/5 of foreigncurrency assets and liabilities are in the common currency.Furthermore, studies indicate an effective basket of currencies in Albania would compriseroughly 75–80% euro, and the rest would be USD or currencies pegged to it.All these indicators mean we are much more exposed to the policy stance across theeuro area, while the policy stance of the FED affects us only indirectly.At this point, a presumed tightening of the ECB monetary policy:would increase foreign currency lending costs in our economy, i.e. tightening financialconditions;If not followed by our monetary policy, would cause internal portfolio-shifts and depreciationpressures on the exchange rate;would not result in major capital outflows, as we did not benefit much capital inflows from theextraordinary expansionary policy pursued by the ECB;On the other hand, a tightening of the FED monetary policy would not affect Albaniadirectly, apart from the usual negative implications it might have on oil and commodityprices.However, I have to state out that our monetary policy would benefit from a predictablemonetary policy stance of the ECB in the near future.A predictable stance of the monetary policy in the Eurozone enhances the effectiveness of ourmonetary policy. A wider interest rate differential might lead to appreciation pressures on theexchange rate, and this can, and will be taken in consideration in our policy analysis and actions.To conclude, let me recap my points:Albania remains much more exposed to the ECB rather than the FED policies;Our expansionary monetary policies have been greatly facilitated by the policy stance of theECB and the FED;The relative stability of Fed and ECB monetary policy has helped us reduce volatility in ourdomestic markets;However, any tightening by these banks would represent a tightening of our domesticfinancial conditions;th 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Our monetary policy would benefit from the FED and the ECB, taking into account they willnot present any surprises. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Joachim Wuermeling: Securities finance and collateralmanagement - current challengesKeynote speech by Prof Joachim Wuermeling, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the 26th Annual Securities Finance and Collateral Management Conference,Berlin, 21 June 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenThank you very much for your kind invitation to give today’s keynote speech here at this high-levelconference. For me, the board member responsible for market operations at the Bundesbank,this conference constitutes a great opportunity to exchange views on current challenges in thefields of securities finance and collateral management.“The convergence of liquidity” is a promising title. To be honest, though: At least with regard tothe liquidity the Eurosystem injects into the markets, there are – unfortunately – no signs ofconvergence towards a certain value yet. Most of you will be well aware that the GoverningCouncil of the ECB decided two weeks ago to leave the Asset Purchase Programme (APP)unchanged for now. The Eurosystem will continue to buy securities through the APP to the tuneof EUR 60 billiona month at least until December 2017. Hence, mathematically speaking, lineargrowth is the name of the game – at least for now. Excess liquidity, an essential indicator formonetary policy implementation, currently stands at EUR 1,650 billion.I would like to take this opportunity today to elaborate on three issues that are, at least to somedegree, interlinked with the Eurosystem’s activities in the markets. First, I would like to discussthe remarkable upswing in asset prices after the financial crisis and drivers for this development.Second, I would like to briefly discuss the shifts in financial markets with respect to marketliquidity. I will argue that, whereas some of the factors affecting market liquidity are temporary,others – such as the regulatory environment and innovations in trading – are here to stay. Finally Iwill conclude by presenting my view on the outlook for monetary policy implementation. 2. Current drivers of financial marketsThe financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent European debt crisis dealt financial markets aserious blow. Investors had to reconsider long-held beliefs that were accepted as truths: thatlarge banks were immune to bankruptcy, and that sovereigns in the developed world would neverdefault on their debt. When the crisis hit and the unimaginable happened, prices of financialassets, apart from a few viewed as safe havens, went into a tailspin.This is history. Asset prices have rebounded remarkably. Stock markets in Europe as well as theUS have reached new historic heights. Corporate debt is in high demand, and risk premia haveshrunk noticeably, even for heavily indebted entities. Prices have also increased for moretangible assets such as real estate. Naturally, the continued rise in asset prices is fuellingspeculation about potential bubbles. However, judging whether price developments constitute abubble or reflect fundamental and sustainable factors is not a simple task.  1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
2.1 Recovery in asset prices and QEThere is little doubt that the extraordinary measures taken by central banks to shore up liquidityhave played a significant part in these price developments. They reassured markets, rebuiltconfidence and created an environment in which investors were once again willing to put moneyinto risky assets. It is important to remember that this was an intended effect. For the economyto grow again, businesses and households need to have access to affordable capital. Investmentis the lifeblood of any recovery.However, there is, of course, the concept of too much of a good thing. Unintended side effects ofquantitative easing are becoming more apparent the longer the programme runs and the less it isneeded to sustain the economic recovery. So far, the positive effects may well have outweighedthe negative implications, but this is bound to change at some point.Quantitative easing is designed to work by nudging investors away from safe havens andtowards riskier assets. However, one has to realise that the balance to be struck is ratherdelicate. There is a serious risk that investors will start to underestimate the risks of theirinvestments, leading to price distortions and misallocation of capital. An abundance of liquiditywill not by itself make a risky investment less so. Market participants should think very carefullyabout what will happen once the ample liquidity provision stops.Additionally, there is the thorny issue of whether private investors are being crowded out ofcertain market segments by central banks and what the long-term effects are. Although theEurosystem puts a high value on implementing the purchase programme in a market-neutralway, it must be acknowledged that there are areas of concern.Apart from concerns about private investors simply being crowded out for the time being andassociated questions about market functioning, there is also concern about which investors willcome back once the purchase programmes end. It is certainly not the Eurosystem’s intention toharm capital markets: quite the contrary. Nevertheless, it needs to be recognised that investorsprobably will most likely not flood in again immediately.But as a wise person once said: it is very difficult to predict – especially the future. Instead oflooking into a crystal ball, I would like to discuss two further drivers that play a major role forasset valuations. 2.2 The macroeconomic environmentThe first one, the current macroeconomic environment, is convincing. While the recovery wasrelatively anaemic for a long time, it seems to have gathered pace over the last two to threeyears. This is in part thanks to the unconventional measures taken by the Eurosystem.Quarterly growth in the euro area has improved and has ranged between 0.2 percent and0.8 percent for the last 16 quarters. The latest reading for April puts the unemployment rate at 9.3percent. That is still too high, but it is nevertheless a marked improvement on its peak of12.1 percent in mid-2013. And spirits are up: economic sentiment is close to a nearly 10-yearhigh.Inflation, however, remains a sore point. Accelerating inflation from the beginning of the year hascome down once again. After hitting 2.0 percent in February, its highest reading since January2013, inflation has retreated to 1.4 percent in May. The oil-price effect has subsided and onceagain the onus is on economic growth to generate inflation. The Governing Council of the ECBputs a strong emphasis on underlying inflation. It is very important for credibility that policydecisions are taken on a strong footing. They cannot be beholden to monthly volatility in data 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
publications.So overall, the macroeconomic backdrop does provide some justification for price developmentsover the last few years. Asset prices should rise when growth prospects improve. Naturally, itwould be welcome to see asset price inflation translated into a reasonable level of consumerprice inflation as well. 2.3 Political uncertaintyWhile the macroeconomic backdrop is promising, there are still complications ahead. Politics,another driver for asset prices I would like to briefly discuss, has created a lot of headlines overthe last year. These developments have not substantially affected the high valuation levels,though.The first major test came in the form of the Brexit referendum in June 2016. The decision by amajority of UK voters to leave the European Union came as quite a shock. Markets exhibitedsubstantial volatility in response. This response was short-lived, though, and markets haveremained orderly throughout. Next up was the presidential election in the United States. Marketsadjusted even more quickly to the new circumstances. The constitutional referendum in Italy inDecember 2016 was barely registered in markets.However, political risks remain a concern for markets. The run-up to the French presidentialelection had investors worried, as evidenced by a widening spread between French and Germansovereign bonds. And the view on the US has somewhat turned from exuberance to waryidealism as it has become clear that implementing all the stimulus measures promised by theTrump Administration will not be a walk in the park after all.Looking forward, questions about the US political agenda will remain relevant, and the roadahead of the Brexit negotiations will give investors much to interpret and think about. Theoutcome of the UK elections might very well complicate the negotiations with the rest of theEuropean Union further. In addition, election season in Europe is not quite over, with the Germangeneral elections due in September.The Brexit negotiations will not only be reflected in the prices on financial markets, but will alsohave a lasting effect on financial market locations themselves. Once the UK has left theEuropean Union, European agencies currently based in the UK, like the EBA and EMA, will haveto be relocated into the EU-27. The future location of euro clearing operations is certainly anothercrucial aspect: in my point of view, euro clearing is of key importance for Europe, and a meresupervisory recognition of a UK central counterparty as “equivalent” is unlikely to be sufficientpost-Brexit.Banks and the financial services industry will need to waste no time in planning ahead for thefuture, since Brexit could involve a substantial loss of rights to conduct business in the EuropeanUnion and possibly necessitate the relocation of sensitive and important infrastructures. That iswhy I expect a growing number of firms to transfer their operations from the UK to continentalEurope even before negotiations have been finalised. There will not only be just one city whichattracts these companies. Cities such as Paris, Dublin, Luxembourg and, of course, Frankfurtwill complement one another in terms of the value they add. And, in my personal opinion,Frankfurt has quite a few major selling points to offer.Looking at current asset valuations, markets appear to be taking the political risks in stride. Goingforward, this behaviour might very well continue with markets only adjusting once it looks likepolitics will impact on the fundamental outlook. That is what is happening right now with themarket participants assessing the reform agenda in the US, and probably will happen when the 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Brexit negotiations are underway. If some tail risk scenario were to materialise, however,markets might reassess valuations a lot more forcefully, and prices of risky assets might thenadjust accordingly. 3. Transitory and structural changes in market liquidityLadies and gentlemenDistortions in asset prices are one concern when discussing financial markets. Other concernsare related to changes in the market place. Today, we are facing a situation where central bankliquidity is hitting all-time highs daily while, at the same time, market liquidity appears to be ficklein a number of segments. Reason enough, in my view, to shed some light on factors thatinfluence market liquidity. 3.1 The APP and securities lendingAs already mentioned, the purchase programmes seem to have been successful in loweringfixed income yields and fighting potential deflation risks. Nevertheless, they have been criticisedstrongly. Not only for inducing concerns in matters of supporting further government debt anddelaying structural reforms, but also because they are said to create market distortions.Academic evidence on the effects of non-standard measures is helpful for determining the needfor remedial measures, but unfortunately rather rare. The Bundesbank and the Bank forInternational Settlements have launched a joint project which analyses the impact of purchaseswithin the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) on prices and liquidity of Bunds in thefirst 18 months of the programme. The researchers provide evidence for negative side effectsover the lifetime of the programme, eg decreasing Bund market liquidity. Based on data from theBund cash market, the authors not only show deteriorating liquidity conditions over the course ofthe programme, but also find evidence that the purchases have a negative effect on transactioncosts and order book depth. These findings suggest that the scarcity effects of asset purchasescan impact adversely on market functioning.Strains in market liquidity have also become visible in the repo market. Especially at quarter oryear ends we have seen deeply negative repo rates. This can be attributed to a variety ofreasons, but the large-scale purchases of the Eurosystem may have played a role.In order to curtail tensions in repo and bond market liquidity, Eurosystem central banks havemade their holdings available for securities lending from the start of the PSPP. Let me go a littledeeper here, as securities lending is a key topic at this conference.The lending was implemented in a decentralised manner in the Eurosystem. The Bundesbankstarted by using the automated Clearstream lending facilities. In September 2016 we also beganto offer a bilateral repo facility.Not all the features of the bilateral repo facility have been fully appreciated by market participants.We have imposed relatively strict operational and risk management parameters. This concernsspecific terms such as a maximum maturity of seven days or the exclusion of automaticrollovers as well as certain collateral requirements.I would like to stress that the lending facilities for the asset purchase programmes are designedas backstop facilities. We do not want to crowd out private players; we are just offeringsupplementary facilities to the repo and lending markets. Against this background, we regardsomewhat stricter operational parameters as justified. Furthermore, as a central bank we have to 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
place particular emphasis on risk mitigation, and most of the lending parameters serve exactlythis purpose.Despite the criticism put forward by some market participants, in the meantime our repo facilityappears to be being well received in the market. So, allow me to note that the conditions do notappear to be overly harsh after all. The outstanding volume has been continuously growing andmost of our active trading counterparties are also using the repo facility. Especially theopportunity to submit cash collateral for PSPP securities lending, which was implemented inDecember 2016, has enhanced the popularity of the bilateral facility. The APP securities lendingprimarily addresses the most active market participants in the respective markets or primarydealers. It is, however, open to other counterparties as well.In 2017, volatility in the repo market for German government securities has been rather moderateso far, even at the end of the first quarter. It seems that market participants have found a way tocope with the challenging environment. The Eurosystem’s lending facilities may have contributedto this development.Another area in which various commentators and academics have recently criticised theEurosystem is the collateral framework. The Eurosystem conducts repo operations to providetemporary liquidity to the banking sector and takes financial assets as collateral in return. Thecollateral framework defines the eligible financial assets, the related pricing methodology and therespective risk-control measures.Critics contend that the Eurosystem is accepting collateral of insufficient quality at excessivelylenient terms. This – so they argue – could create market distortions and large risks for theEurosystem’s balance sheet.The Eurosystem is taking this criticism seriously. However, it should be duly noted that,throughout the difficult times of the financial and sovereign debt crisis, the broad collateralframework was regarded as a great institutional strength of Eurosystem’s monetary policy. Whilethe pledged collateral has successfully protected the Eurosystem from financial losses, at thesame time the collateral framework has been flexible enough to preserve the Eurosystem’sability to support market functioning and provide liquidity to the banking system in times of stress.The Eurosystem thereby fulfilled one of the core functions of a central bank. 3.2 RegulationAs is apparent from the agenda of this conference, regulatory issues have become a crucialfactor in financial markets, cropping up in almost every agenda item. In the aftermath of thefinancial crisis, national and European regulatory initiatives alike have mushroomed.In a nutshell, the regulations involve stricter rules for capital, stricter provisions for riskytransactions, and higher administrative burdens. At the Bundesbank, we are fully aware of thesestrains and the potential drawbacks of regulatory requirements. Liquidity in the bond and repomarkets has decreased, also – but not only – because of new regulations.Moreover, the higher required capital ratios will increase banks’ cost of capital while banks’earnings are currently compressed. This is making it difficult for banks to raise further capital,which is why they may respond to regulatory requirements by deleveraging. This, in turn, maywell have negative effects on market liquidity.At the same time, it is evident that well-designed regulatory measures will help make the financialsystem more stable. The ultimate aim is to make financial markets more resilient and crisis-proof in the future. Higher resilience will restore market and customer confidence in banks. This 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
is intended partly make up for the higher costs of capital and allow banks to attract morecustomers and funds. In the long run, a stronger capital base can be expected to enhance banks’loan origination capabilities. These are thus positive effects of regulation which need to berecognised.I am convinced that we need effective and well-targeted regulation. This also means that weneed to closely monitor all effects – intended and unintended – and consider makingadjustments, if necessary.But even if targeted adjustments are made to the regulatory framework, I believe one thing canbe expected: while other factors currently weighing on market activity are eventually going to fadeout, tighter regulatory requirements will definitely stay, and this is the “new normal” marketparticipants will have to adapt to. 3.3 High Frequency TradingLet me now turn to another phenomenon whose role in market liquidity is, in my view, larger thansome observers think. For the last fifteen years the investment community has witnessed atransformation in the landscape of exchanges, brokers and investors from a trading process thatis based on human decision making into an automated electronic high-speed exchange. HighFrequency Trading (HFT) operates in a matter of microseconds.The Bundesbank conducted a comprehensive empirical study on the significance of HFT in theGerman capital market and analysed whether or not HFT has had a positive impact on marketliquidity.The results show that HFT with its 40 percent share of trading volume in the DAX and BUNDfuture, does indeed play a very dominant role in market making and in the supply of liquidity inthese very important market segments. The observed characteristics of the market behaviourpaint a two-sided picture of HFTs’ impact in the markets:In normal trading environments, the findings support the view that many HFTs act as a stablesource of liquidity that provides investors a steady opportunity to trade future contracts at verygood prices. Market response times to incoming fundamental news are in the millisecond rangeand bid-ask spreads are for the most part at their minimum. During times of increased stress in the markets, such as during the anticipated announcementof important macroeconomic data, the empirical findings show a change in HFTs’ behaviour.Market-making activity of high-speed algorithms is significantly reduced, sometimes close tozero for short time periods, while at the same time more aggressive and liquidity-demanding HFTtrading strategies take over and start to dominate the trading field.Hence, the ramifications of HFT and the transformation into an automated trading ecosystemindeed change the liquidity conditions in the market. Drawing the right conclusions is not easy –for market participants and regulators alike. 4. Outlook for monetary policy implementationTo conclude, there are a number of factors which impact financial markets. While thetechnological progress and the regulatory changes are here to stay, the Eurosystem’s extremelyaccommodative monetary policy will come to an end at some point.Discussions on normalisation took centre stage again last week, when the US Federal Reserve 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
System updated plans for its balance sheet runoff. The duration of the process has been definedas “a few years”. The general approach will be to let the balance sheet runoff happen passively“in the background,” as if markets were simply “watching paint dry.”It is self-evident that the Eurosystem is hoping for a process which will be just as boring as theFed’s plan. But first, the necessary precondition has to be met:inflation has to sustainably adjustback towards the ECB Governing Council’s target for price stability of below but close to 2percent in the medium term. Additionally, we must bear in mind that – like in the US – the exitprocess will take several years.Which technical options does the Eurosystem have at its disposal once the Governing Councildetermines that it is time to start the exit process?From a technical point of view, neither an increase in the level of key interest rates nor an exitfrom individual non-standard monetary policy measures would pose particular challenges.However, since the start of the financial crisis the Eurosystem has gradually implemented a largenumber of expansionary measures which would need to be phased out. Once the GoverningCouncil has determined the appropriate timing and has adjusted its “Forward Guidance”accordingly, the sequencing of monetary policy normalisation and exit from non-standardmeasures will follow a gradual and prudent approach. Even after non-standard measures havebeen discontinued, a considerable amount of liquidity will stay in the market for a prolongedperiod.For the Bundesbank, the key step towards the normalisation of monetary policy would be the endof outright purchases of government bonds under the Asset Purchase Programme, as thisprogramme blurs the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. However, from anoperational or economic perspective there is no predetermined sequence for exiting from singlenon-standard measures. It should be noted that the comprehensive package of non-standardmeasures is highly expansionary. Consequently, removing one measure would only remove itsparticular effects, i.e. the monetary policy stance would not become restrictive, only lessexpansionary.Hence, a number of different options for the departure from expansionary monetary policymeasures are possible. An orderly exit which has been properly prepared both technically andverbally will allow a smooth transition in the financial markets. Talking about communication – alook at the introductory statement of the press conference after the last ECB Governing Councilmeeting reveals a few interesting details. The Governing Council considers that risks to thegrowth outlook are now broadly balanced. It also removed the easing bias on rates for now.Some observers interpreted this statement as a further step towards monetary policynormalisation – and market participants should be prepared for these new challenges.Thank you for your attention. 7 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Page 1 of 7    Remarks by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,  at the annual dinner in honour of the Ambassadors and High Commissioners  to the Republic of South Africa  South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria 7 June 2017  Introduction  Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Ambassadors, High Commissioners, Counsellors and Diplomats – a very good evening to you all. Thank you for accepting our invitation to this event, which has become a permanent feature on our calendar.   South Africa has its fair share of challenges. Our country finds itself at an intensely contested but creative moment in its history. South Africans are energetically debating the problems we face today and the policies we should be implementing to fix these problems.   Notwithstanding these challenges, South Africa has a number of positive things going for it, not least of which are its institutions, which remain resilient.   However, it is not my intention to bore you with the developments in South Africa tonight. I would prefer to use the limited time I have on this podium to touch on global economic developments and say a bit more about some of the initiatives that the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has been involved in on the continent and in other global forums. I will be brief, so that we can enjoy the excellent food and wine on offer tonight.   A global economy experiencing a cyclical recovery   
Page 2 of 7  Over the past few years, the world has had to become accustomed to disappointing global growth outcomes. Therefore, when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified 2016 as the turning point in the global growth cycle and upgraded the outlook for the global economy for 2017, it came as a welcome surprise. Broad-based gains were pencilled in across both the developed world and emerging markets. It seemed that the many years of accommodative and often unorthodox monetary policy, coupled with the more recent easier fiscal policy in the advanced economies, had helped to propel the global economy into a cyclical upswing.   But despite the promising short-term outlook, a number of challenges and risks persist, and I would like to highlight a few of these. The shift towards more inward-looking policies threatens to derail global trade, with negative consequences for growth. And the lack of progress in the implementation of some of the financial regulatory reforms agreed on since the most recent global financial crisis, such as finalising the capital framework under Basel III, is also something we need to address as it threatens to create an uneven global playing field, putting some countries at a disadvantage by creating space for regulatory arbitrage.   Policy uncertainty in many countries, specifically the uncertainty arising from the tax proposals in the United States, also warrants careful attention. Furthermore, more aggressive monetary policy actions than currently anticipated could tighten global financial conditions, causing disruptions to capital flows to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) like South Africa.   So while the short-term outlook is an optimistic one, there is general recognition that we cannot afford to be complacent. Securing a sustained recovery over the medium term requires stronger international cooperation. Allow me to highlight some of the initiatives in this regard.  International cooperation  
Page 3 of 7  International forums such as the G201 and BRICS2 continue to give attention to initiatives aimed at supporting stronger, more sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. As part of that, the G20 and BRICS also give much attention to improving the resilience of the global financial system.    Structural reforms have been a key objective of the G20 and have consequently been receiving greater emphasis since the Australian Presidency of the G20 in 2014. These reforms are aimed at raising the collective G20 GDP3 by an additional 2% by 2018. Each G20 country has devised a growth strategy, highlighting the key structural reforms to be undertaken to raise potential output. Every year, member countries update their growth strategies (which are peer-reviewed), new measures are committed to (where possible), and progress towards the stated objectives is assessed.   Under China’s G20 Presidency in 2016, the structural reform agenda was further enhanced by the development of a set of priorities and guiding principles as a reference for G20 reform efforts. An indicator system was devised to assist with the monitoring and assessment of the implementation of structural reforms and their adequacy to address the structural challenges. This year, under Germany’s Presidency, the G20 has devised a set of principles as a means of enhancing member countries’ resilience to shocks.    There is little doubt that progress is being made in building a more resilient global financial architecture. The IMF is currently reviewing its lending toolkit to make it more relevant and more balanced, and to also work towards closing the existing gaps within the global financial safety net. Numerous discussions are also continuing on developing macroprudential policies and devising ways of improving the availability and quality of relevant data to enhance economic policy formulation and implementation.                                                                1 Group of Twenty 2 Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa 3 gross domestic product 
Page 4 of 7  South Africa continues to reaffirm its support for the agreed reforms to strengthen the global financial system. It is our hope that various jurisdictions will expedite their respective processes to find a compromise on the remaining Basel III elements to ensure level playing fields. We support the efforts of the German G20 Presidency to try and establish a more holistic monitoring framework of the effects of the reforms, especially for EMDEs. This is essential to determine the adjustments and/or refinements to the reforms that may be needed to reduce their unintended effects.    Digital innovations in the financial sphere are another key topic in international forums. South Africa is fully supportive of the ongoing work on the regulatory approaches to financial digital innovations as well as of the stocktake of cybercrime regulations in the financial sector. The reduction of correspondent banking services in some EMDEs has presented some challenges for countries on the African continent. Reasons for this reduction in correspondent banking services relate mainly to more stringent regulatory requirements which have brought about reviews of business models. The resultant impact of these developments, inter alia on financial inclusion, warrants closer attention.    Beyond the G20, the BRICS grouping has achieved much since its first political dialogue in September 2006. The New Development Bank (NDB) was established to mobilise resources for infrastructure development, particularly within the BRICS countries but also in other EMDEs. The NDB is doing well in mobilising resources for infrastructure development projects and, in 2016 alone, approved seven projects in the BRICS countries with a total value of over US$1.5 billion. These projects are all in the areas of renewable and green energy and transportation. The first ‘green bond’ was issued in 2016 and the NDB has signed memorandums of understanding with other development banks such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. I should also mention that the African Regional Centre of the NDB will likely be opened in South Africa later this year.  Another initiative which the BRICS grouping has undertaken in its quest to strengthen the global financial safety net is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). The CRA Treaty was signed in July 2014 and came into effect a year later; it is now fully operational.  
Page 5 of 7   The CRA is a self-managed contingent reserves arrangement to forestall short-term balance-of-payments pressures, provide mutual support, and further strengthen financial stability. The arrangement, which is a pool of US$100 billion, provides the BRICS countries with access to additional liquidity in the event of a crisis. Fortunately, none of the BRICS countries have had a need to call upon the CRA to date.  A number of new initiatives are being discussed under the BRICS agenda, with a view to furthering the work already undertaken and cementing the progress that has been made to date. More details will emerge at the BRICS summit later this year. Next year, South Africa will take over the Presidency of the BRICS grouping. We will continue the work aimed at further strengthening the cooperation and collaboration among the BRICS members.  Regional economic integration   The SARB is an active participant in various forums on the continent, which include the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Association of African Central Banks (AACB), and the Common Monetary Area (CMA).   The main aim of SADC is to promote economic and financial integration in the interest of sustainable economic development in the region. In this regard, the SADC Heads of State adopted the revised Regional Integrated Strategic Development Plan in 2016. The SARB’s regional initiatives are mainly conducted through the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG), which is chaired by the SARB. The main objective of the CCBG is to undertake initiatives in support of the SADC Finance and Investment Protocol.  A notable achievement of the CCBG in recent years relates to the implementation of the SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System, known as SIRESS. Through SIRESS, 14 regional central banks and 76 commercial banks are electronically linked to effect cross-border payments and settlements in real time. Since its inception in 2015, more than 700 000 transactions to the value of almost R3.1 trillion have been cleared on the SIRESS platform. 
Page 6 of 7   The SARB is also a member of the AACB. The main objectives of the AACB include the promotion of cooperation in the monetary, banking and financial spheres in the interest of maintaining price and financial stability. The work of the AACB is in line with the broad framework of Agenda 2063 adopted by the African Union in 2013.   The SARB is currently the Vice Chair of the AACB and will host the Ordinary Annual Meeting as well as the Governors Symposium on 12-16 August 2017 here in Pretoria. At this annual meeting, the SARB will assume the chairmanship of the AACB. During our tenure as chair, we will continue to enhance cooperation among African central banks on cross-border banking supervision and payment systems, continental training on issues relating to banking supervision and regulation, and the collection of data needed to support bank supervisory activities.   Closer to home, the SARB also engages with the central banks of Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, who together with South Africa are members of the CMA. The central bank governors of the CMA meet three times a year to discuss economic developments in their respective countries as well as other issues related to cross-border spillover effects among CMA members. The exchange of information as well as the collaboration on research and other matters of mutual interest have proven extremely useful in assisting the CMA countries to fulfil their respective obligations stipulated in the Multilateral Monetary Agreement which governs the CMA arrangement.  Conclusion  The SARB remains committed to playing its role in the development of the region, the continent, and the global economy. In many instances, we do this in collaboration with our counterparts in your respective countries. Tonight, we celebrate this cooperation, and we trust that our partnerships will only strengthen in the times ahead. In the spirit of this cooperation, I would like to invite you to approach the SARB through our International Economic Relations and Policy Department should you need an update on economic and/or monetary policy developments.

Sabine Lautenschläger: Cyber resilience - a banking supervisor'sviewStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, atthe High-Level Meeting on Cyber Resilience, Frankfurt am Main, 19 June 2017.*   *   *This week I learnt that the first computer virus dates back to 1971. It spread via the ARPANET,which was a precursor of today’s internet. The ARPANET connected about two dozenuniversities and government hosts in the United States. The virus had been written forexperimental purposes and was not malicious. It just displayed a simple message on infectedcomputers: “I’m the creeper: catch me if you can”.Things are a bit more complex today, and the outcome of cyber incidents much worse: they candisrupt business, cost a lot of money and destroy reputations. And indeed, the potential fordamage is great, as so much relies on IT and so much happens online – the financial sector is acase in point. As you all know, banks have always been attractive targets for criminals.Although the damage has been limited so far, we banking supervisors take cyber risk veryseriously. And we insist on banks doing the same.Cyber risk has been a priority for ECB Banking Supervision from day one. In 2015, weestablished a working group that had three goals. First, to get an overview of how supervisorsdeal with such risks both at national and international level. Second, to get an overview of howprepared banks are for cyber risk. And third, to propose to the Supervisory Board a strategicdirection and a dedicated work plan on cyber risk.We have learnt a lot over the past two years. And we have used it to address this risk fromseveral different angles.For us, one of the first steps was to establish a cyber incident reporting framework. Weconducted a successful pilot phase in 2016. And now we will implement a long-term solution forall those banks that we directly supervise. As from this summer, they will be required to report allsignificant cyber incidents. This will help us to assess more objectively how many incidents thereare and how cyber threats evolve. It will also help us to identify vulnerabilities and commonpitfalls.In addition to our ongoing supervision we also perform thematic reviews on cyber security and IToutsourcing. These reviews help us to assess the risks facing each bank as well as the risksthat might affect the entire sector. And they also help to raise awareness of cyber risk at Boardlevel.The insights that we obtained in 2015 and 2016 were applied in three ways. First, they informed adedicated section in our methodology for on-site inspections. Second, they were used to createnew analytical tools for our off-site supervisors. And third, they were used to produce a cyber riskprofile of each bank.So we are working to obtain a comprehensive picture of what is happening out there. But how todeal with cyber risk?Well, the World Health Organization says that the best way of stopping diseases from spreadingis basic hygiene: washing your hands. And the same is true for IT. Basic IT “hygiene” can takebanks a long way. Have the latest updates been installed? Are passwords strong enough? Havebackups been made and their restoration tested? Such simple things are so important, but often 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
neglected.So we are taking a close look at our banks to see whether they are following the relevantstandards and best practices. And there are plenty of these; I cannot stress this enough. Wealso work with the European Banking Authority, the EBA, on how to supervise cyber risk in aneffective and harmonised manner across Europe.As for the euro area, we plan to issue our supervisory expectations on how banks approach ITrisks in general. And what we expect clearly goes beyond basic IT hygiene. This will be animportant step for two reasons. First, it will help to forge a common understanding of IT risksbetween supervisors and banks. And second, it will help to ensure a harmonised treatment. Toincrease awareness and to communicate our expectations, we will organise seminars anddiscussions with banks.And we also look beyond the euro area, of course. We cooperate with supervisors worldwide toalign priorities and exchange best practices.To sum up, we take cyber risk very seriously, and we approach it from various angles. My adviceto banks is to do the same. It is vital to be alert and ready to react.Thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
François Villeroy de Galhau: Banking risks, regulations andsupervisionIntroductory speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France andChairman of the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution (ACPR), at the ACPRconference, Paris, Friday 16 June 2017.*   *   *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to welcome you to this new conference organised by the Autorité de contrôleprudentiel et de résolution (ACPR). The three issues that will be discussed this morning –banking risks, regulation and supervision – are all essential and are naturally highlyinterdependent. To introduce this conference, I would particularly like to focus on the issue ofregulations and their impact on the financing of the economy and growth.As you know, this is the subject we chose to address this year in the Banque de France’sFinancial Stability Review, which will partly serve as a framework for your discussions thismorning. Ten years after the beginning of the financial crisis and eight years after the G20summits in London and Pittsburgh that forged a global action plan, it is time to take stock. Webrought together 14 remarkable and complementary views for the Financial Stability Review frompublic authorities, academics and industry representatives. What emerges is, to my mind, bothan achievement and a challenge.*    *    *I. Firstly, an achievement: the banking and financial system is substantially more resilient todaythan it was ten years ago. This is thanks to unprecedented international cooperation on financialreforms under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board and the coordination of the BaselCommittee in the banking sector, and thanks to the remarkable efforts made by the bankingindustry. Thankfully, the world of finance in 2017 is not what it was in 2007.That is particularly true for banks in Europe and in France. It is important to stress thisachievement, as the European banking sector is often criticised, particularly from the other sideof the Atlantic, solely in the light of its difficult cases or institutions that are trailing at the rear,whereas on the whole, it is clearly far more robust than before the crisis. Banks in France forexample, have doubled their levels of capital since the crisis and generate a return on equity(RoE) of 7%, and even up to 9% or 10% when adjusted for one-off items. As regards this return,it is clearly lower than the pre-crisis levels, but in certain respects, this can be expected and isreasonable. We cannot ask banks to generate a double-digit return on equity when interest ratesand the risk-free rate are so low and banks are indeed more resilient than they were. Moreover,this improvement does not only concern the banks: it can also be seen in the non-banking sectorand the financial markets, with particular progress made with regard to over-the-counterderivatives and the shadow banking system.Regarding the economic consequences of the reforms, it is important first to remember thecost of the financial crisis: according to IMF data, the total loss of global output from 2007 to 2014amounts to 25%. Compared to this considerable loss, the potential cost of financial regulation isvery small. And above all, no one can seriously claim that in France or more generally in themajority of advanced economies the supply of credit has been excessively constrained bybanking regulations. On the contrary, lending to the economy remains robust, with housing loansin France up 5.6% year-on-year in April 2017 and loans to non-financial corporations up 5.4%. Inthe coming months, this strong overall growth may actually warrant general vigilance and closerscrutiny by the High Council for Financial Stability, in which I participate. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
*    *    *II. Nevertheless, we are still faced with a challenge for the future, which brings me to mysecond point: even if the achievement is now on solid foundations, there is clearly no room todayfor complacency or respite. Although the risks of a future crisis have diminished, no one shouldbelieve that they have disappeared entirely.So what measures are required? For banks, the priority is to stabilise the regulatory frameworkand therefore we must finalise Basel III. Here, it is useful to remember that, essentially – let’s sayapproximately 80% – Basel III was already completed in 2011. In addition, there is now a broadconsensus on risk measurement approaches. The main point that is still undecided and whichcontinues to occupy the Committee members is the setting of the so-called “output floor” forbanks that apply internal models. Let’s be clear: I read and hear the banking industry, and Frenchbanks in particular, giving its advice for negotiations on this point. A little restraint would not goamiss, and it is not our intention to defend corporate interests. If an output floor of 75% is notacceptable, it is because this floor – and consequently the standardised approach – wouldbecome the constraint for half of the international banks. I must stress that our goal is tofinalise Basel III, based on improved models that remain risk sensitive, and not to moveonto Basel IV, which would use the standardised approach. Therefore, an agreement mustbe reached on a lower output floor along with a tightening of controls over the banks’ internalmodels, much like the targeted review of internal models (TRIM) that was approved for the SingleSupervisory Mechanism and the results of which we are more than willing to submit to peer-review. This stance is shared at the very least by other European countries such as Germanyand the Netherlands, and by the European Commission.International cooperation on financial reforms is a common good that has been extremelyprecious during these past eight years and is crucial to our future. The temptation to go back on itis extremely dangerous and would increase the risk of another financial crisis. In this respect, thecurrent situation in the United States is worrying. Generally speaking, the measures that will beeffectively adopted and implemented by the new administration and the competent governmentagencies regarding financial and banking regulation still have to be clarified. There is a possibilitythat the regulations already finalised in Basel such as the Fundamental Review of the TradingBook (FRTB) or the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) could be called into question. Unilateralderegulation would be nothing less than a lose-lose scenario with serious consequences for thestability of the global financial system as well as the competitive landscape for US and Europeanbanks. In view of this, the integration of a possible agreement on Basel III into Europeanstandards should be finalised while keeping a close eye on what the other major countries willdo, starting, as you will have understood, with the United States.We must also avoid regulatory arbitrage. For non-bank players, significant progress is requiredon liquidity management by funds and asset management companies, on fintechs and moregenerally on the major digital platforms, which, if they carry out financial activities, will have tocomply with similar regulations sooner or later. As for the financial markets, the decrease inmarket liquidity must be explained, and in doing so we must also consider the role of highfrequency trading and its highly debatable social utility.A final word on central counterparties (CCP): I would like to acknowledge the valuableproposals recently made by the European Commission to insist that those CCPs whoseactivities are “super-systemic” for the EU market establish themselves in the European Union.They are a step in the right direction and represent the only viable mechanism to guarantee thatEuropean authorities and national central banks in particular, can control and manage the risksthat CCPs are likely to pose to the financial stability of the European Union. Once the provisionson the resolution of CCPs have been finalised, the compensation framework within the EU willhave been improved considerably.  2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
*    *    *Let me conclude with a general remark that concerns the economy: we need a system toassess, ex post, the economic effects of the reforms. France fully supports the work of the FSBto develop a structured analytical framework, which Germany has rightly included in its prioritiesfor its G20 presidency.Europe, and Germany and France in particular, now has a special duty to protect financialregulation – a regulation that is sensitive to risk, balanced in its treatment of banks and non-banks and binds the entire international community. Generally, that is what we’ve been doing wellsince 2009, and it is what continues to inspire us. Thank you for your attention and I wish you anexcellent conference. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   I. Introduction  My Lord Mayor, Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen. In recent weeks, we have been reminded of fine balances: in decisions, in parliament, in life.  The fine balance between hope and despair.1 Despair at the murder of Jo Cox.  Hope in her remarkable life of service – an inspiration that lives on in her family, friends, colleagues and many admirers.   Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park.  Despair at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower.   Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses.  Hope when we recognise our common humanity. The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment – whatever our differences – to promote the common good.  This includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all. ------------------------------------- Since the prospect of Brexit emerged, financial markets, notably sterling, have marked down the UK’s economic prospects.2   Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU.  But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises.  And it can support households and businesses as they adjust to such profound change.  Indeed, in such exceptional circumstances, the MPC is required to balance any trade-off between the speed with which it returns inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. That is why last summer the Bank announced a series of monetary and macro-financial measures to support the economy during this transition.  This stimulus is working.  Credit is widely available, the cost of borrowing is near record lows, the economy has outperformed expectations, and unemployment has reached a 40 year low.   As spare capacity erodes, the trade-off that the MPC must balance lessens, and all else equal, its tolerance for above-target inflation falls.  Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about                                                                  1 ‘A Fine Balance’ by Rohinton Mistry. 2 The sterling ERI has fallen close to 20% from its November 2015 peak.  Since then, UK-focused equity prices have fallen by over 2%.  In contrast, broader equity price indices such as the FTSE 100 and S&P 500, which more heavily reflect global economic considerations, are almost 20% and 40% higher respectively (in sterling terms).  UK 10-year real government bond yields have fallen 115 basis points;  by contrast 10-year real government bond yields in the US are down by around 25 basis points only.

But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace. From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment.  In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations.   During the negotiating period the economy will be importantly influenced by the expectations of households, firms and financial markets about the nature of both the transition and the longer term economic relationships with the EU and other countries.   Markets have already anticipated some of the adjustment.  Depending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans.  Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.   Whatever happens, monetary policy will be set to return inflation sustainably to target while supporting as best it can the necessary adjustments in the economy. ------------------------------------- I would like to spend the rest of my time on another balance, or rather other imbalances, whose resolution will be an important determinant of our future prosperity. II. The Challenge of Global Imbalances With many concerned that global trade is taking local jobs, protectionist sentiments are once again rising across the advanced world.  Excessive trade and current account imbalances are now politically as well as economically unsustainable.   Perhaps because imbalances ultimately reflect savings and investment choices within a country, they are often described as morality tales with the virtues of Swabian housewives contrasted with the vices of the Anglo Saxon rakes.  In fact, trade imbalances are natural features of an open system and can be warranted by differences in demographics, levels of development and expected paths for income.3                                                                  3 Savings and investment imbalances will shift with changes in relative prices, including changes in prices of final goods and services, changes in nominal exchange rates, changes in relative production costs (including unit labour costs), and changes in the costs of trade.  Lags and frictions will mean that different components will shift at varying speeds.  This, in turn, can result in large adjustment costs not present in economic models, which can make a laissez faire approach risky. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   For example, emerging market economies with young populations and bright prospects should be expected to run large deficits, as Canada did for decades at the turn of the last century.4  In contrast, rapidly ageing countries should run large surpluses, as confirmed by Bank research (Chart 1). 5 Chart 1:  Demographics and current accounts  Sources: April 2017 WEO and UN. Notes:  The countries labelled in the chart are China (CN), Germany (DE), Japan (JP), the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US).  The data point for the 2016 current account for the UK has been adjusted to take account of the likely effect of revisions announced by the ONS, to be incorporated in Blue Book 2017, and erratic movements in trade in non-monetary gold.  The adjustment is based on the average revision in 2011 and 2012 and is applied to the 2016 data published in the 2016 Q4 Balance of Payments release. These are “good imbalances,” and we need global trade and financial systems that encourage and facilitate them. There are also “bad imbalances” caused by domestic distortions (for example, in the financial or social welfare systems that affect savings and investment decisions); global deficiencies (such as inadequate global safety nets which encourage reserve accumulation); or mercantilist and protectionist policies (which manage trade). And that is part of what is occurring today, with Japan, Germany and China running excess surpluses relative to fundamentals; and the US and the UK running excess deficits (Chart 2).  And although the euro-area excess surplus is relatively modest relative to its GDP, in absolute terms it is at least as important as those of Japan or China (Chart 3).6  So while the distortions are few in number, those that exist are large in scale and systemic in importance.                                                                  4 Canadian deficits averaged 8% of GDP in the thirty years before World War I.  ‘Canada in a multi-polar world’, speech by Mark Carney, 16 May 2011, available at http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2011/05/canada-in-a-multi-polar-world. 5 See Lisack, N., Sajedi, R. and Thwaites, G. ‘Demographic trends and the real interest rate’, Bank of England Staff Working Paper forthcoming.  6 Small economies hosting large financial centres like Singapore and Switzerland are special cases for which it is difficult to estimate ‘norms’.

Notes:  The data point for the 2016 current account for the UK has been adjusted;  see notes to Chart 1 for more details. Chart 3:  Excess current account balances   Sources: IMF July 2016 External Sector Report and WEO April 2017.   Notes:  Excess is calculated as the difference between the actual current account balance in 2016 and the mid-point of the range of IMF estimates of the fundamental balances, shown in Chart 2.  The data for the 2016 current account for the UK has been adjusted;  see notes to Chart 1 for more details. Such global imbalances matter for at least three reasons.  First, from the Lawson boom to the Tequila and Global Financial Crises, a common lesson is that large current account deficits are one of the most trenchant early warning signs of financial instability.7  This is                                                                  7 Blanchard, O. and Milesi-Ferretti, G.M. (2011), ‘(Why) Should Current Account Balances Be Reduced?’, IMF Staff Discussion Note, No. 11/03. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   especially true when deficits are accompanied by rapidly growing domestic credit.8  It is dangerous to rely entirely on the discipline of the domestic financial system.  In each case, the eventual large private losses weighed on public balance sheets and growth for years.9   Second, when imbalances reflect unfair competitive advantage – either through managed trade or managed exchange rates – they can lead to protectionist backlashes that leave everyone worse off.  And third, in the current environment of synchronised weakness and limited policy space, it is not hard to imagine this low inflation / low wage / low growth trap being sealed as it was in the 1930s.   In this environment, the UK is running a historically large current account deficit.  On the positive side, the deficit is funded in domestic currency and financial reforms have increased the resilience of the UK system, thereby making larger imbalances more sustainable.  But the UK’s deficit has also been associated with markedly weak investment and latterly with rapid consumer credit growth.  This is not an imbalance that is, as yet, funding its eventual resolution.   Moreover, despite the large depreciation around the referendum, the extent to which the UK’s deficit has moved closer to sustainability remains an open question, one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.   Most fundamentally, the UK relies on the kindness of strangers at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased. III. Potential Solutions The world economy has been here before.  In the 1930s monetary policy was exhausted and fiscal policy was in abeyance.  The trap was sealed by a wave of protectionist measures originating in the US and spreading to Europe.  As current and capital accounts closed, stagnation ensued. What should be done to prevent history from rhyming? In the simple world of the economist, the prescription is straightforward.  Deficit countries should loosen monetary policy and tighten fiscal policy.  Surplus countries should do the reverse.10  If only the G20 would roll up its sleeves, it could easily solve this economic Sudoku.11 But such cures are prescribed in the abstract where policy space is unconstrained – a situation far removed from current realities.                                                                    8 Caballero, J. (2014) ‘Do surges in international capital inflows influence the likelihood of banking crises?’ Economic Journal. 9 For example, the IMF estimate that the output cost in Mexico following the Tequila Crisis of 1994-96 was around 14% (Laeven, L. and Valencia, F. (2012), ‘Systemic banking crises database: an update’, IMF working paper).  For the global financial crisis, the cumulative loss of global output, when compared to its pre-crisis trend, is of the order of 25% of global output, while for the Lawson boom it is close to 10% of UK output. 10 More recently, attention has been paid to the need to maintain appropriate macroprudential policies as well as monetary and fiscal.  See, for example, the IMF policy paper (2011) ‘Macroprudential Policy:  An Organizing Framework’. 11 See speech by Mervyn King at the University of Exeter, 19 January 2010, available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/archive/Documents/historicpubs/speeches/2010/speech419.pdf.

Colleagues at the Bank estimate that secular forces – which include demographics, the lower relative price of capital, higher costs of financial intermediation, and inequality – have reduced global long-term interest rates by around 4 percentage points since the 1980s.12  In addition, cyclical forces since the crisis including high policy uncertainty and hedging of disaster risk are exerting further drags on private investment, not least through reinforcing the option value of waiting.13   Fiscal space is limited in the wake of the financial crisis.  And the space that exists is often unevenly distributed – with the euro area providing the classic example.14  Given the heavy burden on European monetary policy, the still sizable amount of slack in the euro area, low European borrowing costs and aggregate fiscal space, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that if the euro area were a country, fiscal policy would play a greater role in promoting internal and external balance and the world would be better off accordingly. Moreover, as in the 1930s, theoretical remedies are generally falling foul of the real world reluctance of surplus countries to share the adjustment burden.  Unlike deficits, surpluses can be run for a very long time as they are not hostage to changing preferences of investors and are only gradually affected by their domestic impact.15  For these and other reasons, work at the IMF and the Bank suggests that changing the macro policy mix in systemic countries would at best reduce only about one third of their excess imbalances (Chart 4).16  Why not just leave the rest to exchange rates?  This might prove risky not just because exchange rates tend to move slowly then significantly, but also because IMF estimates of the required changes are greater than have occurred in any year since the collapse of Bretton Woods.17                                                                   12 See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), ‘Secular drivers of the global real interest rate’, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571.  13 As Ben Broadbent has noted, as uncertainty rises, the option value of waiting also rises – with a simple model suggesting it can add around 10pp to the hurdle rate that firms need to meet.  See ‘Uncertain times’, speech by Ben Broadbent at the Wall Street Journal, 5 October 2016, available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf. 14 For example, consider the following comparison between the euro area and the UK.  In the euro area, the private sector continues to generate surplus savings of 5% of GDP.  Those must be recycled effectively to generate an expansion. The UK no longer faces that challenge.  Its private sector is in balance.  The euro-area unemployment rate of just over 9% is twice that in the UK.  Gross general government debt in the euro area is roughly the same as in the UK and below the average of advanced economies.  The weighted average yield on 10-year euro-area sovereign debt is similar to that in the UK, at close to 1%.  And yet, the euro area’s fiscal deficit is half that in the UK. Its structural deficit, according to the IMF, is around one third as large.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the euro zone were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive. 15 See Blanchard, O. and Milesi-Ferretti, G.M. (2011), ibid. 16 The macro policies included in the IMF’s analysis are fiscal, credit, foreign exchange reserves, the social safety net (proxied by spending on health) and capital controls.  For Germany, for example, the IMF estimate that only 0.6pp of the assessed 4.8% excess current account surplus is due to an overly tight domestic policy mix relative to other countries and a further 0.8pp is accounted for by the policy mix being too loose elsewhere.  In China, the IMF analysis indicates a tightening of domestic policies is needed, which would increase the current account surplus rather than reduce it.  For more detail, see the IMF’s 2016 External Sector Report, available at https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2016/072716.pdf. 17 See the IMF 2016 External Sector Report, available at https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2016/072716.pdf.

Notes:  The countries labelled in the chart are China (CN), Germany (DE), Japan (JP), the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US).  See the notes to Chart 2 for how excess current account balances are calculated. And since all countries cannot become more competitive at the same time – it is a relative concept – there is no avoiding it: higher global growth will require comprehensive measures to boost productivity and with it, real wages and demand.  This means domestic policies to spur innovation, technology adoption, and the reallocation of resources.   Particularly important will be measures to re-start the stalled ‘diffusion machine’.18  While the most productive companies have continued to innovate, others have become slower at adopting those innovations.  Speeding up the rate of take-up of new inventions and processes – for example through greater product market competition or challenges to management to benchmark against best practice19 – would provide a significant boost to overall productivity growth. And higher growth requires a new approach to trade policy.  Consider that Bank of England research estimates that up to one half of the post-crisis productivity slowdown could be related to the deceleration in global trade growth.20   It will not be enough for the G20 to “resist protectionism.”  The G20 now needs to make “trade work for all.”  That includes using e-commerce platforms to promote free trade for SMEs across the G20,21 and it requires an urgent and critical examination of trade in services.                                                                  18 See https://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/OECD-2015-The-future-of-productivity-book.pdf. 19 See the report written by the Productivity Leadership Group, chaired by Sir Charlie Mayfield, (2016), ‘How good is your business really?

IV. Levelling Down or Up: Managed Trade or Free Trade in Services?  One cause of global imbalances is the uneven playing field between trade in goods and services, with barriers to services trade currently up to three times higher.22  Most of the world’s major surplus countries, like Germany and China, are net exporters of goods and benefit from this asymmetry.  Conversely countries with a comparative advantage in services, like the US and UK, are more likely to run current account deficits (Charts 5 and 6).   Chart 5:  Correlation between current account balances and comparative advantage in services  Sources:  Barattieri, A. (2014), ‘Comparative advantage, service trade, and global imbalances’, Journal of International Economics, Vol. 92, Issue 1, UNCTAD and WEO April 2017. Notes:  The chart shows average current accounts for the 57 largest economies over the decade 2006-2015 against each country’s share of services in total exports (the higher this share the more comparative advantage in services that country has).                                                                  22 Miroudot, S., Sauvage, J. and Shepherd, B.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   Chart 6:  Goods and services components of current account balances  Source:  WEO April 2017. Notes:  Averages for 2011-2015. The G20 faces a choice – between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up by liberalising trade in services. Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if barriers are removed.  For example, in Canada – one of the few countries to track trade flows within its borders – services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada’s international exports.  If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other countries then services exports would triple.  Reducing restrictions on services trade to the same extent as those on goods have been over the past couple of decades could reduce the excess deficits of the US by one third and the UK by one half.23 Services liberalisation is also a more efficient form of rebalancing because services industries tend to have higher domestic value added, and jobs, than manufactured goods.  The lower import content of services compared with goods means smaller changes are needed to address current account imbalances.24  For example, a £10 billion increase in UK financial services exports would reduce the UK’s trade deficit by £9 billion, whereas the same increase in exports of autos would contribute £5½ billion. Of course, liberalising services is not straightforward, as barriers are typically not tariffs but ‘behind the border’ differences in regulatory standards and trading conditions.  This is where global standards and regulatory cooperation should help.                                                                    23 Roughly equal to 15%.  These calculations are based on the estimated effects of reducing services trade restrictions on services exports reported in Nordås, H.K. and Rouzet, D (2016), ‘The impact of services trade restrictiveness on trade flows’, The World Economy, and the estimated mapping between services trade restrictions and services trade costs reported in Miroudot, S. and Shepherd, B (2016) ibid.  24 In sterling terms.  In percentage terms, the changes are larger for services reflecting the fact that they start from a smaller base. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   Arguably the greatest possibilities are in financial services given the major progress in financial reform.  Indeed, financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  And with Brexit, we have the coincidence of necessity and opportunity. Since the crisis the G20 has agreed a series of new international minimum standards to secure the resilience of the banking sector, transform shadow-banking into resilient market-based finance, make derivatives markets safer and end too-big-to fail.  Implementation is now being regularly assessed and transparently reported by the FSB and IMF.  The playing field for cross-border activities is being levelled.   At the same time, supervisory cooperation has intensified.  Information is now readily shared through supervisory colleges.  And regular crisis management groups for systemic firms are building confidence in how authorities will behave when things go wrong. In short, platforms are being created for deference to each other’s approaches when they achieve similar outcomes.  With robust standards consistently applied, wholesale financial services could be brought more fully into bilateral trade agreements, keeping the global financial system open and resilient, and supporting greater trade, investment and innovation. Let me use a specific example of CCPs in London – although my points apply more generally and reciprocally to all critical cross-border financial market infrastructure in the UK and Europe.   Prior to the crisis, derivative transactions created a complex, opaque – and dangerous – web of exposures that helped turn a shock into a panic.   With the G20’s encouragement, CCPs are now helping to untangle this web and build resilience.  Moreover, by netting exposures across counterparties, currencies and products; CCPs are supporting more liquid markets and are lowering costs to end users.  That means more resilient financing and better risk management for business and households. The UK houses some of the world’s largest CCPs.  For example, LCH in London clears swaps in 18 currencies for firms in 55 jurisdictions, handling over 90% of cleared interest rate swaps globally and 98% of all cleared swaps in euros.  All currencies, products and counterparties benefit from the resulting economies of scale and scope. Fragmentation of such global markets by jurisdiction or currency would reduce the benefits of central clearing.  EU27 firms account for only a quarter of global activity in cleared euro interest rate swaps, and about 14% of total interest rate swaps in all currencies cleared by LCH.  Any development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   The potential for higher costs is not theoretical.  In Japan, for example, where the clearing of yen-denominated swaps by certain Japanese firms must take place onshore, the difference in price between the onshore and offshore markets has generally been in the range of 1-3 basis points. Such seemingly small price differences translate into significant costs for users given the scale of activity in these markets.  Industry estimates suggest that a single basis point increase in the cost resulting from splitting clearing of interest rate swaps could cost EU firms €22bn per year across all of their business.  Those costs would ultimately be passed on to European households and businesses. Moreover if the large stock of existing trades of EU firms – tens of trillions of euros in size – was trapped at a CCP which was no longer recognised by the European Commission, those EU firms would face capital charges as much as ten times higher than today unless and until they could move them.25   Fragmenting liquidity would drive up costs somewhat in the remaining market as well.  On current volumes, almost 90% of swaps are traded by non-EU firms and could remain in the main UK-based liquidity pool.  Given the size of this market, the impacts could be expected to be much smaller, although not insignificant. Fragmentation is in no one’s economic interest.  Nor is it necessary for financial stability.  Indeed it can damage it.  Fragmenting clearing would lead to smaller liquidity pools in CCPs, reducing the ability to diversify risks and diminishing resilience.  And higher costs would reduce the incentives to hedge risks, increasing the amount of risk that the real economy would have to bear. The Bank of England fully recognises European concerns.  I know because I shared similar ones as Governor of the Bank of Canada.  These were addressed then through common standards and cooperative supervisory oversight, allowing C$ clearing to move to a more efficient and resilient hub in London.  The Bank of England also must concern itself with the resilience of CCPs in other European and non-European jurisdictions that are used by firms that we supervise.  These CCPs must be subject to robust regulatory standards and deep reciprocal supervisory cooperation.   To address such issues, we can and should build on current models to develop a new form of regulatory and supervisory cooperation.   The European Commission’s proposals announced last week recognise the importance of effective cooperation arrangements between the relevant EU authorities and their overseas counterparts.  They include potential provisions for deference to the rules to which a CCP is subject in its home jurisdiction in line with the intent of the G20.26   The Bank welcomes this.  The Commission’s proposals, driven in part by Brexit, address an increasingly important and more general issue in the regulation of the international financial system.                                                                  25 Requiring up to another €5bn of capital. 26 See, for example, the G20 Leaders’ communique, Brisbane Summit, 16 November 2014, available at http://www.g20australia.org/official_resources/g20_leaders_communique_brisbane_summit_november_2014.html. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   Elements of these proposals could therefore provide a foundation on which to build robust cross-border arrangements for the supervision of CCPs.  This should be based on deep cooperation between jurisdictions and authorities who defer to each other’s regimes where they meet international standards and deliver similar outcomes.   Coming to an innovative, cooperative and reciprocal agreement on central clearing would promote competitive financing in the euro area and maintain the resilience of the UK and global financial systems.   More fundamentally, it would be an early milestone in the broader rebalancing of the UK, European and global economies.  And it would produce far superior outcomes to other elements of the Commission’s proposals, which would fragment global clearing activity and raise costs and risks. V. Conclusion  My Lord Mayor, this building, with all its majesty and history and this topic, central clearing of derivatives; could not appear farther from the concerns of people in this country. But they are much more closely related than they appear.   A decade of radical financial reform was not an end in itself, but rather a means to serve households and businesses better.  We must ensure that the real economy reaps its full benefits, including through freer trade in services and more resilient financing of the investment needed to boost wages of workers in all industries across the UK. One million people across this country work in financial services.  The industry contributes 7% of output and pays taxes that cover almost two thirds of the cost of the NHS.  At a time when the UK is running a 5% current account deficit, financial services runs a 1.5% trade surplus with Europe alone.  The entire service sector runs a 5% surplus with the world and employs 85% of UK workers. We could take these realities for granted.  And it would be all too easy to give into protectionism.  But as we learned in the 1930s, that road leads neither to equity nor prosperity.  Raising barriers to trade disproportionately hurts the least well off through higher prices and fewer opportunities.27                                                                    27 Fajgelbaum, P.D. and Khandelwal, A.K. (2016), ‘Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade’, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 131, Issue 3, shows that past episodes of trade liberalisation have disproportionately benefited poor households, in every country, through reductions in consumer prices and increases in product variety.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   Escaping the low inflation / low wage / low growth trap requires more than a textbook rebalancing of macro policies across the major regions.  It demands comprehensive structural reforms and a new approach to trade policy.  Such changes could more than make up for the dramatic fall in the real incomes that UK households have experienced in the decade since the crisis.28 The Brexit negotiations will be the test.  May the hundreds in this room pass it by working towards innovative, cooperative and responsible solutions to the benefit of the tens of millions outside.                                                                   28 As my colleague Andy Haldane noted in his speech ‘Productivity Puzzles’(available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2017/speech968.pdf), if productivity growth in the second, third and fourth quartiles of the distribution of UK firms’ productivity could be boosted to match the productivity of the quartile above, then arithmetically that would deliver a boost to aggregate UK productivity of around 13%.  In the longer run, that increase in productivity would be expected to flow through fully into real wages.  By contrast, the peak to trough fall in real wages following the crisis was in the region of 10%. 
 III Standing Committee on Foreign and European Community Affairs and XIV Standing Committee on EU Policies                 Brexit: the possible economic and financial effects   Testimony of Luigi Federico Signorini, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy                                   Chamber of Deputies Rome, 26 April 2017 
 
 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of Parliament,   I would like to thank the Committees for inviting the Bank of Italy to comment on the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. I will begin with a brief description of some well-known institutional aspects and then make some comments on the possible economic (for the United Kingdom, Europe and Italy) and financial repercussions. At this point in time, my observations can only be preliminary ones.   Institutional aspects: negotiations, exit and future relationships   Following the agreements reached in Lisbon in 2007, an article was added to the Treaty on the European Union – the constitutional basis of the EU – which  explicitly provides for the possibility that a member state might wish to withdraw, and regulates the relative procedure. This is Article 50, now well-known after being invoked for the first time by the UK on 29 March in Prime Minister May’s letter to the President of the European Council.  Article 50 envisages four phases. The first one, already completed, requires the outgoing member state to notify the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union. The other steps are as follows: the Commission is given a mandate to negotiate the withdrawal agreement according to the guidelines unanimously established by the Council; the Commission conducts the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement; and both parties approve the agreement. The United Kingdom will not participate in the Council’s decisions; aside from that, it will retain meanwhile all the rights and obligations arising from its EU membership.  Given the geographical proximity, the long, shared history and the deep-seated economic integration of the UK with the rest of Europe, there is a great deal of discussion on both sides as to how the withdrawal will take place and what relations will be established afterwards, with comparisons made between hard and soft Brexits, concepts that have yet to be clearly defined.  In principle there are two separate but related negotiations. One concerns the exit agreement as such, to which the procedure of Article 50 refers. It should cover issues such as the position of people and firms that live and work in the EU, thanks to the current freedom of movement, but will find themselves on the other side of what will again become an international border in all respects in 2019: this applies to British citizens in Europe and to European ones in the UK. This agreement   might   establish  transitional   rules  and  temporary  or  permanent,  conditional  or 
4  unconditional, recognition of status, on people’s right to stay where they are and continue with their current activities. Another important issue, which will presumably be covered by the withdrawal agreement, is the UK’s financial obligations towards the EU as a member state.  The other negotiation concerns relations between the two parties after the withdrawal, including any trade agreements. Although the two negotiations are linked conceptually and certainly politically, they could in theory have different outcomes. For example, an agreement may be reached on the exit but not on subsequent relationships; in any case, the agreement on the new relationships will only be formally stipulated at a later date.  It is also not inconceivable that the negotiations are a complete failure, which would lead to the hardest of hard Brexits (except in the case of an extension of the two-year deadline, which the Treaty allows if decided unanimously). Both sides have indicated their wish to avoid a traumatic conclusion and to reach an agreement, as called for in a recent speech by Barnier, the European Commission’s chief negotiator; it is to be hoped that they hold to this intention so as not to cause serious and avoidable personal and economic problems.  As far as post-Brexit trade relations between the UK and the EU are concerned, in theory there are four possibilities.  1. Accession to the European Economic Area (EEA) to which Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway belong, as well as EU member states. Membership of the EEA ensures full participation in the European Single Market for non-EU states and entails accepting the ‘four freedoms’ (the free movement of people, goods, services and capital), with the same rights and obligations as EU member states, including a financial contribution. However, though non-EU states must apply the rules for participating in the single market, they do not decide them within EU institutions, such as the Commission, the Parliament and the Council.1  2. Participation in a customs union with the European Union, as in the case of Turkey. This union provides for the free movement of goods, the obligation to implement the relevant European regulations and  a waiver on deciding own  customs duties and  on  the possibility of reaching independent trade agreements. 3. A free trade agreement.2     1 Switzerland, which is a member state of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, is not a member of the EEA, but over time it has stipulated over one hundred bilateral agreements with the European Union (including the free movement of goods and people, but not of services and capital) and is required to implement the relative European regulations. 2 Depending on the scope of the agreement, ratification by all EU member states could be required. 
5  4. If no agreement were reached, trade relations would be governed by World Trade Organization regulations. In this case, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause would apply, which prohibits any form of discrimination: each state undertakes to extend to every other state the same treatment granted to all countries with which there are no specific bilateral trade agreements.  In practice, however, neither membership of the EEA nor of a customs union seem realistic options. The former would impose the free movement of people and the obligation to implement the ‘acquis communautaire’, both of which the UK wants to abolish; the latter, as well as laying down certain regulatory restrictions, would greatly curb the UK’s freedom to decide independently on its trade relations with other countries. The UK government’s notification of withdrawal makes a general reference to a ‘deep and special partnership’ with the EU, but effectively appears to exclude staying in the single market.  The most likely scenario – if there is no change of heart – is that the UK will become a real ‘third country’ for the EU. Under this hypothesis, the question is whether it is possible to reach at least a free trade agreement, which would benefit the common interest; the notification letter expresses a desire for it to be ‘bold and ambitious’. At this stage, the nature, timeframe and contents of any future agreement cannot be predicted. Negotiations are yet to begin; the UK government’s stance will also depend on the outcome of the recently announced general election. We may imagine that the main topics of negotiation will be the trade of goods and, above all, financial services.  There are free trade agreements with nearly one hundred advanced and emerging countries, including Switzerland, Canada and South Korea. The agreement recently concluded with Canada is particularly interesting since, as well as eliminating customs duties, it makes access to public tenders and investments easier and facilitates trade in services.  If, or for as long as, there is no agreement, the trade relations between the EU and the UK will be governed by WTO regulations, unless there are specific transitional agreements, and the MFN clause will be applied. 
6  The economic impact   United Kingdom – In the short term, the negative effects on the UK’s economy that many expected immediately after the referendum failed to materialize. GDP growth actually increased in the second half of 2016, rising from 1.6 to 2.4 per cent on an annual basis, and employment continued to rise. Much depended on the strongly expansionary measures introduced by the Bank of England in August and on a more accommodative fiscal policy stance.  On 3 August 2016 the Bank of England cut its Bank Rate by 25 basis points; resumed the purchase of UK government bonds; and launched new schemes for corporate bond purchase and for extending loans to commercial banks. The HM Treasury put a brake on the fiscal consolidation process.  Analysts have progressively revised growth forecasts upwards for 2017, but continue to expect a slowdown over the year. According to the most recent consensus estimates, growth in the UK’s GDP is expected to average 1.7 per cent over the year, slightly below that of 2016.  The most significant effects of the referendum have been on the sterling exchange rate, which has depreciated by about 10 per cent since 23 June, both against the euro and in nominal effective terms (that is, against all the other main currencies, weighted according to their trade with the UK); inflation rose by nearly 2 percentage points, to 2.3 per cent in March. The severe tensions besetting international financial markets around the time of the referendum dissipated quickly (Table 1). The economic policy uncertainty index rose in late June and early July, but then returned to pre-referendum levels (Figure 1).  It cannot be ruled out that any tensions arising from negotiations with the EU may trigger new bouts of financial volatility over the next few years, especially if they coincide with renewed concerns on the markets as to the cohesion of the Union.  What may happen in the long term remains uncertain. Openness to trade, immigration, and foreign investment generally promote growth, while a decrease in these factors, especially if it occurs in a climate of increasing protectionism at global level, could create significant costs for the UK economy in terms of innovative capacity, competitiveness, and productivity growth. This would also occur in the EU market, though on a more limited scale and would vary from country to country, depending on their links with the UK. The UK market is quite a small one for the EU, accounting for 7.1 per cent of total exports; in contrast, the EU is the destination for 44 per cent of UK goods.  According to our studies, if the UK and the EU imposed reciprocal trade tariffs, the long-term economic cost to the British economy would be significant, particularly if productivity growth diminished at the same time; the repercussions for the euro area would instead be small. 
7  Brexit is expected to have an impact on the EU’s budget, to which the UK makes a positive contribution. From 2010 to 2015, even taking into account the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 and the rebate received by the UK for its partial participation in justice and home affairs policies, the country contributed over €13 billion a year on average while receiving less than €7 billion. Moreover, the EU will no longer receive the customs duty collected in the UK; instead it will collect the duty levied on British exports to the EU. The overall effect is still difficult to assess.  Discussions are still under way about the UK’s financial obligations to the EU when it leaves (the Brexit bill). Calculating the amount is a complex and controversial matter. One question is how the UK’s share of the EU total should be calculated (it amounts to about 15 per cent of gross national income but 12 per cent in terms of contribution to the budget after rebates) and what asset and liability items should be included. This will probably be one of the most delicate issues faced during the exit negotiations.  Italy – Unfavourable economic developments in the UK would in any case not have any major repercussions for Italy in the short term. The slowdown that the Bank of England has forecast for 2018-20 would have a negligible impact. Even if the UK experienced such a deep recession as to reduce imports by 10 per cent over a three-year period, we estimate that the effect on Italy’s GDP would be at most 0.25 percentage points.3  Italy’s trade and financial ties with the UK are not as  close as those of other major euro-area countries (Table 2).  In 2015 Italian exports to the UK amounted to 1.8 per cent of GDP, against 2.7 for France, 3.2 for Spain and 3.7 for Germany. Imports amounted to 1.1 per cent of GDP, again less than for the other countries. Italy mainly exports machinery and mechanical engineering products, agri-food products, transport equipment, clothing and footwear, and tourism services. The bilateral balance on goods is very positive for Italy, while the balance on services is generally even.  Italy’s financial ties with the UK are not as close as those of the other main European countries, as regards both portfolio investment and direct investment.  In June 2016, Italian residents’ portfolios included €60.8 billion worth of UK-issued securities (that is, 3.7 per cent of GDP, compared with France’s 10.1 and Germany’s 5.9). Italian investors have limited exposure to exchange rate risk between the euro and sterling, with securities denominated in sterling accounting for little more than 1.1 per cent of the total. At the end of 2015 Italian direct investment in the UK stood at 1.4 per cent of GDP, compared with significantly higher percentages for the other leading euro- area countries. UK investment in Italy amounted to 2.2 per cent of Italian GDP.  If negotiations for a free trade deal between the EU and the UK are unsuccessful, trade between the two will become subject to customs duties. To have an idea of the  potential economic impact for both sides let us assume that the UK applies the current EU tariffs at least until it has put its own tariff system in place; in other words, the trade tariffs that the EU  3 Economic Bulletin 3/2016. 
8  currently applies outside the area will apply between the area and the UK. On this basis, and considering only the impact effect (i.e. excluding any reallocation of trade flows), customs duty on goods exported by the 27-member EU to the UK would total about €16 billion and the duty on British goods exported to the EU-27 over €6 billion. Customs duty would on average represent a higher proportion of the value of goods (5.2 per cent) for exports from the EU-27 to the UK than the other way round (3.9 per cent) because of the different sectoral composition.  In fact, tariffs differ considerably across goods categories. Close to one fifth of the value of EU- 27 exports to the UK relates to motor vehicles, which carry very high duty.  Moreover, as the structure of exports differs across EU-27 member countries, the average incidence of the tariff applied to exports to the UK would also differ. In the case of Germany, the tariff would be similar to the EU-27 average; for France and Italy it would be slightly less; Ireland, Spain and Poland would be faced with average duties in excess of 6 per cent.  If the existing European tariffs were applied to Italy’s exports to the UK, in the case of machinery and mechanical engineering products, a sector that accounts for 20 per cent of Italian exports to the UK, the effect would be small (about 2 per cent of the value). The difference would be greater in the case of agri-food products (almost 10 per cent), clothing and footwear (8.2 per cent), and above all motor vehicles, even though the sector accounts for a much smaller share of exports to the UK (12 per cent) than in other countries (Germany 33 per cent, Spain 32 and Belgium 26).  Even with a free trade agreement, the UK would have to pay the administrative costs associated with the ‘rules of origin’, i.e. certification that goods being exported to the EU-27 (and many of the inputs needed to manufacture them) do not come from countries subject to EU customs duty. Differences in regulations and other non-tariff measures could further increase the cost of trade. 
9  Financial regulation, banks and market infrastructure  Financial regulation – One of the biggest unknowns of Brexit is what shape future financial relations will take, starting with the regulatory aspect.  As an EU member state, the UK is part of the single market in financial services in which the single passport applies. Thus, a bank authorized in one member state can operate in any other member state (by establishing branches or through the free provision of services) under a system of notification and without the need for authorization. Prudential controls are conducted by the authorities of the home member state; the host state is responsible for anti-money-laundering and consumer protection.  With Brexit the single passport will be withdrawn. British banks will be treated like third- country banks: they will need to obtain a licence in all the member states where they wish to operate and will become subject to supervision by their host country.  UK-based banks and economic policymakers and financial regulators view the possibility of losing the single passport with trepidation, fearing that the City will lose part of its role as a financial centre for Europe and the world. At present, many non-EU banks (especially American and Asian ones) have their European legal and operational headquarters in the City, thus gaining access to the European financial market as well as to plentiful professional expertise and specialist services.  When it leaves the EU the UK’s supervisory framework will, by definition, be ‘equivalent’ because – partly in consideration of the commitments set out in Prime Minister May’s letter of notification – European regulations will initially be incorporated en bloc in the UK’s internal regulations. Any changes made subsequently will have to be examined to ensure that equivalence is maintained.  Supervisory ‘equivalence’, as defined in the EU’s financial legislation, gives some benefits to third countries. Most of these are exemptions from specific requirements, but in the case of investment services (MIFID/MIFIR2) and alternative investment funds (AIFMD) the legislation effectively gives equivalent third-country financial intermediaries a single passport of sorts in all EU member states, though only with respect to their professional clientele. Ensuring that domestic financial legislation stays aligned with that of Europe would make it easier for UK banks to set up a presence in countries, like Italy, that only grant authorization after verifying the standard of home country supervision.  Under a proposal of the European Commission included in the Review of the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation, in the future, third-country banks that are of systemic importance in the area would have to set up an intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) in Europe. The IPU and its subsidiaries in the EU would be subject to consolidated supervision and crisis management under European rules. Hence, the major UK banking groups – many of which are spin-offs of international groups – would presumably be required to set up an IPU. 
10  The UK will certainly try to reach agreements with the EU-27 that allow it to keep some of the benefits that London banks enjoy in terms of access to the European market. It is impossible to predict what these agreements will be or how they will affect London’s competitive advantage.  Brexit also means that the European Banking Authority (EBA) headquartered in London will have to find a new home.  The decision, which will be taken in the coming months, is connected to an on-going debate on possible changes to the architecture of European system of financial supervision. The Commission has launched a public consultation prior to introducing new legislation. The present model is a sectoral one: the EBA is responsible for the banking sector, the EIOPA (headquartered in Frankfurt) for the insurance and pension fund industry, and the ESMA (based in Paris) for securities and markets. One of the options considered (with some variations) would reduce the number of authorities to two: one for banks and insurance and the other for markets and securities.  The debate is further complicated by the fact that the competencies transferred to the European level differ across sectors and activities (for example, more competencies are transferred for regulation than for supervision, except in the case of the banking industry where the application of the Single Supervisory Mechanism to the euro area alone has created a further difficulty).  Banks – As far as Italy’s banking system is concerned, the importance of UK-based banks is limited. The 16 banks with branches in Italy account for 0.6 per cent of lending to customers. The majority of them (11 of the 16) belong to third-country groups that have established their European headquarters in London. They only have a significant role in some specific segments (advisory on extraordinary financing and placements, syndicated loans, and guarantees) relating to large corporations. Some international banks may move part of their activities from London to another European country, via either new or existing subsidiaries. The effect on Italian banking will probably be minimal.  Moreover, there are about 80 UK banks operating in Italy without a branch, through the free provision of services. They could continue to do so, failing any specific agreements, only if they set up a subsidiary in an EU member state. The scope of their activity in Italy is also limited.  There are very few Italian banks in the UK. The leading Italian banking groups jointly have six branches in London, mainly involved in trading and investment banking; they use the City to access the international wholesale funding market, though on a smaller scale than before the financial crisis. If they decided to move the management of these activities after Brexit, the cost is unlikely to be very high.  The Italian banks have limited exposure to UK residents: at the end of 2016 it was just under €34 billion (1.3 per cent of the Italian banking system’s total exposure), three quarters of which consisting of loans to other banks and financial corporations.   Market infrastructure – Since 2007 Borsa Italiana Group has been controlled by London Stock  Exchange  Group  (LSEG),  which  owns  two  important  financial  market  management 
11  companies (MTS and EuroTLX), the Italian central counterparty (Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia) and the central securities depository (Monte Titoli). In March of this year the interbank deposit market management company (e-MID) also came under the control of an English group.  LSEG and Deutsche Börse had already planned a merger in 2016. The European Commission, however, recently announced that it had blocked the plan, which in its opinion would have created a virtual monopoly of the clearing market for fixed-income instruments: in fact the new group would have included the four central counterparties with the largest volume of business in this segment. Competition in clearing for equity derivatives would also have been significantly reduced.  Even if they are controlled by a foreign entity, the trading and post-trading management companies remain fully responsible for all operating processes. They are supervised at the domestic level by the Bank of Italy and Consob. Indeed, unlike banks, markets and market infrastructure are supervised at the solo level, rather than on a consolidated basis.  Controlling shareholders can be located outside the EU provided they meet the requirements of integrity and capital adequacy.  When the UK leaves the EU, the Bank of Italy and Consob will need to have closer contacts with controlling shareholders. When some of the cooperation mechanisms envisaged by European legislation are no longer in place, the Italian authorities will have to step up their efforts in the sphere of cross- border supervisory cooperation, as well as increase their bilateral cooperation with the UK supervisory authorities.  At European level, Brexit raises a matter of some importance regarding the supervision of central counterparties, since euro-denominated financial instruments, especially derivatives, are mostly cleared by UK-based entities.4 We will need to make sure that supervision of UK central counterparties does not fall below the level set by European regulations for the main stability profiles: prudential supervision, currency of cleared contracts, and market control.  ESMA proposed a review of EMIR to strengthen the process of recognizing the third-country CCPs and provide forms of direct supervision by the European authorities. In the weeks to come, the Commission will publish its proposed review of EMIR; the prospect of the UK’s exit requires this aspect to be carefully considered as well.   * * *   Prime Minister May’s letter triggered for the first time the process by which a Member State can leave the Union. Difficult negotiations will now begin, although they will not be lengthy since the Treaty imposes strict time limits, given the technical complexity and political sensitivity of many of the issues. Both sides will require foresight and good will.   4 For example, in the case of interest rate swaps, 50 per cent of global trades and 90 per cent of standardized swaps (i.e. which have to be cleared through a central counterparty) are cleared by the London-based LCH Group Ltd. and a very large share is denominated in euros. 
12  To the surprise of many analysts, there were no immediate adverse effects of the UK’s decision to exit on confidence, investment or the economic outlook. There was a significant but orderly devaluation of sterling.  There is no reason to expect any serious direct and immediate repercussions on the Italian economy and banking system.  Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that difficult negotiations, especially if they interact with the increasing global and European political and institutional uncertainty, could at a certain point trigger further market turbulence. It is unlikely that Italy would be immune. For us, the only way to prepare is to reinforce internal stability, to deal with any fragilities perceived by the markets, and to pursue the path of reform.  What will happen in the long run is as yet difficult to foresee. History teaches us that international openness is, at the end of the day, a powerful driver of economic growth. An economist may find it hard to believe that a country’s prosperity can be furthered by creating barriers to the free movement of goods, capital and people. Naturally, a great deal will depend on future trade and financial agreements and on global developments. In any case, this is more of a risk for the United Kingdom than for the rest of Europe or the world.  Allow me to close by saying that, personally, I will miss my British colleagues in the European institutions that I participate in: not only because of their skill and level of preparation, which have always been admirable, but I will also miss their pragmatism, dislike of red tape and openness to the market, which has generally characterized their approach. I can only hope that 40 years of working together has allowed us all to learn from each other’s best qualities.

Vítor Constâncio: Challenges faced by the European bankingsectorSpeech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Risk &Supervision 2017 Conference, organised by the Italian Banking Association (AssociazioneBancaria Italiana), Rome, 14 June 2017.*   *   *Let me start by thanking the Italian Banking Association for inviting me to participate in thisimportant event.Euro area banks have faced a number of headwinds since the financial crisis. As a result, euroarea banks have raised significant amounts of capital which have led to a substantialstrengthening of solvency ratios: average common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) increased from7% in 2007 to 14% at present. The solvency position of European banks is thus robust. Thelingering concerns about their condition relate primarily to their low profitability, an issue that hasalready lasted several years.The subdued profitability is reflected in depressed bank valuations. Despite a broad-basedimprovement in bank valuations in recent quarters, a wide dispersion persists between euro areaand U.S. banks’ valuations. While euro area banks’ price-to-book ratios have recovered from thelows of mid-2016, the gap between euro area and U.S. banks’ valuations remains significant,with an average price-to-book ratio of 0.77 against 1.26 for U.S. listed banks.The large cross-sectional variation of price-to-book ratios within the euro area partly reflectscyclical factors, as the pace of economic recovery varies across countries, but possibly alsodifferences in the progress made by institutions in tackling structural challenges. To give you anidea, average price-to-book-value is 0.94 for Spain, 0.75 for Italy, 0.76 for France and 0.42 forGermany.In the euro area, listed banks aggregate return on equity (ROE) stood below 3% in 2016, a slightdecline from the previous year. In international comparison, euro area banks’ financialperformance continues to lag behind that of most of their global peers: in 2016, U.S. averageROE stood at 8% with Nordic banks above 9%, led by Swedish banks with 12% ROE, a notableperformance in a country where key official interest rates are negative and much lower than inthe euro area. Regarding cross-country differences, listed Italian and German banks recordednegative average ROE in 2016 which, in the case of Italy was due to sharp increases in loanimpairment charges at some banks, mainly linked with increased efforts to clean up their balancesheets. In other large euro area countries, French and Spanish listed banks recorded a ROE of5% and 7%, respectively.The continued weakness in bank profitability reflects a number of cyclical and structural factors.A key cyclical challenge is linked to the difficulties in increasing revenues in a low nominal growthand low interest rate environment and a relatively flat yield curve. As a matter of fact, net interestincome declined somewhat in 2016, as the compression of margins was only partly offset byincreased credit growth albeit still at moderate levels.While profitability headwinds stemming from cyclical factors should abate as the economicrecovery progresses, structural challenges remain and need to be tackled. These include thelarge stock of non-performing loans (NPLs), a legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, cost inefficiencyand excess capacity. Let me address each of these factors in turn.A large stock of legacy NPL in some euro area countries continues to dampen profitabilityprospects. The average NPL ratio for euro area banks at just above 2% in 2007, reached 8% in 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
2013 and stands now at 6%. For the six “high-NPL” national banking sectors, the averages wenthowever from 5% in 2007 to 23% last year. Elevated loan impairment costs remain an importantdriver of low profitability in “high-NPL” countries. Indeed, following the capital and provisionincreases since the financial crisis, the NPL issue does not primarily concern solvency but ratherbanks’ profitability. The coverage of NPLs by provisions and collateral is, on average, 82% in theeuro area and 80% in Italy. Net NPLs are therefore reassuring, from a solvency perspective.Profitability however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight ofgross exposures in total assets. The share of total assets that generates lower revenues than fullperforming loans is a considerable European problem: gross NPLs represent 4% of total assetsof euro area banks against only 0.8 % for U.S. banks. The figure for Italy however stands at 11%,thereby with an unavoidable significant impact on profitability, despite the visible reduction in theNPL ratio for the system since the peak in 2013. Naturally, high NPLs also tie up capital, erodefunding, as well as operational capacity, thereby constraining banks’ ability to support theeconomic recovery. Despite a visible reduction in system-wide NPL ratio in Italy, progress inreducing stocks of high NPLs to manageable levels remains insufficient.Amid continued difficulties in boosting revenues, remaining cost-inefficiencies also weigh onbanks’ profitability. On aggregate, euro area banks’ cost-efficiency has deteriorated somewhatsince 2010, based on both a cost-to-income and a cost-to-assets basis and comparesunfavourably with some international peers, most notably the Nordic countries.Against this background, for many euro area banks, a return to sustainable profitability isincreasingly dependent on improvements in operational efficiency. A cross-country comparisonsuggests that the relative importance of physical versus digital distribution channels may be oneof the differentiating factors across countries in terms of cost efficiency, as illustrated by thepositive correlation between branch network reduction since the late 90s and the usage ofinternet banking in EU countries.Structural challenges to profitability in some banking sectors are also linked to industry structureand excess capacity. In addition to banks’ efforts to improve operational efficiency via cost-cutting, consolidation could bring some profitability benefits at the sector level. These could beparticularly relevant in countries where banking systems remain fragmented and arecharacterised by low market concentration and high cost-to-income ratios. Ideally, consolidationshould go hand-in-hand with greater geographical diversification. This would allow banks toachieve economies of scope and scale from cross-border mergers and acquisitions, therebyalso contributing to greater macroeconomic risk-sharing by diversifying country risks.The way forwardLooking forward, there are several ways of estimating what could be “realistic”, longer-term ROEtargets for banks. In terms of historical comparison, we need to bear in mind that high leverageobserved in pre-crisis years can flatter measured profitability. Therefore, an upper boundestimate for ROE targets could be derived by multiplying pre-crisis return on assets (ROA) ratiosby the current, structurally lower leverage multiples. From another perspective, the long-termaverage of banks’ estimated cost of equity (i.e. the rate of return investors expect from aninvestment in bank equity) is a useful benchmark. In addition, survey-based information on banks’own estimates of long-term sustainable ROE can complement approximations of what could besustainable levels of profitability. Combining estimates from these different approaches, wearrive at a target range of 8-10% ROE for euro area banks.Should we expect banks’ profitability to reach their “sustainable” targets over the next 3-5 years?Even in a benign scenario of a robust economic recovery, this may not necessarily be the case.For instance, in its latest Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF argues that even in a cyclicalupturn, many euro area banks may not be able to raise their profitability to a sufficient degree.12 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Against this backdrop of cyclical and structural challenges to banks’ profitability, possiblesolutions include: (i) revenue growth; (ii) cost efficiency improvements; (iii) consolidation throughmergers and acquisitions; and (iv) NPL resolution.The first avenue that banks may want to explore is to revisit their revenue growth strategies,particularly in the field of fees and commissions that still show relatively low levels in internationalcomparisons.Adjustments to the business model could also include actively targeting a change in the productmix, seeking adjustments to the funding structure or increasing the geographic diversification ofactivities.These discussed strategies have limitations, as they require capital, entail risks or on account ofcompetitive pressures. From a financial stability perspective, one should also be mindful of thepossible impact of revenue diversification on bank performance and riskiness.As highlighted earlier, many euro area banks continue to operate with relatively high cost levels,which constitute a drag on efficiency and hamper the sector’s ability to generate sufficient netincome. Improving cost efficiency is therefore another strategy some banks should pursue inorder to return to more sustainable levels of profitability.Cost reductions and efficiency improvements can be achieved in a variety of ways, ranging frommore traditional measures such as downsizing, branch closures to the adoption of new, cost-saving technologies aiming at digitalising financial intermediation services such as increasing thereliance on internet-based banking. There is significant room to improve cost efficiency amongeuro area banks considering that the ratio of costs to total assets is, on average, 1.4% for euroarea banks, and just half of that, 0.7%, for Swedish banks.Apart from potentially reducing costs, a higher reliance on digitalised forms of financial servicesmay also result in more contestable bank retail markets, as it becomes easier for bankcustomers to “shop around” and compare bank products and prices. This, in turn, may have apositive impact on the sector’s overall efficiency.It should be acknowledged though that cutting costs is easier said than done. It may entailsubstantial upfront investments and costs (e.g. new IT systems, compensation for staffreductions), may be hampered by country-specific legal and institutional settings and may besurrounded by non-negligible execution risks. The more capital-constrained banks especiallymay therefore face difficulties undertaking radical cost reduction schemes.Another avenue towards improving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies is through bankingsector consolidation via mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Well-managed M&As can deliverimportant cost synergies (e.g. lower administrative expenses, branch rationalisation) as well asrevenue synergies (e.g. lower funding costs of the merged unit) that might contribute toimproving the banking sector’s profitability prospects.M&A activity has, however, remained subdued in recent years, in particular cross-border M&As.In the ECB’s latest Financial Integration Report, we document that M&A activity in the euro areabanking sector has been on a declining trend since 2000, and in particular in the aftermath of thecrisis. This is especially true as regards cross-border mergers.In general, there is an ambiguous relationship between consolidation and financialstability. Banking sector consolidation could strengthen the market power of the merged entitieswhich may help them restore profitability.At the same time, by lowering competition, consolidation may increase the costs of retailfinancial services for households and firms and may also provide disincentives to keep costs34567 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
under control. These negative effects are likely to be more pronounced in the case of domesticM&As, whereas cross-border mergers should be broadly neutral in terms of immediate impacton market concentration.In this context, let me reflect on the Italian perspective. The Italian banking sector is one exampleamong euro area countries where there seems to be scope for further consolidation. Indeed, interms of standard concentration measures the Italian banking sector is among the leastconcentrated in Europe.This has been duly recognised by the Italian authorities, which in recent years have introduced anumber of measures aimed at consolidating and modernising the Italian banking sector, such asthe reform of the mutual banks, the reform of the cooperative banks, and the self-reform ofthe banking foundations.These are important steps to facilitate further consolidation of the sector which are welcomed inItaly and elsewhere in the euro area.Excess capacity and fragmentation along national lines are, to some extent, hampering theprofitability and performance of some euro area banking sectors.The banking union, includingsingle supervision and resolution mechanisms, in principle provides ideal conditions for banks toreap the benefits of new cross-border merger and acquisition opportunities.However, progress in both domestic and, in particular, cross-border bank consolidation remainslimited to date. Ultimately, the euro area economy needs banks that are large and efficientenough to operate and diversify risks on a cross-border basis within a European single market,but small enough to be resolved with the resources of the Single Resolution Fund. This wouldmake the most of the banking union while improving the trade-off between financial stability andeconomic efficiency.One potential deterrent of further consolidation at the domestic and euro area level is the highNPL stock that I just mentioned, which may reduce the attractiveness of potential targets in somejurisdictions. This is another reason why resolving the NPL problem is of utmost importance.Resolving the NPL problemResolution of the NPL problem is first and foremost a task for the banks. Should NPL markets befully efficient, it would be straightforward to sell the NPLs to other investors. We know however,that the NPL markets in the EU are shallow. Notwithstanding the recent pick-up in transactions,only a small fraction – less than 10% – of the stock of EU NPLs changed hands over the lasttwelve months.Notwithstanding the existing obstacles, a wide range of solutions to the NPL problem is availableto banks and policy-makers.Internal work-out would always feature among the available tools. In this vein, ECB BankingSupervision has recently issued guidance to improve bank capabilities in working out NPLs, asthese vary significantly. Direct sales could be complemented by securitisations, assetmanagement companies, and NPL trading platforms that may be used to transfer the risk of NPLwork-out outside of the banking sector to those who may be better suited to recover value.Clearly, more needs to be done to fully unlock the potential of market-based solutions to the NPLissues. Due to asymmetric information between the investor and the seller of NPLs, and to verylong duration and high cost of debt enforcement procedures, there is a wide bid-ask spread inthe NPL markets. The exact data on that gap are difficult to come by. Estimates suggest that itmight reach up to 40% for a fully collateralised loan.89101112131415 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Reduction of that gap, which has many causes, requires a comprehensive strategy. Determinedstructural reforms should play a prominent role in the action plan for national and Europeanauthorities, regardless of the actual solutions adopted by individual countries.For instance, debt enforcement procedures should be streamlined, and their cost lowered. Thismay require in particular that judicial and out-of-court capacity is increased. To mitigate theinformation asymmetry, access to financial information about distressed debtors and public dataregisters should be made easier. Investment in improving quality of that information is oftenneeded, and may be rewarded by investors with higher transaction prices.Within the comprehensive strategy, there may be a role for national governments to support thecorrection of the NPL market failure. Necessary structural reforms may require a lot of time toyield fruit and to earn credit with investors. This is a very tangible issue also in Italy, where recentreforms of the debt enforcement claims have not yet produced the expected results, andtherefore have not influenced NPL prices to the desired extent.Asset management companies (AMCs) may aid in correcting the market failure. They can swiftlyclean up NPLs from bank balance sheets, and resolve them over a longer period of time.Acquisition of assets at their long-term economic value, instead of market value which isdepressed by low liquidity and high uncertainty, minimises fire sale losses. Sweden, Germany,Ireland, Spain, Slovenia and Korea, for example, used these tools to manage their bankingcrises, often with a focus on loans backed by real estate. There is one common feature in thistype of AMC: state support. By putting capital and funding guarantees at stake, governments cansignal their commitment to the structural reforms and bring forward the related benefits. A similarrole may be played by securitisation schemes.The EU legal framework does not close the door to setting up an AMC with governmentsponsorship. The rules also allow for precautionary recapitalisation of banks by the public sectorin cases of significant financial stability concerns, subject to strict conditions laid down in theBRRD (Art. 32, 4), covering hypothetical losses estimated under an adverse scenario of a stresstest. Precautionary recapitalisations also have to respect State Aid rules that generally requirebail-in of subordinated debt as stated in the European Commission’s communication of July2013, where possible exemptions are nevertheless foreseen (paragraph 45).Let me remark here that, in the steady state, this would not be a major issue as “bail-in-able”debt would in principle only be sold to knowledgeable, qualifying investors, capable ofunderstanding the related risks. That unfortunately, is now not the case: our resolution rulesentered into force before the requirements for MREL i.e. the specification of “bail-in-able”securities, entered into force. However, the rules give scope to address valid concerns aboutretail investors through compensation. The European Commission recently announced whatcould become an important initiative: a proposal regarding a comprehensive strategy to deal withNPLs in Europe, including a blueprint for national AMCs accompanied by a clarification of theregulatory aspects involved.The new European Regulation on recovery and resolution deserves full support as it representsa change from easy public bailouts to a new culture of private bail-in, minimizing moral hazard.Notwithstanding this, the regulation does not ignore financial stability considerations. “We have tobear in mind that it is not only direct public support for banks that has a cost for taxpayers, butalso financial instability – indeed, the costs of the latter may, in some circumstances, be higher.Compare the worldwide costs for taxpayers stemming from the absence of public intervention torescue Lehman Brothers, with the zero cost for taxpayers following the USD 700 billion injectioninto U.S. banks in 2008 (which have been totally repaid by the banks). In other words, financialinstability can have a meaningful cost to taxpayers even if it is not visible in the very short-term –a notion that all policy-makers should keep in mind.1617 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
ConclusionI have highlighted a number of structural, cyclical and legacy-related challenges confronting theeuro area banking sector. We need to recognise the progresses made in increasing robustnessof euro area banks, the establishment of the banking union, the firming of the economic recoverydue to the ECB monetary policy, with the consequent improvement in banks’ future profitability asrecognised by the stock market in the recent quarters. Much still needs to be done to fullyovercome the consequences of the financial crisis and fully restore the condition of all nationalbanking sectors.The first line of response obviously lies with the banks that have to adjust their business model tothe new environment, entailing new regulation and increased competition from non-bank financialinstitutions and market-based finance as well as from technological innovations in financialservices. The adjustment is already underway and I have no doubt that the banking industry,even after some restructuring and downsizing, will continue to play a dominant role in thefinancing of the European economy.Public authorities, regulators as well as supervisors, also have to do their part by providing theproper incentives to steer and support a strong and efficient banking sector that the Europeaneconomy crucially needs.Thank you for your attention.See Constâncio, V.

  SOUTHERN CONE AND ANDEAN OPPORTUNITIES CONFERENCE CHILE: THE VIEW FROM THE CENTRAL BANK  Mario Marcel1/ Governor, Central Bank of Chile April 2017   Current macroeconomic conditions and prospects in the monetary policy scenario  1. The last few months have brought mixed signals for the Chilean economy. On the one hand, 2016 ended in a low tone, with a slowdown in activity and inflation. A series of one-off events extended economic weakness into the first quarter of 2017, lowering forecasts for the year as a whole. On the other, the global outlook appears more favorable, both for the growth of trade partners and terms of trade. This suggests a gradual improvement of economic prospects for the Chilean economy which should be further supported by an expansionary monetary policy as long as inflation remains below target.  2. Activity data and expectations in advanced economies have been more upbeat, marked by better than expected performance by the manufacturing sector and a broadening of the growth outlook across countries following years of stagnation. As a result, deflationary risks have dissipated, as inflation is expected to return to more normal levels. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has continued to normalize monetary policy and monetary authorities in Europe and Japan appear to have set aside the possibility of additional stimulus measures. Markets have incorporated these changes in their expectations avoiding any serious disruptions. Along with better signs in advanced economies, activity in China has remained relatively stable, which contrasts with what had been observed one year ago.   3. In this context, there has been an increase in the willingness to take on risk in financial markets, increasing stock market indices, reducing sovereign risk premiums and increasing capital flows to emerging markets. Commodity prices have also benefitted. Copper, our main export product, has been trading at prices near two year highs and prospects for the next few years have improved, which has had a material impact on the Chilean terms of trade. Thus, based on better growth prospects for our trading partners, favorable external financial conditions and increased terms of trade, the baseline scenario included in the  Monetary Policy Report published at the beginning of April, considered that, for the next two years, the Chilean economy will receive an external impulse higher than considered at the end of 2016 (Figure 1).                                                    1/ Keynote speech at the VI JP Morgan Southern Cone and Andean Opportunities Conference, April 25th, 2017. This speech is based upon that delivered at The Council of the Americas, April 20th, 2017.  
2    4. On the domestic front, inflation has been consistent with what was expected in December. The annual variation of the CPI fell to 2.7% in March, a significant drop compared to the 4.5% figure of a year ago. The behavior of the nominal exchange rate, which has appreciated relative to its level one year ago, has been a fundamental driver of these dynamics. The appreciation has had a greater impact in the decline of the goods component of the CPIEFE index (our core inflation measure). In fact, the goods component of core inflation dropped from nearly 5% at the beginning of 2016 to 0.3% in March. The services component has been stickier, and has dropped from the same levels the first few month of last year to 3.3% in March. Approximately ¾ of the prices included in this component are managed or indexed prices, which enhances their inertia and, as such, makes them less sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations (Figure 2).

3  5. Although in the baseline scenario headline inflation is expected to continue declining in the coming months towards the lower bound of our tolerance range, it is foreseen to return to 3% by the end of 2017 and fluctuate close to target towards the first quarter of 2019. Market expectations are very similar to our forecasts. Convergence of inflation rests on two main assumptions: first, that our RER will remain relatively stable at its current levels --a level we believe is consistent with fundamentals-- and, second, that the output gap will gradually close by the end of this year (Figure 3).    6. Activity has been somewhat weaker than expected. According to recent data the output gap is currently larger than we anticipated in December. GDP grew by 1.6% in 2016, in line with what was anticipated. However, revised national account data suggests the economy was somewhat stronger towards the beginning of 2016 and weaker towards the end of the year, leaving a low starting point for 2017 and a higher base of comparison for the beginning of the year. The new data also point to weakness in investment-related areas and in sectors that tend to be more persistent, such as business services (Figure 4).    Figure 3(*) The grey area, starting from the first quarter of 2017, corresponds to the forecast.

4   7. On the expenditure side, domestic demand—excluding changes in inventories—also tended to decelerate throughout last year. Weakness was most evident in investment in construction and other works, which contracted by 4.9% in annual terms during the fourth quarter (average growth of 0.5% between the first and third quarters).   8. Private consumption, in line with its behavior in previous years, provided support to the economy, growing by more than 2% annually throughout 2016, on the basis of wage growth and a low unemployment. However, it should be noted that while consumption of non-durables and services has remained relatively stable, durable goods have recovered, partly due to the appreciation of the peso during the last year and the necessary replenishment of inventories following several years of weak growth and even contraction. Something similar is observed with gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment. Excluding the purchase of non-regular transport machinery, this component of investment has improved in recent months.  9. In our baseline scenario, gross fixed capital formation should experience a slightly positive growth in 2017, after three consecutive years of contraction. A key factor in the negative figures of the last few years is the ending of the mining investment cycle, which reached its peak in 2012. More recently the deterioration of housing construction has added, as the boom triggered by tax incentives finished and a modification of loan-to-value norms reduced home sales. Going forward, our forecasts rely on an increase in non-mining and non-residential investment (mainly machinery and equipment). While mining investment will eventually return to positive territory during 2018, the gradual adjustment in residential investment is expected to continue during the following quarters (Figure 5).

5  10. The labor market continues to gradually adjust and runs the risk of becoming a drag on consumption. Wage employment declined by 2% annually in the moving quarter ending February, and annual wage growth moderated. In addition, working hours declined due to demand rather than supply reasons. Yet this has not translated into an increase in open unemployment, due to flexibility in the Chilean labor market: the unemployment rate is still low from an historic perspective. In fact, despite being more precarious, self-employment has acted as a significant buffer to the loss of dynamism in wage employment (Figure 6).     11. Domestic financial conditions remain favorable, particularly in terms of interest rates. Notwithstanding, credit volumes have decelerated with respect to previous years, as a result of overall subdued demand. Despite some increase in recent data, NPL ratios remain low, a clear sign that slower growth has not affected the financial health of companies and households.   12. The evolution of the local stock market has caught some attention lately, since the IPSA has increased about 17% this year and more than 30% since December 2015. Although these numbers might ring some bells, the performance of the Chilean index does not differ significantly from other regional stock markets and its recent behavior might just be a catch up from very low levels. Measured in real terms, its current value does not seem to be an outlier either (Figure 7).

6    13. The prolonged strike at La Escondida, the world´s largest open-pit copper mine, will have a very important effect on the first quarter GDP figures. It already did in the Imacec of February, which showed a yoy contraction of 1.3%, with a fall of 17.1% of its mining component. Since the strike ended in late March and resumption of production is not immediate, figures for that month will also be affected. Adding up the continued weakness in construction, the economy could experience an expansion close to 0% in the first quarter of the year. However, one should not forget that the strike at La Escondida, while very relevant to explain the first quarter figure, is a one-off event that is not expected to generate significant spillovers on activity elsewhere in the economy, nor on inflation.     14. On the basis of these data the Central Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1-2%, compared to 1.5-2.5% in December. At the same time, for 2018 we are expecting the economy to grow between 2.25 and 3.25% (Table 1), based on the fact that the economy does not appear to have any relevant imbalances, the mining-related investment adjustment is expected to end, and a more favorable external outlook. Fiscal policy is assumed to follow the fiscal consolidation path announced by the Government.

7   15. Our base scenario assumes that monetary policy will remain accomodative throughout the policy horizon. Following the adoption of an expansionary bias in December, the policy rate has been cut 75bp, acting promptly upon the prospects of a softer economy. In the April monetary policy meeting, while adopting the last 25bp cut in this series, the Central Bank Board signaled that it could consider some further policy easing if economic prospects remained subdued. This is reflected in the evolution of market expectations (Figure 8). Compared to a neutral real rate of 1%-1.5% Chile´s monetary policy continues to be one of the most expansionary among comparable economies.     16. As usual with forecasts, this macroeconomic scenario is exposed to risks. External risks include political and policy risks, especially concentrated on fiscal and monetary policy decisions in the US.  China remains a concern although its authorities appear to have successfully managed a gradual deceleration without a major disruption thus far. External risks are particularly relevant for a small open economy like Chile´s. Upside risks essentially emerge from a more robust expansion of the world economy and additional improvement in terms of trade.  17. On the domestic front, several years of subdued growth may have caused some underlying erosion that could compromise the economy’s ability to grow in the medium term. Deterioration of the labor market is particularly risky because it could weaken household consumption, which, by growing 2%-2.5% annually over the last three years has provided support for domestic demand and, ultimately, inflation. On the other hand, private investment may recover faster if export demand and expectations improve faster than expected.

8   18.  In 2012-2013 the Chilean economy was exposed to a substantial external shock given by the end of the commodities super cycle. However, contrary to past episodes, the economy did not fall into a recession. In fact, despite a substantial slow down, the signs of an economic contraction are not visible. Salaried employment slowed down but no massive layoffs have taken place. Companies saw their margins compressed by rising input costs and weak demand, but bankruptcies have not picked up. The demand for loans has weakened, but NPLs have remained stable.  19. The former is due to two major reasons. First, the macroeconomic policy framework has provided countercyclical support while allowing relative prices to adjust to the new circumstances via the exchange rate. Between mid-2013 and early 2016 the Chilean peso depreciated some 55%, putting some pressure on inflation, but the Central Bank kept monetary policy on a steady course until inflation decelerated from nearly 5% to less than 2% in less than a year.  20. The second reason is that domestic markets and economic agents have been able to adapt to changing circumstances. In the labor market there has been substantial mobility between sectors and from salaried to self-employment, while nominal wages and working hours have adjusted gradually. The corporate sector has cut on costs, improved operational efficiency and refinanced its debt. Financing conditions have remained historically favorable and banks have adjusted loan-loss provisions without rationing credit.  21. The above indicates not only that the Chilean economy has become more resilient than in the past but also that it is well prepared to resume growth. In fact, there are no major macroeconomic constraints to grow beyond the current rates. On the one hand, financial conditions are highly favorable and corporations and financial institutions face no liquidity constraints. On the other, with a current account deficit of 1.6% of GDP, Chile has little pressure from external savings. Finally, public net debt is only slightly positive and there is very little risk of crowding out private investment.  
9    22. This is one of the factors that explain the CB estimates of growth at 2.25%-3.25% in 2018. Other factors include improving external conditions, the expansionary monetary policy and the gradual disappearance of idiosyncratic factors that have dragged down economic activity in recent years. According to the CB growth should resume gradually from the second quarter of 2017 to gain speed and start reducing the output gap, currently at 1 ½ per cent, in the second half of the year (Figure 10).   Figure 9(*) General Government Financial Balance.(f) For 2017 to 2019, forecasts obtained from the 2016 Public Finances Report.

10   23. The above compares to a potential growth between 2.5% and 3%, according to the latest Central Bank estimates. This is indeed significantly lower than trend growth rates close to 5% in the mid-2000s. However, the same Central Bank analysis indicates that reallocating resources beyond the shorter term, recovering the historical investment/GDP ratios and resuming the increase of participation rates of women in the labor force could allow the country to attain trend growth of about 3.5% per year. This suggests that the Chilean economy still has considerably headroom to grow.  The challenges    24.  Speeding up growth with price stability in Chile still faces some important challenges. First and foremost, closing the current output gap would require recovering productive investment that has remained particularly weak over the last four years. Part of this is due to a substantial drop in investment in the mining sector, but gross capital formation in sectors other than mining has also faltered. While recent data points towards an increase in machinery imports, a more substantial change would require an improvement in business expectations that have remained in negative territory for some time.  25. The possibility of raising potential growth beyond the figures quoted above relies mainly on: (1) increasing human capital accumulation through increased labor participation, raising working skills above the already projected levels or the migration of workers with the competences required by the Chilean system; and (2) making productivity improvements via enhancing companies’ efficiency, lowering production and trading costs, and changing output composition toward more competitive and productive sectors, while advancing in terms of innovation and technological development.  26. As Chile’s concern for growth has intensified, many ideas about public policies have emerged that could help enhance productivity, with proposals coming from the government, private agents and the National Productivity Commission. In particular, policies have been developed that have permitted to diversify the energy matrix, increase supply reliability and reduce costs. There have been other factors, however, that pose a risk to productivity, including initiatives that may overburden corporate costs, generate new trading costs or reduce savings. Last, but not least, any discussion about productivity must necessarily cover technological development and innovation, which in Chile is limited by low private and public investment in R&D and by discontinuity in long-term policies aiming at economic diversification.  27. A third key challenge for the Chilean economy is to strengthen its institutions and making them more trustworthy. Even though Chile enjoys a substantial advantage in this respect over other emerging countries, trust in public and private institutions has suffered from a series of scandals in recent times and rebuilding such trust would require consistent action over a number of years. Such effort, however, would be well justified since a low-trust economy is likely to suffer from high transaction costs, free-riding behavior and low policy effectiveness.  
11  28. The former three elements—investor expectations, potential growth and institutional trust—are certainly not part of the conventional agenda of central banks. However, even a narrow focus on stable and low inflation requires monitoring the key developments affecting the future path of the economy. While the Central Bank can contribute indirectly to these goals by reducing economic instability and uncertainty, it would greatly benefit from the additional flexibility, effectiveness and welfare that they would be able to build. 
Muhammad bin Ibrahim: The dollar, the renminbi, and the evolutionof the international monetary systemWelcoming remarks by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia(Bank Negara Malaysia), at the SEACEN-OMFIF Policy Dialogue “The dollar, the renminbi, andthe evolution of the international monetary system”, Kuala Lumpur, 31 May 2017.*   *   *Welcome to the SEACEN-OMFIF Policy Dialogue. I am privileged to be here as we assemble toexchange views, insights and perspectives on an interesting and contemporary issue. Indeed,the theme on “The Dollar, the Renminbi and the Evolution of the International Monetary System”not only has regional importance but also global implications.The rules, institutions and conventions of the international monetary system are far-reaching.They shape the actions and behavioral responses of players in the global economy. It is for thisvery reason that I look forward to the diversity of views that will enrich our discussion on thistopic today.I shall provide some perspectives on the existing landscape of the international monetarysystem, the shift that is taking place and the possible implications for Asia. Although there arevarious elements of the international monetary system, I will focus on the interaction ofcurrencies, particularly as the title indicates, on the dollar and the renminbi.Dollar DominanceThe US Dollar (dollar) is unequivocally the dominant currency in the international monetarysystem. Its influence is, no doubt, prevalent.a. Firstly, in international trade, more than 40% of international trade settlement is invoiced indollars despite the United States making up only approximately 20% of the global trade;b. Secondly, for financial markets, more than 88% of foreign exchange trading involves thedollar;c. Thirdly, on safe assets, more than 63% of the world’s central bank reserves are held indollars.These three figures represent the present. However, the dollar has only been dominant over thelast 70 years. To understand the present and to form expectations about the future, let us firsttake a look at the past.Peering into history, numismatic records indicate that a few national currencies played importantroles in enabling international trade. Ancient Athens issued the silver drachma in the 5th centuryB.C. It became the first currency circulated widely outside its issuing state’s borders. This wasfollowed by the Roman aureus and the Byzantine solidus coin in the 6th century; the Arabiandinar in the 7th century; and the Mediterranean currencies between the 13th to the 15thcenturies.From the 16th century onwards during the Age of Exploration, the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanishand British empires expanded their trading colonies, and with it, their currencies. It was not untilthe 19th century that national central banks and treasuries began holding gold as reserves. Thisdevelopment coincided with Britain’s rise as a lead exporter and importer between the 19th and20th centuries. Consequently, the British pound sterling became the de facto internationalcurrency of the modern age. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In recent decades, however, the prime position of the dollar has been unchallenged. Itssurpassing of the sterling occurred in the 1920s, although many historians would ascribe the pre-eminence of the dollar as coming to the fore with the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944. Sincethen, the “dollar dominance” continued unabated despite the US experiencing various challenges,including the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s and the recession in 1981.Closer to present times, the dominance of the dollar continues to hold even after the GlobalFinancial Crisis, the most damaging crisis since the Great Depression.Although the privileged position of the dollar was not in question, the magnitude of its influencecertainly varied across time. It was not linear, consistent nor smooth-sailing. In fact, over the pastfew years, it was a favorite past time of market commentators to call time on the ‘reign’ of thedollar as the world’s reserve currency. A few candidates were cited to supplant the role of thedollar in the past, including the yen, the euro and recently, the renminbi.Necessity for Economic RebalancingIn 1971, the US Treasury Secretary John Connally, famously said to the European financeministers that the “dollar is our currency, but your problem”. This statement had validity then, as itdoes now.  For emerging markets in Asia, this braggadocio or arrogance rings true. This realitywas starkly demonstrated during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/98, where the emergingAsian economies were at the mercy of “original sin”. With the relatively cheaper dollar being thevehicle currency of the world, these economies became reliant on the dollar for its borrowings,despite proceeds being largely in local currency. The corresponding currency mismatch, evidentduring the AFC, made these economies vulnerable to shifts in capital flows. The impact ofsudden stops were amplified, causing the currencies to devalue and the cost of servicing theexternal debt to escalate, leading to a vicious cycle of default and instability. Capital flows to theregion went from a USD93 billion inflow in 1996 to a USD12 billion outflow in 1997. As aconsequence, growth of the economies in this region contracted between a range of 16% and10%, a big contrast to the robust growth of 7% in the period before 1998.Since then, emerging Asian economies have learnt their lesson. The reliance on externalfinancing was reduced. Sources of domestic financing were diversified through the developmentof the domestic bond market. Regional bond markets have expanded significantly. The regionhas replaced foreign currency borrowings with local currencies and addressed the inherentweaknesses in currency mis-matches in funding.However, there are unintended repercussions. An open and well-developed bond market attractsnon-resident participation and the diversity of market players is said to enhance market liquidity.However, we have discovered that beyond a certain threshold the presence of non-residentsparticipation is a source of instability. The higher the participation of non-residents in the bondmarket, the more vulnerable the market is to volatile portfolio outflows.So it is said that with history, if we learn it well, will not repeat itself. Nevertheless, sometimeslessons in history are cloaked in apparent success.The 2008 Global Financial Crisis and corresponding policy responses by major central bankscaused risks not seen before. In the periods after, unconventional monetary policy and aprolonged period of low interest rates had negative spillovers to emerging markets. This wasnotably evident through the waves of volatile capital flows in large magnitude. These flows weredrawn by the search for yields, and ironically coincided with a significant expansion anddevelopment of our financial markets, a key reform measure following the AFC. The region wasonce again at the mercy of global easy money, flattered with an overvaluation of asset prices anddomestic financial market exuberance. As these capital inflows mainly originated from theadvanced economies, regional financial markets became increasingly exposed to their vagaries.Take the Taper Tantrum for example, which exemplifies how fragile the region’s fate is when justa hint of the US Fed possibly tapering its asset purchases was sufficient to trigger massive 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
capital outflows from the region.Time and again, a clear policy lesson has come to the fore – the importance of diversificationand the need to reduce reliance on the de facto reserve currencies to manage negative spillovereffects.The aftermath of the shifting economic tectonics spurred countries to strengthen regional andbilateral cooperation. The impetus for regional integration in ASEAN deepened, and efforts weremade to strengthen the regional safety net through bilateral currency swap arrangements and theChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation. At the global level, the G20 was made the premier forumfor international economic cooperation and the leaders involved have indicated their commitmentto reforming the international financial architecture.Collectively, countries in this region are resilient with strong domestic savings, current accountsurplus and high international reserves. The strength and stability of this region could be furtherenhanced with increased regional cross-border investments, supported by a wide network ofregional banks. While some central banks and sovereign wealth funds have taken the lead toinvest regionally, the size of these cross-border investments in local currencies pales incomparison with investments in the dollar markets. Nevertheless, re-channeling savings into theregion, albeit still small, is a welcome start.China: Roaring DragonThe story of China’s rise in the global economy is a remarkable one. Its integration andincreasing influence in the global economy is becoming more pronounced. In 1990 its size wasonly 1.9% of the global economy. Now it constitutes close to 15%. Rapid growth of a staggering9.4% between 1978 and 2012 led to this rise. In fact, if one measures the size of the economy bypurchasing power parity terms, China is already the largest economy in the world.China’s ascent was in part due to its integration with the global economy, signified by itsmembership in 2001 to the World Trade Organization. It opened itself to the world, embracingglobalisation. This new phase of openness to the global markets was evidenced by the shift fromgoods export to capital exports, the move up the global value chain by producing high-techproducts, new business models such as cross-border e-commerce, and over the last few years,an evolution from being a net capital importer to a net capital exporter. All these furtherstrengthened China’s transformation from a manufacturing and investment based economy, toone based on services and consumption.Economically, China is introducing a bold strategy to enhance connectivity within this region andbeyond. The clearest example of this is the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative that is adding toprevious initiatives such as the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank andthe New Development Bank.The consequence of China’s economic rise is the increasing use of its currency. This wasfurther spurred by China’s gradual internationalisation of the renminbi in 2009. Renminbi hubshave been established around the world, including in Malaysia, and a global payment, clearingand settlement platform for renminbi, namely the Cross-border Interbank Payment System(CIPS) is in the development stage. Six years on, an estimated one-third of all Chinese trade issettled in renminbi, making it the third most traded currency in the world after the euro and thedollar. It is also now ranked 5 as the world FX currency in trading value and 6 as a paymentscurrency in value. Given the steady internationalisation of the currency, the renminbi is expected to be on a gradualpath to become a fully convertible currency, along with the emergence and expansion of majorChinese cities such as Shanghai, as formidable truly global financial centres. The ongoingaccessibility to the domestic financial markets, if further accelerated, will set forth a virtuousthth 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
cycle of development that will facilitate greater use of the currency.Thus, should the internationalisation of the renminbi continue as expected, it will further cementits role as the influential currency for trade and investment, and some say, a path towardsbecoming one of the more significant global reserve currencies.What are the implications for Asia?Using an analogy is apt in describing the implications for Asia. Japan, a country experiencingapproximately 1,500 earthquakes a year, is finding innovative ways to support its structures.Instead of using steel and concrete, traditional materials to strengthen its  structure, a Japanesetextile firm is experimenting with carbon fibre rope-curtains, which are tough and pliant toearthquake-proof a building.This will allow the building to realign itself when it is quivering during an earthquake. Thiscompany, Kengo Kuma and Associates, realising the potential risks from stress, also plantedanchors around the structure to prevent the ground from rising up when the carbon-fibre curtainis activated.Likewise, Asia should ensure it has its own ‘carbon-fibre curtain’ of policy adaptability andflexibility to manage destabilising movements in the financial system. Despite the inevitablediversification of de facto reserve currencies, the dollar will remain a significant force to facilitateglobal trade and cross-border capital flows.Thus, it is of primary importance for Asia, in particular the emerging markets, to ensure thateconomic fundamentals are strong and financial markets are resilient with adequate buffers. Atthe same time, we need to continuously improve the necessary infrastructure for corporates,businesses and financial institutions to transact in a multi-currency environment.Currently, cross-border trade within the ASEAN region are transacted and settled mostly indollars despite almost half of ASEAN trade being intra-regional. It makes economic and businesssense, that transacting in local currencies would enhance the efficiency of trade andinvestments, with strong probability of reducing the cost of doing business. In an environment ofvolatile market conditions, businesses will have more options to choose the currency to transact,providing flexibility and insulation from exogenous shocks. Greater usage of local currencieswould be an impetus for the development of the region’s financial markets, consistent withASEAN’s collective vision for an integrated cross-currency market.Malaysia has been forward-looking in preparing for the inevitability of a multi-currency market:i. We have diversified our international reserves into emerging market currencies in early2000, including into renminbi assets. We were confident in the diversification benefits giventhe strength and sustainability of China and emerging markets’ economic growth. Thesenew asset classes serve to reduce vulnerabilities and recycle some of the regional savingsfor the development of regional financial markets;ii. Putting in the necessary supporting infrastructure is critical to facilitate the development andreadiness of our markets to accept multi-currencies. This is the basic idea behind thesigning of the currency swap arrangements with the People’s Bank of China and Bank ofKorea to promote greater usage of renminbi and korean won ; andiii. In December 2016, Bank Negara Malaysia signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs)with Bank Indonesia and Bank of Thailand to promote the settlement of bilateral trade anddirect investment using domestic currencies. An established Operational Framework willpave the way for wider usage of local currencies in support of closer integration under theASEAN economic community. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Conclusion, the need to re-engineer the international monetary systemThe current international monetary system needs to be re-engineered. Our past experienceshave proven that the current system is unstable, prone to shocks and broken. Stakes in theinternational monetary system are far too high to be beholden to conventional thinking and statusquo. Like Japan and its buildings, we must continue to find innovative ways to strengthen thestructure of the international monetary system. Such re-engineering efforts may unseat us fromour comfort zone. It will certainly invite resistance and may even cause some temporarydisruptions. But standing still is the costliest option, as we would be stumbling from one crisis toanother. In a sense, the work is cut out for us, we need to distrust the status quo or we willcontinue to live in a decaying, sub-optimal and dysfunctional system, punctuated with frequentfinancial crisis. The needed reform will mean less disruptive capital flows, more robust financialsafety nets and most relevant of all, greater impetus for diversification that will lead to greaterresilience. Now is as good a time as any to begin.I wish all of you a productive dialogue. Thank you. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  SVERIGES RIKSBANK SE-103 37 Stockholm (Brunkebergstorg 11)  Tel +46 8 787 00 00 Fax +46 8 21 05 31 registratorn@riksbank.se www.riksbank.se  DATE: 31 May 2017   SPEAKER: Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley   VENUE: SEB, Stockholm        The central bank in an innovative and fast-paced world1  On 22 July 1668, a Stockholm court sentenced a bank director to death.  The bank director’s name was Johan Palmstruch, and he was the founder of the first bank in Sweden, Stockholms Banco. A few years earlier, Stockholms Banco had suffered an acute liquidity shortage when a confidence crisis arose regarding the banknotes issued by the bank. When the bank was unable to pay its depositors, it was simply taken over by the then Riksdag of the Estates, and later became the precursor to Sveriges Riksbank. Palmstruch was thus condemned to death unless he reimbursed the bank's creditors, which he of course was unable to do. The Council of the Realm eventually converted the death sentence into a prison sentence. And later, after the Chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie rushed to the defence of the deposed banker, Palmstruch was finally granted a pardon. De la Gardie also happened to be one of the bank's largest borrowers. It was possibly the Chancellor's guilty conscience that made him advocate milder treatment of Palmstruch. Not long after he was released, more precisely on 8 March 1671, Palmstruch died of natural causes.2   A banking crisis every thirty years With this historical retrospective, I would like to remind you that as long as there have been banks, there have also been financial crises. And when financial crises have arisen, the state has often had to rush to the rescue in one way or another. In Sweden alone, severe banking crises have occurred no less than nine times in the past 250 years.3  This entails, on average, one crisis every thirty years.  1 Thank you to Johan Molin, who has helped me write this speech. Valuable comments were received from Mats Anderson, Christina Nordh Berntsson, Sara Edholm, David Forsman, Mattias Hector, Martin W. Johansson, Gabriel Söderberg and Anders Vredin. 2 See Wetterberg (2009). 3 See, for example, Hagberg (2007).   1 [14]                                                             
   This speech is about how Sweden can counteract and mitigate the effect of such crises, and not least the significance of having an appropriately-designed foreign currency reserve to succeed in this. Johan Palmstruch’s banknotes were an innovation in their day, but now, 350 years later, we in Sweden are heading towards a cashless society, primarily due to new financial technology in the payments field. What this and some other development trends may entail for society and for the Riksbank is the subject of my speech today.  The banks’ business models entail risks What is so special about banks that the government sometimes intervenes to counteract banking crises? Nothing like this happens when, for instance, a manufacturing or construction company collapses.  The reason is that a crisis in a bank can very quickly spread to the rest of the financial system, which can in turn have very costly consequences for the economy as a whole. I shall explain how this comes about.    The banks’ traditional business model is to function as an intermediary between, on the one hand households and companies needing credit to buy homes or to get business projects started, and on the other hand households and companies wanting to hold money in accounts for transactions or savings. The banks thus help to transform savings into investment in the economy and contribute to more efficient mediation of payments. This is of course beneficial to the economy as a whole. At the same time, this business model entails significant risks. To put it simply, this is because the bank's assets consist of long-term loans that cannot be quickly and easily converted into cash, while the bank's funding is largely short-term and volatile. Normally, this does not entail any problems, but if for some reason doubts were to arise with regard to the bank’s ability to pay, the funding could be withdrawn very quickly, and the bank could be forced to default on its payments.  Problems in one bank can have serious domino effects As the banks are often interlinked with one another and often have similar types of exposure, problems in one bank can very quickly have serious domino effects in the rest of the financial system. Financial crises have arisen on many occasions through history, and not least the extensive financial crisis the world experienced 2007-2009 reminds us that financial crises can be extremely costly and that government measures can sometimes be necessary to stave off a total meltdown in the economy.4  Some banks are quite simply “too-big-to-fail”. It is in the light of the banking system's inherent instability, combined with its significance for the economy as a whole that we should regard the need for special supervision, regulation and other measures to make the system more 4 See, for example, Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).     2 [14]                                                             
   robust. As I mentioned in the beginning and I shall soon develop further, this is one reason why we need a central bank with an appropriated foreign currency reserve. In Palmstruch’s day, it was the depositors who rushed to the bank and caused a liquidity crisis. Unlike the 17th century, there is now in most parts of the world some form of obligatory protection for depositors’ money, a deposit guarantee. This reduces the risk that a bank’s depositors will rush off and empty their accounts if the bank's financial strength is suddenly called into question. The fact is that deposits from private individuals are now usually regarded as the banks’ most stable source of funding. But then we should know that the banks have for a long time also funded themselves through short-term and volatile borrowing on the international capital markets.5  I shall develop this a little further soon. What is the situation in the Swedish banking system? The Swedish banking sector is large and cross-border. In January 2017, the Swedish banks’ balance sheet total amounted to approximately SEK 17,000 billion. This is a figure that is rather difficult to grasp. It corresponds to four years’ worth of Swedish GDP. Everyone understands that a crisis in the Swedish banking system can become extremely problematic and also very costly to manage.  Of course, the comparatively low sovereign debt in Sweden means we have greater room for manoeuvre in a crisis than many other countries.  Comparatively low national debt in Sweden today   Note.

Source: Eurostat  5 The design of the Swedish pension system, with a large share of collective savings in the form of funded allocations within the occupational and premium pension systems, is one factor that may have had an impact on the banks’ financing structure. See Nilsson et al. (2014). 2030405060708020304050607080969798990001020304050607080910111213141516    3 [14]                                                             
   If one looks at the Swedish banks’ capital adequacy ratios as a percentage of their risk-weighted assets, they appear to be very well-capitalised. But then one must remember that the explanation for these capital ratios looking so good is largely because the banks use low risk weights in their internal risk models. If one instead looks at the non risk-weighted capital adequacy, the picture is different.  The so-called leverage ratio is almost at the same level as prior to the financial crisis. The risk of a new financial crisis is thus certainly not eliminated, and we should make higher demands of the banks regarding capital, so that the banking system becomes more robust and can better withstand a crisis. The major banks’ risk-weighted capital adequacy ratios are relatively high, but the leverage ratios are at almost the same levels as prior to the financial crisis…  Note. Per cent.

   The Swedish banks are dependent on foreign funding.  I mentioned earlier that banks around the world are using funding from abroad to an increasing extent. So what about the Swedish banks? Well, the Swedish banking system’s funding in foreign currency currently amounts to around 150 per cent of GDP, which is three times as much as at the beginning of the 2000s.   The Swedish banks are dependent on foreign funding   Note. Per cent. Swedish banking system’s foreign funding in relation to GDP  Source: Statistics Sweden Foreign funding refers to Swedish banks’ (including Swedish subsidiaries but excluding foreign subsidiaries) market funding and borrowing in foreign currency.  The increase is due to Nordea’s previous bank subsidiaries with effect from the start of the year being incorporated into the Swedish parent company.   If we also include the funding in foreign currency that remains in the major Swedish banks’ foreign subsidiaries, including Nordea’s mortgage lending companies in Denmark, Norway and Finland, the funding in foreign currency amounts to around 175 per cent of GDP, or SEK 7,650 billion. Part of the bank's borrowing in US dollars and euros is exchanged for Swedish krona and other Nordic currencies to finance assets in these currencies, including lending to households and companies.6  And it is thus the banks’ international financiers, rather than the normal - protected by the deposit guarantee - depositors who should be most disposed to withdraw their financing when the going gets tough. If these investors stop buying the banks’ bonds and certificates, the bank may very quickly suffer liquidity problems with a high risk of being forced to close down. This can in turn give rise to an acute threat to financial stability and ultimately to the economy as a whole – not only in Sweden but also in our neighbouring countries, where Swedish banks have operations.  6 Via FX swaps which have maturities of different lengths.

   There is a process consisting of many stages behind the lending for Swedish mortgages and corporate loans. In this process, both the Swedish banks and their counterparties on the foreign exchange market are dependent on the funding in foreign currency functioning constantly. Different currencies in the banks’ balance sheets (a simplified example)   How can we then best manage the banks’ increased liquidity risks in foreign currency?  A natural starting point is that the banks – just like other private commercial actors – should manage their liquidity risks themselves. They therefore need to insure themselves by having enough liquidity reserves and sufficiently stable funding in foreign currency. This reduces the risk that the government will have to intervene in the event of a crisis. Hopefully, it also gives the authorities a little more time to take in the whole situation and to find an appropriate solution if problems nevertheless arise. A liquidity buffer can to some extent also be regarded as a “deductible” that can at least on the margin reinforce the banks’ incentives to manage their liquidity risks. Finansinspektionen has also already placed demands for how the banks should manage their liquidity risks, among other means by requiring specific buffers in euros and US dollars. As I am sure you know, the Riksbank’s opinion is that the banks also need buffers in other important currencies that they use in their operations.   Even if the banks were to have strong self-insurance, it is not certain that this would be enough in a crisis situation. Then the Riksbank can act as “lender of last resort”, that is, assist the banks with liquidity if they experience difficulties obtaining market funding. The Riksbank can in principle create any amount of liquidity in Swedish krona. Swedish krona can normally be exchanged for foreign currency. So what is the problem? Well, it is the word “normally” that is the snag. In a financial crisis, there is very little that functions “normally”. This is the whole purport of the word “crisis”. In other words, it is far from certain that the foreign      6 [14]  
   exchange markets will function in a crisis. And this is when it is most urgent and most expensive to acquire foreign currency.  Swap agreements, not just a phone call  During the financial crisis, an acute shortage of US dollars arose in the banks. In September 2008, the Riksbank was able to establish, together with some other central banks, temporary currency loans – swap agreements7  – with the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. However, before the agreement was signed and ready to be put into use, the Riksbank was forced to use its own foreign currency reserve. With the aid of this, and gradually with the new swap facility, the Riksbank lent dollars equivalent to around SEK 200 billion for four weeks. In total during 2008 and 2009, the Riksbank was able to offer its counterparties, with the aid of the swap line from the United States, dollar loans corresponding to more than SEK 1,000 billion.  Central banks’ balance sheet – grown to manage financial crisis  Note. Per cent of GDP.    Source: Macrobond  It is difficult to say what would have happened if the Riksbank had not received access to the swap with the Federal Reserve, and if the Riksbank had not been able to offer the banks this dollar facility. Probably, some of the banks would have experienced severe difficulties. After the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has announced that it no longer offers swap lines to other than a small group of central banks, a group to which the Riksbank does not belong. It is also highly uncertain whether we will have access to similar arrangements with the Fed or other central banks the next time problems arise. The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has also expressed increasing concern over this 7 Swap agreements between central banks can be described as rental agreements, where one obtains access during a predetermined period to a foreign currency in exchange for remuneration in the form of one's own currency.      7 [14]                                                             
   development. In the report, the IMF calls on countries with limited currency reserves and a lack of swap lines, like Sweden, to consider measures aimed at strengthening their protection.8  With 70 years of experience of problems in many countries, the IMF's advice is worth taking seriously.  Many factors contribute to Sweden’s access to potential swap lines being uncertain. The fact that Sweden is in global terms a small economy is of course one such factor. One cannot assume that it is always in the interests of an individual country to help another country, particularly not in cases that concern a largely domestic crisis. The tendencies towards a more introvert policy that can be discerned in some economies do not exactly give hope for greater helpfulness in the future. Perhaps the conditions would be better in a global financial crisis, when it may be in one's own best interests to help others. But the hopes of bringing about a swap agreement could be dashed if the borrowing country’s own buffer, the foreign currency reserve, has been weakened. On the contrary, there may be doubts that the country is capable of managing its own risks. Who would want to come to the rescue of a country that is not prepared to pay the cost of a reasonable insurance?  Let me make a comparison. Some years ago, Sweden chose to re prioritise within its defence forces, and the compulsory military service system was abolished. Now that uncertainty in global policy has increased, the Swedish defence budget has increased, and compulsory military service is being considered again. It is quite simply safer to have, for instance, a number of JAS fighter planes on standby than to rely on being able to rent them if one needs them, partly because in an acute situation it would probably take too long and because it would be difficult and expensive.  Foreign currency reserve – part of Sweden's economic defence  Similarly, we can regard the foreign currency reserve as part of Sweden's economic defence. The advantage of having a foreign currency reserve is that it can quickly be made available for liquidity support to the banking system if an acute need were to arise.   A foreign currency reserve can also prevent a financial crisis by creating confidence in the central bank’s ability to take action when necessary. This is particularly important in a situation where market confidence in the country’s credit and payments systems is under pressure. If you say it could never happen to Sweden, let me remind you of Ireland and Iceland. Prior to the global financial crisis, these countries were assessed to be in good condition with healthy public finances and consequently high credit ratings. But in connection with the crisis, both Ireland and Iceland suffered serious confidence crises. Their credit ratings were cut rapidly, at the same time as their borrowing requirement was increased. 8 IMF (2016a).     8 [14]                                                             
   Interest expenditure soared and the countries were forced to make drastic cuts in a number of areas of expenditure. Swedish experiences also point to confidence falling rapidly and taking a long time to regain. For many years after the 1990s crisis, Sweden suffered from a much higher interest rate than Germany, with a very large risk premium on Swedish government securities.  Given the Swedish financial system’s large degree of international dependence, it is important and necessary to maintain international confidence in the financial system. A robust foreign currency reserve is, in my opinion, an important condition for this. To return to the defence forces metaphor, if other countries know that we have a number of JAS fighter planes on standby, it would probably also reduce the risk of a conflict situation arising, where we would have to use them. Today, there is a proposal on the table before the Government that could in principle entail halving the Riksbank's foreign currency reserve.9 Allowing the foreign currency reserve to decline in a situation where the banking sector as a whole and its funding in foreign currency are growing is to say the least a risky venture. This is not only my opinion and the opinion of the Riksbank, it is also shared by the International Monetary Fund. In its Article IV review of Sweden's economy in 2016, the IMF concluded that the foreign currency reserve should not be smaller than it is now. The European Central Bank, ECB, has also recently issued an opinion recommending that Sweden should not reduce the size of its foreign currency reserve below the current level.10   The foreign currency reserve should be paid for by the banks The cost – or insurance premium – of having a liquidity insurance in the form of a foreign currency reserve is at present charged to the Riksbank’s earnings and central government finances and is calculated at around SEK 400-500 million a year. This is, of course, a lot of money, but calculated per inhabitant per year the insurance premium is only SEK 40-50. This corresponds to around two cups of coffee or half of a cinema ticket.  Moreover, it is actually a cost that could well be transferred to the banks, which are the primary beneficiaries of such an insurance. One could say – to take it to an extreme – that tax-payers currently subsidise the banks by almost half a billion a 9 The Government’s draft referral to the Council on Legislation (in Swedish): http://www.regeringen.se/494cc9/contentassets/c34c52bc62904b2984784e2b94f1e6aa/riksbankens-finansiella-oberoende-och-balansrakning-utkast-till-lagradsremiss The Riksbank’s consultation response: http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Press-Releases/2017/Important-to-have-sufficient-foreign-currency-reserve-rapidly-available-in-a-crisis/ Other public authorities’ consultation responses regarding the foreign currency reserve can be found here (in Swedish): http://www.fi.se/sv/publicerat/remissvar/2017/remissvar-pa-utkast-till-lagradsremiss-riksbankens-finansiella-oberoende-och-balansrakning/ and https://www.riksgalden.se/globalassets/dokument_sve/om_riksgalden/remissvar/2017/riksbankens-finansiella-oberoende-och-balansraekning-remissvar.pdf 10 ECB (2017).     9 [14]                                                             
   year through the liquidity insurance provided by a strong foreign currency reserve. Depending on how the Government chose to design the charge or premium for this insurance, it could further strengthen the incentive for the banks to reduce their liquidity risks in foreign currency. Financial technology has changed our means of payment  I began by talking about Johan Palmstruch. Let me return to him now and discuss a subject that also affects the Riksbank’s ability to carry out its tasks, namely financial innovations and the development of new financial technology, or “FinTech” as it is known in some circles. Johan Palmstruch was a financial innovator of his time. He was the one who introduced banknotes with standardised denominations – a real global innovation in the 17th century. The printing presses made it possible to mass produce these standardised banknotes. The banknotes were much lighter and easier to transport than the heavy copperplates that they were used to dealing with. Sweden had a copper standard at that time.  After Stockholms Banco collapsed, it was not until the 1830s that the financial sector in Sweden really took off. Private banking firms emerged, and some of them began to issue their own banknotes. They continued doing so until the early 20th century, when the Riksbank was granted a monopoly on issuing banknotes so that the state could gain a firmer grip on price stability and standardise payments. The development of financial technology has always been an important driving force behind changes in the financial sector and it has often entailed new challenges for financial stability. Now and then, it has also given central banks reason to consider how they can best do their job. During the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of this one, we have seen several innovations that have changed consumers’ methods of payment.11 In recent years, the amount of payments made with the aid of smartphones and mobile bank ID has risen very rapidly. The Riksbank has actually contributed to the latter by giving Bankgirot access to a special account in the Riksbank's payment system RIX that enables secure payments with a mobile application. 12  Use of cash declining rapidly in Sweden All of this has contributed to the volume of outstanding cash in Sweden declining from around 10 per cent of GDP at the beginning of the 1950s to around 1.5 per cent of GDP today. The largest decline in the use of cash has taken place in recent 11 Some examples of innovations that have changed our way of making payments over the years include cheques, ATMs, credit and debit cards and bank transfers – initially as paper forms and later as direct transfers over the Internet. 12 Today 97 per cent of all citizens in Sweden have access to some form of payment card. 85 per cent have access to on-line banking and 80 per cent have access to direct debiting. More than 60 per cent now have access to the Swish payment app.     10 [14]                                                             
   years. Demand from the general public has fallen from almost SEK 100 billion in 2007 to around SEK 60 billion today.13   Banknotes and coins in circulation falling rapidly in Sweden    Source: Statistics Sweden  One can say that the Riksbank's banknote monopoly has almost had its day, as a number of rapid and simple electronic means of payment are being supplied by private agencies. You see, in Sweden, there is no legal requirement for cash to be accepted as a means of payment in the retail trade. Nor do the banks have a legal requirement to supply cash services.  The fact that we have gained more efficient means of making payments has on the whole been good for Sweden.  But this development also entails a number of difficult challenges, for instance, that the infrastructure for cash management is being phased out in Sweden.14 15   Most indications are that this development will continue, which raises a number of difficult questions: What happens if the general public no longer has access to cash, or if it is not possible to use cash anywhere? Sweden is on the verge of a situation where commercial interests determine whether the general public shall have access to central bank money and ultimately what payment methods can be used. Is there a risk that the payments market will become an oligopoly, with high thresholds for competitors and where payment services are expensive? Can we ensure that those who do not have access to the banks’ services in the future will still be able to manage their payments in a safe and efficient way? What would happen in a future financial crisis, if the general public distrusts the banks and wants to withdraw savings in cash – but the banks no longer hold cash?  13 Withdrawals from ATMs have also declined significantly in recent years. In 2010, Swedes withdrew around SEK 225 billion and in 2015 they withdrew only SEK 153 billion. 14 See, for instance, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority's report on its task from the Government with regard to fundamental payment services, 27 February 2017:  http://www.pts.se/sv/Dokument/Rapporter/Post/2017/Aterrapportering-av-PTS-regeringsuppdrag-inom-grundlaggande-betaltjanster---17-201-/ 15 To some extent the Riksbank has contributed to this development by reducing the number of cash depots in Sweden. See, for example, Daltung and Ericson (2004). Note. Annual average for cash outside the banking sector, that is, cash held by companies, households and government agencies.     11 [14]                                                             
   Central bank money will still be needed in the future These important questions must be answered. In my opinion, there is reason to examine whether the Riksbank should offer money in digital form to the general public. If the printing press made it possible to print banknotes in its time, then our current technology enables electronic payments. It is therefore reasonable to try to find out whether the Riksbank can use new methods and techniques to offer means of payment that are guaranteed by the Riksbank in the same way as banknotes and coins.16  The Riksbank's role as supplier of liquidity in a changing world Technological advances and structural changes affect not only the methods of payment, but also the risks and threats to the financial system. This means that the authorities need to regularly evaluate and test their crisis preparedness. The Riksbank also needs to review and maintain its liquidity tools in good shape.  Although the banks are still central to the payments system and comprise a natural focus in the Riksbank’s financial stability analysis, other agents such as central counterparties (CCPs) are gaining increasing importance in the financial system. Structural changes, such as the banks’ funding or how they choose to organise their cross-border operations, affect the liquidity risks in foreign currency, among other things. This is something that the Riksbank and other authorities must monitor.  Financial innovations such as trading robots and other types of automated financial services can contribute to greater efficiency, but they can also give rise to considerable liquidity stress.17  In line with technological advances, the speed at which the transactions can be implemented is also increasing. The fact that money and securities can, at the touch of a button, be moved immediately from one continent to another, is something that hardly reduces the liquidity risks in the financial system. It also emphasises the importance of central banks having the capacity to quickly intervene if necessary. This requires having sufficient reserves on standby.  Liquidity decisive Let me conclude with a reflection. Many agents who have so far expressed an opinion on the issue have emphasised Sweden's strong public finances as a compelling reason for reducing the Riksbank's foreign currency reserve. But everyone knows that in an uneasy situation it is always liquidity that determines 16 See, for instance, Skingsley (2016): http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Tal/Skingsley/2016/tal_skingsley_161116_eng.pdf and the Riksbank's project plan for the E-krona: http://www.riksbank.se/Documents/Avdelningar/AFS/2017/Projektplan%20e-kronan_170314_eng.pdf. 17 See, for example, De Nederlandsche Bank (2016).     12 [14]                                                             
   how well one copes with the problems. If you are not able to pay when the bills fall due, those around you will lose confidence in you and ultimately you may face seizure and bankruptcy. As a Swedish citizen and representative of Sveriges Riksbank, it is my duty to point to the importance of good liquidity in managing a financial crisis. This requires a foreign exchange reserve that is sufficiently large to cover at least the foreign currency needs that may arise in the short term in a situation of financial stress. In my opinion, such an insurance is a way of taking responsibility that the citizens of the country have the right to require from their government and national authorities as the world becomes faster paced and innovation increases.  Thank you.          13 [14]

Sabine Lautenschläger: Supervising banks - four prioritiesStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, atthe International Monetary Conference, London, 13 June 2017.*   *   *Many thanks for your question, Howard. So what priorities do I see at the moment? In respect ofbanking supervision there are four things that come to mind.Most importantly, regulation has to remain a global issue; the banking system is global in scopeand we need to take a global approach to regulating it. Reforms of banking regulation have nowbeen under way for almost a decade; it is time to finalise them, implement them and see howthey work.But it is not only about the rules themselves; it is also about their application. Supervisors aroundthe world apply the rules very differently. Globally we should focus on how supervision is carriedout and how we can learn from each other. What approaches are used? What are the best toolsand methods? What are the best structures in terms of budget and independence, for instance?These are things we should discuss at global level – also with respect to Brexit.That, in fact, is the second thing on my list of priorities. We all know that, in the event of a “hard”Brexit, UK banks would have to seek a licence in the EU to do business on the Continent.And here, I get the feeling that many banks are a bit too relaxed about this. So my message todayto the banks is quite simple: the clock is ticking. Obtaining a licence takes some time, so don’tput off applying for one for too long.But it is not just about banks. In the wake of Brexit, we might also see entities, such as broker-dealers or third-country branches, setting up shop in the euro area. These entities wouldprobably be supervised at national level.The market would become more fragmented and all the conditions for a race to the bottom wouldbe present. It might thus be appropriate to have such entities supervised at European level. Thecurrent review of the European rulebook offers a chance to adapt the relevant rules.Non-performing loans, or NPLs, are the third item on my list. In some parts of the euro area,banks still have large exposures to NPLs on their balance sheets – a legacy of the economiccrisis. NPLs are a drag on banks’ profits and they keep the banks from lending to the economy.The issue needs to be resolved, but it cannot be resolved overnight. Getting rid of NPLs takestime and effort. In March we published guidance for banks on how to deal with NPLs, and oursupervisors are monitoring closely the strategies banks devise and the progress they make.Still, resolving NPLs as quickly as possible requires the right structures. And here, governmentscould help by improving the legal and judicial systems. The price of NPLs depends largely onwhether these systems are effective and efficient.The fourth item on my list is risk management. And in a broad sense that also covers internalmodels. After all, banks use these models to calculate risk weights for their assets, which thenserve as the starting point for determining the right amount of capital.I think that risk sensitivity should be central to calculating capital requirements. But I also see thatinternal models have become very complex. And that makes them prone to error or evenmanipulation. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Against that backdrop, we have launched a major project; the targeted review of internal models,or TRIM, as we call it. With TRIM, we want to achieve two things.First, we want to harmonise the supervisory treatment of internal models and ensure a levelplaying field.Second, we want to ensure that the results of internal models are conservative and driven byactual risks, and not by modelling choices. This will strengthen trust in the banks’ calculation ofrisk and, ultimately, in the adequacy of capital buffers.Thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: Interview with Bloomberg TVInterview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,and Bloomberg TV, conducted by Ms Francine Lacqua on 12 June 2017.*   *   *Benoît Cœuré, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg TV. Now, the ECB seemsto be in a rush to exit this accommodative stance. How dangerous is lower for longer?Thank you for inviting me. Basically the thrust of what the Governing Council decided last week isto acknowledge the improving economic circumstances, to translate it into a revised forwardguidance, because we have to adapt to economic reality, but also to give a sense of patiencewhen it comes to rates being low: we are still not seeing inflation where we would like it to be;we’re still not seeing the criteria that we’ve set for inflation to be sustainable all being met. So youneed a sense of patience here.How much of a nightmare is stronger GDP on QE?Stronger GDP is good news. It’s unqualified good news. This has been acknowledged by theGoverning Council last week, and that’s why we changed our communication to adapt to thechanging reality. It also shows that our monetary policy measures are working. All the jobs thathave been created in the eurozone over the last three, four years or so, a lot of them have beencreated thanks to the accommodative monetary policy stance, so it is working very well. Now, wehave an inflation mandate, so when it comes to the next steps we’ll have to focus on inflation.Why was tapering not discussed last week?That wasn’t discussed at all. It is too early to discuss it. We have to acknowledge the changingreality. We discussed a lot the economic situation; we discussed the prospects for inflation.There was a sense of progress also when it comes to inflation where, in spite of the inflationbeing revised downwards, if you look carefully at the staff forecast, you’ll see that inflation is alsoless dependent on our monetary policy measures, which is one step in the right direction, but it’snot yet quite enough to start discussing tapering. We’re not there yet.When do you think tapering needs to be discussed? Even to just accustom the marketsto the idea of tapering.I don’t want to give dates here. I don’t think it serves a purpose. The reason being that we’re verymuch data-driven. We’re driven by facts. So we’ll discuss tapering whenever we see theeconomic situation and the prospects for inflation are right for discussing it.Do you have in your mind a perfect idea – and I’m not going to press you on it, but do youhave a perfect idea of when tapering should be discussed and what it would look like?No, again, that will depend a lot on the economic numbers; it will depend a lot on inflation. Weobviously have to discuss it before the end of the year. That’s obvious given what we’ve said onbuying bonds until the end of the year and later if necessary. So that discussion will take place,but it will take place when the data supports it.Is July a live meeting? I know we were talking about it, but is it a live meeting given thatit’s July so there’s actually usually low volatility in the markets, and given that you’re notactually doing any new forecasts?Well, we do work in July. It may look nice around, but we do work in July. And as I said, thediscussion last week was very much about taking stock of the progress in the economy, taking 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
stock of the progress that will support an improved path for inflation, and that’s a discussion thatwe’ll have again and again. So one lesson of what we’ve decided last week, is that the GoverningCouncil wants to keep our forward guidance aligned with reality, and that’s going to continue.You’re one of the brightest minds when it comes to academic economics. Why is inflationso low? Is it structural, or is it just that we may be counting things differently?No, I don’t think it’s that much about the statistics. That may play a role, but it’s a lot about thechanging structures of the labour market, in particular. This is a recovery which is jobs-rich. A lotof jobs have been created and are being created in the eurozone economy, but it’s a differentkind of jobs. A lot of them are on temporary contracts, a lot of them are part-time, and thisproduces less inflationary pressures. There will be a time where they are consolidated intopermanent, full-time contracts, and then nominal wages will start growing, but we’re not yetthere. So it has a lot to do with the structure of the job market, and that’s certainly an area wherewe’re paying a lot of attention, to understand in detail the nature of the jobs being created.Do you think the market understands all of these nuances quite well, especially when itcomes to when you talk about tapering and exactly what kind of potential roads that maytake?I think it’s very well understood. The markets have the example of the Fed in the US; it has to bedifferent here, because we are operating on different markets, but we have a successfulexperience with policy normalisation. We’ve been able to communicate our intentions. Themarket reaction to the Governing Council last week was very positive, very smooth. So I’m notvery worried here.Yes, but that’s because you didn’t announce much. Is there a danger that when you doannounce something a little bit more substantive that the markets go haywire?Well, we did change our communication, and that was a significant change, and the marketunderstood very well, I think.Give me a sense of, when you talk about forward guidance, and we talked about the datapoints, and everything seems very, very clear: are there parallels with the Fed when itcomes to inflation just not being as strong as you were hoping it would be?I don’t think so, because the economies are different. I was mentioning the labour market earlieron: the labour market has been very different in the US and in Europe. In the US the participationrate has fallen, so a lot of workers have been detached from the labour market, ordisenfranchised from the labour market. They’re just staying at home, and have lost any hope tofind a job. That is not the case in Europe. So we’ll have also to account for these differences.On a trade-weighted basis, the euro is that much stronger compared to the dollar: is thata concern at all? Do you think about it, or not?Well, we don’t have an exchange rate target, and insofar as exchange rate movements do reflectthe economic fundamental situation, that’s fine, so there’s nothing to comment at the stage we’reat. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Compared to six months ago, what is the risk that you still perceive – forecasts are a lotbetter, right? So it seems that things are getting rosier.Well, the Governing Council has judged last week that risks were now balanced, and also addedthat we see downside risks mostly coming from the outside. So we see risks surrounding thefuture course of US economic policies, we see risks in emerging market economies, and theseare the risks we want to focus on. Risks coming from the inside, that is, from within the eurozoneeconomy, are much less than they used to be.How would you qualify tensions within the Governing Council? I know there are differentviews, but is that healthy? It seems like you’re becoming more like an MPC BoEmonetary style…It is healthy to have different views. We are working for 19 countries, so we need different viewsto be reflected. Different economies inside the eurozone are running at different paces, and thathas to be reflected. So, so far so good, as long as the Governing Council can form a consensus.And what we’ve decided last week was very much a consensus, which is good and givesstrength to our communication.How do you rate political concerns? Is there a danger that because France is out of theway and it was an outcome that the markets like, that we now underestimate politicalrisk?Well, political risk is there. It’s not for us to decide on political risks. We’re not a politicalinstitution; we don’t decide based on political outcomes. We decide based on economic facts,and political timelines should certainly not be in our way when we have to decide on monetarypolicy. That said, it’s true that political uncertainty has held back consumption and investment tosome extent in the eurozone. I very much hope that in France this will not be the case any more.That will certainly support the strength of the French economy. I also very much hope that theoutcome of the French election can support a momentum of reform, starting in France,obviously, but also in Europe, that will support our monetary policy. We want a stronger eurozonefor our monetary policy to be effective, and France has a key role to play here.When it comes to fiscal policies, Mario Draghi has been asking for fiscal policies for aslong as I can remember: why would it be different this time?It’s not that much about fiscal policies; it’s a lot about structural policies. It’s about improvinglabour markets, and, as I said, it’s about making the eurozone work better, which is a politicaldiscussion, which the ECB cannot lead, and should not lead, because we are not a politicalinstitution. We don’t have a mandate to do that. So we need eurozone Member States, startingwith Germany and with France, to lead the discussion, and I very much hope, I’m very confidentnow, that that discussion will start.Does the UK election last week make your job harder or easier?Well, the UK is not so important for the eurozone economy. I wish the best for the UK economy; Icertainly trust the Bank of England to steer the economy through this political uncertainty, but atthe end that’s not a major risk for us.What does it mean for clearing houses?Clearing houses is an important discussion. That discussion has to be led by the EuropeanCommission, because that’s about law-making in Europe. The European Commission will, withindays, I guess, make new proposals when it comes to derivatives and to clearing houses, with anobjective to ensure the safety and soundness of clearing across the EU when the UK leaves. Sofar, we’ve been able to ensure the safety and soundness of euro-denominated clearing through 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
very robust arrangements that we have with the Bank of England and with the CCPs located inLondon, and that works very well. The basis for the arrangements will fall in 2019, when the UKleaves, and so we need an alternative. Different alternatives are considered by the EuropeanCommission, and they have to lead that discussion. So I would defer to the Commission here.Right, but countries want basically sovereignty over that, and the ECB, the GoverningCouncil, I believe, the best person to regulate that is yourselves. How do you think it willend up?The Governing Council, the ECB has a stake in that discussion, insofar as financial stability isconcerned, and insofar as monetary policy transmission is concerned, and we have a statutoryrole as central bank of issue for euro-denominated transactions, and I welcome the fact that theCommission has referred to the role that we should play as central bank of issue, and wecertainly need to play a strong role here. But when it comes to requirements which will be hard-wired into European law – so say, for instance, location: do we need location? – that’s for theCommission to have a say. That’s not for us to decide.Give me a sense of what happens with Greece.Greece will be discussed in the Eurogroup in Luxembourg on Thursday this week. That’s anotherof a long series of meetings. I very much hope, and the ECB very much hopes, that this will bethe concluding meeting that will make more precise the way the Greek debt will be addressed bythe Eurogroup. The Greek government has done its part. They have done their part in terms ofpolicies, in terms of the MOU, and now it’s for Eurogroup ministers to deliver when it comes toconfirming the sustainability of Greek debt. As I said earlier, it wouldn’t serve a purpose to keepthe Greek economy in limbo for one more year. We need a decisive act by the Eurogroup thatwill create confidence in the Greek economy. It’s time for investors to come back in Greece, it’stime for depositors to bring back their money to Greek banks, and it’s for the Eurogroup to givethe signal that will make it possible.So you think the resolution this week will be something that’s acceptable to the ECB?Well, another discussion will be about the monetary policy consequences and inclusion of Greekdebt into QE. That’s a different discussion. It is a monetary policy discussion. So the GoverningCouncil will take whatever will come out of the Eurogroup, and this will be considered andassessed against our rules. We’re certainly not going to be part of a political quid pro quo withthe Eurogroup. These are two different discussions.I know we’re going round the world in 15 minutes. Give me a sense of banks and howconcerned you still are about Italian banks. The resolution last week that we had inSpain, is it a blueprint for how you think Italian bank problems should be resolved?I’m very hesitant to pass judgment, or even pass a comment, on Italian banks. I’m not asupervisor, and we have a separation principle that it’s for my colleagues on the supervisory sideto assess and communicate. So Danièle Nouy and Sabine Lautenschläger will do that. When itcomes to the resolution of Popular last week, the main lesson is that we have a system thatworks, so that is a positive test for the institutional set-up that we have, with the Single ResolutionBoard, European Commission, Single Supervisory Mechanism, and ECB in its monetary policyfunction: that cooperation has worked very well, in a very swift way, which is what you want tosee in the case of resolution. Would that be the case for any other bank? I don’t know. All banksare different, and, well, you know that quote from Leo Tolstoy, who said that all happy families arealike, and every unhappy family is different. So every failed bank is different.Very diplomatic. One very last question, because we haven’t talked about China at all:when it comes to external factors, how should we look at China? 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
China remains a major area of interest for us. I would not say of concern, or risk, because so farthe Chinese authorities have been able to steer the transition in the Chinese system very well,and to provide stability to the world economy. That said, there are issues to be addressed:shadow banking, corporate debt, transition towards domestic demand, transition towards adecarbonised economy. These are daunting challenges that will stay with us in the years tocome, but so far the Chinese authorities have been very successful in steering the economy andnot making China become an issue for the global economy. We’ve got enough issues, so wedon’t want China to become one of them. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Gent Sejko: Money and banking in Albania, from antiquity tomodern timesOpening address by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the First Conference ofthe Museum of the Bank of Albania “Money and Banking in Albania, from Antiquity to ModernTimes”, Tirana, 14 June 2017.*   *   *Dear Professor Picard,Dear academics, professors and researchers,Dear guests,It is a special pleasure for me to welcome you to the First Conference of the Museum of the Bankof Albania.This is a special event, which brings together academics, researchers, and experts of centralbank and currency museums, to establish a new bridge of communication and cooperation thatwill help us to take further our work at the Museum.In our short experience in museum management, we have learned that it is very essential tocooperate with other institutions responsible for the administration of cultural heritage, as well aswith scientists and experts that study and preserve them, and tell their history. Also, with thesupport from the Ministry of Culture, Centre for Albanian Studies and Institute of Archaeology, wehave today the Museum of the Bank of Albania, whose collection displays unique and impressiveitems. The systematic work of our distinguished archaeologists and of the dedicated central bankemployees over the years has helped in materialising the efforts for presenting the history of theAlbanian currency, from the axes of the Hoard of Torovica, to the first coins struck inDyrrhachium, to those in circulation throughout various historic periods, up to modern days.Through over 30 exhibits and 5 educational rooms in the Museum, we show interactively theancient history of our currency. The permanent exhibition in the lower floor displays collectionsfrom monetary systems that have existed in our territories over the past two thousand years.They are part of the numismatic collection of the Bank of Albania and the Albanian Institute ofArchaeology. We have selected and studied them meticulously in a close and long process ofcooperation with archaeologists, numismatists, historians and ethnologists in Albania. I take thisopportunity to thank them for their valuable contribution.Our Museum, however, is not just a money museum. It is also the museum of the central bank,which considers financial education as an essential objective. The public needs to be informed inorder to be able to make judicious and sound financial decisions, which, in turn, contribute tofinancial stability. That is why we have dedicated the upper floor of the Museum to financialinformation and education. Through a number of activities, educational publications, lectures,films, and applications, irrespective of their age, visitors learn about financial products andsystem. The history of money originates long ago and its developments are closely related to thepeople that have produced it. Its role is not limited to the economic functions; it is also a historicevidence of the minting or issuing country. It speaks about periods of economic crisis ordownturns, of peace and prosperity, of successes and injustices. In this context, we decided todedicate the First Conference of the Museum of the Bank of Albania to two main topics, whichwe think are the gist of its exhibitions and educational activities.1. Findings, researches and discussions in the area of monetary production and circulation, thehistory of the economy and banking activity in Albania and Albanian historic territories, whichcontribute to accurate interpretation and updating of information transmitted to the visitors 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
through Museum collections.2. The educational role of central bank museums in getting to know the history of money, andbanking activities and enhancing financial literacy through exhibitions, education and innovation.For this purpose, we aim, therefore, to bring together foreign central bank experts to share theirperspective on the management of central bank museums, collections and educational activities.This conference certainly underlines the commitment of the Bank of Albania to earnestly engagein both research and educational activities. We are very interested in enhancing cooperation withresearchers, academia, peer museums, and specialised institutions in economic, historic andcultural heritage research.Such cooperation is an excellent opportunity to Bank of Albania employees, who may benefitfrom valuable skills and expertise for our Museum. It would also contribute to new networking andcollaboration in research activities.In light of promoting and furthering cooperation, we are committed to turning our Conference ofthe Museum of the Bank of Albania into an annual event. Also, in 2017, the Museum of the Bankof Albania will organise a cycle of lectures dubbed as “Nights of the Museum”, which will addressa variety of topics, such as numismatics, banking history, economic and financial education,philately, art and architecture. These projects aim at developing another aspect of our work at theMuseum, which would focus on social developments vis-a-vis museum objects.Dear participants,The first conference of the Museum of the Bank of Albania coincides with the 25th anniversary ofthe establishment of the modern central bank of the Republic of Albania and a two-tier bankingsystem.In these 25 years, the Bank of Albania has served to the country’s economic and financialdevelopment, supporting successfully the development of an efficient and stable financialsystem.It will continue to remain an institution with ambitious objectives in the field of Europeanintegration and approximation with the European Central Bank. Today, it is undertaking a newchallenge: opening to the public, not only to communicate clearly its primary objectives, but alsoto contribute to helping the public learn about the history of money, art and tradition that itrepresents.We will work hard, so that all the interested persons, whether in Albania or abroad, will be able tolearn about the history of banking, money and people that have dedicated their life and work to it.I am certain that very soon the Museum of the Bank of Albania will be a place to visit theexhibition, and exchange opinions and ideas about banking and moneyConcluding, I would like to thank you for your participation and contribution to the conference andwish success in these two days of the conference.Thank You! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Juyeol Lee: 67th anniversary of the Bank of KoreaSpeech by Mr Juyeol Lee, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the commemorating ceremony ofthe Bank of Korea’s 67th anniversary, Seoul, 12 June 2017.*   *   *Dear fellow members of the Bank of Korea family,Today marks the 67th anniversary of the Bank of Korea’s foundation. I would like to take thisopportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all those who served before us in the Bankof Korea over the years, devoting themselves to the development of our Bank and the nationaleconomy, and to those who have supported and encouraged us as well. Let me also expressmy compliments to each and every member of our current staff, for so faithfully carrying out theduties entrusted to you. Although consumption still appears to be recovering only modestly, it is judged that the pace ofgrowth in our economy is accelerating, as exports are increasing rapidly and investment is alsoshowing favorable movements. As these trends continue, it is expected that the economicgrowth rate for this year will exceed the forecast in April. Notably, if measures to expand fiscalexpenditures to create jobs and for other purposes are implemented by the new government,then the pace of growth will accelerate even further.However, looking at the economic environments at home and abroad, there are still numerouspotential risks preventing us from complacency about this positive growth outlook. If our traderelations with major countries become strained, owing to stronger trade protectionism forexample, the negative impacts on our economy with its heavy dependence on exports can behigh. Additional rate hikes and the reduction of its balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve, aswell as political uncertainties in major countries and geopolitical risks related to North Korea, canalso at times lead to increased financial market volatility and even work to limit our growth.On the domestic front, there are a variety of difficult structural problems causing the recovery inour economic vitality to slow. Factors such as our low birth rate and population aging, inter-sectoral imbalances, and the dual structure in the labor market have been weakening our growthpotential and the virtuous cycle in our economy. Further, owing to delays in industrialadvancement and in finding new drivers of growth, improvements in productivity and the creationof high-quality jobs are not being properly achieved. As household debt has continued to growfaster than household income for a long time, concerns are rising that household debt canconstrain consumption and undermine financial stability.We will need to overcome these structural problems wisely in order to sustain our recent growthmomentum over the medium- to long-term. First, we will need to loosen the many competition-restricting regulations and eliminate unfair trade practices, so as to create an environmentfavorable to dynamic technological innovation and the brisk advent of new industries. Togetherwith this, we must devote efforts to easing the sectoral imbalances in our economy and restoringits virtuous cycle. As the government is working from multi-faceted perspectives to devisemeasures for resolving our structural problems, the policy authorities and economic agents willneed to work together so that the measures undertaken by the government can achieve theirdesired results.Dear fellow members of the Bank of Korea family,Now I would like to talk about several of the tasks that the Bank of Korea needs to focus on goingforward.Despite the recent accelerating pace of growth, we will need to maintain our accommodative 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
monetary policy stance for some time, in view of the continuing high uncertainties as to thegrowth path and the not so great inflationary pressures on the demand side. However, ifeconomic conditions show more clear improvements, with the economic recovery beingsustained for example, then we may need to adjust the degree of our monetary policyaccommodation, and will therefore need to carry out a thorough review of this possibility. Inconducting monetary policy, it is also necessary to stress the importance of financial stability-related issues such as the pace of increase in household debt and the monetary policynormalization by the US Fed.There have been various economic policies drawn up since the new government took office. Wewill need to take a closer look at the impacts which these policies will have on our monetarypolicy environment, including macroeconomic and financial stability conditions. We will also needto work to keep our monetary policy in sync with the government’s policies. We must in additionactively propose effective and feasible policy options, through practical application of ourresearch capacities, so as to ensure that the government’s policies can better lead thedevelopment of our nation’s economy.We will have to devote even greater attention to financial stability. Above all, we must concentrateour best efforts on easing the trend of sharply rising household debt, which is a potential risk tothe financial system. While redoubling our endeavors for the monitoring of household debttrends, analysis of the factors causing it to increase, and assessment of the related risks, weshould also contribute to the formulation of effective measures for responding as necessary, inclose consultation with the government and the supervisory authorities.We must maintain our robust external soundness as well. We will need to closely monitordevelopments in terms of factors causing global financial market unease that could lead toexpanded exchange rate or capital flow volatility. If the financial and foreign exchange marketsbecome unstable, then market stabilization measures appropriate to the circumstances shouldbe carried out in a timely manner. We will in addition need to work to strengthen the multi-levelfinancial safety nets, through financial cooperation with international organizations and regionalcooperative bodies.As the convergence of IT and finance accelerates, the environment for our payment andsettlement-related work is changing rapidly, and in view of this we should continue to expand andimprove the related infrastructures and services. We will also need to carry out in-depth researchon the implications that the establishment of Internet-only banks, and the extensive use of digitalcurrencies, have had on conditions for monetary policy operation and the payment andsettlement system.Dear fellow members of the Bank of Korea,In times of high uncertainties like those now facing us, it will inevitably be difficult for the centralbank to accurately analyze economic conditions and carry out an optimal monetary policy basedupon this analysis. No matter what the circumstances, however, we need to faithfully fulfill themandate bestowed upon us. Only by doing so can we contribute to sound economicdevelopment and gain even greater public trust. To this end, all members of our Bank’s staffshould work to strengthen their expertise, by striving to develop themselves and to fully exercisetheir potentials. We must also open our minds and listen to diverse voices directed at the centralbank, such as outside requests and opinions of economic experts at home and abroad, withoutbeing shackled by our existing knowledge and experience. We should continue working toincrease the transparency and predictability of our policies, so that economic agents are able toenhance their understandings of our monetary policy and form rational expectations as to ourpolicy directions.The more a society advances, the higher the level of morality and social responsibility demandedof those in the public sector. And central bankers are of course no exception. We must therefore 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
work to bring our ways of thinking and our code of conduct into step with the new values andnorms arising with the changes of the times. Not only as members of this organization, but in ourown everyday lives as well, we as central bankers should spare no effort in self-management touphold our dignity. We should also take the lead in showing consideration for the sociallydisadvantaged, while strengthening our community service activities as well.Fellow members of the Bank of Korea,I am filled all the more with emotion now because today’s ceremony celebrating the Bank ofKorea’s foundation will be the last event held in this building, which has been with us here for 50years. We must make sure that the construction and renovation project preparing our new homeis successful. While being mindful to ensure that no safety accidents nor security issues occurduring the process of staff relocation and construction, we should also see to it that we do notcause any inconveniences to the general public.Thanking the staff involved in the preparation of this commemorative event, I want to wish all ofyou and your families the very best of good health and the greatest happiness.Thank you.  3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
       MONETARY POLICY REPORT  PRESENTATION TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE HONORABLE SENATE OF THE REPUBLIC ∗       Mario Marcel Governor Central Bank of Chile 3 April 2017                                                        ∗The Monetary Policy Report of March 2017 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl/en  
 Introduction  Mr. Governor of the Senate’s Finance Committee, Senator Carlos Montes, honorable  members of this Committee, ladies, gentlemen,  Thank you for your invitation to present the views of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile about the recent macroeconomic developments, their projections and implications for monetary policy. This vision is contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report (the Report) of March 2017. It is worth mentioning that this Report includes for the first time economic forecasts for 2018, as I will show you throughout this presentation.  I am here with the full Board and all the staff responsible for the topics covered in our Report. I wish to make a special mention of our new Board member, Ms Rosanna Costa, recently confirmed by this Senate, and Ms Solange Berstein, our Financial Policy Division Director, as of today.   In recent months, annual CPI inflation has continued to decline, in line with forecasts in the December Report. Goods inflation continues to be shaped largely by the movements of the exchange rate, while services inflation has continued to drop gradually, marked by the widespread indexation and consistently with the business cycle.   Meanwhile, in late last year and into this, GDP of non-natural-resources sectors performed weaker than forecast. Furthermore, incoming data suggest that it will take longer than expected to recover. This, coupled with recent events that have considerably eroded mining activity, will pull down annual GDP growth in 2017.   However, as can be seen in the outlook I will be sharing with you in a few moments, a number of elements will help the economy to regain momentum within the projection horizon. Worth noting among these are that no significant macroeconomic imbalances are observed, that the negative impact of the mining investment adjustment has diminished, that the external scenario has improved, and that monetary policy will remain clearly expansionary. Overall, capacity gaps foreseen for the next two years will be somewhat wider than we thought in December, toning down medium-term inflationary pressures.   In this context, the Board lowered the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) by 50 basis points during the early months of the year, speeding up the cuts with respect to provisions made in December. At the same time, we considered that, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, it will be necessary to enhance the monetary impulse somewhat, which reflects in an MPR trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days prior to the statistical closing of this Report.  Macroeconomic scenario  In February, annual CPI inflation was 2.7%, while core inflation—CPIEFE; CPI excluding energy and foodstuffs—was 2.2%, driven mainly by its goods component, whose annual growth fell to 0.4% in February, in line with the nominal exchange rate, 
 2  which is now below its year-ago level. The services component of the CPIEFE posted an annual change of 3.4% in February, a quite milder fall than its goods component, reflecting its greater inertia (figure 1). About this, it is worth noting that one feature of the CPI services basket is that 75% of its prices are either managed or linked to another indicator or to past inflation, meaning that they are indexed. This fact in practice augments their inertia and causes the effect of any change in the activity gap to take longer to show up. Of course, this is not the case for every service price, as non-indexed or non-managed prices tend to show a more visible effect from changes in the gap. One of the boxes in the Report is devoted to this, showing how the differences in the recent evolution of services inflation appear when these recently mentioned price groups are taken separately.  In this Report’s baseline scenario we foresee that headline inflation will continue to decline for some months, to return to 3% by year’s end and hover around that mark until the first quarter of 2019, when the current projection horizon ends. The CPIEFE will decline steadily until the second half of 2017 and will take longer to hit 3% (figure 2).   This inflation path relies on two assumptions: first, a fairly stable real exchange rate around its current levels, which are estimated to be in line with fundamentals; second, that although the output gap will exceed the December estimate for some time, it is projected that, for the aforesaid reasons, it will begin to close towards the end of this year.  Activity growth ended 2016 in line with the December forecast, although characterized by a steeper slowdown during the year, which is expected to continue well into 2017. On 20 March, the Bank published the first National Accounts figures based on the new benchmark compilation that uses the base year 2013. This change is intended to update the way the evolution of the national economy is gauged, incorporating new estimation methodologies, changes in international standards and new sources of information. The Bank makes these changes regularly every five years, according to the respective international standards set by the IMF and the OECD. The most salient changes are depicted in a box in this Report, and all the details can be seen in several documents uploaded on our website.   The new data, which included a very small revision to 2014 and 2015 growth, confirmed the further weakening of the economy in the last quarter of the year, and at the same time modified the growth trajectories of the already published quarters of 2016. In particular, the economy would have slightly outperformed previous estimates for the first part of that year. By sectors, it confirmed that Mining posted negative y-o-y growth throughout the whole year, while activity in areas unrelated to natural resources (i.e. Other GDP) continued to worsen, going from growing 3% in the first quarter to 1% in the fourth (figure 3). In the other sectors, most weak in the fourth quarter were particularly those sectors linked to investment in construction and related services, which are usually more persistent. Also personal services decelerated, although it is estimated that it responded partly to the effects of the public sector strike at the end of last year (figure 4).   On the domestic expenditure side, y-o-y growth in final demand—minus inventory change—also showed a downsloping trend throughout the year. The biggest loss of 
 3  dynamism was seen in investment in construction and other works, whose annual rate of change was -4.9% in the fourth quarter (0.5% average between the first and third quarters). Private consumption, as has been the case for some years, provided support to the economy, growing by over 2% annually throughout 2016. This was helped by growth in labor income, falling inflation and persistent low unemployment by historic standards. It is worth noting that while growth in non-durable consumption has remained stable, durable consumption growth has recovered, partly due to the appreciation of the peso in the last year and partly due to the necessary replenishment of stocks after several years of low or even negative expansion. Something similar is observed in gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment. Discounting unusual purchases of transportation equipment, this investment component has tended to perform better in the past few months (figure 5).  The labor market has continued to adjust. Salaried employment stands out with a fall of 2.1% annually in the December to February moving quarter, as does the moderation of annual wage growth. Plus the reduction in hours worked, at a time where a growing number of workers claim that they work fewer hours than desired. Anyway, self- employment, while more precarious, has significantly cushioned the disturbances coming from salaried employment (figure 6).  A constant concern in recent years has originated in the evolution of the labor market. In several Reports we have included boxes and research notes addressing various related topics, including the degree of working flexibility and how changes in labor conditions affect unemployment. Our last issue includes a box that explores the effects of the business cycle on workers' wages. Normally, wages are analyzed using aggregate data that, by their very nature, conceal the movements of individual wages. Using data per worker, we show that the dynamics of individual wages are much more correlated with the business cycle than what aggregate wages would suggest. In particular, because the wages of workers changing jobs—either voluntarily or involuntarily—are affected, for better or for worse, depending if the business cycle is favorable or not. This is a line of ongoing research that allows us to better understand the evolution of the labor market and its implications for medium-term inflationary pressures.  Domestic financial conditions, meanwhile, are still good in terms of interest rates. However, lending volumes have slowed compared to previous years, which the respondents to the Bank’s Business Perceptions Report and Bank Credit Survey interpret as the consequence of weak demand (figure 7).  In our baseline scenario, we estimate that this year the economy will grow between 1% and 2%, down from the range we projected in December, 1.5% to 2.5%. Around 0.2 percentage points of this correction originate in the effects of the Escondida mine downtime. Because of the importance of this mine in the country’s copper production—15% to 20% in 2016—, this downtime will have a substantial impact on first-quarter GDP, around 1 percentage point of reduced growth, taking the figure to near zero.  Despite its economic impact, the Escondida deadlock, plus the effects of massive forest fires in January and February, are all one-time events that not only do not affect the long-
 4  term trajectory, but neither do they influence the dynamic of the business cycle. Thus, we do not expect these events to have any material repercussion on the performance of other economic sectors or on inflation. In the case of mining production, although its impact on GDP of the first quarter is significant as it is determined mostly by supply-side factors, it is deleted from the Other GDP calculation that the Bank uses in its models to measure the activity gap and the medium-term inflation outlook.  Thus, the change in the projected range for 2017—of half of one percentage point—responds to two major factors. On the one hand, about half is explained by Escondida mining downtime and other incidents during the first quarter. On the other hand, the greater weakness we saw in the course of 2016 gives a lower starting point for the economy this year. In particular, because this weakness has been observed in sectors that tend to be more persistent in their dynamics, such as construction and associated areas. We must not forget that this sector received a significant boost in 2015, which lasted into early 2016, as a result of the new VAT that would be charged to the sector under the tax reform. Such reduced strength responds largely to the end of this boost. There is also the effect that the lending standards of mortgage loans have tightened too, given the higher down payment demanded by the banks. Another important issue worth looking into are the changes in inventories over recent years. The year 2016 completed three years of inventory depletion, which is quite uncommon. In general, inventory movements reflect how companies predict the future: if they are optimistic about it, they accumulate, and vice-versa. Recent years’ relentless downward revisions to growth prospects have permeated companies’ desired level of inventories and part of what we see in the 2017 growth outlook is also related to that.   For 2018, the baseline scenario assumes that the economy will perform better than this year, growing in the 2.25% to 3.25% range. This will allow the activity gap to narrow steadily throughout next year, keeping in mind that the Board still estimates our economy’s potential growth rate between 2.5% and 3%, and trend growth at 3.2%.  These projections assume that, after a three-year-long fall, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) will post a slightly positive growth in 2017 and a clearly stronger expansion in 2018. This result will be decisively influenced by higher investment in non-mining and non-housing investment (mainly machinery and equipment). This, because the former is expected to regain its positive numbers during 2018 and the latter to continue to adjust for a few more quarters, after the boom triggered by amendments to VAT payment regulations in the sector. As a percentage of GDP, in 2017 GFCF will reach 21.7% and 22.5% in real and nominal terms, respectively.   On the consumption side, no major changes are expected in annual growth, and it is foreseen that it will continue to sustain domestic output and expenditure. Our baseline scenario assumes that consumption will grow at a pace of 2.5% and 3% this and next year, quite like 2016. It also assumes that export volume will grow a little over 1.5% this year, and the rate will double in 2018. Behind this increase is an improved external scenario, which I will discuss in a moment. In this context, the current account deficit will be smaller than projected in December, and 2017 will be better than 2016, due to slower growth in domestic demand and improved terms of trade (table 1). 
 5   As I said earlier, the greater growth expected in 2018 originates in the economy having no major imbalances, the end of some factors that have hindered growth in recent years—for example, the four-year plunge of mining investment—an expansionary monetary policy stance and a stronger impulse from abroad compared with previous years. As for fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidation announced by the Administration will proceed further.  The recovery that reflects in the annual figures projected for 2018 should begin during the course of this year, considering the negative impact of the debilitated economic activity at the end of 2016 and early 2017. In fact, the average annual GDP growth of the last quarter of 2016 and the first of this year is somewhat above 0%. Already for the second quarter, in our baseline scenario, it will rise above 1.5% annually, which, on average, will be sustained and increased in the second half of the year. However, as we will see later, this scenario relies partly on a stronger monetary policy bias, which is necessary for the inflation target to be met.  Internationally, in the last few months a somewhat more favorable scenario has been forming. On the one hand, activity and expectations indicators in the developed world have revealed a better economic environment. Particularly noteworthy is the situation of the manufacturing sector, which after long years of stagnation shows improved results and prospects, which has been added to the greater dynamism of services sectors that has been observed for several quarters (figure 8). In the United States, persistent positive consumption figures—sustained by a robust labor market— have coupled with the much desired rebound in investment. In the Eurozone, the stronger and more synchronized recovery among its members stands out. In Japan, the depreciation of the yen has given a boost to the foreign sector. Thus, relative to the December forecast, the growth projection for 2017 of our trading partners in the developed world is revised upward by 2 decimals, to 1.8%, this year and next.  Improved conditions in the developed world have given way to expectations pointing to a normalization of inflation or have at least dissipated the risk of deflation that existed not long ago. Thus, the Federal Reserve continued normalizing of its monetary policy and policy makers in Europe and Japan have ruled out further QE. Markets have gradually incorporated these changes in their expectations avoiding major disruptions (figure 9). In the past, the processes of raising interest rates in the US were surrounded by complex economic and financial developments in some economies. In the 1980s, the most critical case, there was the debt crisis in Latin America. Then in the 1990s, the most significant effects were circumscribed to some countries. In the 2000s, the emerging world was not so affected directly, but the subsequent subprime crisis in the United States and all its implications for the world resulted the Federal Reserve rate hike. Today, the conditions in which the United States and the emerging world confront the episode are different as seen from both sides. China's growth and the size of Europe make them a potential risk for the Fed, so it cannot overlook the effect of its decisions on these economies. At the same time, economic policy frameworks have changed in emerging markets and are more capable of dealing with external shocks. Anyway, it is still an element of risk. A box in this Report provides a deeper analysis of these topics. 
 6   Beyond the volatility of recent months, the dollar remains strong with respect to most currencies, developed and emerging. Our peso, which has depreciated a little more than 30% from its 2013 average, has behaved similarly to most of our trading partners’ currencies, so its multilateral variation has been much smaller. Accordingly, the real exchange rate index with base year 1986=100 is now near 93, some 3% above its 2013 average (figure 10).  Among emerging economies, the improvement in China’s outlook is worth noting. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Chinese GDP grew 6.8%, so growth for the full year was 6.7%. Conjunctural numbers and financial indicators have been calmer, according to manufacturing output and foreign trade figures. The renminbi is depreciating gradually and the large capital outflows and reserves depletion of 2016 have stopped. Meanwhile, the authorities set the growth objective at 6.5%. Thus, our baseline scenario has revised the Chinese growth forecast upward by 2 decimals.   In Latin America, the main economies in the region are still adjusting. In Brazil, consumption and investment are weak, as is manufacturing production in Colombia. Argentina is also undergoing a difficult process and, although more lagging than in other countries, has shown signs of milder deterioration of activity, especially concerning manufacturing output. The Mexican economy could sustain good growth and performance in the labor market until the markets became aware of the potential effects of the US elections on trade and migration. This has resulted in weak investment. In this context, the Mexican authorities have taken steps to strengthen their macroeconomic fundamentals, through policies aimed at consolidating public finances, withdrawing the monetary stimulus to deal with inflationary pressures, and managing the exchange rate to counteract the sharp depreciation that the Mexican peso suffered towards the end of last year. In general, the inflation outlook has continued to improve in the region, opening room for further monetary stimulus. In addition, the external imbalances have moderated and the fiscal accounts continue to consolidate. Still, there is only weak support for a more robust expansion in the region.  In this context, there has been a widespread increase in risk appetite, raising stock prices, reducing sovereign premiums and boosting capital flows into the emerging world (figure 11). The terms of trade also show a significant improvement, largely due to a combination of higher prices for copper and lower for oil than assumed in December. The prices of other export products have also risen. Copper has remained at its highest price in two years. This responds partly to the aforementioned better performance of the manufacturing sectors and the better world growth outlook. Another part is explained by supply disruptions in some important producers and the lack of new investments. Thus, we have risen our projections of its price to US$2.55 and US$2.50 per pound for 2017 and 2018, respectively. The oil price, after some rise after the agreement between OPEC and other producers to reduce output, has fallen in recent weeks. Our baseline scenario foresees it close to 50 dollars per barrel in the projection horizon. With this, in 2017 and 2018 the terms of trade should not only outperform 2016, but should also be higher than was anticipated in December (table 2).  
 7  In the baseline scenario, monetary policy is providing a somewhat stronger impulse than estimated in December. As a working assumption we assume that the MPR will follow a trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days prior to this statistical closing of this Report. Thus, we assure that monetary policy will have responded swiftly to the changes in economic conditions and will remain expansionary through the whole projection horizon (figure 12). As always, the conduct of monetary policy and any possible adjustments to the MPR will be contingent on the effects of incoming information on the projected inflation dynamic.  On the external front, there are some sources of uncertainty that may have significant effects but by their nature are very hard to quantify. For example, political and economic uncertainty surrounding European elections, worries about Brexit implementation and possible shifts towards protectionism in several developed economies. Other risks that have long lingered in the external scenario have varied in intensity. The US economy has evolved favorably, averting the risk of a new recession. The much awaited fiscal impulse could help to sustain somewhat higher growth in the years to come. However, it is also a source of risk, as its implementation may have problems or inflationary effects that might trigger a faster withdrawal of the monetary impulse, creating disruptions in financial markets. China continues to be a source of concern, especially its leverage, although its authorities have successfully weathered its gradual slowdown without causing disruptions, and this has been welcomed by markets.   Neither can we rule out an intensification of the recent global trends and a stronger than expected impulse from abroad, by either a steeper recovery of world activity and/or better commodity prices. Some of this seems to have permeated financial markets, where the prices of riskier assets have risen. Although it is still premature to validate such optimism, it is clear that the markets are in a better mood than last year, including local markets, which have even been outperforming many of their peers.  On the domestic front, after several years of subdued growth, we cannot rule out that a more persistent phenomenon may be affecting the economy’s ability to grow, in which case spending plans of both public and private agents would need some revision. One area calling for special attention is the labor market. While acknowledging that it has gradually adjusted without significantly increasing unemployment in the past several years, it is possible that, after years of low growth companies wish to make more drastic changes in their payrolls, particularly if the expected growth recovery towards the end of the year stalls. In contrast, in a context where no macroeconomic imbalances are hindering growth, a scenario where an improved external outlook consolidates, plus the end of a cycle of mining investment adjustments and a rebound in sentiment, could lead to a more dynamic recovery than expected.  All considered, the Board believes that the risk balance for both inflation and activity is unbiased.  Summing up, inflation has evolved in line with December forecasts. However, the economy has been weaker, widening the activity gap beyond expectations and reducing inflationary pressures. Accordingly, the Board deemed it appropriate to enhance the 
 8  monetary stimulus between January and March. Going forward, we believe that it will be necessary to increase this monetary impulse a bit more, using as a working assumption that the MPR will follow a a trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days prior to this statistical closing of this Report. As always, we reaffirm our commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% in the policy horizon.  I will now share some final thoughts.  Final thoughts  The evolution of the economy in recent years has brought great challenges for monetary policy making around the world. The actions of central banks were paramount to take the world out of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and to prevent a relapse in the following years, especially in those countries with less room for fiscal maneuvering. During this long period the effectiveness of monetary policy to influence inflation and economic activity was called into question. Though less dramatic than in other places, in Chile this discussion is also revisited every now and then.  Before responding to the question of how effective monetary policy is, we must clarify two points: what objective does it pursue, and how does it operate, and then we can explore whether the means contribute to the ends.   Chile’s institutionality assigns the Central Bank two main functions: to safeguard the stability of prices and the stability of the payment system, understood as financial stability. The first of these objectives has been specified under the regime of flexible inflation targeting, and has governed us for over 15 years, setting the target that annual expected CPI inflation must stand at 3% in a two-year horizon. This regime also considers a floating exchange rate, where the Bank reserves the possibility of intervening in the market, a power it has exercised barely four times since this policy came into effect in 1999.  This should clarify what lies beyond the objectives of our Monetary Policy: on the one hand, under the foreign exchange policy I have just described, we do not have a target for the exchange rate. We allow it to settle freely in the market responding to local interest rates and its other macroeconomic determinants. This is relevant because, as the empirical evidence shows, in small, open economies the exchange rate is an important shock absorbing mechanism.   Second, our target is not short-term inflation, but longer-term inflation. Thus, to the extent that inflation fluctuations are perceived as transient, they should not have much impact on our policy decisions. A good example of this is the steep increase in inflation we had between 2014 and 2016. This process originated largely in a shock to the exchange rate that had transitory effects on inflation. Of course, the duration of the period of high inflation was long, but it responded to a succession of different shocks and not to the persistent effect of a single one.   
 9  On the contrary, whenever we identify medium-term pressures on inflation, either upward or downward, we must react with vigor. The same episode which I have just referred to is illustrative in this regard. While in the short term inflation rose as a result of a shock on the exchange rate, with transitory effects, medium-term pressures diminished as a result of a deteriorating economy. Had our target been short-term inflation, we should have raised the MPR. As it is not, and what we aim at is medium-term inflation, our decision was to lower the MPR to prevent inflation two years out from falling below the 3% target.  This response of monetary policy is very different from its not so distant past. In the 1990s, when our economy was not yet sufficiently prepared to deal with a currency shock, the Bank had to choose between an inflation target and an exchange rate target. The result of the exercise was complex for the Chilean economy. Not to mention what happened in the early 1980s, when the defense of a pegged exchange rate and changes in external financial conditions led us to a recession that cost us 15% of lost GDP and escalating unemployment. Applying our present scheme, monetary policy, coupled with a fiscal policy based on a structural balance sheet, has achieved its inflation objectives by dampening external and domestic shocks more strongly. The turbulences that in the past caused recessions in Chile, today are manifested only as changes in the pace of growth.   To this end, monetary policy operates through several channels. Primarily, it regulates market liquidity and it sets, through open market operations, an interest rate for the provision of liquidity to the financial system at very short terms. By way of these two mechanisms it affects market interest rates, which are the ones that influence asset prices and economic agents’ decisions.  The effectiveness of monetary policy therefore depends on the operation of these mechanisms at different levels. First, the Bank's ability to ensure the provision of liquidity is critical, as it maintains market interest rates aligned with the MPR. This is done regularly through open market operations and the Bank itself operates systems that allow these operations to be carried out with the appropriate standards. There may be cases where there is a sudden rise in market rates, because players in the system are faced with potential or actual liquidity constraints. Such a situation occurred in 2008, when events associated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers swept over the world economy. On that occasion, the Bank announced to the market that it would resort to exceptional liquidity provision mechanisms in pesos and dollars, which allowed local rates not to be altered, despite severe external risks.   Although the Bank's monetary policy instrument is the short-term interest rate, its movements affect the complete yield curve. The effectiveness of changes in the MPR in this area hinges on the credibility of the Bank's decisions as perceived by economic agents. Here there are several areas, within which communication and transparency of decisions are essential. To the extent that individuals and companies understand and validate the Bank's decisions, their consumption and investment decisions will be consistent with the described scenarios, as well as with asset prices and market rates. For these reasons, the Bank makes special efforts be transparent and to communicate its decisions and scenarios in the best possible way. We publish a wide range of information 
 10  and all members of the Board are constantly making presentations to raise awareness of the Bank's vision, among many other efforts.  Other important factors in the effectiveness of monetary policy are the changes in the external scenario. Being a small, open economy, Chile is subject to the vagaries of other countries. As we have said time and again, we can cushion their effects, but we cannot isolate ourselves from them. In that sense, significant fluctuations in the external scenario that, for example, produce unexpected or major changes in capital flows and external financial conditions, could affect local market rates. Again, the Bank's ability to provide liquidity that compensates for possible changes in external conditions is vital. The example of 2008 I just described is relevant here too.  It will not go unnoticed that several of these mechanisms also affect economic activity. For example, to the extent that a reduction of the MPR is properly transmitted to the cost of interbank funding, financial institutions may offer better credit conditions to their clients or, based on a better spread, bring to their portfolio of clients people and companies that were left out before because of, for example, a higher risk assessment. At the same time, as people and companies see a more attractive offer of credit in terms of amounts or costs, they will decide to spend and thereby boost activity.  Central banks are often caricatured as obsessed with inflation and indifferent to economic activity. Nothing further from the reality. The deviations of growth are very relevant for the evolution of inflation in the medium term, which means they play a fundamental role in our actions. The closer GDP is to its potential, the closer inflation will be to its medium-term target. Moreover, in the great majority of cases, monetary policy influences economic activity and inflation in the same direction, which is not surprising since both tend to correlate within the business cycle. This is especially important when the economy is in a weak phase of the cycle and a monetary stimulus can raise inflation and boost domestic demand. In any case, one must always keep in mind whether a persistent drop in activity is the result of a cyclical problem in the economy or responds to a more permanent phenomenon, such as lower potential growth. In the latter case, it is not evident that the output gap is much wider in the face of a slowdown and, therefore, it is not evident that medium-term inflationary pressures are lower.  Again, the conduct of monetary policy of the past few years is a good example of how it implicitly ensures economic stability, as its stance remained expansionary even with annual inflation rates above 4%, understanding that they obeyed to an exceptional episode of exchange rate depreciation.  The prolonged period of low growth that Chile has endured in recent years has put downward pressures on medium-term inflation. Therefore, within this framework that I have described, monetary policy has been and will continue to be expansionary. Measuring how expansionary monetary policy is, is no easy task. Typically, the so-called neutral rate is used as a benchmark. Our most recent estimates, which we reported in a box in our Monetary Policy Report of last September, place it between 1% and 1.5% in real terms. With a real MPR that is now at zero and with the prospect of a further reduction in the near future, which we use as a working assumption for the baseline 
 11  scenario of this Report, there is no doubt that we are providing a considerable boost to the economy. Even more importantly, longer-term real rates are also below or around these levels, reflecting that the market considers that monetary policy not only is expansionary now, but is expected to remain so for some time, in line with the communications of the Bank itself.   The lower interest rates are reflected not only in the record-low level of risk-free rates, but also in that borrowing costs are now very low by historic standards. This applies both to mortgage loans and to commercial and consumer loans. The exchange rate has also reacted. In nominal terms, the peso is now about 35% below its levels of mid-2013. Compared with other countries, however, the behavior of our currency has been similar, so that multilateral and real depreciation have been less. Finally, from the perspective of other countries that have had cycles similar to ours, monetary policy rates in Chile are among the lowest in real terms.  Nonetheless, we must recognize that, even in normal situations, the effectiveness of monetary policy is not guaranteed, but depends on its correct implementation. This means respecting certain basic principles. Monetary policy, first and foremost, must be coherent with its policy framework and the situation of the country. This implies refraining from favoring short-term objectives, but rather calibrate the monetary impulse in such a way that projected inflation stands at 3% over a two-year horizon. Consistency is especially important to avoid unnecessary ups and downs in the economy causing market confusion.  Its implementation must also be timely, which requires having enough information for a better understanding of the economic environment, and acting promptly when changes occur. Obviously this entails taking some risks, as certainty is always elusive. One example of this may come from the recent evolution of monetary policy conduct in Chile. At our presentation before this Committee last December, we noted that our baseline scenario featured as a working assumption that the monetary stimulus would be boosted by 50 basis points, which would be done in the following months. New information convinced us that such impulse would need to be speeded up, so we took action in our monetary policy meetings of January and March. Moreover, the Report I am presenting you now uses a MPR trajectory that goes al little further as a working assumption. Also, as always, as circumstances change and the medium-term inflation outlook varies, monetary policy will be adjusted accordingly.  Furthermore, monetary policy and its underlying diagnosis must be persistent enough for it to influence economic decisions regarding saving, investment and pricing, which operate with significant lags. In Chile, estimates indicate that it takes from two to eight quarters for a MPR movement to completely pass through to the economy. Now, this can vary if economic conditions are complex or the magnitude of the impulse is estimated to be still not large enough. The events in the developed world during recent years provide a good example. After the crisis of 2008-2009 the Federal Reserve increased the monetary impulse beyond the usual limits set by the interest rate. It not only took it to zero percent, but it also added a quantitative boost through the purchase of bonds. In a normal environment, it probably would have been unnecessary to take the impulse to such extremes, and probably the economy would have taken less time to react. However, 
 12  the post-crisis damage was very large and only the persistence of the momentum has allowed the US economy to make a successful recovery after nine years. We see something similar in Europe, with the difference that they took longer to apply the stimulus, suffered a banking crisis in 2011 and, in addition, the very agreement procedures of the European Community make it more difficult to take extreme decisions.  Finally, as I said, monetary policy must be credible, in order for the economic agents’ reactions to its impulses to be in line with the objective. If inflation expectations are aligned with the two-year-ahead target of 3%, agents’ decisions, market interest rates, and financial asset prices will harmonize with low, stable inflation.  The need for persistence and credibility raises a warning about how inefficient an interest rate reduction may be if perceived as temporary by the market. This is very important, because in practice if agents consider that a rate cut will be very short lived, it will probably have no meaningful effect on the yield curve or on the decisions of households and businesses. Moreover, costs could outweigh the potential benefits. If agents consider the downturn not only to be ineffective but also to compromise the achievement of the inflation target, a much less expansionary monetary policy could be necessary to realign inflation expectations.  Thus, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on our ability to timely diagnose the state of the economy and its implications on inflation, to respond consistently in setting the policy rate, giving it sufficient persistence to operate and generate the necessary credibility for markets to respond in accordance with the expected results of these interventions. At the Central Bank we are committed to ensuring these conditions. With this, monetary policy will continue to contribute to the country's welfare by maintaining low and stable inflation, cushioning the volatility of the business cycle.  Likewise, although the Central Bank does not have the instruments to directly influence the growth potential of the country, it can indirectly contribute by preventing the loss of welfare that results from economic volatility; reducing uncertainty to encourage investment, production, employment and consumption decisions, and contributing to make the financial sector safer and more efficient for the benefit of the entire population.  Thank you.

 1       When Bank of England governor Mark Carney gave his famous speech on climate change almost two years ago, he mentioned ‘the tragedy of the horizon’. He was referring to how the catastrophic impact of climate change will be felt beyond our traditional horizon – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no incentive to fix.   The country where I’m from is a striking example of this phenomenon. One quarter of the Netherlands lies below sea level. This area is home to nearly one third of the population, and the heart of our economy. Although we are highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming, we still have one of the most carbon-intensive economies in Europe. As well as being heavy oil and gas consumers, we are also a major producer and exporter of it. So perhaps I’m not in the best position to preach to the world about the risks of climate change. But as a representative of an organization whose mission is to safeguard financial stability and contributing to sustainable prosperity in the Netherlands, climate change is a serious concern for me.  Fortunately, a number of recent events have presented us with a new horizon, the horizon for action on climate change. The most notable of these is the Paris Climate Agreement, which entered into force last November. I will briefly mention the unfortunate recent development in that respect later on, but today I’d like to concentrate on what this action on climate change might look like. I’d also like to offer some observations on the importance of managing climate-related risks for you as financial institutions. And lastly I want to provide you with an insight into the business opportunities that are available to you. And as the right rules and incentives are introduced, these opportunities will only become ever more numerous and attractive.   The theme of this conference is ‘Responding to Sustainability Regulation.’ What I want to stress to you is that, rather than waiting for the regulators, you must act now: To manage climate-related risks and seize the opportunities that the transition to a low-carbon economy offers. In the words of Axel Weber, written on the invitation to this conference: ‘Finance is about seizing opportunities and managing risk.’ That’s the spirit of the British financial sector. That is what you’re good at.  So what could this action look like? After decades of scientific research on climate change, we have now entered the era of action. Climate change is no longer exclusively the preserve of scientists. Today it is also a challenge for policymakers and business people. A crucial driver of this is the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement establishes a global commitment to limit global warming to well under two degrees Celsius. Very importantly, it provides for monitoring the reduction of emissions, and forges a pathway for more ambitious efforts, if current policies fall short of that goal. The Paris agreement has sent out a very strong signal that policymakers and regulators will intensify their efforts over the coming years.   
 2  The fact that the United States has withdrawn its support is of course no small setback. But I am confident that the international community will rally together, set the right example, and press on with implementing the Paris agreement. Today’s announcement of a climate accord between the State of California and China is a vivid example of this.   China, once being amongst the world’s largest polluters, is now becoming one of the global champions of renewable energy. Just a few days ago, the EU and China reinforced commitments to the Paris Agreement, pledging to:  - cut back on fossil fuels - develop more green technology and  - help raise $100 billion a year by 2020, to help poorer countries cut their emissions. So despite the setback, this is an encouraging development.   Numerous other initiatives, both on the national and international level, are already underway. Allow me to name a few. At the end of 2015 the Financial Stability Board launched a private sector Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Led by Michael Bloomberg, the task force also draws its members from the British financial sector, including UBS. The consultation period for the report ended just a few days ago. The report contains recommendations for an efficient and voluntary framework for climate-related financial disclosures. And these recommendations can be used by companies across all sectors.  The potential impact of this framework, when put in practice, can hardly be overstated. For the first time, it will provide investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders with information about the concentrations of carbon-related assets in the economy and exposures to climate-related risks. Reliable, comparable and forward-looking information that will significantly improve your ability to assess, for example, how exposed potential investment targets are to the clean energy transition, and what they intend to do about it. Information that is crucial for kick-starting a functioning market for climate-related risk.  At a European level, the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance will submit its interim report to the European Commission within the coming weeks. The Group’s mission is to provide recommendations on hardwiring sustainability into the EU’s regulatory and financial policy framework, identifying obstacles to sustainability in finance, and mobilizing more capital flows for sustainable investments.   I have the privilege of being a Group observer, so I can already tell you that the interim report will contain policy options that will be both concrete and far-reaching. It is now too early to go into any detail, but I would urge all of you to closely study it once it comes out and participate actively in the public consultation.  It is also important to pay attention to prudential regulation of financial institutions: incorporating climate factors in the risk management of banks and insurance companies will become both a mainstream and a regulatory requirement. And this will happen sooner rather than later. Regulators don’t even have to completely change the rules for this. After all, already under current regulations, financial institutions must manage all relevant risks. Well, climate change is a relevant risk. Financial supervisors could implement this focus on climate risk management tomorrow. As a matter of fact, we do. In my view, all should.   
 3  Similarly, financial institution should be aware that regulations on disclosure of sustainability factors, including climate risk, are likely to be tightened. For instance, in France, specific reporting obligations are already set out for a range of financial institutions, on how they should integrate sustainability factors in their risk management. Regulators could also encourage or require sustainability knowledge and competence of board members, for example as part of fit and proper testing.  And that’s not all. Government intervention will not be confined to the financial sector, but will cover the entire economy. The UK, back in 2008, was the first country in the world to enact comprehensive general climate legislation. More and more countries, from Sweden to Mexico, from France to Singapore, are following up on their commitments under the Paris Agreement by adopting and implementing climate transition laws. The Dutch Central Bank has publicly advocated for a climate law being passed in the Netherlands as well. These laws are intended to provide a predictable pathway to a low-carbon economy. These include clear targets, and new regulation to meet them on time.   The point of all this is not to give you a comprehensive overview of all the new regulation coming at us, but to signal that when it comes to climate change: governments mean business. And that has profound implications for the risks and opportunities your company faces. And even the greatest climate sceptic on Earth cannot afford to ignore these risks. At the same time, new regulation will create great opportunities for those who invest with foresight. And as the financial sector, seizing opportunities and managing risks is your core business.  Being a prudential regulator, you’ll forgive me if I start by discussing the risks.  There are generally two types of climate-related risk. First, physical risks: the impact today on insurance liabilities and the value of financial assets arising from climate-related events, such as floods and storms that damage property or disrupt trade. Second, transition risk: the financial risks that could result from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and physical risks could prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as costs and opportunities become apparent.   While some are still debating the scientific evidence for climate change, representatives of the insurance industry know that physical climate risks are already a reality, affecting their underwriting strategies. As Governor Carney stated in his climate speech, a Lloyd’s of London study estimated that the twenty centimeter rise in sea-level around Manhattan since the 1950s increased insured losses from superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone.  Ever since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 led to serious losses, the insurance industry has used natural catastrophe models to analyse and measure risk more accurately. Use of these instruments is now the norm. Insurers therefore seem well-prepared to manage physical risks in the near term.   But further ahead, beyond the typical insurer’s horizon, previously unimagined levels of physical risk could shift the balance between premiums and claims significantly. This threatens solvency, and may even make some risks uninsurable. If high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, scientist predict that oceans could rise by close to two meters by the end of this century. Just think of the threat to the combined value of coastal property. And by the way, this estimate could turn out to be on the conservative side, given current uncertainties surrounding the stability of the Antarctic ice shelfs.  
 4  While physical risks pose a serious threat, transition risks may be even more important for financial institutions. Transition risk could also be called the risk of success. Take for example the commitment made in Paris to limit global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius. Estimates vary, but it is certain that the remaining budget for carbon emission relating to this target will make large amounts of existing reserves of oil, gas and coal unusable. The exposure of financial institutions to the resulting write-offs of these stranded assets and the repricing of companies is potentially huge, and could pose a threat to financial stability. Possible delays in policy changes do not remove these risks, but magnify them. This is because we may see more significant and abrupt policy changes and market adjustments further down the road. This is very important: the longer we wait, the more radical the measures need to be.  What I want to stress to you is that despite the uncertainty, or even controversy, about the pace at which new policies are implemented, financial institutions and regulators have to take transition risks into account. Also here, the horizon for action is approaching fast. Climate-related risk is rapidly becoming a mainstream risk that financial institutions have to manage, using for example scenario analysis. And it’s not just the regulators. Increasingly, markets and investors are asking: how do you model and identify relevant trends and risks? How robust are your strategies given different scenarios and contingencies? Some institutional investors see climate risk management as a key indicator for the quality of board-level risk management.   Similarly, if you’re an investor, and you’re not already asking questions about how companies you invest in approach these risks, then it’s high time you did.  We’ve looked at the risks. Now let’s turn to the opportunities. Financing the transition to a decarbonized economy presents a major opportunity for financial institutions. It implies a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution. Estimates for investments required in areas such as efficiency improvements, renewable energy, nuclear energy, carbon capture and storage amount to as much as 1 trillion euro annually. Technological innovation is assisting this transition. This includes developing efficient heating solutions, advances in LED lighting technology, utilizing geothermal power, and developing electric vehicles.   I know there is still considerable uncertainty about the potential returns on these investments. But I expect this uncertainty to diminish significantly as international disclosure standards make climate risk more transparent, and governments introduce clarity by setting targets, rules and deadlines. This has the potential to transform green investment from a niche market into a major investment class of its own..  Let me give you an example of how public policy can kick-start a whole new market for green investment: early this year the Dutch housing ministry introduced new rules requiring all commercial real estate in the Netherlands to have an energy rating label of C or better as of 2023. Buildings that fail to meet this requirement can no longer be used as offices. Dutch banks are getting involved by adding surcharges to, or outright withholding, funding for non-sustainable buildings. At the same time they are offering energy efficiency plans and financing to owners that need to upgrade their buildings. Expectations are that the estimated 860 million euro in investments necessary to meet the target will be realized much earlier than 2023.  There are more examples. I name but two: All new public transportations busses in The Netherlands will be emission-free as of 2025. According to current government policy in The Netherlands the same holds true for all new passenger cars of 2035. 
 5   My expectation is that this process will play itself out over and over again in an increasing number of sectors within the economy. Public authorities will set deadlines. Deadlines for zero-emissions/climate neutrality to be reached by a certain date:  • in public transportation • in shipping • in aviation • in housing • in agriculture • in manufacturing etc etc  And the private sector will jump on the opportunity. And often beat the deadline. As it makes business sense to do so.  After all, by acting now, financial institutions have a first mover advantage over their competitors. They can build up specialized knowledge that is valuable for assessing risk and return. For example, over 90% of wind farms in the Netherlands are financed by one bank. The same argument applies to all kinds of financing for frontrunners in sustainability. Despite uncertainty over how public regulation will develop, there is still plenty of opportunity for no-regret actions.  Ladies and gentlemen,  International consensus has been growing for some time that climate change is an urgent problem. What is new is the growing resolve among governments across the globe to do something about it. And I am convinced that the recent setback because of the decision of the present US administration will serve only to strengthen the resolve of the global community, including many, many public and private actors in the US, and foster even greater international cooperation.   Both climate change and government action will create new risks and opportunities. Risks and opportunities that you can and should anticipate today. So sit around the table with your authorities to discuss the obstacles for sustainable finance, and what changes in regulation are necessary. As our experiences with the Platform on Sustainable Finance in the Netherlands show, your input is highly valuable.  Don’t get me wrong: I am not here to sell you anything. As a regulator it is not my place to convince you to start financing green investment, or to buy green bonds just for the sake of it. Some of you may even be skeptical about the scientific evidence for climate change, still others may doubt the ability of governments to take action. Coming from an oil and gas-addicted little country below sea level, I would understand you for not believing me.  But you don’t have to. As uniform disclosure standards start to be adopted better information will become available about the carbon intensity of companies, and how they manage their risks and prepare for a low-carbon world. Information that will allow you to assess for yourselves how their valuations might change over time, and what the risk is to your capital. Information that brings the horizon more sharply into focus.  
 6  On this very day, 6th of June, 73 years ago as part of operation Overlord 62,000 British soldiers crossed the Channel to liberate Western Europe from barbarism. Churchill said of the Normandy landings:  “This vast operation is undoubtedly the most difficult that has ever occurred.  It involves tides, wind, waves, and contact with conditions which cannot be fully foreseen.”   Those soldiers overcame the challenge brilliantly by showing courage, devotion and skill. And I believe this spirit is still alive and well in the British business community. It’s the spirit that does not walk away from a challenge, but stands up to meet it, and turns it into an opportunity. Not oblivious to risk and danger, but with your minds and motives sharpened by it. Aware that what is in your company’s interest also helps preserve a world that is rapidly changing.  The challenge today is called climate change. Let’s be aware of the risks and turn them into opportunities.  Ladies and gentlemen I wish you a productive, stimulating and memorable conference.  Thank you. 
Donald Joshua Jaganathan: Enterprise risk management -harnessing disruptionOpening remarks by Mr Donald Joshua Jaganathan, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Institute of Enterprise Risk Practitioners (IERP) AnnualConference 2017 “Enterprise Risk Management – Harnessing Disruption”, Kuala Lumpur, 23May 2017*   *   *It is my pleasure to have the honour of addressing you this morning. I would first like to take thisopportunity to congratulate the organisers for successfully gathering an array of distinguishedspeakers to share their broad-ranging and invaluable experiences. The breadth of theprogramme over the next few days reflects how vast the area of Enterprise Risk Management(ERM) has evolved, and how much there is for risk managers today to discover, learn andmaster. In my speech this morning, please allow me to share my thoughts on risk management,amid the so-called “age of disruption”.Technology and risk managementAmongst all ‘disruptions’ witnessed thus far, perhaps none have been as forceful and impactfulas technological disruptions.  Take the smartphone, its use has permeated almost every aspectof our daily lives and has become almost like another limb for some of us. I’m no longer wokenup by an alarm clock, nor do I read the papers on “paper” or take photos on a camera. In thepalm of my hand I hold a music player, internet browser, GPS navigator, torchlight, andcompass, even a wallet in more and more places. With a couple of taps I can hail a cab, andmonitor my home CCTV, or buy any number of goods from across the world, which might, in thenot too distant future, be delivered to my doorstep by a flying drone.Given how extensively technology has altered our world today, being technology savvy hasbecome a crucial requirement for risk managers today. In what seems like a blink of an eye,companies like Uber, Waze and Airbnb which barely existed a decade ago have becomehousehold names. Now valued in the billions, they are a source of income for thousands ofpeople across the globe, and are shaping our modern economy in a myriad of ways.Technological savviness is crucial for two reasons. First, technology can be harnessed toimprove business operations and enhance risk management.  Secondly, it allows us to quicklyidentify and respond to new sources of risks emanating from technological developments.The potential of technology in risk management is vast, not only for the automation of tasks, butincreasingly as a tool for making business decisions as well. The application of big data analyticsand artificial intelligence to assess and predict human behaviour, for instance, can provide greatvalue to businesses in terms of reducing risks.  In the motor insurance sector for example,General Motors Assurance in the US has been utilising mileage and driving behaviours capturedthrough in-vehicle telecommunication devices. Telematics,as this approach is called, enablesthe incorporation of personalised information distinct to the policyholder in setting insurancepremium prices and rewards those who continuously maintain good driving standards – a win-win situation for both the insurers who mitigate their underwriting risk and consumers who benefitfrom lower premiums.Technology has also advanced to a level where machines’ capabilities extend beyond simpletasks, but also able to carry out complicated tasks by professionals more quickly and efficiently.A bank in the US, for example, has created a machine-learning programme to sieve through andreview legal contracts in mere seconds, saving 360,000 of labour hours which are better spenton more productive tasks. It is an ideal worker – having a low margin for error which minimisesthe occurrence of costly mistakes, and better yet, never gets ill or asks for leave. Of course, 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
investments in technology may be expensive and returns may not be immediate. It is,nevertheless, not a choice and it is crucial to start early. Not innovating along with the latesttechnology should not only be seen as lost opportunities, but also lead to risk of your businessbeing rendered obsolete.Business transactions and financial services are becoming more digitised and reliant on theinternet. Alongside this, the extent of technology risks and the level of sophistication of cyber-attacks are rapidly expanding. There is a need for risk managers to be quick in identifying andresponding to cyber risks. With increasing dependence on information technology, institutionsare faced with numerous threats such as distributed denial of service, malicious hacking andvirus attacks which affect vital services provided to customers. Barely a week ago, thevulnerability of major organisations to such attacks was laid bare when a massive “ransomware”virus hit up to 300,000 computers across 150 countries including Malaysia. Judging from itsname, the “WannaCry” virus clearly achieved its aim as users found themselves locked out fromtheir computers and their data held at ransom. A host of organisations were left reeling in thewake of these cyber extortion attacks, including the Russian interior ministry, delivery andshipping giant FedEx and the UK’s National Health Service where some hospitals were unable toperform operations, putting patients’ lives at stake.There is also the danger of phishing and stealing of confidential customer data which coulddestroy the trust placed on your company. Yahoo!, one of the internet’s top sites with a billionmonthly users, suffered a massive security breach in 2014 when hackers stole the personaldetails of at least one billion user accounts. The implications are far-reaching as a stolen digitalidentity makes us vulnerable to manipulation and undermines the safety of, not just ourselves,but also the ones we love. Bank accounts, social media profiles and even medical informationcan be abused to put us and our family in harm’s way. In the months following the hackingrevelations, more than five billion dollars was wiped off Yahoo’s market capitalisation. This wasnot an isolated incident and sadly, many more companies could fall victim to cyber-attacks. Lastmonth, a report by cyber security consultancy CGI Group and Oxford Economics estimated thatsevere cyber-attacks have cost shareholders losses exceeding £42 billionsince 2013 as a resultof falling share prices. And this does not even include the damage from lost consumerconfidence which is not easily rebuilt.These cases of cyber-attacks serve as a wake-up call to risk managers, as lagging behind in thelatest technology is no longer an option. Missing the boat can bring dire consequences, not onlytobusinesses but also to the overall safety and soundness of the socio-economic and financialsystem. Recognising this, technology risk has been one of the top priorities of Bank Negara.Allow me to share some of the Bank’s efforts thus far:a.     In March this year, Bank Negara began testing current institutional capabilities in managingcyber threats. Malaysian banks were required to participate in the National Cyber Drill exercise,and the results showed that the millions invested on modern security countermeasures havepaid off, with our banks remaining resilient. Notwithstanding this however, the key message isthat we must be vigilant. We must be alert. We must be prepared.b.     A key tool in identifying IT security vulnerabilities is the practice of penetration testing or“pen-testing”, where a simulated attack is carried out on IT systems by “ethical hackers”. As partof the efforts to improve the standard of pen-testing in Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia facilitatedthe formation of a task force last October, to set up a Malaysia chapter of the UK-based Councilof Registered Ethical Security Testers or CREST, which will serve as a certification body forethical hackers. We believe that this is a good platform to grow domestic talent in this area andpromote international best practices in penetration testing.c.      The Bank has also launched the Operational Risk Integrated Online Network or commonlyknown in the industry as the ORION system, to enhance the standard of operational risk 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
management in the financial sector. ORION is a risk surveillance system that consolidatesinformation on operational risk incidences, including cyber-attacks. The system will strengthenthe Bank’s ability to perform system-wide monitoring and early detection of developing trends incyber-attacks and frauds within the financial sector.Moving forward, Bank Negara Malaysia is looking to address identified gaps in technology riskmanagement practices within the financial sector. As part of this effort, the Bank is in the midst ofconducting a comprehensive review of existing technology risk guidelines, including enhancingthe expectations for the board and senior management to play a more active role in managingtechnology risk, and enhancing the resilience of IT infrastructures such as data centres.In today’s world where there is increasing uncertainty of what the future may hold, it is no longerpossible for risk managers to rely solely on historical trends. The 2008 subprime crisis is atextbook example of how backward-looking data is not a good indicator for the future economicenvironment. Hence, organisations need to be pragmatic and shift towards more forward-lookingand proactive risk identification, assessment and management. In a recent financial industrysurvey conducted by the Bank to gauge the top operational risks among financial institutions, it isevident that most financial institutions are still focused only on “typical” risks such as card fraudand operational errors, rather than proactively anticipating and preparing against emerging risks.This has to change. In this regard, the Bank highly encourages pre-emptive and forward-lookingrisk management practices such as scenario analysis to anticipate the potential impact of futurethreats to an organisation and provide sufficient time for remedial actions to be taken.Incorporating culture into risk managementLet me now move on to another element that a good risk manager cannot ignore, which is theimportance of incorporating culture into enterprise risk management. At the heart of everycorporate scandal is the failure of the people at different levels of the institution to uphold thehighest standards of ethical behaviour and integrity. This is the reason why organisations need todo more than just comply with rules and regulations.  The accounting scandal at a majorJapanese conglomerate recently, illustrates this point. The company was once seen asexemplary in corporate governance. Such was its reputation that it frequently appeared as acase study in books on governance. We now know that the truth was quite the opposite, withfindings that top executives were involved in accounting malpractices over the past seven years.The reality was that while its governance structure looked good on paper, its execution had beenmarred by its organisational culture. According to the investigation report, top management wassystematically involved in the inflation of numbers and drove the company into a place whereprofits were paramount. The number of similar cases reported in the media highlights howdetrimental poor internal culture can be for any organisation, not only in terms of financial lossesand the imposition of hefty regulatory fines, but also a potential permanent blow to the company’sreputation.Risk culture, in my view, is a key factor in determining the robustness and effectiveness of riskmanagement in an institution. At Bank Negara, there has also been increasing focus onpreserving the integrity and trust in our financial sector. Last year, the Bank published theenhanced Corporate Governance framework for financial institutions in Malaysia. Theenhancements relate to expectations for the board and senior management to set the right “tonefrom the top” and play a more critical role in shaping the core values and culture of the institution.This includes expanded requirements on compensation practices and disclosures to strengthenmarket discipline, as well as putting in place a transparent whistleblowing policy that enables theescalation of concerns without the risk of reprisal.More recently in April, the Bank published the Code of Conduct for the Malaysian WholesaleFinancial Markets to promote high standards of conduct and transparency in the domesticwholesale financial markets. The code is a binding obligation and it sets out the Bank’s 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
expectations for market participants to adhere to professional and ethical standards of conduct.The Bank views this standard as critical and timely in light of the incidences of ringgit-rate fixingmisconduct and also involvement in the opaque NDF market.Another important aspect of preserving the integrity in the industry is by maintaining strictmembership requirements for all participants. As an industry riding on trust as the main vehiclefor business, the financial sector cannot afford to be tainted by the actions of a few bad apples.Any unscrupulous behaviour exhibited by a player should not be tolerated and be weeded outimmediately from the industry. To protect the financial ecosystem, each organisation has theresponsibility to investigate any misconduct and record the outcomes to allow other institutions inthe market to make informed decisions on the ability of a person to serve with professionalismand integrity. In this regard, the Bank is currently pursuing an initiative that will mandate thesharing of employment references with future employers to mitigate the problem of ‘rolling badapples’ within the Malaysian financial industry.Specific and rules-based regulations, while able to lead institutions in the right direction, do notguarantee the internalisation of such values within bankers nor are they dynamic enough to catchup with new ways of breaching ethics. Therefore, the Bank will also be expanding its supervisoryfocus on financial institutions beyond balance sheet ratios, and incorporating organisationalculture in our radar such as tone from the top, echo from below, accountability, communication,remuneration and performance management. This is a challenging but necessary task thatrequires creativity in exploring unconventional supervisory approaches including interviews andquestionnaires for employees of financial institutions among others..Risk management as part of business strategyFinally, risk managers must move away from merely compliance and loss prevention. Riskmanagers must reposition themselves to be more engaged in strategic business decisionswithin their respective organisations. Chief Risk Officers (CROs) must have a broad andindependent view of the organisation, with an ability to anticipate potential disruptions and toinfluence decision-making. However, according to a global survey conducted by PwC last year,only 1/3 of risk officers view themselves as part of the business. Especially now in the age ofdisruption, risk managers should not view themselves as mere compliance officers or themundane department that says ‘no’ to exciting business opportunities. Instead, risk managersneed to also think in terms of finding the right risk-return trade-off. Risk management must gobeyond the prevention of losses and play an active role in driving business sustainability andenhancing shareholder value.Given the importance of enterprise risk management, efforts need to be directed to giveprominence to this function. It is time for the stature of risk functions to be elevated. Professionalbodies like the IERP play a crucial role in stewarding this transformation by equipping riskmanagement experts and raising their credibility through branding and professional qualifications.Events like this conference can help propel the risk management agenda forward. However,beyond technical competency, risk managers increasingly require confidence andcommunication skills to be the resounding voice in promoting risk culture. Risk managers needto have a seat at the executive table and play a role in shaping the risk profile and risk culture ofyour organisations. A study conducted by Harvard Business School highlights how leadershipand communication by risk managers can influence the significance of their role withinorganisations. As expected, the study found that risk managers that proactively soughtopportunities to raise their visibility were able to assert risk management perspectives and werebetter able to position themselves as critical voices within organisations.Ladies and gentlemenThe task of a risk manager in an organisation is like that of a ship navigator. As you work closely 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
with your captain to navigate your ship across unknown waters, your job is to ensure you getyour ship to its destination in one piece. You never know what hazards may lie ahead butwhether it be foul weather, rough seas or hostile forces, you stand ever ready to face them. Thethings that set great risk managers apart, like great navigators, are their ability to work with theircaptain and crew as a unit, their skills at employing the tools at their disposal to deal with risks athand, and their attention to their surroundings for signs of impending threats.With that, I wish you all a smooth-sailing journey ahead and a productive and fruitful conferenceover the next two days. Thank you. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Ed Sibley: Non-performing loans – the Irish perspective on aEuropean problemSpeech by Mr Ed Sibley, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the second annualconference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2017.*   *   *IntroductionGood morning.  It is a pleasure to be invited to speak at the second annual ESRB conference.As the Chair and previous panellists have noted, non-performing loans (NPLs) have manydimensions. They affect the credit supply channel, impact on banks’ financing costs, bringuncertainty to banks’ capital position, and block-up capital that could otherwise be used for moreeconomically and socially useful activities. They also cause considerable distress for borrowers.In short, they can cause serious dysfunction for the banking system and hence its ability to servethe economy and its customers. For me, as a member of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) Supervisory Board, NPLsclearly remain one of the central challenges facing the European banking sector today.NPLs go to the heart of banking – both its simplicity and its complexity. Because credit, likebanking more generally, ultimately requires trust. High levels of NPLs can erode that trust andconfidence in the banking system.  In my remarks today, I would first like to reflect on this issue of trust. I will then elaborate on theIrish experience, pointing to some of the measures and solutions we took regarding NPLs.Finally, I would like to draw on some of the key lessons from the Irish experience, which arerelevant to the broader trajectory for Europe going forward.Trust and NPLsBoth maturity transformation and credit intermediation ultimately rely on trust.At its simplest, depositors need to trust that when they put their money into a bank they havecertainty of being able to withdraw that money in the future. Similarly, banks need to trust thatwhen they gather these deposits, and lend at longer maturities, they will either be repaid, or inextremis be able to enforce collateral. This requires trust in the legal, judicial or extra-judicialprocesses.However, we have all seen how trust can evaporate very quickly in times of crises. And, asFrancis Fukuyama notes, “widespread distrust in a society….. imposes a kind of tax on all formsof economic activity”.While trust and confidence may be considered intangibles, the quantitative impacts aredemonstrated through hard numbers. For example, investor mistrust will be reflected in lowerprice to book ratios; banks’ mistrust will be reflected in elevated interest rates to compensate forhigher risk; potential new entrants and consolidators mistrust will be reflected in the reducedlikelihood of entering markets with higher NPLs, and so on. Authorities, including supervisors, therefore have a critical role in ensuring trust within thesystem.The SSM is close to three years in operation. It is still a relatively new institution. Much has been12 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
done to establish its reputation as an effective, intrusive, and independent supervisor.This trust is hard-earned and easily lost. By taking the necessary decisions, by doing the rightthings we will continue to earn the trust of the European public and market participants. And thisincludes taking firm action in relation to NPLs.But it is not easy.  We must consider financial stability issues, and perhaps less obviously forsome prudential supervisors – but crucially nonetheless – consumer protection matters. Prudential supervision and consumer protection are inherently interlinked and mutually self-reinforcing. Poor outcomes for consumers are poor outcomes for the banking system.Although the ECB does not have an explicit mandate for consumer protection, many NationalCompetent Authorities – such as the Central Bank of Ireland – do. Even were that not the case, itis important that intrusive prudential supervision should not come at the cost of the consumer.And this is particularly relevant for action on NPLs, which by its very nature relate to dealing withdistressed borrowers – that may, for example, be at risk of losing their family home, or smallenterprises that are providing local employment. Indeed, ensuring that borrowers are protected remains at the heart of the Central Bank ofIreland’s approach to NPLs.  This is a fundamental aim in its own right, but it is also important inrebuilding trust in the Irish financial system more broadly following the crisis.I am cognisant that there is much more to be done in this regard, and the remaining high level ofNPLs is a significant drag on rebuilding this trust across the system.The Irish experience with NPLsThis brings me to our own experience in Ireland.   The Irish banking sector has been transformed since the start of the crisis. Intensive supervisoryfocus and pressure coupled with improved economic circumstances continue to drive reductionsin NPLs.Nevertheless, NPLs levels remain elevated and their sustainable resolution remains a keysupervisory priority.This chart helps to illustrate this story, and the increasingly intrusive actions that have been takento drive NPL reduction:3 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Source: Central Bank of Ireland regulatory returns. At Q3 2014 the EBA’s harmonised definitionof non-performing was introduced. Prior to this date, an internal definition was used equivalent toimpaired loans and/or arrears > 90 days.Prior to the crash Irish bank balance sheets expanded considerably, with domestic Irish banksmore than tripling their size. This increase was heavily driven by property related exposuresfacilitated by weak lending standards and practices (e.g. high LTVs) and ultimately unsustainablebusiness models.The economic downturn and bursting of the property bubble resulted in large bank losses (the sixlargest banks lost approximately €67.8bn between 2008 and 2012).The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was established in December 2009 as one of anumber of initiatives taken by the Irish authorities to address the serious problems in the bankingsector. The Agency acquired the largest commercial real estate and connected exposures heldby the Irish banks, with a nominal value of €74bn.  The objective was to deal with the largest andmost problematic loans in the banking system and to, subsequently, obtain the best achievablefinancial return for the State on this portfolio over an expected lifetime of up to ten years.Interestingly though, as the chart above shows, NPLs – amounting to €85.3bn – only peaked inIreland in Q4 2013, with an NPL ratio of 31.8%, more than two years after loans were transferredto NAMA. So, although NAMA was clearly a critical part of the solution to dealing with the bankingcrisis in Ireland – particularly with respect to the larger commercial real estate loans – it was byno means the silver bullet some people may think for resolving Irish NPLs overall, as SME andmortgage loans remained a serious and growing problem.  Of critical importance during 2010 and 2011 was ensuring that the banks were adequatelycapitalised, impairments were recognised, and adequately provided for. The work involved anassessment of asset quality, and stress testing the banks’ balance sheets.  An important milestone was the work conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland during theFinancial Measures Programme (FMP). Under the FMP, a balance sheet assessment and stresstest exercise was completed in 2011 and resulted in a total capitalisation requirement of €24bnfor the going-concern banks.4 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Following the recapitalisation in 2011, which we must not forget was at a catastrophic cost to theIrish taxpayer, our supervisory focus turned to banks’ NPL resolution strategies and capabilities. They were wholly inadequate.The Irish banks remained too slow to recognise the problem and in many cases were stillreluctant to deal with it.   Furthermore, they did not have credible strategies, nor the operationalcapability to resolve it.   Indeed, there are short-term incentives for individual banks andmanagement to try and avoid resolving large scale NPLs, in the hope that economic recovery willdeal with the problem.  But evidence shows that while this reluctance may be understandable atan individual bank level, the macro impact of not dealing with NPLs is highly problematic for thesystem as a whole.The Central Bank of Ireland therefore became more prescriptive and expectations were clearlyset out to the banks, including: segment specific strategies, detailed implementation plans, andenhanced board ownership.Key elements included banks setting out clear plans on how they were going to address NPLs.Portfolio specific NPL strategies, for example, Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies (MARS)were required from the main lenders. Banks’ boards were required to approve these strategiesencompassing the fair treatment of customers and ensuring adequate capabilities to deal witheach customer.Consumer protection measures such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears andenhanced SME protections ran alongside and were interlinked with the prudential measures.We assessed each lender’s strategy and plans, and reverted with firm-specific feedback, followup actions and timelines in early 2012.  While operational capability had been improved, weremained concerned that banks were overly reliant on short term forbearance or “extend andpretend” strategies.  In other words, they were still dragging their feet.So, to press banks to implement longer term sustainable solutions, we introduced MortgageArrears Resolution Targets, underpinned by giving guidance on our view on sustainable solutionsthat both protected engaging borrowers as well as driving resolution. We also introduced non-public SME Targets for banks.You will also see that the Central Bank introduced and subsequently updated provisioningguidelines to ensure that there was consistency and conservatism in the recognition andprovisioning of NPLs.Towards the end of the Programme, in 2013, we then repeated the exercise of assessing thestrength of the banks’ balance sheets, the adequacy of capital and the recognition of NPLs.We challenged progress every step of the way, going to the outer edge of our remit to do so –challenging the organisational structure and resource capacity, challenging skills and experience,challenging governance and oversight, policies and procedures, workout strategies andexecution ability.We challenged the implementation of the plans, challenged credit management and impairmentrecognition, challenged provision coverage and collateral valuations, challenged short-term vssustainable resolutions.And we continue to challenge the Irish banks today.And while it is slower than I would like, this approach is working. This has been achieved throughbetter cohort by cohort borrower engagement strategies, working out and sustainablyrestructuring loans, and some portfolio sales. Importantly, legislation has been passed to enableborrower protections to travel with loans that have sold outside of the banking system.  4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Accounting write-offs have not yet featured to the extent warranted.NPLs in Ireland have reduced for fourteen consecutive quarters. It represents a 58% reductionfrom peak, a decrease of over €50bn.  In some ways, this graph understates the progress,because the NPL ratio has been materially reduced at the same time as there has been a verysizeable deleveraging in the system – loan books (both good and bad) in aggregate are muchreduced. But there remains much more to be done, primarily now on long past due mortgage arrears,which remain a blight for distressed borrowers, banks, and the system as a whole.The reason I am recalling recent Irish history, is that, in many respects the journey we took inIreland is now being followed at a European level.Asset quality and balance sheet strength has always been a priority for the SSM, as evidencedby the Comprehensive Assessment in 2014.  When it took on supervisory responsibility forEurope’s banks, the NPL outlook was diverse across the euro area. While certain countries’banking sectors had, and still have, low NPL ratios, it was recognised that even those countrieswhere banks were not struggling with asset quality, may be affected by spillovers.Through the Comprehensive Assessment, the SSM took early action to gain assurance thatproblem loans were recognised and that the system as a whole had sufficient capital to managethe problem, both under a base and stress scenario, in the same way as it had been done inIreland in 2010 / 2011.Yet NPLs have remained stubbornly high.  The banks’ responses to the NPL problem havedisappointed, in the same way as the Irish banks’ initial responses did. Issues regarding recognition and provisioning for NPLs persisted.  Strategies and capability fordealing with them were inadequate.  Individually, banks did not appear sufficiently incentivised toaddress the problem.  Furthermore, structural issues in different jurisdictions were causingsignificant issues.Following the establishment of an SSM NPL Taskforce, and much work on data collection andjurisdictional differences and approaches, in March this year, the ECB published the finalGuidance to banks on non-performing loans. The Guidance sets the SSM’s expectations on NPLmanagement – and prescribes that banks should implement ambitious yet realistic strategies toreduce their NPLs, using a very granular, portfolio-by-portfolio approach. They must also setinternal targets to reduce their NPLs. This does not necessarily mean portfolio sales.  The hardyards of engagement with distressed borrowers, workout, restructuring and right-sizing debtmust also be cornerstones of successful NPL reduction. Banks should also be taking actionthrough their accounts to reflect the reality of the collectability of long dated NPLs.Those strategies are currently under the scrutiny of the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs), andhave become the basis of the day-to-day supervisory dialogue with banks.It is still early in the process for the implementation of the Guidance, and many banks havesubmitted credible plans. However, many more still need to improve – indeed some were whollyinadequate and in those cases, banks have been required to resubmit.The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) continues to underpin the SSM’sapproach to NPL resolution – imposing quantitative capital and qualitative remediationrequirements as part of our annual risk assessment of each significant bank.Lessons from the Irish crisis5 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
I would like to highlight three key lessons from the Irish experience that are relevant from aEuropean perspective.Firstly, left to their own devices, individual banks will not resolve Europe’s NPL problem, nomatter that it is primarily their responsibility to do so.Intensive, courageous and outcomes-focused supervision is required.  And it is not just a one-offeffort – it needs to be continuous and persistent, driven by high quality analysis. When we get tothe end of the cycle of work we need to start again at the beginning.The ECB Guidance to banks on non-performing loans is therefore a very important step towardsNPL resolution across the European banking system.Secondly, it is clear from the Irish experience is that no single measure will resolve NPLs.Supervisors cannot solve it all alone.  What has helped Ireland is the combination of factors:including NAMA, increasingly intrusive and prescriptive supervisory measures, and some legalinitiatives. The interplay with economic recovery is obviously hugely important also.As highlighted by the July 2017 ECB stocktake report on national supervisory practice and legalframeworks related to NPLs, a number of structural obstacles still prevent banks from resolvingtheir NPLs in a timely fashion across the euro area. These include lengthy legal procedures, taxand indeed accounting impediments. Action on all fronts is therefore required – even if MemberStates do not have high levels of NPLs.Thirdly, the consequences of a credit boom gone bust are very severe, and can take a hugeamount of time to address.  Whilst we have made significant progress in addressing NPLs in theIrish banking system, NPL workout and resolution takes time, even with a buoyant economy.Early intervention is therefore critical in to achieve the best outcome for both borrowers andbanks. Moreover, intrusive supervision of current underwriting practices as well as continually assessingthe long term sustainability of business models are crucial to prevent recurrence, even as we arestill dealing with the legacies of the past mistakes.ConclusionMuch work remains for the Irish banks to do, and for European banks as a whole. First andforemost, banks must act themselves. But where they do not, or are too slow, or not ambitiousenough, it is our job as supervisors to drive them to do so.In the Central Bank of Ireland, we continue to work tirelessly to earn the trust of the Irish people,both in the work we do ourselves and in the financial system as a whole – such that it isdemonstrably serving the long term economic needs of the country and its customers in asustainable way.The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to play an active and supportive role in the SSM, as itcontinues to build its reputation and trust with the public and with the market, not least withrespect to our contribution to the ECB’s work on NPLs.Thank you for your attention, I look forward to the discussion.I would like to thank Mícheál O’Keeffe, John Cullen and David Duignan for their contribution to my remarks.Fukuyama, Francis. 1995.

Sabine Lautenschläger: European banking supervision -achievements, challenges and the way forwardSpeech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at the ESEConference 2017, Vienna, 28 September 2017.*   *   *“What does it mean to be human?” This question has preoccupied philosophers for hundreds ofyears. One of the more popular answers is that humans are rational animals – a view that goesback to Aristotle.Let us take that question and adapt it to our world: what does it mean to be a European bankingsupervisor? The answer is certainly not that banking supervisors are rational bankers.But apart from that, being a European banking supervisor means many things. First of all, itmeans looking across borders. It means being tough and fair, unbiased by national interests. Forus, it means being part of a team of supervisors from 19 countries and 27 institutions. It meansworking in the public interest – and having an exciting job.But it also means dealing with many challenges at the same time. And it is these challenges I’dlike to talk about in my speech. But as there are many and as our time is limited, I have to make achoice. So let me first tell you what I won’t do today.I won’t discuss the bringing together of cultures and languages that are very different. I won’tdiscuss dealing with banks that struggle to remain profitable. I won’t discuss digitalisation, and Iwon’t discuss Brexit.Instead, I will focus on three issues: first, the rulebook for banks and how it relates to supervision;second, the toolbox that supervisors have at their disposal; and third, the role of the market.Supervisors and the rulebookA solid rulebook is a cornerstone of a stable banking sector. It ensures that banks acknowledgethe risks they take and build up adequate buffers. A solid rulebook lays the foundations forbanking supervisors to do their job.Since the financial crisis, the rulebook for banks has been thoroughly revised. Today, banks facemuch tougher rules than before. They need to hold higher capital buffers that consist of bettercapital. At the same time, they need to hold liquidity buffers – for the first time ever. And these arejust two of the things that help to make banks more resilient.So the regulatory base has been made more solid. But it needs to be more than solid; it alsoneeds to be level. The rules for banks should, in general, be harmonised across countries. Onlythen would banks be able to compete on a level playing field.But what’s the scope for harmonisation? Here, we should be bold, in my view. The financialsector is global in scope, and so should be the rules that govern it. And after the crisis, it wasprecisely this idea that drove the work on a global rulebook: Basel III.But since then, the political landscape has changed. It seems that there are some who havestopped subscribing to the idea of a global approach to regulation. National interests might getthe upper hand, and that’s not good. Against that backdrop, we need to finalise Basel III as quicklyas possible. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
But having a global set of standards is just the first step. The second step is for all countries toimplement it in a consistent manner. That includes the euro area. Here, a level playing field iseven more important, given that we have a single currency and a single market.And there is indeed a single European rulebook. However, when you take a closer look, it turnsout that the single rulebook is not so single, after all. So, in fact, we still have a kind of regulatoryhotchpotch in Europe. How can that be?Well, one reason is that parts of the single rulebook come in the form of EU Directives. Andthese directives still have to be transposed into national law. That in turn opens the door forsignificant differences between countries.One of the many examples relates to what is known as “fit and proper” requirements. Bankdirectors have to fulfil certain criteria of competence and probity before they can take up their job.However, these criteria differ across the euro area. In some countries, they are quite strict, inothers less so. And as the ECB is bound by national law, we cannot provide harmonisedsupervision in this case.But the patchwork consists of more than that. The rulebook also contains what are known asoptions and discretions, O&Ds for short. These O&Ds provide governments and supervisorswith some leeway in applying the rules. Again, this has led to differences across countries.Here we have made some progress, though. Together with the national supervisors, we haveagreed to exercise a number of options and discretions in a harmonised manner. But there arestill O&Ds that lie in the hands of governments. So it is up to them to bring about moreharmonisation. And I admit that I am quite disappointed that so little has been done in this area.And last but not least, there is a third item that helps to explain Europe’s regulatory mix. We stillsee that some countries are issuing national laws that affect the core of European bankingsupervision. There are, for instance, national laws that govern risk management. And these lawsapply to banks that are directly supervised by the ECB, of course. Now imagine that there is abanking group with entities in Germany and Spain. This banking group would be subject todifferent rules when it comes to managing credit risk or to liquidity reporting. Needless to say, thisseems ill-suited to a banking union and a level playing field.Now what does this regulatory hotchpotch mean for European banking supervisors? Well, itmakes them less effective and less efficient. In the worst case, they have to deal with 19 nationalrules instead of a single European one. This makes it hard to treat banks equally. It leads to morebureaucracy and higher costs. It opens the door to regulatory arbitrage, and it distortscompetition.My advice is therefore clear: we must further harmonise the rulebook. Instead of EU Directives,we should rely more on EU Regulations, which can be directly applied in all Member States. Weshould deal with the remaining O&Ds, and we should stop passing more and more national laws,especially those which apply to banks that are supervised at European level.Instead, we should strive to cut down on some of these national laws, such as those concerningthe reporting requirements that have become redundant as a result of the European ReportingFramework. Scrapping such laws would increase efficiency and reduce costs for both banks andsupervisors.So supervisors need a strong and level regulatory base. However, we must be careful that itdoes not turn into a cage. How could that happen? How could the rulebook evolve in a way thatwould confine supervisors? 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The problem here is “too much detail”, a kind of regulatory “overload” – involving too manystakeholders and too much bureaucracy. There is a tendency to add more and more details tothe rulebook. This is driven by a desire to have rules that cover every eventuality. Whateverhappens, there should be a rule to deal with it. It would trigger supervisory action. And if it didn’texist, well, then there’s no trigger and no action.However, trying to have a rule for every eventuality is an elusive goal, of course. The business ofbanking is so complex and fast-changing that no rulebook would be able to fully cover it. Theunexpected will always happen. If not by chance, then because banks make it happen onpurpose.And precisely that is one of the problems entailed by an overly detailed rulebook: regulatoryarbitrage. The more detailed the rules, the more ways banks can game them. This creates newrisks, which are then not covered by the rules.On top of that, an overly detailed rulebook would make it much more difficult for supervisors toreact decisively and quickly to a changing environment. Supervising a bank could turn into amere box-ticking exercise. And supervisors would turn into experts for tiny details; they could endup focusing on the minutiae and forgetting the big picture.And that would be a waste. It would be a waste of all the experience, expertise and insights thatsupervisors have. Why not strengthen their judgement? Why not keep the flexibility they need toreact to newly emerging risks in an ever-changing banking sector? And do all that within asensible legal framework, of course.At the end of the day, we need both. We need clear-cut rules, and we need sound supervisoryjudgement. Adding more and more details to the rules might come at the expense of supervisoryjudgement. With the recent reforms we have struck a balance in this regard. If we were to upsetthis balance, it would become much harder to ensure that banks remain safe and sound.Supervisors and their toolboxBut European banking supervisors need more than an adequate rulebook to do their job. Theyalso need the right tools, of course. They need a European toolbox.And here, a lot has been done. We have harmonised the main tool of banking supervision: thesupervisory review and evaluation process, SREP for short. In the SREP we take a very closelook at each bank. We analyse its business model, its governance, its risk management as wellas risks to its capital and liquidity positions.The SREP provides a common yardstick to compare banks across the euro area. It helps us toidentify best practices and spot common problems. By referring to the SREP, we developspecific supervisory requirements and measures for each bank. And by the way, supervisoryjudgement plays a big role in the SREP.But the SREP is a massive tool, and we still need to refine it. Let me give you an example. Aspart of the SREP, we review the processes that banks use to assess and maintain adequatecapital and liquidity buffers. These processes are known as ICAAP and ILAAP. Based on whatwe learnt from our SREP exercises, we will refine our expectations regarding ICAAP and ILAAP,and our methods for reviewing them.And we also need to consider how best to assess the risk management of banks in the SREP.We need to do more than just define what we expect with regard to the management of IT risks,outsourcing or leveraged finance. We need to define fully fledged minimum expectations for therisk management of banks.1 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
But our toolbox comprises more than the SREP. So there are other things that we need toimprove. First, there are tools that are applied in different ways in different countries. On-siteinspections at banks are one example. In some countries, the preparation takes some time,while the actual inspection is quite short. In other countries, it is the other way round. This makesit difficult to coordinate and to create international teams of on-site inspectors.Second, there are tools which exist in some countries but not in others. In this regard, themoratorium tool comes first to mind. It allows supervisors to suspend all the activities of a failingbank for a short period of time. It helps to handle such failures in a timely and orderly manner.Therefore, moratorium powers should be part of the European toolbox.Another tool that we need to have is called “deductions from own funds”. It would help to ensurethat banks make adequate provision for risks – adequate from a prudential point of view. Thenational accounting frameworks allow for some flexibility with regard to provisioning. And what abank then chooses may not be sufficient from the supervisors’ viewpoint, taking into account thebank’s risk profile. That’s why supervisors should be able to impose prudential deductions fromown funds.And third, there are some tools which are part of the European toolbox not once but twice. Andthis can cause problems. A relevant case relates to banks that get into trouble and the questionof how to intervene as early as possible. As a rule of thumb, banks don’t get into trouble out of theblue. Rather, it is a gradual downfall in most cases. Thus, we have tools at our disposal thatallow us to step in early and send warning signals to the banks.This is known as early intervention. However, the relevant tools are the same as some of ourstandard tools. And this overlap might prevent us from using early intervention tools. The reasonis that we are bound to use the least intrusive tool, which is always the standard one. This isparticularly relevant should the market authorities demand that the bank disclose whether earlyintervention tools have been deployed. So, the overlap between early intervention tools andstandard tools should be removed.To sum up, we still need to work on the toolbox of European banking supervisors. We have toexpand, harmonise and streamline it.Supervisors and the marketNow let us come back to my initial question. Being a European banking supervisor means doingan important job. Equipped with an adequate rulebook and the necessary tools, supervisors helpto make banks safe and sound. Such banks in turn form the foundations of a strong economy.But we should not become too self-centred.Banks are private enterprises, and the banking sector is a market, after all. As such, it deploysforces that can help to keep risks in check and secure stability. There were even times whenmany believed that market forces alone could bring about a stable and efficient banking sector,ensure sustainable business models and make banks resilient to the ups and downs of theeconomy. That belief was shattered by the crisis.But don’t get me wrong. I believe in the market; in theory, the forces of the market work fine. Theproblem is just that, in practice, they do not always work so well, for several reasons.First of all, the market is made by people interacting, and people have their limits. Ampleresearch shows that human brains are not very good at handling risk. We tend to over- orunderestimate it; we tend to get carried away by potential gains; and we tend to overreact whenthings change.And then, people’s behaviour depends on incentives which are sometimes distorted. The most 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
prominent example is this: whenever you can keep the gains but pass potential losses on tosomeone else, you might be tempted to take on too much risk.So, in practice, the market has its shortcomings. But is that a reason to do away with it? No, notat all. We should try to make it work. For the banking sector, this means aligning incentives.And as I just mentioned, the best incentive to keep risks in check is potential failure and financialloss. As the economist Allan Meltzer noted: “Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.It doesn’t work.” But in banking, there was a lack of failure.During the crisis, many banks that should have failed did not fail. Instead, governments proppedthem up with public funds – at huge cost to taxpayers. They did so out of fear of a systemiccrisis. They were worried that when a large bank fails, it would drag others down and destroy theentire system.So there was a situation where banks could pass on any losses to someone else while keepingany profits. They had an incentive to gamble with other people’s money. So, we need to make itpossible for banks to fail without causing the whole system to collapse. And we need to makesure that profit-makers are also loss-takers. That would align incentives, strengthen marketdiscipline and keep risk-taking in check.In Europe, we now have a new system for exactly that purpose: the Single ResolutionMechanism, SRM for short. The SRM provides the tools to resolve banks in an orderly manner.Earlier this year, it passed its first test when a couple of banks failed. This was a huge steptowards imposing market discipline on banks and making them safer and sounder.And I can confirm that dealing with a failed bank is among the most complex things you can doas a supervisor. The first step is that the ECB declares the bank failing or likely to fail. And that, initself, is a delicate matter.A bank can fail for a million reasons. Sometimes it is a slow death that drags on over weeks andweeks. Sometimes it all happens within a couple of days. In the end, it is up to the ECB to decidewhether the moment has come, and that is a decision which cannot be taken lightly.Taking it too early might infringe the rights of investors and creditors. Taking it too late might leadto a systemic crisis; it might harm the economy and society. So all in all it is a decision thatrequires supervisors to carefully judge the case at hand.Once the ECB has declared a bank failing or likely to fail, another body takes over: the SingleResolution Board, SRB for short. It is the SRB that decides how to deal with the bank.In a nutshell, this is how we handle failing banks in Europe. Once you start looking at the details,it becomes much more complex, of course. It requires all parties involved to closely cooperate.And it requires all parties, including the banks, to be well prepared. That’s why it is so importantfor banks to carefully draft their recovery and resolution plans.But as I said, recent experience has shown that our approach works. The ECB, the SRB, theEuropean Commission and the relevant national authorities proved that they can cooperateclosely. They have demonstrated that they can deal with failing banks and handle the wholeprocess smoothly.That said, things can and should be improved, of course. And I am not just thinking of the actualfailure of a bank. I am also thinking of what can be done before it comes to that.And here, we need to think about precautionary recapitalisation, for instance. Under very strictconditions, the European rules on state aid allow banks to be given public funds. However, theseaid rules might need an update that would align them with the new European resolution regime. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
In this context, we also need to reflect again on how we define solvency. After all, banks need tobe solvent in order to receive precautionary recapitalisation. Here, we need to reach a commonunderstanding of how to define solvency, in particular its forward-looking aspect.As for the banks, they need to reflect on how to handle their liquidity during a crisis. Mostimportantly, they need to make sure that they have a backstop in place that is readily accessible.And then, when push comes to shove, we need to improve the tools that are needed to actuallyresolve a bank. I already mentioned that some tools still need to be added to the Europeantoolbox. The moratorium is one of them.And finally, we must keep in mind that only systemically relevant banks will be resolved atEuropean level. All other banks will be subject to national insolvency regimes. It might thus bewarranted to harmonise these regimes across Europe to ensure a level playing field.All the things I just mentioned will have an impact on how supervisors assess and react to therisks of banks and the risks of bank failures.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,What does it mean to be a European banking supervisor? That was one of my questions at theoutset. And the answer was that it means many things. It is a job that is challenging andrewarding at the same time.Today I have mostly talked about the challenges. I have talked about the need to write a solid andharmonised rulebook. I have talked about the need to expand, harmonise and streamline thesupervisory toolbox. And I have talked about how to make the market work again.To end on a more positive note, let us turn to the rewarding aspects of being a European bankingsupervisor. Above all, it means being part of a united Europe. It means working towards a stableand truly European banking sector – a banking sector that spans 19 countries and serves morethan 300 million people.And all these people rely on banks. They rely on banks to invest their savings, to help them starta business or buy a home. It is the job of a European banking supervisor to contribute to a stablebanking system that can reliably and efficiently serve these needs.Thank you for your attention.ICAAP: Internal capital adequacy assessment process; ILAAP: Internal liquidity adequacy assessment process.1 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg: Main developments and challenges inachieving the inflation target in Israel in recent yearsRemarks by Dr Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel, at aconference, organized by the Bank of Canada, Ottawa, 17 September 2017.*   *   *Accompanying slides"I should like to thank the organizers of the conference for inviting me to participate and sharewith you Israel’s experience with inflation targeting, and particularly our recent experience whichis not unlike that of many other small open economies except perhaps in a more accentuatedform:  solid growth, rising wages, strong currency and inflation not only below its target butmostly in negative territory for 3 consecutive years. As a general background, let me recall that Israel saw a decade of hyperinflation in the 70’s andearly 80’s, followed by a decade of disinflation policy that targeted a gradually diminishing inflationrate, while the present day 1%-3% range for top line inflation has been effective since 2003.Though 12 month inflation has at times variated out of this range, it did so mostly for shortperiods of time due to fluctuations of the exchange rate. This was the case until approximately 3years ago, when inflation fell systematically below target for now more than 3 consecutive years.Note that medium and long term inflation expectations have continued to be well anchored withinthe target band, thus giving credence to monetary policy.The importance of price stability, was reiterated in the renewed Bank of Israel Law in 2010,where it states that the Bank’s first role is to maintain price stability, while supporting economicgrowth and financial stability.  The Bank is given what appears to be ample room to attain itstarget, 24 months, allowing it to “look through” temporary shocks, or onetime events that areexpected to have short-lived impact on inflation, thus pushing it out the range fleetingly. Or so wethought. But first, let me zoom out and give you the broad outline of macro data the MPC took into construct its view of economic developments.Over the past few years, while many of Israel’s trading partners were faced with a financial crisisand coping with a protractedly underperforming economy, Israel’s economy was growingsteadily, and is now at close to its potential growth rate, supported by a continued rise in laborrate participation (particularly of women), growth in employment across sectors, and rising realand nominal wages which have emboldened private consumption expenditures.  Of course, thedata underlying this picture, does not come in smoothly, and aside from the labor market datathat were consistently strong, we had plenty of fluctuations, including significant revisions ofquarterly national account data and despite a robust current account surplus, we faced a clearlyunderperforming export sector. The lull in export was in part due to the slowdown in world trade,but we were keenly aware of the continuing strengthening of the shekel, beyond what we couldestimate would be the normal adjustment reflecting the relatively good performance of the Israelieconomy.So unemployment was at an all-time low, wages were rising and yet inflation remained low,compelling us to dig deeper into its sources in order to disentangle its underlying “core” trend,from a series of exogenous shocks that pushed inflation down. These were many and varied,from importing “deflation” from abroad, to decreasing energy prices, to successive reduction inadministered prices such as water, electricity, children daycare, a cut in VAT, to welcomestructural reforms that enhanced competition in industries such as communication.  Thesecame in addition to a backdrop of social protests concerned about the cost of living thatincreased the public’s price awareness and changed consumer habits enhancing competition inthe retail sector, particularly with the increased use of internet buying.  This phenomenon is 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
shared by other countries, but there is ample evidence that the level of prices in Israel is higherthan its other advanced countries, thus leaving more space for price reductions throughenhanced competition and consumer savvy.Throughout this period, of now about 3 years, all forecasts and market expectationssystematically underestimated the downward forces on prices, and thus overestimatedforthcoming inflation.The discussions in the MPC reflected our challenge of on the one hand allowing for a welcomereduction in the level of prices, and on the other maintaining the overall price stability environment– a hard won anchor that allows for the good functioning of the economy.We lowered the Bank of Israel’s rate as inflation was dropping, to reach 0.1% in March of 2015when 12 month inflation reached what turned out to be its lowest point at –1%. In addition,whenever the shekel appeared to embark on what we viewed as excessive momentum notjustified by fundamentals, we intervened in the FX market, and still do so, not only because of itsimpact on prices but also to avoid the unwarranted impact on export industries, particularly ofgoods which tend to be more sensitive to the exchange rate.  One could look at it as the QE ofsmall open economies.A year passed, and still the inflation rate was below target and still in negative territory and weobserved that the same forces were at play, and expected to continue to be due to the globaleconomic and monetary environment and because of our own domestic conditions. It was clearthat we needed to show our patience with the price environment. We did so by introducing non-conditional forward guidance – there were clearly too many elements behind the low inflation toallow us to turn some into conditions – which we reiterated more recently, and in our view wascorrectly interpreted by the market.Patience has its virtue but must not be confused with inaction, the BoI has been patient withinflation to return, but quite active to ensure that the crucial broader environment of price stabilityremains intact.  Inflation expectations of the medium and longer term are still well anchoredwithin the target range bestowing credibility to the monetary policy.To conclude in the spirit of this forward looking conference, I would draw 3 points from the recentIsraeli experience.First, protracted periods of below target inflation do not entail an automatic loss of monetarypolicy credibility.  For the latter to be maintained, we need to better understand, and betterexplain, how the transmission mechanisms operate – through short term interest rates, longterm rates, exchange rate and asset prices.  This will lead us to use more tools and moretargeted tools when available.Second, the Israeli experience does not lead to the need of changing the inflation target: animportant anchor for the economy must not be amenable to easy change unless there is strongevidence that it is no longer at the appropriate level. Inflation in Israel is also strongly impacted byglobal inflation, and while the debate on changing the inflation target is also taking place globally,there is no reason for Israel to be a pioneer in this change, if the change takes place.Third, monetary policy must take into account financial conditions as signaled daily, if not hourlyby the markets, but as upholder of a necessary and crucial nominal anchor it must be able towithstand noise and remain forward looking. This in turn requires the Central Bank to engage indiscussions and better explain its interpretation of sometimes contradictory data on the onehand, and to withstand “flavor of the day” pressures. “ 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Stephen S Poloz: The meaning of "data dependence" - an economicprogress reportRemarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the St. John's Board ofTrade, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, 27 September 2017.*   *   *I would like to thank Russell Barnett and David Amirault for their help in preparing this speech.IntroductionI am always happy to be here in St. John’s, a unique corner of our country. Given the city’sgeography, its history and rich culture, those of you who get to call St. John’s home are fortunate,indeed.The idea of “home” is a preoccupation for us at the Bank of Canada. We have been workingsince the global recession almost a decade ago to bring the Canadian economy home. What Iwant to do today is give you a sense of how far the economy has come and how much further ithas to go, and talk about some signs to watch for along the way.The goal of our monetary policy is to keep inflation low, stable and predictable. Under the termsof the agreement between the Bank and the federal government, we aim for an annual rate ofconsumer price inflation of 2 per cent. Of course, unforeseen events can always push inflationup or down. So, our agreement sets out a target band of 1 to 3 per cent.What do I mean by “home”? For us, home is at the intersection of full capacity and 2 per centinflation. We expect that when the economy reaches full capacity, inflation will converge on the 2per cent midpoint of the target band. That is why we are so preoccupied with the idea of home.Our adjustments to interest rates affect economic activity, which affects the gap between thelevel of output and full capacity, which in turn affects inflation. However, there is an importantconsideration that sometimes gets lost: this process takes time. Any change in interest rates willnot have its full impact on inflation for about a year and a half to two years. So, when we makeour monetary policy decisions, we are less concerned about the latest inflation numbers—whichare already a month old—than we are about where inflation will be in the future.Forecasting inflation: data, sentiment and intelligenceThat brings us to the question of how to forecast future inflation. The place to start is witheconomic models. Models are indispensable for developing forecasts of inflation and the rest ofthe economy. However, no central banker would ever base a monetary policy decision solely ona projection from an economic model. Models provide us with a coherent starting point, but weneed to apply real-world judgment before reaching a policy decision.A lot of this judgment comes from conversations with people. Earlier this year, Deputy GovernorLynn Patterson spokeabout how the Bank gleans intelligence from financial markets. Equallyimportant are efforts to gauge business sentiment—sometimes called “soft data”—and to gatherintelligence about the real economy from business leaders. We need to understand the viewfrom both Main Street and Bay Street to help inform our outlook for growth and inflation. This iswhere our regional offices, staffed by people who routinely visit companies across the country,play a vital role.One of the most important vehicles for these efforts is our Business Outlook Survey (BOS),which is celebrating its 20thanniversary this year. The informal process for these visits beganwhen I was at the Bank in the early 1990s. In fact, the first time I visited St. John’s was to do 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
some of those consultations. Through our surveys and conversations with business leaders, weregularly get clues about economic trends before they show up in the official economic statistics.Let me illustrate. The roughly 50 per cent drop in oil prices during 2014 represented a cut ofroughly $60 billion per year in export revenue for oil producers. Some of the impacts of this cutwere immediately obvious and predictable. We knew oil-intensive regions would be hurt by thedrop in income and that oil companies would reduce their spending. Certainly, the people of thiscity and province are aware of the pain caused by the oil price shock.However, the BOS taken late in 2014, together with additional discussions we had with energycompanies, revealed warning signs that went well beyond the decline in business investment.For example, companies in this region told us that they were being flooded by résumés ofworkers returning from Alberta. Service firms, such as hotel and trucking companies, told usabout bookings being suddenly cancelled. Energy-service companies told us that previouslysigned contracts for construction and exploration work were being renegotiated, or eventerminated.So, well before the shock started to show up in the statistics, we could see that it would have asignificant negative effect on the Canadian economy and the outlook for inflation. This wascrucial to our decision to lower interest rates in January 2015. And, as companies cut theirinvestment intentions further, we lowered interest rates again the following July.To be clear, our economic models correctly predicted that the collapse in oil prices would be aserious blow. Specifically, our main policy model gave us invaluable insights into how the shockwould affect the economy and how the subsequent adjustments would unfold. But the fact thateverything we were hearing was supporting these insights increased our confidence that cuttingrates was the right course of action.Adjusting to lower oil pricesObviously, the drop in oil prices was a significant detour for the Canadian economy. We knewthat the shock would trigger a complex series of adjustments and create significant hardship formany people.Basically, our models projected that the economy would go through the reverse of its experiencein 2010–14, when high oil prices led to strong increases in business investment and nationalincome. Provinces where the energy sector is relatively more important, such as Newfoundlandand Labrador, would feel these effects most acutely. This underscores one of the fundamentalchallenges for policy-makers, that economic shocks can have very different effects acrossCanada’s regions.In terms of adjustments, we anticipated that lower oil prices would mean not only a decline in theenergy sector, but also a pickup in growth in the non-energy sector. We expected exports to beboosted by a lower Canadian dollar. And, as exporting companies reached their capacity limits,we expected to see business investment increase. Stronger exports and investment wouldcomplement household spending, and growth would become more broadly-based and self-sustaining.Certainly, adjustment in the energy sector has been painful. Beyond cuts to investment spending,oil companies restructured operations and laid off workers. Employment in the resource sectorfell by roughly 50,000 jobs from the beginning of 2015 to the middle of last year. Despite this,companies boosted production and exports of crude oil as earlier investments were completedand as they found greater efficiencies. And, since oil is priced in US dollars, the decline of theCanadian dollar also helped cushion the impact of the shock. The increased output and weakercurrency helped to offset almost half of the $60 billion decline in revenue from oil shipments,boosting exports by about $25 billion. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
That said, Canada’s other exports took longer to recover than we anticipated. Exportingcompanies had taken a significant hit both during and after the global financial crisis. Manydisappeared, to be replaced over time by new firms exporting new goods and services. As aconsequence, the composition of Canada’s exports has also changed since the crisis. Exportsof services in categories such as technical, travel, financial and management services, havetaken the lead, while some traditional goods, such as motor vehicles and parts, have seen theirshares decline. By mid-2016, non-energy exports had fully recouped their previous drop, andtoday, total exports are almost 10 per cent above their pre-crisis peak.Monetary policy has played a key role in this adjustment. We estimate that if we had not loweredour policy rate in 2015, the economy would be roughly 2 per cent smaller today—a difference ofalmost $50 billion—and there would be about 120,000 fewer jobs. Government fiscal stimulusmeasures also contributed importantly to growth, and this has meant a better mix of monetaryand fiscal policy. Without this fiscal stimulus, interest rates would have had to have been evenlower than they were. All things being equal, this would have meant even more household debtand an increased longer-term vulnerability for the economy.As we look ahead, we project that business investment will be a key driver of economic growth.Business investment has also been slower to materialize than we expected, but it has beenstrong across the board over the first half of this year. Further, in our most recent BOS, ourregional staff found that companies were more focused on expanding capacity than they werepreviously. Indeed, businesses across an increasing range of sectors say they expect salesgrowth to improve further, and hiring intentions have reached a record high.Given all this evidence, we could see by the beginning of summer that the economy’sadjustments to lower oil prices were essentially complete. To be clear, the impact of the shockwas still visible in energy-intensive areas of the country. But this was being offset at the macrolevel by greater strength in other areas.So, in July, and again earlier this month, we raised our key policy interest rate. Between thosetwo rate hikes we saw a long string of stronger-than-expected economic data, culminating in theGDP report at the end of August that showed an annual growth rate in the second quarter of 4.5per cent. As we noted in our most recent interest rate announcement, this pace is unlikely to besustained, and recent data point clearly to a moderation in the second half of the year. Still, theexpansion is becoming more broadly-based and self-sustaining, and it is important to rememberthat it is the level of output relative to potential that drives inflation, not the growth rate. We are inthe process of developing an updated forecast for growth and inflation, and it will be published innext month’s Monetary Policy Report (MPR).Risk managementDespite the recent news about economic growth, the story of inflation in Canada over the pastfew years has been dominated by downside risks. Indeed, for most of the past five years,inflation has been in the bottom half of the target band. Bearing in mind the long lags betweeneconomic activity and inflation, much of this low inflation has been due to slow economic growthin the past. More recently, it has also reflected temporary factors such as weakness in food andelectricity prices. In fact, inflation has been surprisingly soft recently in much of the developedworld, not just Canada. I will have more to say about this in a few minutes.Since inflation has been so consistently in the lower half of the target band, our risk-managementapproach to monetary policy led us to pay greater attention to forces pushing inflation down. Thisis because when inflation is already low, a negative shock to the outlook for inflation has moresignificant policy consequences than a surprise on the upside. Throughout, we wanted to besure our policy would be sufficiently stimulative to get the economy home.As the expansion continues, we will continue to manage the evolving risks to the inflation outlook. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
The temporary factors that have been holding inflation down should dissipate in the monthsahead, although recent exchange rate developments could affect this timing. In our Julyprojection, we forecast that inflation would reach close to 2 per cent by the middle of next year.Since that projection, the Bank’s measures of core inflation have edged higher, as expected. Weexpect the downward pressure on inflation to shift to upward pressure as economic slack isused up. Indeed, our models forecast a very slight overshoot of our 2 per cent target in 2019—aproduct of our model’s dynamics.The appropriate path for interest rates in this situation is very difficult to know, because there area number of important unknowns around the inflation outlook. These unknowns are unusual, asthey are mostly the product of the unusual nature of the situation we find ourselves in—thelegacy of the global financial crisis, the protracted period of slow economic growth and extremelylow interest rates, and so on. Accordingly, we need to keep updating our understanding of theeconomy in real time. That is why we say that the outlook for inflation, and therefore monetarypolicy, is particularly data dependent right now.The meaning of data dependenceWhat does it mean, in practical terms, to say that monetary policy is “data dependent”? After all,central banks always depend on data to measure their economy’s progress relative toexpectations.What I mean in this context is that in a period of heightened uncertainty about how the economyis evolving and the implications for inflation, we need to pay very close attention to all theinformation we receive, including data, sentiment indicators and intelligence, and makecontinuous inferences about not just how the economy is evolving, but how its behaviour may bechanging.Let me give you four examples of the issues we will be monitoring.The first, and most important, is the evolution of economic capacity. I said that our version of“home” is at the intersection of full capacity and 2 per cent inflation. But full capacity can be amoving target. This is because when companies increase investment, they augment theircapacity to produce through some combination of raising their productivity and increasing theirworkforce. This is a welcome development because, as the economy approaches full capacity,investment spending can have the effect of pushing out those capacity limits, giving the economymore room to grow in a non-inflationary way. In short, this is something worth encouraging. Tosome extent, this happens at this point in every economic cycle, but the protracted cycle wehave been through makes this issue particularly relevant this time around.A second issue is the question of inflation and technology. Some economists have citedtechnology as contributing to the weakness in global inflation. The digital economy may beallowing goods and services to be produced and delivered more efficiently, helping to keep pricesdown. We may also be seeing stronger competition through e-commerce, which affects howretailers set prices.It is worth emphasizing that this type of disinflation increases everybody’s purchasing power andtherefore is also a positive development. The Bank would want to estimate the impact oftechnological developments on trend inflation and, assuming the impact was temporary, seethrough it, provided that inflation expectations remained well anchored. There is a lot more workto be done to understand both the size and persistence of these effects.A third issue is wage growth, which has been slower than would be expected in an economythat is approaching full output. Hourly wages increased at an annual pace of 1.7 per cent in thesecond quarter, and growth has been subdued for months, although there were signs of anincrease in the latest monthly employment report. The slow growth is likely due in part to 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
employment shifting from higher-paying jobs in the oil sector to lower-paying jobs elsewhere.How long this effect will continue is not clear, and other phenomena may be at work. Again, wemust work hard to understand the data, and the underlying shifts in behaviour they may bepointing to.The fourth issue is elevated household debt. There is reason to think that interest rateincreases may have more of an impact on the economy and inflation than they did in the past.Further, we do not yet know the full extent of the economy’s reaction to various macroprudentialmeasures aimed at imbalances in the housing market. So, the Bank will be looking closely to seehow the economy’s adjustment to changes in interest rates may differ from that in previouseconomic cycles.This is not an exhaustive list. There are also many external risks and uncertainties around ouroutlook, including geopolitical developments and the rise of protectionist sentiment in some partsof the world. The evolution of the neutral rate of interest is also a topic of significant debate in theprofession. We have been talking about these uncertainties for some time.In such an environment, we simply cannot rely mechanically on economic models. This does notmean we are abandoning our models. It does mean we need to use them with plenty ofjudgment, informed by data, sentiment indicators and intelligence, as we go through the delicateprocess of bringing inflation sustainably to target. We will continue to watch all the data closely,as well as developments in financial markets, in terms of their impact on the outlook for inflation.We recognize that the economy may act differently than in previous cycles. We will not bemechanical in our approach to monetary policy. Let me quickly make one final point. Among the financial market developments that we watchclosely are movements in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate. Changes in interestrates naturally lead to movements in the Canadian dollar. However, currencies can move formany other reasons, including external factors, and these movements can affect our inflationoutlook, depending on their cause, size and persistence.ConclusionIt is time to conclude. I hope I have given you an appreciation of just how far the economy hascome on its way home. And although we are confident that the economy has made significantprogress, we cannot be certain of exactly how far there is left to go.The economic progress we have seen tells us that the moves we took to ease policy in 2015were the right thing to do. At a minimum, that additional stimulus is no longer needed. But there isno predetermined path for interest rates from here. Monetary policy will be particularly datadependent in these circumstances and, as always, we could still be surprised in either direction.We will continue to feel our way cautiously as we get closer to home, fostering economic growthand keeping our inflation target front and centre. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Elisa Ferreira: Lessons from the crisis for central banks - a policyviewRemarks by Ms Elisa Ferreira, Vice-Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the Joint Bank ofPortugal and European Central Bank Conference on "Risk Management for Central Banks",Panel 2 "Lessons from the crisis for central banks - a policy view", Lisbon, 25 September 2017.*   *   *IntroductionEconomists and policymakers are still struggling to build a consensus on the long-runeconomic impact and on the policy implications of the financial crisis, 10 years past itsbeginning.In my view, there are two major lessons from the crisis:(i.) understanding macroeconomic equilibria requires knowing theinteraction/transmission mechanisms of balance sheet positions of all agents in theeconomy, the behaviour of financial intermediaries and the interlinkages betweenthe financial and non-financial sectors of the economy; this has implications on thedesign of economic policy, notably monetary and macroprudential policies, and on the needfor interaction between monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies; (ii.) the European architecture was unprepared to face the financial crisis and,despite several major steps observed in recent years, we are still living within anincomplete setup; a holistic approach – combining (i) steps in micro and macroprudentialpolicies, (ii) policy action to implement the three interlinked pillars of the banking union; and(iii) further coherent steps in economic integration are warranted.In these remarks I would like to briefly touch upon each one of these lessons, having in mindthe policy implications that may arise for the euro area.(i) The return of financial issues to centre stage in economic thinking and the challengesstill faced at the current junctureOne of the insights from the crisis is that real and financial interactions can only be ignoredat our peril. This has implications for economic modelling and for the design of monetary andmacroprudential policy strategies. In particular, should financial stability considerations beincorporated in the conduct of monetary policy? What is the effectiveness ofmacroprudential policy when some of the risks for financial stability have alreadymaterialized and the macroprudential “buffers” were not build up beforehand? How domonetary policy and macroprudential policy interact in practical terms? Issues such as how to optimally coordinate policies and how to avoid time-inconsistencyproblems in this coordination are still outstanding. This is even more evident in a currencyunion where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be localin nature. The current consensus is that price stability should continue to be the primary goal ofmonetary policy and that financial stability concerns should be mainly addressed bymacroprudential policy. This is consistent with Tinbergen’s assignment principle. There isalso a clear alignment between the goals of price stability and financial stability, as theobjective of monetary policy is more easily achieved under financial stability and the latterbenefits from price stability. Nevertheless, existing instruments are unable to fully address persisting significant 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
macroeconomic imbalances, and they still persist.Monetary policy is not the right instrument as it may lead to substantial deviations ofaggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels.Macroprudential policy is the most promising tool to tackle financial stability risks. However, itis still quite recent – the underlying “buffers” were not built up before, they were built duringthe crisis. Additional tools still need to be developed, and more work is still needed toestablish a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit beyond banking, which to date is lacking.Last week’s announcement by the European Commission calling for a review of theEuropean Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is a good step in this direction.Legacy issues thus need to be tackled also at the micro level, underscoring the need toaddress the interaction between macro and microprudential policies and guarantee that theyare consistent. The design of the institutional roles of central banks should hence guarantee the consistencybetween these different policies, taking into account the existing complementary betweenthem, as well as these policies’ interaction with fiscal policy.(ii) The need to complete the European architecture The crisis revealed several gaps in the European architecture which have been addressedto a certain extent during the past decade but still require further decisive work. The setting up of the ESM, the Single Rule Book and the two pillars – the supervision and theresolution – of the Banking Union were major achievements. But one should not think thatwithout what is missing still, they can work. They cannot.As we stand, the third pillar of the Banking Union, a common deposit insurance scheme, hasnot yet been implemented, thus leading to severe inconsistencies, as the recent resolutionof Banco Popular Español strongly put into evidence.One should not underestimate how much was achieved in a short time-span. However, inthe rush to solve overarching problems there is always the risk of creating new problems. The accountability of recently created European institutions is a good example in this regardwhere we must ask ourselves if the intrinsic goal of preserving financial stability is beingsuperseded by a strict auto-protective instinct that triggers another interpretation of theirmandate.The harsh conditions for any State intervention, under precautionary recapitalization,imposed by the BRRD and by state aid rules, accompanied by the supervisory andregulatory requirements for capital and other loss absorption instruments, amidst lowprofitability, in a context of low interest rates, are conducive to significant transfers of wealthand the destruction of economic value that may seriously jeopardize financial stability.Moreover, the ESM’s recapitalization instruments are currently limited by the wider EUframework. Direct recapitalization is extremely difficult to be activated and cannot in anycase be used on a precautionary basis.This is all happening at a time when financial stability is still mostly a national responsibility,despite the much more limited ability for the usage of national tools to safeguard it, in acontext where there is a clear misalignment between liability and risk control.It is thus essential to guarantee a proper alignment of interests between who is entitled withdecisions powers, who bears the liabilities and who is accountable to ensure fair andbalanced decisions. Final remarks and way forwardUncertainty calls for a cautious approach but should not be a reason for inaction: thefoundations of the European architecture are still not sufficiently robust to withstand the 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
impact of a future crisis and this should be the focus of policy makers. Otherwise, we riskfragmenting the single market and not having a genuine Banking Union.Against the background of (i) a significant amount of banks in the euro area with sizable NPLstocks, (ii) MREL shortages in banks with a traditional funding model reliant on depositorsand/or elevated stocks of NPLs, (iii) the perceived ‘return’ of the bank-sovereign nexus, and(iv) low levels of banks' profitability, amid fintech challenges, European authorities mustseize the opportunity to review the existing regulatory and crisis management framework ina coordinated fashion with a full-information approach instead of each devising their own setof rules.A comprehensive re-thinking is required recognizing that the current framework was not setup to address banks with legacy issues and to assess if the existing framework is adequatewhen legacy issues have been tackled.In addition to the necessary holistic approach, encompassing monetary, macro andmicroprudential policies, we need to move forward with concrete measures to improve thecurrent legal framework, including (i) the setting up of a backstop for the Single ResolutionFund and establishment of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS); (ii) thereinterpretation of the ESM treaty to allow the ESM to become a euro area backstop forfinancial stability purposes, and (iii) the change of the conditions under which the ESM andother stabilization tools can be used. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   Welcome to this conference marking 20 years of independent monetary policy making in the UK. We are here because long and varied experience has shown that price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the public good.  High inflation hurts the least well off in society the most.  It distorts price signals, inhibits investment, and ultimately damages the economy’s productive capacity.  Equally, deflation imperils growth and employment, and, in the extreme, leads to financial ruin and economic collapse.  The happy medium is low, stable and predictable inflation.  A little inflation greases the wheels of the economy, and it gives monetary policy space to deliver better outcomes for jobs and growth when shocks hit. Recognising the value to society of price stability is one thing, delivering it is quite another. The Bad Old Days Prices were anything but stable during the 1970s and 80s.  With the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971, UK monetary policy lost its nominal anchor.  There followed a series of botched experiments, with targets for incomes, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate.  The costs of such failures were enormous, with prices rising by 750% in the twenty-five years to 1992, more than over the previous two hundred and fifty years.  Unemployment was high and growth volatile. The inflation target rose from the ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago this month, marking the point when price stability became the unambiguous objective of UK monetary policy.   The new framework was a success, though only a partial one.  That’s because, with interest rate decisions still made by the Chancellor, it wasn’t fully credible.  Experience teaches that political control of monetary policy decisions suffers from time inconsistency, in which policymakers promise low inflation, then go for faster growth and ultimately achieve neither.   Conversely, welfare can be improved if governments first choose the preferred rate of inflation and then delegate operational responsibility to the central bank to achieve it.     
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   The UK Framework for Monetary Independence So it was in 1997 when Gordon Brown boldly gave the Bank of England operational control for setting monetary policy.   The Bank of England Act of 1998 clarified – for the first time in three centuries – the Bank’s responsibilities.1  It gave a new independent body of the Bank, the MPC, a clear remit to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. The inflation target is symmetric (meaning we care as much about returning inflation to target from below as from above), and it applies at all times.  Subject to achieving the target, the MPC is also required to support the Government’s economic policy objective, currently strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Accountability  Under what Mervyn King termed constrained discretion, the Bank takes its orders from the remit and is accountable to Parliament and the people for its performance. Their expectations certainly have changed since Montagu Norman justified his decisions to a compliant predecessor of the TSC by appealing opaquely to his “instincts.”  Not a response I’ve dared to venture during my thirty odd parliamentary testimonies.  More seriously, the need for the Bank to be open and accountable is greater than ever, not only because of the growing distrust of institutions and the ‘experts’ who reside within them, but also because better public understanding makes our policies more effective.   That’s why the Bank has increased dramatically the scale and quality of its outreach.  We now publish all relevant information for each policy decision on the day it is released.  We disclose the key judgments underlying our forecasts and account for differences when they occur.  Leveraging our network of 12 regional agencies, we meet with thousands of businesses every year, discuss with the tens of thousands of people who attend our town halls and Public Forums, and engage with the hundreds of thousands more through social media.   Performance and Lessons Learned The gains from independence have been enormous.  In the two decades that followed independence, inflation averaged just under 2% compared with over 6% in the preceding two. It’s been one-fifth as volatile.  Crucially, independence allowed monetary policy to respond boldly and effectively to the biggest financial crisis in a century.  And it leaves the Bank well placed to address a range of possible developments around Brexit.                                                                    1 As former Governor Eddie George once remarked, in the half century that followed its nationalisation in 1946 “the Bank operated under legislation which, remarkably, did not attempt to define our objectives or functions.”  They were, instead, “assumed to carry over from [the Bank’s] earlier long history.” George, E (2000), ‘Central bank independence’, speech at the SEANZA Governors’ Symposium, 26 August 2000. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   Over the past twenty years, we have also learned a few important lessons.  Allow me to highlight three. First, the financial crisis exposed how a healthy focus on price stability became a dangerous distraction.  Central banks had won the war against inflation during the Great Moderation only to lose the peace as vulnerabilities built inexorably.   Now monetary policy isn’t best placed to address risks to financial stability but the challenge is that the necessary financial policy decisions are also subject to time inconsistency problems.  Financial lobbies are strong, and the temptations of a dash for growth are powerful.  Conversely, there are no obvious or immediate rewards to the tough decisions necessary to avoid future crises.  In the world of financial stability, success is an orphan. That is why when the Bank was fundamentally reformed after the crisis, the procedures and structures of the MPC were largely replicated in the Bank’s two new policy committees, the FPC and the PRC.  Crucially, all the Bank’s committees have access to the Bank’s information and analysis, all are well-informed about each other’s reaction functions and all can coordinate their policies when appropriate.  The Bank’s Committees are independent but not isolated. The second lesson of the past two decades has been the importance of the flexibility in flexible inflation targeting. While the inflation target applies at all times, the remit has always acknowledged that inflation may deviate temporarily from the target on account of shocks.  Since 2013, it has explicitly recognised that in exceptional circumstances, bringing inflation back to target too rapidly could cause undesirable volatility in output and employment.   In exceptional circumstances like today when the economy is facing profound structural change, the MPC can extend the horizon over which it returns inflation to target from above in order to balance the effects on jobs and activity.  After all, even though monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU, it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. This brings me to my final point: while carefully circumscribed independence is highly effective in delivering price and financial stability, it cannot deliver lasting prosperity and it cannot solve broader societal challenges.  This bears emphasising because in recent years a host of issues have been laid at the door of the Bank of England from housing affordability to poor productivity. Calls for the Bank to solve these challenges ignore the Bank’s carefully defined objectives.  And they confuse independence with omnipotence.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   Monetary and financial stability are foundational.  They are necessary for prosperity but they aren’t sufficient to deliver it. The biggest determinants of the UK’s medium-term prosperity will be the country’s new relationship with the EU and the reforms it catalyses.  Most of the necessary adjustments are real in nature and therefore not in the gift of central bankers.  The Bank will do everything it can to support adjustment consistent with its statutory obligations.  We will continue to assess and express our independent assessment of the risks associated with Brexit.  We will also use all our powers, consistent with our remits, to mitigate those risks and to smooth the adjustment to new opportunities.  Monetary policy will be set to achieve the inflation target in a way that helps smooth real adjustment in the economy and supports jobs in the wake of very large external forces.   Banks will be capitalised so that they can withstand any severe shock that could be associated with Brexit – however unlikely – and still meet demand for credit.   The financial system as a whole will have the capacity to finance the transition and the opportunities beyond.   These are the best contributions the Bank of England can make to the good of the people of the United Kingdom. **************************** Ultimately, the prosperity of the UK will reflect not just the final Brexit arrangements but also the government’s fiscal and structural policies.  The first speaker at this conference is the best placed to address these topics. It could, however, have been very different.  As some of you may know, the Prime Minister began her career as a new graduate at the Bank before leaving after six years to pursue other interests – ultimately politics.  Whilst at the Bank, the Prime Minister worked in the Economic Intelligence Department – then the cutting edge of our activities.  During her time she accomplished great things and was destined for much more.  Just imagine what could have become of your career, Prime Minister, if you had stayed at the Bank: you could have been in Fishmongers Hall…

Theresa May was elected as MP for Maidenhead in 1997, just as the Bank was getting to grips with its newfound monetary policy independence.  She held a number of positions in the shadow cabinets of a string of opposition leaders and served as the Chair of the Conservative Party.  After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, she would become the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years.  During that period, she confronted many of society’s biggest challenges – for example introducing legislation to tackle domestic violence, to eradicate modern slavery and to counter terrorism.   Never afraid of a challenge, she stepped into the breach to become Prime Minister following the referendum. The Prime Minister and her Government are committed to making the most of the opportunities that Brexit brings, and more fundamentally to working to build a stronger, fairer and more prosperous country for all.   Please join me in welcoming the Prime Minister, Theresa May. 
Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs of the European ParliamentIntroductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before theHearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Brussels, 25 September 2017.*   *   *Mr Chairman,Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee,Ladies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to be back speaking to your committee for the third hearing of this year.A year ago, we were discussing together the moderate pace of the recovery in the euro area. Wewere witnessing a slight loss of momentum and assessing the impact of the UK referendum.Over the past 12 months, however, the recovery has accelerated and broadened, supported bythe pass-through of our monetary policy.In my remarks today I will discuss the current economic outlook and the impact of our monetarypolicy measures. At the request of the committee, I will focus in particular on two topics related tothe ECB’s monetary policy, namely the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) andmonetary policy implementation across the euro area.The economic and inflation outlookThe economic expansion is now firm and broad-based across euro area countries and sectors.Real GDP growth was better than expected in the first half of 2017, coming in at 2.3%, year onyear, in the second quarter. The euro area economy has enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters ofgrowth, and the latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.The ongoing recovery is, crucially, driven by domestic forces, and the labour market has notablyimproved. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in eight years. The number ofpeople employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7 million since mid-2013. Theseemployment gains, together with increasing household wealth, are supporting the privateconsumption outlook. Moreover, investment is improving, buoyed by very favourable financingconditions.The domestic drivers are making the recovery more robust and resilient to adverse externalinfluences. According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economicexpansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon. Annual realGDP is projected to increase by 2.2% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. Riskssurrounding the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced. At the same time, downsiderisks continue to exist, mainly related to global factors and developments in foreign exchangemarkets.The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflationdynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared.Nevertheless, measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recentmonths. Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towardsthe turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it isexpected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line withour inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation isstill needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertaintieswith respect to the medium-term inflation outlook. Most notably, the recent volatility in theexchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to itspossible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that isdurable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, stillrequires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation.With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments thatmaintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete itstransition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of pricestability.The corporate sector purchase programmeThe package of monetary policy measures that we have phased in sequentially since June 2014has led to a significant easing in financing conditions. What is very apparent today, and verydifficult to dispute, is that this monetary policy impetus is increasingly leading to strongereconomic activity, higher incomes and better employment prospects for people in the euro area.One key factor has been our ability to activate non-standard instruments that can transmitadditional stimulus to the productive sector. In fact, transmission through the banking system hasbecome increasingly effective since we began adopting credit-easing measures. I am referringhere specifically to the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), but a similar case can bemade for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.At the request of the committee, let me focus on one component of the APP, namely the CSPP.Together with the purchase of asset-backed securities and covered bonds, the CSPPrepresents an important credit-easing component of the APP. By directly lowering the market-based financing costs of non-financial corporations, it boosts the pass-through of our monetarypolicy.Under the CSPP, the Eurosystem has since June 2016 purchased bonds issued by a widerange of non-bank corporations established in the euro area, which include large, as well assome smaller, companies. So far, close to €110 billion of corporate bonds from around 200issuers, in 20 countries, across all sectors, have been purchased. This information is availableon our website and in our publications, and is updated regularly. We continue to analysepossibilities for sharing more information, to the extent that it can enhance transparency withoutundermining the effectiveness of monetary policy.Thanks to our corporate bond purchases, firms in the euro area have witnessed significantimprovements in their financing conditions when issuing bonds.But these improvements in financing conditions stemming from the CSPP are not confined to thecompanies whose bonds are purchased or to the corporate bond market: they are evidentacross firms and other market segments. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
For example, the yield spreads of high-rated corporate bonds that are not eligible for purchase –namely those issued by financial corporations – have fallen by as much as those of eligiblebonds issued by non-financial corporations (almost 70 basis points, from 1.25% in March 2016 to0.57%) since the CSPP announcement. Spreads of non-investment grade corporate bonds,which are not eligible for the CSPP, have also declined by 262 basis points, from 5.59% in March2016 to 2.97%.For asset purchases to boost activity and inflation, however, these improvements in financialmarkets need to be passed through into credit conditions for the real economy.In this regard, we have seen very favourable spillovers into credit conditions for small andmedium-sized enterprises. As more corporations seek market-based financing, given theattractive funding conditions prevailing in the capital markets, banks are left with greater capacityto provide loans to smaller companies, which are more constrained in terms of access tofunding sources. Hence, bank lending rates on very small loans to non-financial corporationshave declined by around 50 basis points since the CSPP announcement. Looking at our latestSurvey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, smaller companies are indeed reportingimproved financing conditions and better access to finance.The CSPP, therefore, has strengthened the pass-through of our asset purchases to thefinancing conditions of the real economy and has contributed to the overall monetary stimulusneeded to bring inflation rates back in line with our inflation aim.Conducting monetary policy in the euro areaThe supportive impact of our policy measures – including all elements of our asset purchaseprogramme – on financing conditions is therefore evident across firms regardless of their size. Itis also evident across sectors and across euro area countries. In other words, we are seeing asmooth transmission of our single monetary policy.A single currency entails a single monetary policy. Hence, the Governing Council takes decisionsto achieve the primary objective of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole. It alsoestablishes the necessary guidelines for their implementation.At the same time, and in accordance with its Statute, the ECB has recourse to the nationalcentral banks (NCBs) to the extent deemed possible and appropriate for carrying out theoperations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem. NCBs in turn have a duty to act inaccordance with the guidelines and instructions of the ECB.This decentralised approach takes into consideration the financial structure of the euro area, i.e.a monetary union made up of segmented national financial markets. In such an environment, theclose interaction of NCBs with the banks operating in their jurisdiction brings benefits for theimplementation of monetary policy. For example, we are able to collect precise information froma wide range of local counterparties, which can be integrated into the harmonised and richinformation set that the Governing Council needs to design policy. Moreover, NCBs, knowing wellthe specificities of their jurisdictions, are well placed to manage assets to be used as collateral inour operations.This makes our decentralised system more efficient than a centralised approach under thecurrent circumstances. In the absence of a truly single market for capital, securities markets stilldepend very much on national specificities and preferences. A successful capital markets unionwould abolish dividing lines between jurisdictions, with positive effects on the way we implementour monetary policy. In the end, we should not forget that a fundamental reason for monetaryunion was precisely to foster more integrated capital markets and reap the benefits in the form ofimproved financing conditions across the euro area.123 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
ConclusionSince you asked me to elaborate on the issue of decentralisation, let me conclude with a finalthought in this respect and in particular on the implications for the functioning of Economic andMonetary Union.The fact that the ECB’s non-standard policy measures have been very effective in supporting thefinancing conditions of companies and households throughout the euro area should not make usforget the situation we witnessed at the peak of the crisis. For example, institutional weaknesses,structural fragilities and excessive risk-taking contributed to a negative feedback loop betweensovereigns and banks in some countries, which significantly impaired monetary policytransmission. The resultant contraction in the euro area economy threatened price stability, ourprimary objective. Overcoming this vicious circle required considerable effort.The pattern is now running in reverse, with positive spillovers from all countries. They all havebenefited from our measures supporting growth across all of the euro area and thus laying theground for a sustained return of inflation to levels in line with our aim.But while a cyclical adjustment has been taking place, there are still structural issues whichimpede sustainable economic convergence.In the years to come, a higher degree of sustained convergence and strengthened resilience willbe necessary in order to achieve a better-functioning Economic and Monetary Union.This requires, on the one hand, policy actions by national governments aimed at unlocking theproductive potential of our economies. On the other hand, further decisive steps are needed tomake Economic and Monetary Union’s economic governance truly fit for purpose.Thank you for your attention.

Mario Draghi: Youth unemployment in the euro areaKeynote speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, for the HenryGrattan Lecture Series, Trinity College, Dublin, 22 September 2017.*   *   *First, let me thank the Provost, Patrick Prendergast, for the warm welcome, Professor GailMcElroy for the introduction and indeed Trinity College Dublin.I am happy to see my friend Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. We see eachother in Frankfurt every other week so I am pleased to see him in a different setting. It’s also niceto see my former colleague Patrick Honohan. And a warm welcome to all of you.I am especially honoured to speak here in Ireland for the first time and here in this prestigious,world-class institution, Trinity College, Dublin. Many of you are students, and to speak to youngpeople who will carry today’s message into tomorrow’s world always entails a specialresponsibility. With it comes the honour of having been chosen to give this address. Your livesare being changed forever by the education of exceptional quality that you are receiving here, in atestimony to the history of Trinity, its birth, its glorious past and its distinguished alumni.I should especially acknowledge its extraordinary teachers, including Patrick Honohan, formerGovernor of the Central Bank of Ireland, and his successor Philip Lane.The Book of Kells, on permanent display here at Trinity, with its history and its beauty, remindsus of the importance of nurturing knowledge, spreading it throughout the world, and protecting itin times of peril. It also tells us how important Ireland and its culture are for Europe.It is well known how relevant the role of Irish monastic orders was in preserving our Europeancultural heritage in the early medieval period. At the turn of the 7th century, St. Columbanembarked on a journey across Europe. From the Atlantic to the Alps, he founded monasterieswhich were the centres of learning of his time. Along the way, he urged kings and commonersalike to adopt a notion of a European society rooted in the universal values of human life, thecommon good and education.Robert Schuman, a founding father of the European Union, honoured St. Columban in 1950,saying that “this illustrious Irishman who left his own country for voluntary exile, willed andachieved a spiritual union between the principal European countries of his time. He is the patronsaint of all those who now seek to build a united Europe.”It is with these thoughts in mind that I have chosen the topic of our meeting today: young peopleand the labour market in Europe.Youth unemployment in the euro areaYouth unemployment is not a recent phenomenon. It was high over the last few decades, drivenboth by cyclical and long-term structural factors.In Europe, the worsening labour market performance for young people became apparent in the1970s, when unemployment increased from 4.6% to 11.1% by the end of the decade, partly dueto the substantial increase in supply as the so-called baby-boomers entered the labour market.But even when the size of this group declined, the relative labour market performance did notimprove. There was some recovery in the early 1990s, but it never returned to the level of theearly 1970s. In 2007, when total unemployment in the euro area declined to 7.5%, its lowestlevel since the early 1980s, the unemployment rate for young people was already very high ataround 15%.1 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Youth unemployment is not just structural but also highly pro-cyclical. During the GreatRecession, and the corresponding cyclical downturn, youth unemployment surged markedly.Between 2007 and 2013, it increased by about 9 percentage points in the euro area – twice asmuch as the overall unemployment rate.But euro area aggregates hide important differences across the euro area. Greece and Spainentered the crisis with youth unemployment rates of 23% and 18% respectively, and reachedrates well above 50% by 2013. In Ireland, it tripled over the same period, peaking at 30%. Incomparison, the youth unemployment rate in Germany, a country less affected by the cyclicaldownturn, declined from about 12% in 2007 to about 8% in 2013.What is the situation now? The ongoing economic recovery in the euro area has led to improvedlabour market conditions. Euro area real GDP has now grown for 17 consecutive quarters,creating in total over 6 million jobs. As a result, from its peak in 2013, the youth unemploymentrate fell from 24% to around 19% in 2016, but is still about 4 percentage points higher than at thebeginning of the crisis in 2007. In Ireland, where real GDP grew 5.2% last year, it declined bymore than 13 percentage points from its peak, and is now below the euro area average.However, headline unemployment rates give only a partial picture of the labour market situation.Many young people in the euro area are still in education or are not actively seeking employment.The possible significant social and economic consequences are even more relevant if we look atnew measures of labour utilisation, taking into account both unemployed people and those notinvolved in further education or training. In 2016, around 17% of people between the ages of 20and 24 in the euro area were neither in employment, education or training, with Ireland beingclose to this euro area average.  In Greece and Spain, the numbers are 23% and 21%respectively.The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment across Member States point tocontinued underlying problems in labour market structures, with correspondingly high costs forour societies.Long-term costs of youth unemploymentCyclical unemployment can turn structural if people remain unemployed for a long time.Protracted periods of unemployment can result in “scarring” effects, leading to a greaterlikelihood of future unemployment, human capital losses and lower earnings. And this hasnegative effects not only on life satisfaction, but also on health, and may persist well into later life.The sense of detachment that is produced by prolonged unemployment has been welldocumented in several social experiments. With a large proportion of young people not havingany defined role in society (neither looking for jobs, nor acquiring the skills to find one), there is ahigh risk of social cohesion and of trust in public institutions being undermined, with harm formedium-term growth prospects.Youth unemployment is also costly in terms of long-term productivity. High-productivity firms,particularly in their early expansion phase, are more likely to hire young people because thatgroup will help them to become more innovative.Innovation is driven, among other things, by curiosity and creativity. The fact that young peopleare more curious requires no further explanation; the teachers among you or those of you withchildren or grandchildren are well aware of that.When it comes to creativity, age plays a crucial role. Creativity can be measured, for example, bythe number of original and valuable contributions to fields such as science and art. By thatmeasure, output first increases in our mid-20s, reaches a peak when we are in our 30s or early40s, and then undergoes a slow decline as we age.2345678 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
So to foster innovation, it is very much in the interest of firms to recruit young people.The young are also in a better position to facilitate knowledge diffusion. In this regard, labourmobility is key. During the early years of their careers, young workers, in the search for a betterjob, move more frequently between professions and assignments. As we get older we changejobs less often: at the age of 40 we switch half as much as we do at 20. The mobility of theyoung is likely to facilitate an efficient allocation of labour through higher job-to-job transitions. Andthis mobility across firms and sectors, and sometimes across regions and countries, contributesto the diffusion and expansion of knowledge.For these reasons, youth employment and productivity growth create a virtuous circle. Whenfirms become more productive they are more likely to employ young people. And when youngpeople have such opportunities, they can capitalise on their skills, adding to productivity growth,which among other benefits for society will lead to higher wages.Youth unemployment breaks this virtuous circle: it is a drag on innovation and impedesknowledge diffusion by decreasing mobility.Additionally, unemployment prevents experienced workers and young workers from interacting.The experienced ones don’t benefit from insights and knowledge of the young. And they, in turn,don’t gain from the know-how of more experienced workers.The role of policiesAs we have seen, there are cyclical and structural reasons for the high rates of youthunemployment.Demand-side policies, such as fiscal and monetary policy, can help to address cyclicalfluctuations. Our monetary policy measures, aimed at maintaining price stability, are supportingdomestic demand and thus the recovery in employment, from which also younger generations ofEuropeans are benefiting.Furthermore, we should not forget that the crisis was a financial crisis, and therefore financialpolicies are also essential. It is important to further improve the resilience of the financial systemby strengthening sectoral balance sheets, and having an appropriate financial regulatory andsupervisory framework, and a robust macroprudential policy framework.But the rise in youth unemployment has also deeply rooted structural reasons.The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment rates across the euro area countrieseven before the crisis, as well as the diverse developments during the crisis, indicate that thereis need for specific policies to improve education and labour market functioning in somecountries.Higher levels of education are positively correlated with both greater labour market participationand lower unemployment. The risk of losing a job is significantly higher for people with loweducational attainment. And this group was severely hit by the crisis, with their unemploymentrate increasing from about 11% in 2008 to 21% in 2013 in the euro area. The pattern is similar foryoung workers. For example, in Ireland the unemployment rate of young people with aneducational attainment below lower secondary education was 27.5% in 2016, while for youngpeople with tertiary education it was about 11%.Acquiring a good skill set at school and university is therefore essential for a young person to findwork.However, skill mismatch indicators – which quantify the difference between skills wanted and8910 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
skills offered – still remain at elevated levels, with only a slight moderation compared with therecord levels at the height of the financial crisis.But skill mismatches are not just a consequence of the crisis. In fact, they started to increasebefore the crisis because of structural changes related to digitalisation and globalisation. The skillmismatch index for the euro area labour market in 2007 was almost twice as high as it was in2004.There is also large heterogeneity across the euro area countries. The OECD’s Survey of AdultSkills shows that while young adults in, for instance, Finland and the Netherlands perform well inproblem-solving in technology-rich environments, in other countries they score significantly lowerand youth unemployment is correspondingly higher. Furthermore, the correlation betweenPISA scores and youth unemployment in the euro area is strong and negative.The percentage of the working age population that has completed upper secondary or tertiaryeducation ranges widely in the euro area – from a high of more than 90% in some countries to alow of around 40% in others. The need for improving skills has also been confirmed by theresults of an ad hoc ECB survey of leading euro area businesses. The survey revealed that over90% of businesses strongly supported reforms geared to enhancing the quality of education andtraining. These factors were deemed particularly relevant in the light of shifts towardsknowledge-intensive skill sets, digitalisation and given long-standing structural deficits inengineering skills.Other non-tertiary education, such as the dual training and apprenticeship systems which wehave in some euro area countries, has also been shown as helping to facilitate the transitionfrom school to work. In particular, Austria and Germany have been successful in keeping youthunemployment low mostly because of their efficient use of vocational training and programmestargeted at disadvantaged youth.The employment prospects of the young also depend on the existence of efficient labour marketinstitutions.The vocational education system, together with more flexible wage setting, and stronger publicsupport for helping the unemployed to seek and find jobs, as well as lower labour marketsegmentation explain in part why the youth unemployment rate is lower in Germany than inFrance. Furthermore, labour market rigidities decrease both inflows into and outflows fromemployment, and tend to reduce hiring of the young, especially during recessions.In dual labour markets, it is typically young workers that have temporary contracts and thatshoulder much of the burden of adjustment.Segmentation of the labour market and poor vocational training are also among the main reasonsfor the persistent high level of youth unemployment in several countries that have been hitseverely by the recession such as Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. The role of EuropeEurope’s role in addressing the problem is primarily defined by its Single Market that hasremoved many barriers to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. Indeed, theSingle Market fosters competition among firms. In the long run, firms’ competitiveness is not onlydetermined by pricing, but also by other product features that meet customer demands.Knowledge and innovation of products and processes are therefore essential.The Single Market requires firms to be more productive, so that they activate the virtuous circlebetween productivity growth and youth employment that I described earlier. And indeed, the1112131415161718 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
countries that have a high degree of openness and have benefited most from the Single Market,are also those with lower youth unemployment.Therefore, also to support youth employment and incomes, the first and most important policydecision at European level is to complete the Single Market in all its dimensions. But to fully reapthe benefits of openness, the Single Market needs to be embedded in supportive policies andinstitutions. Competition not only creates opportunities for some firms to expand, it also drivesothers out of business and displaces workers in entire industries. It is therefore essential thatthose workers are supported when resources are channelled towards more productive firms orsectors. Protecting people, rather than jobs, means ensuring that they have or will acquire thenecessary skills to be employed in other more productive parts of the economy.Today much of this support falls under the competence of Member States, but also the EU canbuild on existing instruments, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and theEuropean Social Fund. There is a second way in which European integration can support youth employment: byfostering the exchange of ideas and knowledge as researchers, students, and technologiesmove across Europe. I am sure that many of the students here have been on an Erasmus exchange, or have comefrom other European countries to study here. There is clearly a European dimension toeducation. And Europe can contribute by investing in such exchanges as well as more broadly inthe advancement of science.The new Erasmus+, which now offers more opportunities for learning and training, is thus awelcome development. And the Bologna Process makes it easier for young people to work inanother EU country by facilitating the recognition of qualifications across borders.Moreover, the Youth Guarantee programme provides welcome support to the commitment byMember States to ensure that young Europeans under the age of 25 receive a good quality offerof employment, training or continued education.Labour mobility is often, when undesired, the result of poor cyclical and structural labour marketconditions. It is those conditions that should be addressed in the first place. The completion ofthe Single Market, the continuing progress in European integration and the deepening of ourEconomic and Monetary Union, will further expand the opportunities for young people beyondborders, and job matching possibilities. Labour mobility across countries and sectors is bound toincrease. This will require adequate supranational policies.ConclusionLet me conclude.In some countries, and Ireland is one of them, some progress in reducing youth unemploymenthas been achieved. More generally, the strengthening of the recovery in the euro area willcontinue to reduce its extent. But to address structural causes of youth unemployment, a uniformdegree of protection among workers, flexible labour arrangements, effective vocational trainingprogrammes, high degree of trade openness, and support to reduce the social cost of mobilityare all necessary conditions.I have highlighted the economic reasons that make addressing youth unemployment aninvaluable undertaking. But there is a more fundamental reason to continue addressing thischallenge with determination and as a priority. We have seen how in several countries the weightof the crisis has fallen disproportionately on the young people, leaving a legacy of failed hopes,anger and ultimately mistrust in the values of our society and in the identity of our democracy.192021 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Some say that a more equitable distribution of income and wealth is the answer and that it wouldbring those who have lost out from globalisation back into our compact. But that cannot beenough for the young people who are the future of our democracies. They do not want to live onsubsidies. They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities. Today after the crisis,governments know how to respond to their quest, and how to create an environment where theirhopes have a chance. They should do so: for the future of their countries’ youth and of theirdemocracy.See Bell, D. and D.G.

  Speech   Page 1/4    Embargo 21 September 2017, 5.30 pm Second Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture Introduction of John B. Taylor  Thomas J. Jordan   Chairman of the Governing Board Swiss National Bank Zurich, 21 September 2017 © Swiss National Bank    
     Page 2/4   Ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to welcome you to the 2017 Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture. The Swiss National Bank established the Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture Series to pay tribute to academics whose research is of particular relevance for central banking. With this annual lecture, we want to reach a wide audience, including, in particular, students. For this reason today’s event is taking place at the ETH Zurich, which is internationally one of the most renowned academic institutions. I would like to thank the President of the ETH Zurich, Professor Lino Guzzella, for making these fantastic premises available to us.  This year, we are paying tribute to John B. Taylor. He is one of the world’s foremost economists. John’s work is characterised by a keen interest in highly relevant questions, from both an academic and an applied point of view. He has made major contributions to economic theory. In addition, by bridging the divide between theory and practice, he is one of few economists to have had a profound impact on economic policy and thus on macroeconomic stability.  John is also a very effective teacher. Just let me give you one example. Did you know that Tiger Woods, the famous golf professional, was his student in the introductory class at Stanford? John taught Tiger about opportunity costs. Immediately afterwards, Tiger left college and joined the pro tour. Clearly, a decision that paid off. But back to John Taylor again. Today, he will talk about ‘Ideas and Institutions in Monetary Policy Making’. Before giving him the floor, I will briefly introduce him. Born in Yonkers, New York, John Taylor earned his A.B. from Princeton University and his Ph.D. from Stanford. He taught at Columbia University from 1973–1980 and at Princeton University from 1980–1984. And since 1984, he has been teaching and researching at Stanford.  John is the perfect economist. He is outstanding as a researcher, policy advisor and teacher. In acknowledgment of his exceptional services, he has received a number of prestigious awards for excellence in all these three fields. Let me say a few words about each of these areas, beginning with John Taylor the researcher.  His research topics range from work on rational expectations to wage and price dynamics, macroeconomics, econometrics, fiscal policy, and, of course, monetary policy. He has written an impressive number of influential articles in leading journals and important books. It is impossible to summarise his research in a few sentences. Therefore, I will limit myself to two topics.  The first topic dates back to the second half of the 1970s, when John initiated a research strategy that would have a profound and lasting impact on our profession. It was a time when the new-classical macroeconomists were claiming that monetary policy was powerless when it came to steering the economy. This challenged both the Keynesian and the monetarist views. John quickly accepted the new concept of rational expectations. However, he rejected 
     Page 3/4   the assumption that markets always clear, and that prices and wages are perfectly flexible. His research showed that – as a result of staggered wage contracts – monetary policy, even if anticipated, can be useful for stabilising the economy. This restored the proposition of Keynesian and monetarist models that even anticipated changes in money affect the economy. The second topic I would like to highlight is a recurrent theme in John’s research agenda. This is his deep interest in rules for monetary policy. John’s research has always emphasised the importance of rule-like, systematic behaviour for monetary policy. However, by the late 1980s, many people were arguing that efficient rules would have to be very complex, and expressed severe doubts about the practicability of rules for monetary policy. So John decided it was time to write down a workable rule that was consistent with his research. The result was a simple equation to guide interest rate decisions at the Fed. The equation related the policy rate to inflation and unemployment. When he presented his rule at a Carnegie-Rochester Conference in November 1992, he did not regard it as a big deal. It turned out quite differently. His paper, published in 1993, has become one of the most cited works in macroeconomics. The rule became known as the Taylor rule.  My experience at the SNB testifies the importance of the Taylor rule. For us, the Taylor rule derives its appeal from three features. The first is its simplicity in describing the behaviour of different central banks by estimating the policy reaction to deviations from the inflation target and to the output gap. The second is its quality as a benchmark in assessing the current stance of monetary policy with respect to the historical average for a similar macroeconomic situation. And, thirdly, the Taylor rule is appealing because it sets the standard by which monetary policy is introduced in macroeconomic models for forecasting and simulation purposes.  The SNB’s monetary policy focus is on maintaining price stability, and we do not follow any explicit rule for setting the short-term interest rate. However, the Taylor rule serves as an important indicator in our decision-making process that helps us to conduct a systematic policy.  Having talked about John the researcher, I would like to turn now to John Taylor the policy advisor. Time and again, John has merged research with policy making. On this account, his record is long and outstanding as well. He served as a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors from 1989 to 1991. He was on the Panel of Economic Advisers of the Congressional Budget Office from 1995 to 2001. And from 2001 to 2005, he served as Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs. His responsibilities included setting up a new currency in Iraq and getting terrorist financing under control. He worked on economic reconstruction in Afghanistan, and on coordination of financial policy with the G7 countries. All in all, an impressive job. Currently, John is a member of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance, which aims at improving the functioning of the global financial architecture and governance. No less fascinating is John Taylor the teacher in both ‘quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ terms. On the one hand, he has given countless speeches, hundreds of lectures, written several 
     Page 4/4   textbooks and developed online courses. On the other hand, he is known for mixing teaching with entertainment. Indeed, John does not hesitate to use special didactic techniques to help students understand or remember material. During his classes, to cite just one example, John enters into a humorous dialogue with Adam Smith, revealing deep enthusiasm and dedication to the job. And by the way, this example is quite remarkable for someone who describes his humour “as mostly deadpan”, so that it generally takes a few lectures before his students are able to figure out when something is actually a joke.  Having talked about John’s three occupations separately, I should emphasise how well they interact and stimulate one another. Research is integrated into college lectures; government work has enabled him to understand policy constraints, while this in turn has stimulated research. “Economic research,” John once wrote, “is most exciting and productive when it is policy-driven.” Karl Brunner could not have agreed more.  Coming to the end of my remarks, I would like to repeat how profoundly John Taylor’s thinking has affected central banking. For this, he earns our deepest respect and gratitude. I am certain that his lecture will give us much new food for thought on crucial issues.  Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming John Taylor with a big round of applause. John, the floor is yours. 
Yves Mersch: Risk management in times of non-conventionalmonetary policyKeynote speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the Joint Bank of Portugal and European Central Bank Conference on “RiskManagement for Central Banks”, Lisbon, 25 September 2017.*   *   *Let me start by thanking you for coming to this joint ECB-Banco de Portugal conference, and theBanco de Portugal for hosting us on this occasion. I am delighted to see central bank riskmanagers, practitioners and academics here in Lisbon to exchange views on risk managementfor central banks. This topic has gained such importance in recent years as central banksacross the globe, including the ECB, have sharply expanded their balance sheets, even thoughthe time for ever more of the same is behind us. Like the many great maritime expeditions thatstarted out from this country, some of our endeavours in recent years have taken us intouncharted territory. Now is a good time to take stock of what we have learnt and map out whatmay come next.Following stable principles in the Eurosystem’s risk management frameworkThe Eurosystem has a clearly defined objective, enshrined in the Treaty, to preserve pricestability in the euro area. The Treaty does not speak of eligible counterparties, collateral haircutsor issue share limits for bond purchases. However, you would be mistaken in assuming thatmanaging financial risks has no role in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation –especially in the light of the significant balance sheet expansion over the past few years. On thecontrary, we have applied the guiding principles of our financial risk management framework in astable manner. We established these principles long before we embarked on non-conventionalpolicies, not least because we have a statutory obligation to lend only against adequate collateral.We continue to apply them to standard as well as non-standard policy measures.Broadly speaking, these principles are protection, consistency, simplicity and transparency. Thismeans that – if multiple monetary policy options exist to fulfil our mandate – we should select themeasures that minimise our own exposure to financial risks. This idea is sometimes referred toas risk efficiency. These principles also imply that we aim to avoid undue distortions in themarkets in which we operate. We trade at market prices and we adopt a risk-equivalentapproach in setting our risk control measures. In addition, the principles require risk managementto be an integral part of decision-making in the institution. So we are compelled to measure riskin an objective and consistent way across different types of operation. Lastly, our frameworkspromote transparency and simplicity, and we champion adherence to these principles by beingrules-based ourselves and as predictable as possible in our operations.We have come together here to discuss risk management for central banks and the lessonsfrom the crisis. But, in addition to looking back, I would like to take this opportunity to map outsome fundamental elements that should be part of the future risk management framework, oncewe have returned to a more conventional monetary policy environment. Of course, these arelargely informed by some of the actions we took over the past decade and founded on theprinciples I have just described. So while we are clearly not in a position to move to this newsteady state in one go, its broad features can already be seen today.Navigating through gusts, storms and crosswindsRisk managers, including central bank risk managers, are generally prudent. Such prudence isnot only necessary to preserve market confidence in the central bank’s independence and abilityto comply with its mandate, it is also appropriate since we are entrusted with public money.

crisis, however, the central bank’s exposure to financial risks can – and may indeed have to –increase, because it is still expected to fulfil its policy mandate. The non-conventional measuresthat we implemented were necessary and proportionate to achieve our mandate; they have alsocontributed to financial stability by reducing financial risks in the euro area. There are, of course,limits to the actions of central banks, as monetary policy cannot address structural or fiscalsources of financial distress, nor can it step in to rectify national deficiencies as our mandateapplies to the euro area as a whole. It is important for central banks to strike the right balance inthis regard, and for financial risks to be correctly measured, properly understood and sufficientlycontained.Moreover, the European Court of Justice, in its judgment on outright monetary transactions, hasconfirmed the need to provide sufficient risk management measures that are “likely to reduce therisk of losses to which the ECB is exposed”.Speaking in a country with a proud history of maritime exploration let me recall the words ofSeneca, the Younger:When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind.The “harbour” of a central bank is its mandate. The principles it seeks to adhere to are the“compass” that helps it fulfil this mandate. When a central bank is facing a crisis, it needs toconsider whether its monetary policy operations are still proportionate. This need stems from theobligation under primary law (proportionality principle) to properly weigh up all the components ofa given measure against one another. The aim is to determine whether the expected benefits ofthe measure outweigh its costs. As a general rule, a stable risk management approach and athrough-the-cycle approach are advisable. However, extraordinary circumstances may requireextensions of the framework, such as the acceptance of additional collateral. If this still provesinsufficient, unprecedented types of monetary policy measures may call for entirely newoperations, accompanied by new risk management measures.The evolution of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations in response to the crisis featuredall these activities. Our risk management framework has evolved accordingly, guided by ourstable principles.First, the “gusty winds”: during the early stages of the financial crisis, we increased the amountof liquidity we provided to the banking system without tightening the risk control framework,despite the onset of stress in the system. In this respect, our risk management frameworkfollowed a through-the-cycle approach – thereby avoiding further distress to the banking system.It also stood in stark contrast to the more pro-cyclical nature of the commercial banking sector’srisk management approach – and was thus part of the central bank’s duty to lean against suchpotentially self-reinforcing winds.It was possible to avoid tightening the framework without exposing the Eurosystem to unduerisks because the pre-crisis framework had been calibrated in a sufficiently prudent manner. Infact, the framework proved to be robust enough to protect the Eurosystem from losses resultingfrom counterparties defaulting, such as Lehman Brothers or the Icelandic banks – although thecomplexity of the collateral in some of these cases led to lengthy liquidation processes. Thisexperience certainly merited a careful review of the collateral rules for complex securities andfinancial innovations. More broadly, it justified taking steps towards reducing the reliance onexternal credit ratings, in line with the G20 agenda.Second, the “storm broke out”: after the default of Lehman Brothers, it became evident that suchstandard measures were no longer sufficient to achieve price stability in the euro area. Wetherefore provided enhanced credit support and, later on, non-standard credit operations in thelight of the increased liquidity demands from the banking system. To avoid potential collateralshortages when satisfying this increased demand, we expanded the range of assets against 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
which banks can draw liquidity from the Eurosystem. But at the same time, we followed theprinciple of risk equivalence with the assets accepted under the pre-crisis rules.Let me give you a concrete example: since 2012, several national central banks of the euro area,including the one hosting this conference, have accepted additional bank loans as collateral. Toensure risk equivalence, haircuts on these assets were higher than those used in regularoperations.This brings me to the third phase of the crisis, the “crosswinds”: in recent years the continueddecline in inflation rates in the euro area called for additional non-standard measures – I amreferring, of course, to the asset purchase programmes. This type of liquidity provision was anovelty for the Eurosystem, although the instrument of outright purchases has been envisagedas one of the legal and operational tools of the Eurosystem since its inception. Accordingly,additional risk control frameworks needed to be developed to keep the financial risks in checkgiven the significant rise in exposures.Our Asset Purchase Program, especially the PSPP, its largest component, is a case in point:the Eurosystem applies strict eligibility requirements. Purchases are subject to issuer and issuelimits. We closely monitor the risks of the programme in place and any possible deviations fromthe benchmarks, e.g. in the CBPP3. Our due diligence can, under very strict conditions, lead topurchases of covered bonds that credit rating agencies rate below our regular eligibility threshold.On the other hand, our due diligence can also lead to additional risk control measures forparticularly risky covered bonds.Given that we have not suffered any impairment since we started the expanded asset purchaseprogrammes, I feel justified in saying that the financial risks have been successfully contained sofar.Maintaining the risk management principles while returning to a more conventionalmonetary policyIt is clear that, once we have seen a sufficiently sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, wewill continue to prudently adjust our tool-box of monetary policy instruments, as we have beendoing since December last year. This will also be the moment when we have to carefully reviewhow our operational and risk management framework has deviated from its pre-crisis state.Where necessary, some temporary measures will be rolled back. But we will also considerwhether there are areas where we have taken new risks onto our balance sheet – andconsequently where certain elements should be kept.The developments I have just described offer some insights into how the future steady state riskmanagement framework might look. At the moment, I see four key features:First, while the temporary collateral framework has successfully eased potential collateralshortages, it could be argued that it should not become part of the regular framework. As liquiditydemand declines, there will also be less need for an expanded set of eligible collateral. Whethersome temporary measures might be transformed into a state-contingent framework, ready to beactivated again in the future if circumstances so require, is an open question. As experienceshows, each crisis needs a tailored response.Second, we will need to keep the flexibility to adjust the collateral framework to financialinnovations, especially when it comes to complex new financial products. The new “simple,transparent and standardised” securitisation regulation is a case in point. It will allow us to betterassess the collateral we accept. In a similar way, we will need to forcefully deal with new types ofsecurities, such as conditional pass-through covered bonds, whose risks may not yet have beenfully appreciated. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Third, we will have to retain the risk control frameworks for the asset purchase programmesbeyond the horizon of our net asset purchases. As long as we keep outright portfolios on ourbalance sheet, the reasons behind the risk control measures, including eligibility criteria,purchase limits, benchmarks ensuring diversification and the different risk-sharing agreements,will continue to apply.Fourth, the Governing Council will have to decide whether we ought to rely more on our ownjudgement about the quality of assets and counterparties and to further expand Eurosystem-internal credit assessment systems, steps which would require additional resources. It meansfurther enhancing the due diligence on external credit ratings, for which sufficient transparencyon the judgement underlying these ratings is essential. And it means using supervisoryinformation to ensure an efficient implementation of monetary policy operations – the introductionof the European single supervisory mechanism has brought about fundamental improvementshere, as it allows for the sharing of relevant information within the legal limits of the separationprinciple.To conclude, I believe the Eurosystem’s risk management framework has successfullyweathered the financial storms of the past few years. The reason is that we followed stableprinciples when the size of our operations, the assets accepted as collateral or the types ofoperations changed. Looking ahead, we can already start thinking about a financial riskmanagement framework that will be appropriate for a central bank that has returned to a moreconventional environment for the conduct of monetary policy, while still following these principles.I now look forward to the panel discussions, which will pick up on some of those issues in moredetail, and to hearing your views.

Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Invisible to joined handsSpeech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the Annual Joint General Membership Meeting of MART, ACI, IHAP,TOAP, NASBI, and FMAP, Makati City, 21 September 2017.*   *   *The spirit of unity, collaboration and optimism in this Annual Joint General Membership Meeting ispalpable.  That there are six (6) prestigious financial market associations here in full force in spiteof a holiday of sorts is exciting.  It sets the tone for our willingness to work hard together, hand-in-hand to make our financial markets stronger and better.Historically and ideologically, there has been a divide between the private and the public sectors. There are staunch views that capitalism will take care of itself and government should leavemarkets alone.  As early as the 18th century, Adam Smith’s theory of the “invisible hand” thatguides supply and demand toward equilibrium and efficiency was gospel. In the 1930s, the idea of self-correcting markets was debunked by the Great Depression… evenrecently, by the Global Financial Crisis. That Government can improve market outcomes – topromote efficiency and equity, and address market failures is now accepted principle.That you have consistently been valuable partners of the BSP emphasizes – quite happily – thatwe are on a higher plane of acceptance. We view each other as indispensable partners inachieving our shared vision of greater economic development … There is resoundingacknowledgement that we are on the same side… and it is only when we work together that wecan achieve our goals.For this, I sincerely thank you.  To the Money Market Association of the Philippines (MART), ACIFinancial Markets Association Philippines (ACI Philippines), the Trust Officers Association of thePhilippines (TOAP), the Fund Managers Association of the Philippines (FMAP), the InvestmentHouse Association of the Philippines (IHAP) and the National Association of Securities BrokerSalesmen, Inc. (NASBI), maraming salamat… Thank you for being partners with us in our shared vision of ensuring a more robust financialsystem… To everyone in this ballroom, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening.Setting contextMany of us have witnessed how our country has transformed from being an economic laggard toone of the region’s fastest performing economies. For the past 74 quarters (or 18.5 years), the Philippines has posted uninterrupted GDP growth,backed by strong macroeconomic fundamentals.Inflation today is low and stable with average headline inflation from January-August 2017 at 3.1percent.  The balance of payments is under control despite global shifts. External liquidity issecure.  We benefit from prudent fiscal management with the National Government deficit at amanageable level of 2.1 percent of GDP and a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio of 42.1 percent asof end 2016.  And we protect our fiscal space to support economic gains by moving forward withan ambitious tax reform agenda.In the first half of 2017, GDP growth was 6.4 percent.  A strong domestic demand and expansivegovernment budget for infrastructure development underpins this growth.  Overseas Filipinoremittances and BPO sector revenues continue to drive our economy. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Recently, the World Bank affirmed a positive growth path for the Philippines, forecasting theeconomy to grow even more at 6.8 percent this year, and at 6.9 percent in 2018.Overall business sentiment remains positive as shown by the results of the BSP BusinessExpectation Survey for the third quarter of 2017.  Indeed, it is possible to have both strong economic growth and manageable inflation.  For 2017–2019, we expect average inflation to track the target range midpoint of 2-4 percent… Ampledomestic liquidity and broad-based growth in bank lending for production activities continue tosupport economic growth.While there could be some transitory upside risks to inflation owing to the possible impact of theproposed tax reform program along with pending petitions to raise power rates, inflationexpectations continue to be within target over the policy horizon. Over the medium term, as theinfrastructure program gets underway, the resulting improvement in productivity and varioussafety nets are also expected to temper the impact on inflation.  Based on these considerations,the Monetary Board decided during its meeting earlier today to maintain the BSP’s key policy rateat 3.0 percent.With respect to the external sector, the Philippines’ current account (CA) balance narrowedduring the 1st half of 2017 relative to a year earlier. This was due mainly to higher net receipts inthe trade-in-services, and primary and secondary income accounts which mitigated the wideningtrade-in-goods deficit during the first half.  In turn, the strong demand for imports such as capitalgoods, consumer goods, raw materials and intermediate goods is a result of the sustained andbroad-based expansion in the domestic economy’s capital formation, production andconsumption.The increased demand for dollars also reflects residents’ investments abroad and prepaymentsof foreign debt. However, continued strong inflows from overseas Filipinos’ remittances,business process outsourcing receipts, and revenues from the tourism sector, are seen tosupport the current account. Meanwhile, we continue to watch against financial market volatilityas risks emanating from normalization in advanced economies and ongoing geopolitical tensionsmay dampen investor sentiment.Our financial sector has also demonstrated strength and sustained growth amidst uncertainty.Banks have stronger balance sheets and much improved asset quality. There is double-digitgrowth in assets, loans, deposits and capital. The banking system’s resources expanded by 14.2percent as of end-July supported by a stable deposit funding base. In line with the country’sdomestic growth, banks’ total loan portfolio grew by 17.9 percent and is diverse across industrysectors.Notwithstanding sustained expansion in credit, banks demonstrate prudence in lending.  Banks’NPL ratios declined to 1.98 percent.  Banks also maintained an adequate buffer for loan losses,registering a higher NPL coverage ratio of 113.13 percent.Meanwhile, banks continue to build up their capital position. As of end-March 2017, the capitaladequacy ratio (CAR) of universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) registered at 15.8 percent. Continuing need for balanceWe have much going for our economy that outshines seemingly inherent negativity.  What is therole of the BSP and what more can it do to protect and advance our solid gains?  Let me sharewith you some programs of the BSP key reform agenda…these embody what I describe as“Continuity Plus Plus”.The BSP remains committed to its core mandates of maintaining price and financial stability, as 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
well as an efficient payments and settlement system.  These form part of the “Continuity”agenda. Monetary policyTo ensure inflation is kept at a manageable level, the BSP follows an established process in itsperiodic review of monetary policy.  The BSP has been successful in keeping inflation low andstable, in this regard, we will continue with our monetary policy approach and inflation targetingmechanism. With the introduction of the Interest Rate Corridor (IRC) last year, we continue to strengthenmonetary policy transmission.  We have seen some encouraging results in the form of 1)sustained Term Deposit Facility (TDF) demand, and 2) a gradual adjustment in market interestrates.  As originally envisioned, we shall continue to improve the IRC system as we movetowards a more market-based implementation of monetary policy. Prudential reformsFurther, leveraging on the financial system’s current position of strength, we will continue topursue progressive and proactive prudential reforms to maintain resilience against externalshocks.With the evolving trends and changing preferences in financial services delivery, we continue toalign with international standards while engaging relevant stakeholders for our policies to remainresponsive to local conditions.Last week, our enhanced corporate governance framework took effect.  It emphasizes theresponsibilities and qualifications of banks’ board of directors and senior management andstrengthened requirements for board composition.  This essentially serves as the overarchingframework that ties in risk management in functional areas of a financial institution.Earlier, the BSP issued regulations to strengthen governance over treasury activities.  The BSPexpects market participants to behave ethically and with utmost integrity in all its dealings.  We recognize that the industry has developed a Code of Ethics.  We understand it governsfinancial market activities as well as market conventions covering a range of financial products. We enjoin the industry to review these standards to ensure alignment with global best practice. We encourage the industry to operationalize arrangements to promote adherence to the Code,not only at an industry level, but down to the institution- and individual-level. In our expanding market, integrity and accountability are vital in sustaining confidence. Strategic financial sector reforms towards inclusive growthNow, let me move on to what is close to my heart.  While continuity is about focusing on our coremandates, the “plus plus” agenda pushes the envelope further and focuses on reforms that willfoster broad-based inclusive growth.  These financial sector and market infrastructure reformsare strategic, complementary, and reinforcing.  They aim to 1) deepen our local currency debtand foreign exchange markets, 2) digitalize our payment system, and 3) ultimately enhanceaccess to financial services and products.The world has recently recognized our potential as a promising investment destination. Ourcapital markets are poised to serve as an important source of funding in support of the NationalGovernment’s resolve to shore up infrastructure.A well-functioning local currency debt market, therefore, is critical to the implementation of asustainable market-oriented debt management strategy.  This will likewise support open market 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
operations of the BSP.  This will promote financial stability by diversifying funding sources tosupport economic growth, and increase the availability of financial products.Many of you were at the BSP last month when the BSP, in collaboration with the Department ofFinance (DOF), Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), and the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), unveiled the local currency debt market development roadmap.As you know, the capital market reform agenda will initially focus on benchmark markets.  Thereforms will be undertaken over an 18-month time frame from launch in November with specifictargets for regulatory and institutional milestones.  Deliberately, we sequenced and calibrated theroadmap to ensure that urgent and foundational issues are prioritized.These include initiatives to 1) increase the volume of treasury bills, 2) provide stable, predictableand transparent issuance of government securities, 3) develop a systematic set of obligations,rights and incentives for market-makers, 4) establish a reliable yield curve, 5) introduce a repoprogram, and 6) strengthen regulatory oversight over the repo and fixed income market.Even as we pursue efforts to deepen the local debt market, the BSP actively worked onimproving access to investment products.  For instance, the Personal Equity RetirementAccount (PERA) was launched late last year.  This was done with the strong support of theindustry. The program provides an opportunity for capital market gains to be enjoyed by a widerretail base.  Further, we continue to pursue a related legislative agenda such as the CollectiveInvestment Schemes Law (CISL) to provide a harmonized legal framework for pooled vehicles ofinvestments.Given the Philippines’ young demographic profile, these efforts can also translate to themobilization of a sizeable and sustainable amount of savings towards financing the country’slong-term infrastructure requirements and developmental programs.As part of our holistic financial sector reform agenda, we are pursuing ambitious foreignexchange (FX) reforms. The objectives are to deepen the FX market, increase its efficiency andreduce the cost of doing business.   Reforms include removing prior BSP approval for certain FXtransactions, simplifying registration processes, further reducing documentary requirements, andenhancing data capture for effective policy decision-making.While the idea is to establish a framework that relaxes FX rules and regulations, we wish tostress that authorized agent banks (AABs) are responsible and are held accountable for faithfullycomplying with these rules.With these efforts, we hope to encourage FX flows from the parallel market to the formal market.Even as we strengthen regulations over Money Service Businesses (MSBs) to maintain financialintegrity and enhance consumer protection, we will streamline FX requirements for the bankingsystem to reduce market fragmentation and increase FX liquidity.The amendments to FX regulations is part of a broader thrust for an organized FX market. Theintention is to increase transparency, improve price discovery, and increase availability of FXinstruments, including hedging products, to improve risk management capabilities of banks andclients.Finally, we are setting our sight on digital innovations as a catalyst to reach greater scale. Creating an efficient digital infrastructure reinforces our capital and FX markets and financialinclusion agenda. It provides an enabling platform that can transform the way financial servicesare efficiently delivered and consumed.In this regard, the BSP is committed to drive modernization of the country’s retail paymentsystem, promote electronic retail payments, and facilitate inter-operability for faster settlement of 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
transactions.  The launch of the National Retail Payment System, in partnership with industrystakeholders, will help us achieve this vision of a “cash-lite” economy.From invisible to helping handsAt the onset, I expressed how the role of Government in economic markets has shifted fromexclusion, to regulation, to cooperation.  Adam Smith’s invisible hand, while potent with respect toforces of supply and demand, is now complemented by the helping, collaborating and joinedhands of the Government and the private sector.  Joining hands is essential for long-termsuccess. This is so as goals must be shared and not merely cascaded. For sustainability, interests of theregulator and regulated must converge.Our objectives are the same but our expertise and experiences are varied… these differencesmay be harnessed so that we can come up with viable and mutually beneficial outcomes.  I havefaith that ACI, MART, IHAP, TOAP, NASBI, and FMAP will remain our trusted partners in thisregard. I trust that all of you will remain committed to playing a big role in growing our respectivemarkets, in developing professional standards, in delivering value to your organizations andclients, and in forging strong partnerships with regulators such as the BSP.  Today is a day ofprotest.  Join me in protest against inefficient and undeveloped financial markets.  Tama na! Panahon na! Sama sama tayo sa pagunlad.  Mabuhay tayong lahat.Thank you and I wish everyone a pleasant evening. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
  News conference   Page 1/3    Berne, 15 June 2017 Fritz Zurbrügg Introductory remarks by Fritz Zurbrügg  In my remarks today, I will present the key findings from this year’s Financial Stability Report, published by the Swiss National Bank this morning. In the first part of my speech, I will look at the situation of the big banks, focusing on the progress made in implementing the revised ‘too big to fail’ regulations (TBTF2) that came into effect almost a year ago. In the second part of my remarks, I will outline our current assessment of the situation at domestically focused banks. Big banks Let me start then with the big banks and the TBTF2 regulations. The revised regulations are designed to resolve the ‘too big to fail’ issue in Switzerland, so that systemically important banks no longer have to be bailed out with taxpayers’ money in the event of a crisis. The TBTF2 regulations rest on two complementary pillars. First, they are aimed at strengthening the resilience of systemically important banks in a going-concern perspective. They therefore specify higher requirements for going-concern capital in particular, thereby reducing the likelihood of a systemically important bank getting into financial distress. Second, if a systemically important bank nevertheless gets into financial distress – this is called the gone-concern perspective – the regulations provide a framework for orderly resolution, ensuring the continuation of systemically important functions without the use of public funds. To this end, the regulations stipulate requirements both for loss-absorbing capacity in a gone-concern perspective and for resolution planning. What progress have the two big banks made in implementing the TBTF2 regulations? Regarding the first pillar, resilience, both big banks have improved their loss-absorbing capacity in a going-concern perspective since the last Financial Stability Report. With this further improvement, Credit Suisse and UBS are on track to meet the final capital 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Fritz Zurbrügg News conference   Page 2/3   requirements.1 In a going-concern risk-weighted perspective, both banks are already fully compliant. However, a further improvement is necessary with respect to the leverage ratio. The SNB acknowledges the progress made in improving the capital situation. Achieving full compliance with the TBTF2 regulations will further strengthen loss-absorbing capacity. This is necessary as the big banks’ loss potential relative to their capitalisation continues to be substantial, when measured on the basis of the stress tests carried out by the SNB as well as the losses experienced during the last financial crisis. Given the big banks’ significance to the Swiss economy, it is important that they remain adequately capitalised in the event of such losses occurring. This brings me to the second pillar of the TBTF2 regulations – resolution. Here, too, both big banks have made progress. On the one hand, since June 2016, Credit Suisse and UBS have significantly improved their gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity. To this end, they issued further bail-in bonds, which can be converted into equity in the event of impending insolvency. On the other hand, the two big banks have implemented key organisational measures. For instance, they have both set up Swiss subsidiaries that contain their systemically important functions, including, in particular, domestic deposit and lending business. In order to resolve the ‘too big to fail’ issue in Switzerland, more progress also needs to be made in the area of resolution. This will involve, first, further improvements in gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity in a gone-concern perspective, as stipulated in the regulations and, second, further progress in drawing up robust resolution plans. By end-2019, the big banks will need to demonstrate that they would be able to maintain their systemically important functions in Switzerland without interruption in the event of impending insolvency. The resolution plans will also need to meet foreign regulatory requirements. Domestically focused commercial banks I will now turn to domestically focused commercial banks, whose main business is in lending and deposit-taking. I would like to highlight three key developments at these banks. First, domestically focused banks further increased their risk exposure in 2016. Mortgage growth at these banks remained strong. Moreover, their interest rate risk exposure from maturity transformation continued at high levels. In addition, they took on greater affordability risks and the share of new mortgages with a high loan-to-income ratio reached a new peak. All this took place against the background of high imbalances on the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets. Although these imbalances declined slightly in 2016, they are still at levels similar to those in 2014, when the sectoral countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) was set at 2%.   1 Final requirements refer to the requirements that will apply after expiry of all transitional provisions, and in particular to the qualitative requirements for going-concern capital. 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Fritz Zurbrügg News conference   Page 3/3   Second, the average interest rate margin of domestically focused banks decreased in 2016, having stabilised at a low level in the previous year. This renewed reduction in the interest margin highlights the considerable pressure which these banks continue to face in their core business, in an environment of exceptionally low interest rates. At the same time, however, banks’ net interest income and reported profits increased. This is mainly because the growth in mortgage volume more than offset the reduction in the interest rate margin. Third, the resilience of domestically focused banks remains adequate. In terms of both risk-weighted assets and leverage ratios, they are well capitalised by historical standards, and their capital surpluses currently exceed the regulatory minimum requirements. SNB stress tests indicate that the surpluses at most of these banks are large enough to absorb losses under adverse scenarios. That is the SNB’s evaluation of the current situation at domestically focused commercial banks; but what about our assessment of the outlook? Here, the predominant feature is again the margin pressure that I have just mentioned. The pressure on interest rate margins will remain strong as long as interest rates remain exceptionally low. Thus, there will be strong incentives for banks to take on more risk. In the short term, an increase in affordability risk or interest rate risk may help to prevent a further decline in profitability. However, it would make banks more vulnerable to a large upward interest rate shock and to a correction on the mortgage and real estate markets. Greater risk-taking in lending could also lead to a renewed increase in momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets. This applies particularly to residential investment property, where upward pressure on prices could remain strong. If interest rates rise, there is the risk of a substantial price correction. This could result in credit losses at the banks that provide funding for such investors. This highlights the importance of the capital surpluses currently held by the domestically focused banks. Going forward, banks should set their risk appetite and their capital planning so as to ensure that they can absorb the losses that would arise under highly unfavourable but possible scenarios. Even under such scenarios, the banks must be able to perform their economically important functions – especially that of providing credit to the economy. The SNB will continue to monitor developments on the mortgage and real estate markets closely, paying particular attention to the residential investment property segment as well as to banks’ risk-taking in mortgage lending. In parallel, it will continue to regularly reassess the need for an adjustment of the CCyB. 
 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka Bank of Japan September 25, 2017 Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished gathering of business leaders in the Kansai region. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.  In my speech today, I would like to first explain the Bank's view on the recent developments in economic activity and prices, and then talk about its thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.  I. Economic Developments Let me start by talking about developments in Japan's economy. The economy is expanding moderately, and the real GDP growth rate for the April-June quarter registered a firm increase of 2.5 percent on an annualized basis. It is the first time in eleven years, since 2006, that it has continued to mark positive growth for six consecutive quarters (Chart 1). Looking ahead, the economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Some of the recent characteristics of the economic expansion are as follows.  The first feature is that the economic growth has been led by both external and domestic demand in a well-balanced manner. Looking at overseas economies, business sentiment in the manufacturing sector has been on an improving trend in both the advanced and the emerging economies, and the world trade volume has been recovering. Under such circumstances, Japan's exports have been on an increasing trend, such as those of automobile-related and capital goods (Chart 2). Regarding domestic demand, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at record high levels. Private consumption has increased its resilience recently against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Furthermore, as the effects of the government's large-scale stimulus measures formulated last year have been emerging lately, public investment has been increasing (Chart 3). The economy has been expanding, not on the basis of a single factor, but rather supported by multiple factors -- namely, external demand, domestic private demand, and domestic public demand -- in a 
2  well-balanced manner. For this reason, the economic expansion can be expected to sustain itself going forward.  The second feature of the recent economic expansion is that its effects have been spreading to a wide range of economic entities. The differences in the degree of improvement in the diffusion index (DI) for business conditions either by firm size or by region are not as large as those during the recovery phase in the mid-2000s before the global financial crisis (Chart 4). The DI for the Kinki region had been below the national average from 2015 toward 2016, but has been improving rapidly since the second half of 2016, reflecting a remarkable recovery in overseas economies. Looking at the employment and income situation, the current economic expansion has benefitted a wide range of households. The year-on-year rate of increase in hourly wages of part-time employees, which are particularly sensitive to the tightening of the labor market, has registered about 2.5 percent. This is higher than that of full-time employees, implying that the difference in wage levels between part-time and full-time employees has become smaller. There have been many cases where those who had worked as part-timers but wanted to become employed as full-timers have been able to do so. Moreover, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio of full-time employees exceeded 1 in June for the first time since the statistics started to be compiled in 2004 (Chart 5). As just described, the economic expansion has been benefitting both full-time and part-time employees. In the labor market as a whole, the unemployment rate has declined to around 3 percent, which is equivalent to virtually full employment, and the active job openings-to-applicants ratio stands at 1.52, exceeding the highest figure during the bubble period and reaching a level last seen as far back as in 1974 (Chart 6).  Triggered in part by the tightening of labor market conditions, it has become another feature of Japan's economy of late that a wide range of firms and industries have been taking measures to raise labor productivity. Since wage increases resulting from labor shortage mean rises in labor costs for firms, many firms have been making various efforts to avoid passing on a rise in labor costs directly to their customers. A typical example is labor-saving and efficiency-improving investment with the use of information technology. In fact, in labor-intensive sectors such as retailing as well as accommodations, eating and drinking services, software investment has increased to a remarkable degree recently (Chart 7). 
3  Furthermore, firms have been streamlining their business processes. For instance, some supermarkets and chain restaurants have discontinued services late at night and early in the morning, at which time the number of customers is relatively small, and instead allocated their limited employees to daytime services. Even with reduced labor input due to shorter business hours, sales will not decrease so much, thereby lifting firms' labor productivity.  Of these measures, increasing labor-saving and efficiency-improving investment has certainly contributed to the recent growth in business fixed investment. In addition, from a longer-term perspective, firms' various efforts are expected to play an important role in raising Japan's growth potential. In Japan, it is essential to raise labor productivity to compensate for the decline in labor force. Although this is not easy, firms' increasing efforts of various kinds amid the widespread labor shortage of late have become a driving force toward raising productivity, which is a long-standing challenge to Japan's economy.  II. Price Developments Now I will move to price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has increased to around 0.5 percent recently, but that which also excludes the effects of a rise in energy prices has been relatively weak, remaining at around 0 percent (Chart 8). Looking ahead, the Bank of Japan projects that the rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent. In what follows, let me describe how this process will operate, especially from firms' standpoint.  What lies behind the fact that inflation has been relatively weak despite the increase in labor costs is firms' efforts to absorb the costs that I mentioned earlier. Specifically, many Japanese firms have raised wages for their employees but kept the prices of products and services unchanged, through labor-saving investment and streamlining of their business processes, for example. It often is pointed out that one reason why firms do not raise their sales prices is a kind of caution that, if they raise their prices but competitors do not, they may lose customers and competitiveness in the market. Given that their competitors have the same thought, perhaps all the competing firms wait and see what others will do and none make the first move. This strategy itself would be reasonable for firms facing stiff 
4  competition. At the same time, however, it also makes it unlikely that firms will raise their sales prices by passing on increased costs to those prices as necessary.  What will happen going forward? Given that firms have already been working on streamlining their business processes in many ways, it will gradually become difficult for them to continue to absorb increases in wage costs through those measures. In addition to continuing efforts to streamline their business processes, firms will need to reflect in their sales prices the increased costs that they cannot absorb. Lately, it also seems to be becoming more likely that competitors will follow suit when a firm moves toward increasing its prices. This is because it is highly likely that, facing a tight labor market, every firm feels that it has been reaching the limit to which it can absorb increasing labor costs. On the consumer side, their perception of price rises seems to be changing gradually, as the employment and income situation has improved due to the better labor market conditions. After one of the major transportation companies announced this spring that it planned to raise the prices of its delivery services, competitors followed suit. According to a news report, slightly more than 30 percent of firms in the restaurant business are planning to raise the prices on their menus within this fiscal year, mainly due to increases in labor costs. These developments appear to show the possibility that firms' price-setting stance has been changing in response to the tightening of the labor market and improvement in the economy.  These kinds of changes in firms' price-setting stance have not yet become widespread in the entire economy. However, as firms' and consumers' stance on the passing on of costs changes with the economy continuing to expand moderately, firms' attempts to raise sales prices will likely gradually become more widespread across a broad range of industries. Furthermore, as this process lifts actual prices, firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations, or people's perception of future inflation, will increase. The Bank of Japan projects that, through these mechanisms, the inflation rate is likely to increase gradually toward the price stability target of 2 percent.  III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy Next, I will elaborate on the Bank's thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy. As stipulated in the Bank of Japan Act, the objective of the Bank's monetary policy is 
5  "achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy." The specific number representing "price stability" is "2 percent" in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI.   For reasons why this needs to be 2 percent, I will explain three points in sequence: a bias in price statistics, securing policy room for the future, and a global standard.  Let me start with a bias in price statistics. Although I am not going into detail since this might be a bit technical, the inflation rate based on the CPI that the Bank refers to tends to be higher than actual inflation. Given this, aiming at zero inflation in terms of the CPI means aiming at negative inflation, in effect. Therefore, in order to ensure price stability, the inflation rate should be sufficiently positive.  The next point regards securing policy room for the future. The level of nominal interest rates is usually determined in accordance with that of inflation rates. Looking at the interest rate levels around 2007, right before the global financial crisis, whereas the policy interest rates in the United States and Europe were around 4 to 5 percent with inflation of around 2 percent, the policy interest rate in Japan, or the uncollateralized overnight call rate, was only 0.5 percent with almost zero inflation (Chart 9). In response to the global financial crisis, which exerted a significantly negative impact on the global economy, the United States and Europe counteracted this shock with monetary easing that pushed down the policy interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points to around 0 percent. On that occasion, although Japan also reduced the policy interest rate to around 0 percent, as the United States and Europe did, it was only able to exert limited monetary easing effects of 0.5 percentage point. As you remember, the real GDP in Japan dropped more significantly than that in Europe and in the United States, the epicenter of the crisis. This implies the possibility that the fact that Japan had less room for policy responses in lowering interest rates became a contributing factor to the severer downturn of the economy. With the level of nominal interest rates being high, Japan's economy will have more policy room to mitigate the impact of future economic downturns, or will be equipped with a sort of insurance for sustained economic growth.  
6  So far, I have mentioned a bias in price statistics and securing policy room for the future, but these alone do not give a good enough reason why the target level of inflation has to be 2 percent. There are some proposals advocated overseas that the target level of inflation should be 3 to 4 percent in order to further increase policy room, although these proposals themselves do not seem realistic. So, why is 2 percent considered most appropriate?  To answer this question, the third reason, a global standard, is key. Central banks in major economies are currently conducting monetary policy with the aim of achieving around 2 percent inflation. Given this, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy conduct with the aim of achieving 2 percent inflation is also likely to contribute to stable foreign exchange rates in the long run. Foreign exchange rates fluctuate due to various factors in the short run, but they are considered to reflect inflation differentials between at home and abroad in the long run. From the long-run perspective, if the inflation rate at home remains stable at around the same level as those in other major economies, stability in foreign exchange rates consequently will be ensured.  For the preceding three reasons, the Bank sets the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. However, some may feel uncomfortable about aiming at a positive inflation rate of 2 percent. For example, in the Bank's Opinion Survey on the General Public's Views and Behavior, a questionnaire survey of individuals, about 80 percent of respondents answered that price rises are rather unfavorable.   I would like to emphasize that what the Bank aims at in the conduct of monetary policy is not simply an increase in inflation. It aims to achieve an economy with a virtuous cycle in which the incomes of people increase firmly as the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is achieved. The historical data show that consumer prices and wages have generally been moving in parallel. In Japan in the 1980s and in the United States, with positive inflation, nominal wages generally increased at a higher pace than the CPI (Chart 10). Given that developments in actual prices are factored in at annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, the parallel relationship between inflation and wage growth is easy to understand. In such an economic environment, nominal interest rates usually will increase as well. Since interest rates are the rates of 
7  return on investment for each economic activity within the economy as a whole, they are expected to converge to the level consistent with the nominal growth rate of the country in the medium to long run. In an economy with economic expansion and steady positive inflation, both nominal wages and nominal interest rates increase, which means that the incomes of wage and salary earners, and of those who are living off their deposits, will increase.  I would like to underscore the fact that the Bank, through achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, is aiming at realizing a well-balanced economy in which people's incomes increase accordingly.  Conclusion Lastly, I would like to conclude my speech by briefly explaining the Bank's recent conduct of monetary policy.  The Bank has been implementing powerful monetary easing under "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. This policy framework was introduced exactly a year ago, and at this meeting with you last year, I talked about the new policy, which had just been introduced.  "QQE with Yield Curve Control" consists of two components. The first is an inflation-overshooting commitment, in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the actual CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. The second component is yield curve control, in which the Bank controls short- and long-term interest rates under the guideline for market operations decided at every Monetary Policy Meeting. Looking back at the one year since its introduction, Japan's long-term interest rate has been stable at around zero percent, which is the target level, and bank lending rates as well as issuance rates for corporate bonds have been at extremely low levels. Moreover, financial institutions' lending attitudes as perceived by firms have remained positive both for large and small firms, and the year-on-year rate of increase in the amount outstanding of bank lending has been in the 
8  range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently. Such highly accommodative financial conditions, as well as proactive initiatives by financial institutions, have been firmly supporting corporate activities in Japan.  Although there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will continue to persistently pursue powerful monetary easing with a view to achieving the target at the earliest possible time.  Thank you.

  News conference   Page 1/4    Berne, 15 June 2017 Thomas Jordan Introductory remarks by Thomas Jordan  Ladies and gentlemen It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to the Swiss National Bank’s news conference. I will begin by explaining our monetary policy decision and our assessment of the economic situation. I will then hand over to Fritz Zurbrügg, who will present this year’s Financial Stability Report. After that, Andréa Maechler will review developments on the financial markets. Finally, we will – as ever – be pleased to take your questions. Monetary policy decision Let me begin with our monetary policy decision and the inflation forecast. We are maintaining our expansionary monetary policy, with the aim of stabilising price developments and supporting economic activity. Interest on sight deposits at the SNB is to remain at –0.75% and the target range for the three-month Libor is unchanged at between  –1.25% and –0.25%. We will remain active in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration. The negative interest rate and our willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing pressure on the currency. The Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued. The new conditional inflation forecast differs little from that of March. We continue to anticipate an inflation rate of 0.3% for the current year. For 2018, the forecast has fallen slightly to 0.3%, from 0.4% in the previous quarter. For 2019, we now expect inflation of 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 2/4   1.0%, compared to 1.1% last quarter. The conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains at –0.75% over the entire forecast horizon. Global economic outlook I would now like to turn to economic developments abroad, as these have a considerable bearing on the inflation and economic outlook in Switzerland. In line with our expectations, the global economy has strengthened further in recent months. Global GDP growth in the first quarter was more robust than in previous quarters. This is due in large part to an encouraging upturn in emerging economies. In the euro area, too, economic recovery has gained strength. Owing to the stronger economic growth, the labour market situation in advanced economies has improved further; with full employment now almost reached in the US, Japan, the UK and Germany. Across the euro area, unemployment has declined again.  Despite these positive developments in the real economy, inflation remains modest in most advanced economies. Against this background, monetary policy in Japan and the euro area in particular is likely to remain very expansionary. In the US, monetary conditions are expected to gradually normalise. In our new baseline scenario for the global economy, we anticipate that economic developments will remain favourable. For 2017, economic growth looks set to be its strongest in six years. The improved economic conditions are expected to gradually translate into higher inflation only in the course of 2018, especially in the euro area.  The cautiously optimistic baseline scenario continues to be subject to considerable downside risks; this is due to political uncertainty and structural problems in a number of advanced economies.  Swiss economic outlook I shall now turn to the economic outlook for Switzerland. According to initial quarterly estimates of the national accounts, positive stimuli from abroad were again only partially transmitted to the Swiss economy in the first quarter. Although GDP growth firmed somewhat, it still remained subdued at an annualised 1.1%.  What is our assessment of the current economic situation? Overall, available economic indicators suggest that the Swiss economy is on the road to recovery. Export figures and company surveys alike have pointed to an upturn in manufacturing activity since the beginning of the year. Positive developments are also in evidence in significant areas of the services sector and construction. We are gratified to see that the more favourable economic situation and improved business sentiment are reflected, too, by a greater willingness to invest.  
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 3/4   However, certain indicators suggest that the recovery has not yet taken hold in all areas of the economy. Utilisation of production capacity is unsatisfactory in a number of industries, and companies’ profit margins remain tight. These difficulties arise from a combination of economic and structural factors. In addition, the strong Swiss franc continues to weigh on some industries. Momentum in the labour market reflects this mixed picture. Although the situation continues to improve, the pace is only moderate. Seasonally adjusted unemployment has again receded slightly in the past three months. Companies are nevertheless still cautious about taking on new staff. For 2017, we continue to expect growth of roughly 1.5%. Exchange rates, interest rates and inflation expectations I will now review changes to monetary conditions since the beginning of the year. The trade-weighted nominal exchange rate for the Swiss franc has remained stable overall in the last six months. In the run-up to the French presidential election, there were episodes of increased upward pressure. After the decision in France, the franc again weakened somewhat against the euro. By contrast, it appreciated slightly against the dollar. In real terms, the franc has virtually remained unchanged on a trade-weighted basis over the last half-year and is still significantly overvalued. Interest rates in Switzerland have remained virtually unchanged in recent months. The interest rate differential to the euro area has remained stable as well. Short-term rates in the US, on the other hand, have risen slightly, reflecting the tightening of monetary policy there. Inflation expectations for Switzerland have increased somewhat over the past half-year. Households, companies and financial analysts are now expecting an inflation rate of just above zero, also for the short term. In the longer term, meanwhile, expectations are around 1%. A similar view is substantiated in the company talks conducted by the SNB’s delegates for regional economic relations. Inflation expectations are in the range that is consistent with the SNB’s definition of price stability. Monetary policy outlook  Ladies and gentlemen, let me summarise my key points. Inflation remains very low and capacity utilisation continues to be unsatisfactory.  The Swiss franc is significantly overvalued. In periods of uncertainty, it is still subject to increased upward pressure. The two elements of our monetary policy ease this pressure. The negative interest rate makes Swiss franc investments less attractive, by at least partially restoring the traditional interest rate differential against other countries. Interventions in the foreign exchange market supply the market with additional Swiss francs when demand for our currency is particularly strong. 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 4/4   Our expansionary monetary policy remains necessary in order to ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Newly designed ‘Business cycle signals’ report To conclude, I would like to draw your attention to an additional document in the media pack. It is the preprint of the ‘Business cycle signals’ report.  The SNB’s delegates for regional economic relations regularly conduct talks with managers of companies throughout Switzerland. These talks provide us with a first-hand account of the latest cyclical and structural developments in our economy and are an extremely valuable source of information for the Governing Board in its assessment of the economic situation. A summary of the information gathered from these talks has been published in a quarterly report for some time now.  We have redesigned this report to coincide with today’s monetary policy assessment. The aim of the new design is to allow readers to interpret the results of the talks at a glance. In addition, the text is supplemented by charts to enable comparisons over time. A structured approach, both with regard to conducting the surveys and to selecting the companies, forms the basis for the compilation of such time series. In redesigning the report, we also changed the title from ‘Business cycle trends’ to ‘Business cycle signals’.  I am pleased to be able to present you with the delegates’ new ‘Business cycle signals’ report today. It will continue to be published as part of the SNB’s Quarterly Bulletin.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. It is now my pleasure to give the floor to Fritz Zurbrügg, who will present this year’s Financial Stability Report.  
William C Dudley: Prospects for the local economy and theimportance of workforce developmentRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the Onondaga Community College, Syracuse, New York, 25 September2017.*   *   *Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here with you in Syracuse, and I want to thank OnondagaCommunity College for hosting us. This is my fourth visit to Central New York as president of theNew York Fed, and I always look forward to coming back as part of our regular visits to differentparts of our district. These trips and our meetings with stakeholders in the region give me and mycolleagues important insight into what’s happening in the economy.Today, I will briefly discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and what we are seeing at theregional level, and offer some reflections on the challenges and importance of workforcedevelopment in the region and across the nation. As always, what I have to say reflects my ownviews and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the FederalReserve System.Two years ago, I spoke in nearby Rochester on the topic of workforce development. Since then,the need for effective workforce development has become no less pressing, and both the NewYork Fed and the Federal Reserve System have focused greater efforts on this critical issue.This morning, I will return to some of the themes from that speech and look at lessons we havelearned.The U.S. Economic OutlookAlthough the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposedimmeasurable hardship on many and will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for a time, theseeffects are likely to be relatively short-lived in the context of the overall economic outlook. Naturaldisasters tend to depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstructionefforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic activity.Looking beyond the storm effects—which will make interpreting near-term economic datareleases more difficult—the U.S. economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth,which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market. Over time, this should support a rise in wagegrowth. The fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable. Lowunemployment, sturdy job gains, and rising wages—even at a pace below previous expansions—are lifting personal income. Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equityprices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthyhousehold balance sheet. Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in comingquarters.Business fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise. With the supply of labortightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and improvement inU.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness. The softer dollar and solidgrowth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economicgrowth.12 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
With a firmer import price trend and the fading of effects from a number of temporary,idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percentobjective over the medium term. In response, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to removemonetary policy accommodation gradually.The Regional EconomyWhile the national economy has been growing steadily since the end of the Great Recession, theeconomies of Upstate New York have lagged behind, with job growth running at only about halfthe national pace through much of the expansion. And, over the past year, job growth in UpstateNew York has slowed considerably, particularly in Rochester and Buffalo.Here in Syracuse, job growth has also been disappointing through most of the expansion, with aneven slower pace of growth than many other upstate areas. In fact, today, almost 10 years afterthe Great Recession, Syracuse has still not fully recovered all of the jobs that were lost—abenchmark most of Upstate New York passed some time ago.However, this slow growth does not imply that the region is standing still. Indeed, there is a lot ofactivity going on beneath the surface. The Syracuse economy and labor force are evolving andbecoming better positioned for the future. But, more needs to be done to help workers adapt tochange, a theme I will return to in a moment.As is the case in much of the country, Syracuse has experienced a dramatic decrease inmanufacturing jobs, reflecting the dual forces of technological change and globalization. Thesewere well-paying jobs that supported a vibrant middle class. Now, I am a firm believer in theoverall positive effect that open trade has had on the United States, but I also recognize that itsbenefits and costs are distributed unevenly, and the positive and negative consequences can begeographically concentrated. On the whole, we have not done enough to recognize the vastconsequences of these changes and to help those hurt by technological change andglobalization.The Syracuse economy has changed considerably from 25 years ago, when manufacturing wasthe dominant source of jobs and income. The number of manufacturing workers has been cut inhalf since then, reducing the sector’s share of employment from 15 percent to 8 percent—ashare that is now on par with the nation. This transition has been painful, but has resulted in amore diversified and stable regional economy.In manufacturing’s place, the healthcare and education sectors have picked up the slack, andhave been a stabilizing force for the Syracuse economy. Offsetting the 20,000 manufacturingjobs that were lost over the past 25 years are around 25,000 jobs added in education andhealthcare. Those two sectors now employ almost 20 percent of the workers in the region. Othersectors, like business services and leisure and hospitality, have also been creating new jobopportunities that differ from the ones the region previously relied on.In addition, jobs are being created in innovative hot spots in the region. For example, start-upcompanies rising from the Syracuse Tech Garden, as well as a new global center for unmannedaerial systems, are providing exciting new opportunities. While these particular efforts are stillrelatively small in scale, they have the potential to change the trajectory of the regional economyover time. However, Syracuse will need workers with deep skill sets to fill such jobs.To that end, it can be difficult for workers to adapt to these changes, and they may need help toget there. Taking a broader view, the good jobs being created in today’s economy require moreeducation, training, and, ultimately, skill than ever before. The skill requirements for virtually alljobs are increasing, and workers will need to rise to the occasion to thrive in today’s economy.The challenge facing all of us is how to best help workers develop the skills necessary to land a3 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
good job, and how to enhance those skills over time as work requirements evolve. Workers withyears of experience in jobs that are no longer in demand have it especially hard, as their skillsmay not be sufficient or match current opportunities—an all-too-familiar story for workers in theSyracuse area.Workforce DevelopmentWorkforce development must, therefore, be a top priority for everyone involved: workers,employers, communities, government, and educational and training institutions. There is no silverbullet or one-size-fits-all solution. This is a complex challenge that requires a combination ofstrategies. But one thing is clear: it requires a holistic approach encompassing the “three P’s” Idescribed two years ago—Partnerships, Programs, and Placement—and then some. Beforedelving deeper into these, let me first explain why we, as the nation’s central bank, care aboutworkforce development.As many of you know, the Federal Reserve is tasked by Congress with a dual mandate:maximum employment in the context of price stability. Clearly, we cannot declare success if wehave people who want to work but lack the skills to fill available jobs. A skilled workforce that ismatched to the needs of employers is necessary for the economy to grow and prosper, and forindividuals to reach their potential. Monetary policy can help labor markets recover by providingincentives for firms to invest and grow. However, monetary policy cannot by itself solve skillmismatches and gaps that exist in the economy.So, what can we do? The Federal Reserve provides research and analysis, and leverages itsconvening ability to bring together diverse stakeholders to better understand the issues andidentify practices that work. For example, we run the Leading the Way video campaign with P-TECH schools and employer partnerships. This competition challenges teams of high schoolstudents in the Rochester area to create public service announcements detailing skills requiredto work in industries that are currently hiring. We also participate in the New York City DataScience Task Force to increase the number and diversity of students in the metropolitan areaprepared to enter graduate school or the workforce with data science skills. And, we are finalizingthe results of a survey of community colleges across New York State that looks at theirengagement with employers for the purposes of workforce development. I will talk a bit moreabout the survey’s preliminary results shortly.In addition, we are working with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and our fellow regionalReserve Banks on broader initiatives to promote investment in workforce development andencourage partnerships, including next month’s Investing in America’s Workforce Conference inAustin, Texas. The conference is a joint effort by the Federal Reserve System and severalleading institutions in the field intended to connect businesses, government agencies, non-profits, academics, and philanthropic organizations. The goal is to reframe workforcedevelopment as an investment, attract new resources, and leverage existing ones to improveeconomic mobility and job opportunities for potential workers.The Three P’s of Workforce DevelopmentThe core of any workforce development effort is the need to help workers build the skillsnecessary to adapt to change, meet the challenges of an evolving economy, and find good-paying jobs. We have been hearing from business owners across our district, on our advisorycouncils, and through surveys for several years about the skills gaps they face, in areas asdiverse as engineering, long-haul trucking, welding, and metalworking. What they all have incommon is that they require specific skills and training, whether through a certification program,a two- or four-year degree, or a formal apprenticeship—an approach that has been verysuccessful in countries such as Germany and the UK, but has not been as widely used here.45 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
This is where the partnership concept comes into play. Partnerships entail cooperative effortsbetween local employers and educational institutions to determine the best strategies to helpworkers develop the skills employers need. The good news is that New York State seems to beahead of the curve in this area.As I mentioned, we are in the process of completing a survey of community colleges in New YorkState. The early results are encouraging: we have found that all community colleges in the stateoffer some workforce development programming, and partnerships with employers are the norm.In fact, the median number of employer-partners among community colleges is over 100, andthere are partnerships in every industry, from healthcare to utilities to agriculture. Suchpartnerships are growing in importance and fill a need for both local workers and employers. Thisgoes to my second P: Programs. Community colleges in New York are becoming very adept atcreating programs tailored to the current skills required by local employers.Locally, I’d like to highlight Onondaga Community College’s partnership with Madison Countymanufacturers, which trains workers through the Apprentice Career Training program. Thisprogram provides paid training for students that can lead to four-year apprenticeships inparticipating businesses in advanced manufacturing, where they will develop skills necessary forjobs that are in high demand, including maintenance mechanics, tool makers, and machineoperators.I would also like to call attention to Work Train’s job training and industry collaboration, as wellas the work of the Onondaga Citizens League to quantify the types of jobs that are in CentralNew York, what job opportunities will likely exist in the future, and other critical workforce-relatedquestions. I anticipate that the Citizens League’s report on how Central New York works willserve as an important resource for shaping workforce development programs in the area.However, while training and skill-building are foundational, they are not enough. Placement intogood jobs—my third P—is a critical component of effective workforce development, especiallyfor those currently unemployed. Recent work by Federal Reserve economists highlights some ofthe hurdles to job placement that will need to be overcome. This research leveraged the NewYork Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations to examine how people find work. The differencebetween those looking for work while employed versus those who are unemployed is stark.Relative to the unemployed, employed workers spend less time searching for jobs but have threetimes higher contact rates and two times as many job offers. Furthermore, workers hired fromanother job do better than those who are unemployed, receiving 28 percent higher wages andtwice the level of benefits. While we have always known how difficult it is for recent high schoolor college graduates to find their first job, it seems that those currently unemployed face an evengreater hurdle, and this is an issue that we need to address.Another finding from this work is the importance of networking and references for those seekingemployment. Referrals accounted for 40 percent of total job offers, and while 60 percent of all jobapplications were the result of job board searches, these accounted for only 24 percent of offers.This all suggests that workforce development providers need to build relationships and trust withemployers as a way to help their job-seekers find available opportunities and successfully applyfor them.Having covered the three P’s, I’d like to now focus briefly on the “and then some,” which refers toaddressing a number of social and structural factors that work against even the best workforcedevelopment efforts.In my travels throughout the region and my interactions with workers, business leaders,workforce development practitioners, and others, I regularly hear how access to transportationand childcare are preventing able and willing workers from actually working. People’s inability toget to jobs relatively far from where they live—either because they can’t afford a car or there is no678 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
viable and reliable public transportation. This is a challenge we are seeing both in sparselypopulated areas, like the North Country, and in cities, where jobs may be available in thesurrounding suburbs and exurbs with no easy public access. With regard to childcare, cost andaccess are what we hear most as hindering people’s ability to fill jobs. And, even for those whocan afford childcare, irregular scheduling by employers makes it very difficult to plan effectively.Additional adverse factors include a decline in geographic mobility—that is, people’s ability orwillingness to relocate to where the jobs are—and the opioid epidemic, which Chair Yellenrecently spoke about as having a significant negative impact on our workforce.While I am not an expert on these subjects, I can say that the inefficiencies these impedimentscreate are keeping us from realizing our full potential individually and as a country, and thataddressing them as part of a comprehensive workforce development solution is essential.I would like to conclude by saying that Syracuse, as well as Upstate New York more generally,has been dealing head-on with the consequences of economic change for a long time. Perhapsbecause of this, the region has developed a deep understanding of the importance of helping itspeople adapt through workforce development programs. The issue of workforce development isa complex one that requires a holistic approach and close collaboration among all interestedparties. The good news is that many great organizations in the area are trying differentapproaches to discover what works best. Our region is in many ways leading the way, and we atthe New York Fed will continue to support these efforts.Thank you for your kind attention.

Andreas Dombret: On the road to greater regulatoryproportionality?Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank,at the strategy conference of the Rhineland Savings Banks and Giro Association, Bonn, 29August 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenSome of you may perhaps recall that I have been a guest at the Rhineland Savings Banks andGiro Association’s strategy conference once before – two years ago, to be precise. On thatparticular occasion, I shared my views on a variety of topics including the precarious situation inGreece and the slump in China’s equity market. Fast forward to the present day, and there areother, not entirely new challenges we are looking at: digitalisation, regulatory matters, interestrate levels.We are here today to discuss strategies which you can use to counter the current challenges. Iwould like to make a practical contribution to today’s proceedings by talking about the challengeof regulation. My speech here will focus particularly on small banks and savings banks with aregional footprint and show how the regulatory landscape might evolve for them.2. Regulation – a challengeLet me begin by asking you this: what do you, personally, associate with regulation andsupervision? I trust you will all now be thinking of your competent analysts at the Bundesbank.But for many of you, I would imagine, your thoughts will also be turning to paperwork, constraints,costs. And let me tell you: you wouldn’t be wrong. Regulation and supervision are indeed achallenge – they do create constraints, they do run up costs.Yet it is no less true that regulation is necessary, and it is useful. The paperwork, the constraints,the costs – there are good reasons for all these things.After all, the services provided by banks and savings banks are crucial for a stable economiccycle, for growth and prosperity. Banks and savings banks fund investments, they managesavings and deliver important services, such as processing payments.But taking risks is also part of the banking business. And when you take risks, there’s a chanceyou might fail. But when a financial institution fails, the implications are far-reaching – and I don’tjust mean for the institution itself, but also for its investors, for the real economy, and for us all.The financial crisis, which marks its tenth anniversary over the next few weeks, taught us that thefailure of a single institution is enough to trigger a chain reaction throughout the entire sector.Smart regulation ensures that banks and savings banks can still go about their business, but thatthey are appropriately protected against the biggest risks. It shields the economy, consumersand the financial system itself against turbulence. The reason we can’t give financial institutionsfull rein is because of the important part they play in the economic cycle.That’s a point that often goes unnoticed in the debate surrounding regulation. Please don’t get mewrong: regulation and supervision are not sacrosanct; criticism is certainly not out of bounds. Inthe days when I myself was being supervised, I voiced criticism when I felt it was right to do so.But criticism, whatever form it may take, needs to be constructive and honest and it shouldn’t beunduly sweeping. Regrettably, that cannot be said of all the utterances in the public debate on 1 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
this topic.3. Regulatory proportionality is lackingRegulation and supervision are crucial, and it’s right that they should be something of a burden.But it is also clear that needlessly heavy demands should be avoided. Regulation needs to costas much as necessary but also as little as possible.And I fear this is a mark we’ve been falling short of in some respects lately. Because regulationhas grown ever more complex over time. The years since the onset of the financial crisis, inparticular, have seen the Basel Committee adopt wide-reaching global reforms. The idea behindthese initiatives was to learn the right lessons from the financial crisis and to be better equippedgoing forward to fend off disruptions of that magnitude. The increased complexity of regulations,then, is merely a reflection of the mounting complexity of global banking business. So you couldsay it is warranted – and the sector’s global players are mostly certainly in a position to get togrips with the new rules.But in actual fact, the bulk of these complex rules, especially in Europe, apply not only to majormultinational institutions but to every single bank and savings bank as well. And that’s quite aproblem. Because when small and medium-sized institutions comply with the rules, they do notbenefit from the same economies of scale which their larger rivals can harness. For one thing,small institutions face much heavier costs, relatively speaking, when they invest in ITinfrastructure or hire an additional employee for their Compliance department. That’s a downsidethey can only partly offset by cooperating with other institutions from their network. As such, thesingle rule book runs counter to the idea of a level playing field and creates problematicincentives in terms of uniformity and size in the banking sector.Regulation today already takes account of proportionality to a degree. Tiered standards exist inareas such as reporting, where large institutions are required to meet more frequent andcomprehensive reporting standards, and supervisors largely exercise proportionality whenapplying the minimum requirements for risk management. Proportionality is also embedded, inprinciple, in the EBA guidelines on the supervisory review and evaluation process. But in practiceI repeatedly encounter situations where the existing gradations are inadequate in my eyes. Theproportionality principle is nothing new, then, but it still has not been anchored deeply enough.4. The road to greater proportionality: a chronologyThat’s why we took action and explored ways in which the principle of proportionality could beembedded more deeply within the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Let me start byrunning you briefly though the events of the past one-and-a-half years. 2 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and his then UK counterpart George Osbornemoved the ongoing debate forward substantially in April last year by noting, in a joint paper, theincreasing complexity of banking regulation and pointing to the excessive burden on smallinstitutions running straightforward business models. It is a topic we at the Bundesbank also feelvery strongly about. Hence my decision to go public with the first set of specific proposals a littlewhile later.That November then saw the European Commission likewise table its proposals forstrengthening proportionality as part of the general overhaul of EU banking regulation, which isstill an ongoing process. These proposals would make major changes to the small print, and Iam certain that we will be able to roll out a number of meaningful initial improvements.That said, the proposals don’t go far enough – which is why we thought ahead. Theestablishment of a German Specialist Working Group was followed by the drafting of aBundesbank paper setting out concrete measures as well as several consultations with theGerman central associations. The outcome of this process is a German “non-paper” – that is, adiscussion paper – which the Federal Ministry of Finance put before the competent expert groupof the European Commission in June this year. 3 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
5. Which way? When working out this common German proposal, there were essentially two paths we couldtake to move towards greater proportionality. Should we look into specific adjustments, or shouldwe go straight into creating a separate regulatory framework for small institutions?The first path has a clear practical advantage: it would be quick and relatively simple toimplement, especially since European legislation on banking regulation is currently being revisedanyway. It does have its disadvantages, however: realistically speaking, smaller institutions willnot gain any substantial relief from their burdens on account of a few specific improvements toregulation. There is also the risk of ending up with a patchwork of exceptions that are difficult tointerpret.The second path would be more radical. The creation of a separate regulatory framework forsmall institutions – also known as the “small banking box” – would mean more fundamental relieffor these institutions. A clear and consistent definition would also prevent any difficulties ininterpretation. Though the implementation and maintenance of this would be somewhat morecomplicated, in future the regulations for small and large banks would be developed in paralleland in alignment with each other. Depending on how the threshold values for the small bankingbox are set, there is also the risk of cliff effects. 4 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
We have carefully weighed up these and many other arguments in the Specialist Working Groupon Proportionality. The group’s purpose was to facilitate the exchange of views betweenpoliticians, supervisors and the banking industry. The Federal Ministry of Finance, BaFin, theBundesbank and the five central associations of the German banking industry were allrepresented in this group.These members agreed that it would be expedient to bolster proportionality in regulation. The aimof the working group was therefore to work out specific proposals on how to alleviate the burdenof regulation on small institutions with simple business models. And it delivered on that aim: thenon-paper that I mentioned earlier, which was written with the group’s help, is now in Brussels,where it is being used as the basis for further discussion at the European level. 5 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
5.1 The question of “Who?": a three-tier approachSo what does the German proposal look like? First, let me address the “Who?", namely who arethe relief measures intended for. The proposal takes a three-tier approach in this regard.At the very top are the systemically important and potentially systemically risky institutions – thesmallest group in terms of numbers but extremely important in terms of risk. Because of this, it isalso the most intensely regulated. Generally speaking, this group includes institutions with totalassets of over €20 billion. Nothing will change for these institutions: all of the Basel IIIrequirements will still apply, as will the additional capital buffer, the total loss absorbing capacity,and so on.A second group would include institutions which are not large and systemically important, butwhich are also not small and low-risk, which is why it is not possible to make any extensivesimplifications for them. Nonetheless, the proposal does include for this middle group sometargeted relief measures which could be achieved by making specific amendments to the currentregulations.Finally, the third group is made up of small and non-complex institutions – the banks that aremost affected by the fixed costs of regulation without their systemic importance being consideredindividually. This group – the largest in numerical terms – is to have its cost burden alleviatedradically by means of a separate regulation: the small banking box.The burning question now, of course, is which institutions belong in which group – andparticularly, which banks could be included in the small banking box. I will say right off that I amnot able to conclusively answer this important question today. These classifications have to bebalanced carefully, and we will do this as part of European-level discussions. 6 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
I would, however, like to give you an initial idea of how this classification might look. By talking ofsmall institutions, this suggests that a qualification criterion for the small banking box would berelatively modest total assets. For example, in Germany, a total assets threshold value of €3billion could put more than 80% of institutions into this category.What constitutes large and small in other member states is completely different, however. Toaccount for this heterogeneity, absolute size would have to be supplemented with relative size. 7 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
This could be the ratio of the bank’s total assets to its home country’s economic power or thesize of the domestic banking sector, though in this case, too, size isn’t everything. I’ve alreadysaid that not only do institutions in the small banking box have to be relatively small, they alsomust not be too complex. This is why we need additional criteria.First, only institutions that we believe would be subject to insolvency proceedings in theevent of resolution may be part of the box.Second, candidates for the small banking box must not engage in any notable capital marketor cross-border business.Third, they should have, at most, a small trading book and a small derivatives book.Fourth, instead of internal models, they may only use the standardised approach.This list of requirements prevents institutions with riskier business models from being part of thesimplified regime.Experience has taught us, however, that there will almost never be a perfect list of criteria thatcovers every eventuality. This is why the final decision should always rest with the supervisors.Should they have serious misgivings, they can opt not to subject an institution to the simplifiedrules. They can also take into account the systemic risks arising from the connectedness ofseveral small institutions – that is to say, small banks which are “too many to fail".Incidentally, this possibility to choose should not be a one-way street. I believe that institutionsthat would be considered eligible for the small banking box should also nevertheless be given theoption of being supervised pursuant to the more complex rules.But coming back to the figures: if we were just to apply a threshold value of €3 billion, around1,300 banks and savings banks in Germany could fall under the simplified rules, or just over 80%of all institutions, as mentioned earlier. This would be equivalent to 14% of the German bankingsector’s total assets. Of course, this is just an initial calculation and it doesn’t include theadditional criteria I listed.If you look at the banks and savings banks in North Rhine-Westphalia alone, the picture is largely 8 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
the same: here, too, around 80% of the institutions could come under the simplified rules. Thiswould be equivalent to 24% of total assets in this state.Some of you will no doubt be wondering what happens when institutions are close to thethreshold value. This is a good question, because alone around 50 German savings banks havetotal assets between €2.5 and 3.5 billion, some of which are in the Rhineland – perhaps some ofyou even run one of these institutions.The question of potential cliff effects always comes up when quantitative thresholds are set.Nonetheless, we regulators cannot do without thresholds. I believe two things are important toprevent institutions from moving in and out of categories or, worse still, basing their businessstrategy on attempts to stay within a certain threshold. First, quantitative thresholds must beflanked by qualitative criteria and supervisors must also take decisions on a case-by-case basis.In other words, just because a bank’s total assets fall below a specified threshold, that isnowhere near enough for it to be included in the small banking box. Second, we are discussingintroducing transitional arrangements to help make it easier to switch between regimes –something that we want to be an option.Ladies and gentlemen, a sensible and workable definition of institutions whose burden could berelieved is perfectly feasible. And while it may appear that way at first glance, creating the smallbanking box does not necessarily require a whole new set of rules. All that is needed is a shortsection in the CRR dedicated to the issue. 9 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
5.2 The question of “what?": reducing the paperworkThat leaves the second key question: what exactly might the box look like? Let us start at theheart of the problem, namely, the paperwork which the complex requirements create in variousareas.Some of these requirements could be completely eliminated for institutions in the small bankingbox. I could, for instance, imagine largely exempting small banks from disclosure requirementsand abolishing remuneration rules for them. In addition, they could be absolved from recoveryand resolution planning.Full exemption from other requirements would be a step too far. But that should not prevent usfrom trying to make things easier for small banks. For example, reporting could be reduced to acore reporting process – a standardised reporting approach, if you like. A simplified form of thenet stable funding ratio (NSFR ) is also up for debate.When designing the small banking box we must weigh up the benefits for supervisors, ieensuring financial stability, against the burden it creates for banks. As a rule of thumb, we cansay that any rules that are dispensable for effective supervision are up for negotiation. 10 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
6. Limits of the small banking boxConversely, however, that also means that a lot of rules are not up for debate. And that bringsme to the limits of the small banking box. I will not beat about the bush: there can be noconcessions in terms of risk-based capital ratios, the leverage ratio or the short-term liquidityratio. And the list goes on. Small banks’ business models are neither per se simple norautomatically low-risk – and that is particularly true when looking at them as a whole. The newregime must therefore be simple yet robust. Whatever happens, financial stability must beguaranteed.And, of course, we also want to avoid unintended consequences. Simplifications in one areamust not create additional work in another area. That also means that a sensible division oflabour and cooperation within banking associations should not be made needlessly complicated.However, I am not overly concerned about this issue either. As I said earlier, the principle ofproportionality is not new and is already well-established in our risk-oriented supervisory practice.So far, the banking associations have managed well in organisational terms. And I would like toremind you that the very purpose of our joint proposal is to avoid unnecessarily high amounts ofpaperwork. 11 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
7. What happens next?The objective of reducing the regulatory burden for small and medium-sized institutions isattracting more and more supporters. Speaking in Jackson Hole at the weekend, Chair of theUnited States Federal Reserve Janet Yellen spoke in favour of reducing the burden on smallerinstitutions.Achieving this goal will be no stroll in the park, however. In drawing up a concept for the smallbanking box, we have taken the first important steps. The aim now is to gain a European majorityfor our idea.For a reminder of how difficult that could be, we have to bear in mind just how different Europeancountries and their banking sectors are. A lot of our European neighbours have only a relativelysmall number of banks, virtually all of them medium-sized to large. Others have a lot of smallbanks, but have experienced serious problems with them in the recent past. And in some othercountries, the banking system is currently undergoing a far-reaching transformation process,which means that the structure of the banking system will experience sweeping change.The question we encounter is always the same: why should we agree to a small banking box?That is the situation within Europe, and that is where we must provide information, explain thesituation and convince people.For that to succeed, we must present a united German front. If we in Germany do not manage toall stand behind the small banking box concept, we will have a hard job convincing otherEuropean countries.1 12 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches

Lawrence Schembri: Monetary policy framework issues - towardthe 2021 inflation-target renewalRemarks by Mr Lawrence Schembri, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Bank ofCanada workshop "Monetary Policy Framework Issues: Toward the 2021 Inflation-TargetRenewal", Ottawa, Ontario, 14 September 2017.*   *   *Good morning everyone, et bonjour à tous.Bienvenue à la Banque du Canada. Je m’appelle Larry Schembri. Je suis un sous-gouverneur icià la Banque.It is a great pleasure for me to open this workshop on issues central to the monetary policyframework and its implementation.Given the significant challenges central banks have faced in achieving their monetary policygoals since the global financial crisis, this is a propitious moment to step back and re-examinethese fundamental issues from a variety of perspectives.As many of you know, the current monetary policy framework in Canada consists of twocomponents:a consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 2 per cent, the midpoint of a control range of1 to 3 per cent; anda flexible, market-determined exchange rate.While the second component has been in place for almost 60 of the past 70 years, our inflation-targeting regime was implemented in 1991 and the current specification has existed since 1995.This framework has served Canada well in the face of significant movements in commodityprices and Canada’s terms of trade, as well as other shocks, including the Great Recession.Inflation has averaged just below 2 per cent since we implemented the target, and both outputgrowth and inflation have been much more stable relative to before 1991.In addition, two important features of our inflation-targeting regime have drawn favourableinternational recognition:first, the price stability policy goal of the regime is founded on a joint agreement between theBank of Canada and the Government of Canada; andsecond, the agreement is reviewed regularly on a five-year basis.The joint agreement with a democratically elected government enhances the legitimacy of theprice stability objective and thereby boosts its credibility. It also gives the Bank of Canadaoperational independence to achieve this goal.The regular five-year review, meanwhile, affords the Bank the opportunity to revisit manyimportant aspects of our monetary policy framework and its implementation.While the framework has worked well in the past, improvements should always be considered—especially given the changing economic environment, the lessons learned from experience inCanada and elsewhere, and pertinent research findings.In the past, the Bank has used this opportunity to organize and give visibility to its monetary policyresearch program, which has examined various dimensions of our monetary framework—well 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
beyond the relatively narrow scope of the joint inflation-control agreement and the goal of pricestability.The regular five-year review also presents the opportunity to engage various stakeholders in thisprocess to provide us with helpful ideas and useful feedback on our work. This workshop is acase in point. It has been organized early in the current five-year review cycle, so we can drawfrom a wide range of perspectives—from academics, economic journalists and other centralbankers and policy makers—well before we begin to develop the key questions for our researchprogram that will culminate in the 2021 renewal and publication of our background document.In addition to striving to obtain a wide range of perspectives, the workshop has been organized ina fairly open-ended manner to stimulate dialogue on a broad span of issues. And in keeping withour desire to be open and transparent about this process, and to include all Canadians, today’sconference is being webcast and we will post running commentary on our social mediachannels.We have divided the workshop into four panels:one on the role and objectives of monetary policy in Canada;two panels on more operational issues, namely the scope and effectiveness of monetarypolicy tools, and monetary policy communication; anda panel on lessons learned from other central banks.In the past, we have considered several important framework questions, most notably:whether to lower or raise the inflation target;whether to adopt a price-level path target, instead of an inflation target; andwhat would be the implications for monetary policy of financial stability vulnerabilities andrisks.These issues were considered primarily during the last two review cycles, which ended in 2011and 2016, respectively.In recent years, discussions of monetary policy frameworks have focused on the impact of anumber of significant economic developments. These include:the decline in the equilibrium real interest rate and thus in the “neutral” policy interest rate,which limits the scope for use of countercyclical changes in the policy interest rate;the decline in potential output growth—especially in advanced economies—driven bydemographic trends and lower labour productivity growth, forces that monetary policy haslimited or no ability to counteract; andthe elevated level of indebtedness of both the private and public sectors, which raisesconcerns about financial stability, fiscal space and central bank independence.And, looking ahead, new financial technologies could affect the implementation and transmissionof monetary policy.So, we are most fortunate to have with us today a very distinguished group of speakers toenlighten us with their thinking on these and other challenging issues. Please let me close bythanking them, and all conference participants, especially those who have come some distanceto be with us today.It promises to be a very stimulating workshop, and my colleagues and I are very much lookingforward to listening and discussing with you. Bonne journée. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Joachim Wuermeling: Keynote speechKeynote speech by Prof Joachim Wuermeling, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the Mandarine Gestion International Investment Conference, Munich, 18September 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenI believe that most of your fellow passengers travelling to Munich did not come here for meetings,but for the “Oktoberfest". The “Oktoberfest” started two days ago – on the 16th of September.You can tell that people in Munich think ahead: they’re already celebrating October in mid-September.Talking of “thinking ahead", you could draw a parallel between the “Oktoberfest” and monetarypolicy: celebrating the “Oktoberfest” in September is a kind of forward guidance. The Bavariansannounce very early what they expect to happen in the future – October will be here soon.So the Bavarians are acting just like the Eurosystem, which is made up of the national centralbanks of euro area countries plus the European Central Bank. Forward guidance is now aregular part of the statement of the ECB President after every Governing Council meeting. Butforward guidance is not the only instrument that was implemented by the Eurosystem inresponse to the financial crisis: a whole package of non-standard measures was adopted. Andthese measures have an impact on financial markets and related investment decisions.As portfolio managers and investment managers, you undoubtedly keep track of thesedevelopments and the statements made by central bankers. And thinking ahead, you will beprobably wondering about the future implementation of monetary policy in the euro area.Munich is located in a region of breath-taking mountain scenery, and regarding this future path anumber of references to a mountain hiking tour can be made. I shall begin by sketching a generalpicture of the current financial conditions – in the same way that you would check what theweather is going to be like before going on a hiking tour. In the second part of my speech, I shallshine light on the implementation of monetary policy in the euro area and its instruments – or tocontinue with the image of a hiking tour – the equipment and path that brought us to where weare today. In my third part, I shall look at how things could unfold in the future. Note the use of theword “could” – after all, the third section of my speech today will take us well and truly into therealm of hypothesis, the world of “what ifs” – or, to continue our hiking tour metaphor, the timeafter the lunch break on the summit.2. Financial markets: The current landscapeI would like to start with the current scenery in the financial markets.As portfolio managers and investment managers, analysing the financial markets is your day-to-day business. The agenda for tomorrow’s conference gives you a great opportunity to exchangeviews on the outlook and trends in financial markets. Therefore, I shall keep my comments onhow we as central bankers see the current financial setting as brief as possible.For the most part, global equity markets have been developing positively lately, despite emerginggeopolitical tensions. The US S&P 500 index, for example, is chalking up one all-time high afteranother. On our side of the Atlantic, the equity markets are currently also posting gains. Althoughthe EuroStoxx50 and DAX recorded some losses in the course of the year, they were quick to 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
recover from this setback.The economic outlook for the euro area has improved and if the euro appreciation continues, theeuro area will be more attractive to investors. Looking at the FX market, this segment is sensitiveto the expectation of market participants regarding the future monetary policy. Notably, on 8September – the day after the ECB press conference – a two-year-high was recorded with anexchange rate of USD 1.206 against the euro. Since then, the exchange rate has been fluctuatingwithin a narrow corridor. But to be clear, the exchange rate of the euro is determined by marketforces and it is not a policy target of the Eurosystem.Activity in the bond market is also determined by the expectations among market participantsconcerning future monetary policy. The prospect that the monetary policy of the Eurosystem willremain very accommodative and the somewhat lowered expectations of a policy hike in the USare leading to declining yields on long-term government bonds at the current edge. The yieldspreads between long-term Bunds and government bonds from the rest of the euro area havenarrowed, as political risks have not materialised.At the beginning of this year, uncertainty in the euro area was rated much higher. A turbulent yearof elections in many European countries lay ahead. One indicator measuring the economicpolicy uncertainty in Europe is currently moving around its long-term average – in spring, theindicator was nearly three times higher. The reason for this easing is that the elections in France,the Netherlands and Austria did not yield a positive outcome for Eurosceptic parties.To sum up this first part we can say that financial markets are currently in quite good shape,driven by an improved economic outlook, benign political developments and an accommodativemonetary policy stance.3. The financial crisis: Monetary policy undergoing changeThe mandate of the Eurosystem states quite clearly that maintaining price stability in the euroarea is our overriding priority. That is why we conduct monetary policy.In August, the euro area annual consumer price inflation (HICP) was 1.5%. This is still below thetargeted inflation rate of less than, but close to 2% per year over the medium term. However, therisk of deflation is now universally considered to be very low. In 2014, things looked different: theeuro area inflation was steadily declining and bottomed out at –0.6% in January 2015. But thisrisk has decreased – also supported by our monetary policy measures.The ECB Governing Council has been pursuing an accommodative monetary policy stance for awhile. Since June 2014, a move known as quantative easing has been implemented by theEurosystem in order to bolster financing conditions for banks and the real economy. At the sametime credit easing has been extended. The main measures were, briefly:targeted longer-term refinancing operations (also known as TLTROs) that provide financingto banks for up to four years, with the amount that an individual bank can borrow being linkedto its loans and lending patterns to the private sector, at extremely favourable (in somecases, negative) interest rates;various asset purchase programmes, grouped under the umbrella acronym APP (expandedAsset Purchase Programme): an additional covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3);an asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP); a corporate sector purchaseprogramme (CSPP); and the large-scale public sector purchase programme (PSPP) as themain instrument to address weak inflation;the affirmation that full allotment in regular refinancing operations will continue at least untilthe end of 2017;and in terms of policy rates, a very low interest environment with the main refinancing rate,1 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
which has stood at 0% since March 2016, and the negative deposit rate (negative since June2014; currently –0.4%). These very low rates are expected to remain at their present levelsfor an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of net asset purchases under theAPP.Working in unison, the aim of these instruments is to improve financing conditions – which theyhave in fact achieved, to some extent. There has been a significant pick-up in lending since it hitits lowest point in early 2014, and the same can be said of monetary aggregates. What’s more,prices are rising more sharply once again – especially if you look beyond the fluctuations causedby energy prices.But this comes at a price: all in all, the asset purchases made under the programmes launchedin June 2014 currently total around €2 trillion, with government bonds accounting for almost €1.7trillion of this. Since June 2014, the Eurosystem’s total assets have increased from €2.2 trillion to€4.3 trillion. Excess liquidity – in other words, surplus central bank money – currently stands ataround €1.8 trillion.These asset purchases mark a move deep into uncharted territory for European monetarypolicymakers. Eurosystem central banks are now the euro-area countries’ biggest creditors. Theboundaries between monetary and fiscal policy, which are of such crucial importance in amonetary union, are becoming increasingly blurred. The financing conditions imposed ongovernments depend to a great extent on the actions of central banks.You don’t need to be a naysayer to fear that there may be political pressure to pursue anaccommodative monetary policy for longer than necessary from a price stability perspective.4. Where could it go from here?This part of my speech is about the future path of the monetary policy in the euro area: Wherecould it go from here?The ECB Governing Council alone decides what path to take. It goes without saying that thisincludes the decision on whether and, if so, when it would be appropriate to normalise monetarypolicy. At its press conference earlier this month, ECB President Mario Draghi, has confirmedthat the framework for this will be re-examined in autumn.In any case, the current environment is opening up the prospect of no longer needing to furtherloosen the reins of monetary policy. Economic recovery is ongoing and risks have been broadlyoffset. Political risks in the euro area, at least, are lower and the banking system has becomemore stable. The Eurosystem finds itself surrounded by countries all over the world pursuing aless accommodative monetary policy. Furthermore, prices are going up and the risk of deflationis universally considered to be very low.At the same time, the marginal benefit of further purchases is steadily declining, with marketparticipants already bracing themselves for a certain degree of “normalisation".It is for the ECB Governing Council to decide when and how such a course of normalisation willtake place. I cannot, and would not wish to, speculate on this matter. But I would like to stick tooutlining what could happen from a technical point of view if the ECB Governing Council were todecide that the time had come to normalise monetary policy.This means that the Eurosystem in a first step would decrease its net asset purchases – not inone fell swoop overnight, but with clear prior warning and gradually. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Note that tapering net purchases isn’t about scaling back the high level of excess liquidity thathas been built up as a result of asset purchases and – mainly targeted longer-term – refinancingoperations.It’s about curbing the growth rate of central bank money or, in other words, slightly reducing themonthly amounts additionally provided. Taken by itself, tapering net purchases is not a restrictivemonetary policy tool. Quite the opposite: as long as additional net purchases take place, thealready accommodative monetary policy is loosened even further. And even if net purchaseswere discontinued, monetary policy will remain expansionary.Concerning the impact of the purchase programme, it is ultimately the stock of assets in theEurosystem’s balance sheet which is essential, and less the flow of monthly purchases. Giventhat reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the assetpurchase programme take place, the stock of securities held by the Eurosystem will not bereduced for the time being. As a consequence, and taking into account other monetary policyinstruments in place, the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem will be accommodative for along time to come.The banking sector would, all other things being equal, still have far more central bank moneythan actually needed for several years. Given the abundant supply of central bank money, it can’tbe the money market that is primarily to blame for many people’s concerns about tapering. Whatis it, then?Tapering is suspected of triggering greater volatility and yield increases in those capital marketsegments that are targeted by monetary policy purchase programmes, with the impact of thisthen potentially spilling over to neighbouring market segments, too. Some market participants arealready anticipating that asset purchases by the Eurosystem will be scaled back in 2018.That said, it’s hard to predict just how the market will react to tapering. A certain amount ofvolatility is to be expected. But this is only natural when markets seek to rebalance themselves.With careful communication, the Eurosystem can counteract major distortions and turmoil.Furthermore, market forces that were recently impaired by the Eurosystem may, to a certainextent, have a stabilising impact on interest rates as net purchases are tapered. We need toplace more trust in such forces.5. Closing RemarksLadies and gentlemenTo take up the mountain hiking metaphor I introduced at the beginning of my speech, therecomes a time when every hiker wants to leave the most arduous part of the trek behind and seethat mountain hut.We haven’t got that far yet, though. We are still on the mountain and our journey is far from over.What’s more, the route that we will take remains unclear. But what we know is that the ECBGoverning Council is our mountain guide. It alone decides which path to take.In autumn, the ECB Governing Council will re-calibrate the monetary policy instruments beyond2018. It has been already assured that this will not take place in one fell swoop overnight. And inany case, the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem will be – due to the stock effect –accommodative for a long time to come. This should be considered when deciding on futureinvestments.www.policyuncertainty.com/index.html.1 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Vítor Constâncio: Interview with EuronewsInterview with Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, and Euronews,conducted by Ms Efthymia Koutsokosta on 15 September and published on 20 September 2017.*   *   *After almost a decade of crisis and uncertainty in the Eurozone, optimism is on the rise.But still unemployment is high and divergences among member states are always there.What should be done so that the euro delivers on its promise to increase the wealth ofthe societies? To discuss this I am joined here by the Vice-President of the EuropeanCentral Bank Mr Vitor Constancio. Mr Constancio: welcome to Global Conversation.So, do you share this optimism, is it justified or there are risks that can really revive thecrisis once again?It’s important to underline that growth has converged, meaning that the rates of growth of allcountries are now very close together and that’s the best situation from that point of view sincethe beginning of the monetary union. But is the Eurozone still attractive for the member states? And I am saying that becauseafter the crisis there are a lot of people saying that this currency is not designed for all,but for only a few strong member states.We were initially eleven countries, then 12 in 2001 and then in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2015 othercountries joined which shows that during the crisis there were several countries still very muchattracted to the idea of the stability and the openness that the monetary union offers to allcountries. But we see some countries such as Hungary or Poland not willing to join.  I won’t discuss the position of any particular country or government, it’s their view but there is apresumption in the treaty – and that’s what Mr Juncker highlighted in his speech – there is apresumption in the treaty that all member countries are supposed eventually to join exceptcountries that are still members and have an opting out clause like the UK which is now leavingthe EU altogether and Denmark. All the others, according to the treaty, are presumed to join oneday. There are also other proposals on the table concerning for example a minister, a financeminister of the EU or the Eurozone or a Eurozone budget. Why is a minister needed rightnow in the EU right now? The idea of a finance minister is more recent and presumably is connected with the introductionof such functions at the central level of the euro area in order to have someone in charge andresponsible for managing that additional capacity and the stabilization function in the monetaryunion. Does this mean that the member states give some powers to this minister?Yes of course. But already the stability and growth pact implies with all its reforms over theyears, implies a lot of coordination and rules that have to be complied by the countries. That sortof sharing of sovereignty in some aspects of fiscal policy is already there and what would be nowpresumably at stake is the creation of some more instruments to help stabilize potentialrecessionary periods in the euro area in the future. But let me tell you about EU growth. Ok, things are going better, maybe the economy 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
goes better, maybe some wages are going up, maybe unemployment is falling but noteverywhere. There are for example the countries of the South still struggling to survivewith crisis, to create growth: Italy, Portugal, Greece. And we see other countries, thestrongest ones which are in a better shape. How you tackle this? Well, in the first place, all these countries that you mentioned and also Spain are growing and inthe case of Spain and Portugal they are growing above the average of the euro area right now. But people don’t feel that.Not yet. But in the first place it’s being felt in the reduction of unemployment also in thosecountries. Growth has returned to all countries. And so, the degree of divergence has stopped,which has been ongoing since the crisis. And of course we need to strengthen thesemovements, and that’s why at the European level we need new initiatives to deepen andstrengthen the functioning of the monetary union. What about Italy? Is Italy the sick child of the euro area? Because of course Italy is a veryparticular case, with a huge exposure to non-performing loans and a banking systemquite vulnerable. The main consequence of having too high non-performing loans is on profits because all thoseloans are not providing the revenue, so the NPL question is very important to indeed restoreconditions of improved profitability so that they can then offer new credits to support therecovery. But despite the recovery of the eurozone, all these positive messages, we have manychallenges ahead. One of this is brexit. What could be the biggest risk of thisnegotiation, of this divorce? In economic terms, one has to consider the size of the UK economy and the size of the EU tosee that the consequences and the disruption would be much more significant for the smallerpart in that negotiation than for the EU as a whole. I don’t expect and no one is expecting that abrexit will mean that there would be no trade between the two parts. That won’t happen. Therewill not be a total disappearance of trade.Mr Constancio, you are in this position since 2010. So, you experienced the hardesttimes of the Eurozone. What was your personal most difficult moment? Well, it was the start of the phase of the crisis when Greece came to a situation where therevelation about the budget deficit created a situation of non-access to the financial markets.That was in 2010.Could you say that the end was close? Well, I wouldn’t say that especially with hindsight but during those moments, indeed it was thefirst big shock of the crisis. Then we had many other vicissitudes later on, some related withGreece, some related with other countries, 2015 was also a difficult moment but the beginningand the big shock and the surprise of what could imply was indeed the more difficult moment. Mr Constancio many thanks for being with us.  2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Philip R Lane: Launch of the Central Bank of Ireland's archivesSpeech by Mr Philip R Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the launch of the CentralBank of Ireland’s archives, Dublin, 31 August 2017.*   *   *Good evening. Welcome to the new North Wall Quay headquarters of the Central Bank ofIreland. I am delighted to welcome you all to this ceremony to mark the opening of our archives tothe public and our own staff.  Let me especially welcome Justice John Hedigan, the Chair of theNational Archives Advisory Council (NAAC) and the other members of the NAAC, and JohnMcDonough, the Director of the National Archives of Ireland. I am also glad that our businesspartners from Arcline Ltd., which has run the Records & Archives unit since 2011, are also ableto join us tonight to mark this milestone.The Bank’s archives have up until now principally been for limited internal use and have not beenformally open to the public. The Bank decided in 2012 to allow public access to the organisation’shistorical archives under controlled procedures. As a result, our new headquarters was designedto incorporate an archive reading room and supporting facilities.The records created, maintained and received by the bank in carrying out its statutory duties andobligations are ultimately, like the Bank itself, owned by the public. In this way, we are bringing theBank into line with other public bodies and peer central banks. The archives of the Bank form partof the cultural patrimony of Ireland and they will now rightly be available to the Irish people andmore widely.The Bank’s archive policy was approved in 2016, in which we have adopted our own rules fortransfer of records by Bank divisions to the archive and a 30-year rule for releasing archives tothe public.We have also developed an online catalogue of the archival materials we hold to allow the publicto search online and identify what they would like to consult, along with booking appointmentsonline to access the archival materials in our reading room.The opening of the archives is in line with our commitment to increase transparency andpromote public understanding of the role and functions of the Central Bank. The archives arealso being used to support our outreach activities.  These include online initiatives through socialmedia, local community events and our schools programme. The archives also provide muchsource material for the Bank’s Exhibition Programme in our new visitor space, which is adjacentto the archival reading room. For example, much of the primary source material in our ‘Pounds,Schillings and Independence’ exhibition comes from our archive collections.The wider access to the archives will also increase the volume of long-term economic andbanking data available to policy makers and scholars. While our official publications have alwaysbeen in the public, the reasoning in many cases behind our policy decisions will now be alsoavailable to scholarly researchers. I believe that this will make a significant contribution toeconomic, financial and social research.At a general level, the Bank’s archives provide many insights into the economic development inIreland. More narrowly, there is significant material on the establishment and the design of Irishcurrency, the services that the Bank provides to both the Irish public and internationally, and theday-to-day workings of the Bank, with our earliest records dating back to 1786. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
To give you a flavour of what our archival collections contain:12,000+ paper files dating from the foundation of the currency commission in 1927; and theBank from its inception in 1943.4,000+ photographic prints. Principally of the social aspects of the life of the Bank, ourbuildings along with conferences and events.560+ architectural plans and drawingsincluding the various premises owned or purchased by the Bank, such as Foster Place;Fitzwilliam House, College Green, and Sam Stephenson’s masterpeice of our formerheadquarters in Dame St.250+ bound ledgers. These include two smaller collections: namely a portion of the FreeState and later Republic of Ireland Land Commission bonds and the archives of theCommercial Building Company.Finally, it holds various artefacts relating to aspects of the production and design of Irish nationalbank notes and coinage.The archives of the Commercial Buildings Company Ltd. form a stand-alone collection within ourcollections. Its premises were situated on Dame Street and were built in 1799 and designed byEdward Parke. Its most famous occupants, the Ouzel Galley Society resided in the buildingsfrom 1805 until they were sold to the Central Bank of Ireland in 1963.The Ouzel Galley, illustrated on the seal on display in the adjacent room, was an Irish merchantship that set sail from Dublin in 1695 en route to the port of Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire. Theship did not return as scheduled within the following year. After a further two year period with nosightings, she was presumed lost. A panel of Dublin merchants was set up in order to settle thequestion over insurance, resulting in the ship’s owners receiving compensation.In 1700, the ship returned to Dublin and the Captain, Eoghan Massey, claimed that his men hadspent five years in captivity at the hands of Algerian corsairs, who had used the ship to engage inacts of piracy.As compensation had been paid out two years previously, the ownership of the ship’s cargobecame a matter of intense debate and controversy. The same panel of merchants, which hadsettled the debate in 1698 on the ship’s fate, met once more in order to decide that all moniesremaining following the proper compensation of the owners should go towards a fund for thealleviation of poverty among Dublin’s “decayed merchants”.Out of this case emerged the Ouzel Galley Society, which was founded to act as a permanentarbitration body to deal with similar shipping disputes that might arise. The Ouzel Galley Societywas wound up in 1888 and its functions subsumed by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce andthe Commercial Buildings Company, whose premises and assets the Bank purchased in 1963to facilitate the building of the Dame Street tower.This is a unique archive collection documenting aspects of the economic and social history ofIreland in the eighteenth and nineteeth centuries. The oldest record we hold is the imports andexport ledger for Ireland from the year 1786.In conclusion, I would like to cite the mission statement of the new service:“The mission of the archive is to collect, preserve, promote and make accessible recordscharting the history of the Bank and its contribution to the development of Ireland.”With those words in mind, I am delighted to officially launch the Central Bank of Ireland archives. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Erkki Liikanen: Central banking and the risk management of centralbanks - what are the links?Keynote speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Joint Bank ofPortugal and European Central Bank Conference on "Risk Management for Central Banks",Lisbon, 26 September 2017.*   *   *INTRODUCTIONAbout a decade ago we saw the first signs of turbulence in global financial markets. A year laterLehman Brothers went under. We were faced with a full-blown financial crisis.Later, it was named the Great Financial Crisis. It led to a both qualitative and quantitative changein the operations of central banks and was reflected in their balance sheets. The events forcedthe central banks to focus on the question what kind of credit they extended, and should extend,in providing liquidity to private banks. Later, the central banks launched large securities purchaseprograms.The growth of the central bank balance sheets since the financial crisis has made centralbankers pay more attention to the management of financial risks. The evaluation, control andmanagement of financial risks has become more central than before.Central Banks are financial institutions, and so their risk management is not totally dissimilar withother financial institutions such as commercial banks. But there are very important differences.For central banks, these differences must be understood to perform properly in their policy tasks.The position and objectives of central banks are different from those institutions that operate on afor-profit basis. Their responsibilities are different, their powers and capabilities are wider, andtheir accountability requirements are broader.These differences matter for risk management. Today, I would like to talk on these differencesand focus on four aspects of risk management in central banks.1. How should the central bank's mandate and responsibilities influence its risk management?2. How should the risk management function be organized in relation to the policy andinvestment functions within the bank?3. How should the accountability and transparency requirements be taken into account inmanaging central bank risks?4. How can financial regulation help the risk management of central banks?I will conclude by collecting some lessons we have learned during the turbulent, but certainlyinstructive years since 2008.I will concentrate on financial risks in the balance sheets and mostly pass over other importantrisks, such as operational and cyber risks. The area of financial risks is where the specialcharacter and responsibilities of central banks probably matter most, making the risk controlproblems even more complex and nuanced than is the case in "ordinary" banks.WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS?As policy institutions, central banks have objectives and responsibilities that differ from thefinancial institutions operating on a commercial basis. To enable the central banks to fulfil theirresponsibilities, they also have special powers – especially the monopoly of issuing currency and 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
reserve money.We should resist the temptation to use the special characteristics of central banks as excusesfor not having to implement the best risk management techniques developed elsewhere. The riskmanagement standard and techniques of "ordinary" banks should serve as an obvious startingpoint when discussing risks. There are differences, but they have to be justified in each case.How do the risks come about? Central banks take on balance sheet risks as a result of theirinvestment activities (as in holding foreign reserves), their monetary policy operations, and fromtime to time as providers of lender of last resort credit to their counterparts.As investors, central banks have traditionally been conservative. This means that when facedwith trade-offs between risk and return, central banks have traditionally tended to favour assetswith very low credit risk even if the expected returns from such investments have been modest.Traditionally, central banks have also preferred very liquid, short-term investments. Thesechoices have been clearly visible in the way foreign exchange reserves are usually invested.As policy makers, central banks influence market conditions and market prices in a unique way.This is the task why central banks exist today, and why they are able to conduct monetary policy.The ability, and indeed the obligation, to steer the money markets in order to delivermacroeconomic stability adds an important extra twist to the risk management problem: thecentral bank is not just price taker in the financial markets, it is a price maker too. This is one ofthe features that make them special as investors and lenders.One may see it as a sort of paradox that central banks, in making policy, themselves seem tocreate and control much of the risk they themselves bear as investors and creditors. However,the central banks do not actually have arbitrary powers to steer the interest rates or other marketprices. They are mandated to exercise their monetary policy powers to pursue specific pre-setgoals: the policy objectives for which they are accountable.In the Eurosystem for instance, price stability is the overriding objective. Therefore, although theactions of the central banks may have an impact on their financial risks, these actions are takenwith the requirements of monetary (and financial) policy in view.So, while the ability to influence market conditions may be important for the risk managementproblem of central banks, we should not read too much into this. There is a wide agreement thatcentral banks should not use their monetary policy powers as instruments of their own riskmanagement.There is also a broad agreement that any information central banks have on their future policiesshould not be used for their own financial gain. In their investment activities and their securitiespurchases for monetary policy purposes, the preference of the very best creditworthiness hasbeen the traditional risk management technique.In credit operations, the situation is more complicated. When credit is granted to banks, inmonetary policy operations or in last resort lending, the most traditional and still the mostimportant method of risk management is collateral policy. To minimize the probability of loss, thecollateral should be safe.However, since the collateral need not be actually realized except in the case of default of theborrower, collateral requirements need not be the same as the eligibility standards in outrightpurchases of securities. This can be compensated in other ways. Haircuts are routinely used tocompensate for suspected risks in the value of collateral.This brings us to an important difference between central banks and other institutions: the role ofcentral banks as policy institutions matters for their collateral policy and can make the policy 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
different from usual, private lenders.The special nature of central banks' collateral policy was first noted by Walter Bagehot, alreadymore than 140 years ago. Bagehot was concerned with how the central bank could best supportfinancial stability. According to the famous Bagehot's rule, in times of crisis central banks shouldlend freely against good collateral, at a penalty rate of interest. But what should be taken as "goodcollateral"? It is worthwhile to cite Bagehot (1873) word for word:"If it is known that the Bank of England is freely advancing on what in ordinary times is reckoneda good security—on what is then commonly pledged and easily convertible—the alarm of thesolvent merchants and bankers will be stayed. But if securities, really good and usuallyconvertible, are refused by the Bank, the alarm will not abate, the other loans made will fail inobtaining their end, and the panic will become worse and worse."The key phrase in this quote is "in ordinary times". Bagehot means that the collateralrequirements of central banks should be set as in a situation where the panic (caused by a runfor liquidity) would not prevail.The revolutionary point Bagehot made is that the central bank's collateral policy should not viewquality of collateral offered as given. The bank should take into account that its own decisionsabout what is eligible will affect the quality of the collateral. The central bank should not only takethe long view, on the quality of the collateral, but also a confident view, taking into account itspower to stem the liquidity crisis.This rule makes plain the great difficulty of the central bank's risk management problem, whichalso is a policy problem, whenever there is market stress. The quality of the collateral "in normaltimes" which Bagehot refers to is not what the market deems it to be; and it is not necessarily thequality that prevailed before a crisis. It is something that will be sustainable in the future.How is this Bagehot's recommended policy different from the behaviour of the privateparticipants? When deciding on its lending policy the central bank should take into account theeffects of its own credit decisions on the quality of the collateral. This is Bagehot's point. That isnot easy to do in practice.The task of the central bank is to assess the quality of the collateral in a future situation after thecrisis will have abated. There cannot be any fixed rules for that. In particular, the market does notgive a firm guidance: if the central bank always followed the market in deciding what collateral isgood, it could not add much to the liquidity of the markets and could not do its job to calm thesituation in the case of market stress or panic. On the other hand, the central bank should notbelieve it can make bad collateral good just by pretending that to be the case and lending moneyagainst it.Bagehot's advice was about collateral policy, reflecting the central banking practices of his time.It has, however, some relevance also for securities purchases in open market policies as well. Itis that the market under stress is not always right, not without some guidance at least. Onelesson from the Outright Monetary Transactions, OMT, was that the government bond markets inthe euro area were at that time operating under unjustified doubts about the future of euro. TheOMT programme confidently declared by the ECB succeeded in correcting the mispricing of thestressed government bond markets, in a way broadly similar to the way in which Bagehotexplained the bill market of his time could be pacified.ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTSTurning to the organizational aspects of risk management, we find both similarities anddifferences between central banks and other financial institutions. 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Starting with the similarities, a generally accepted principle that applies to both is that risk controlfunctions and risk-taking functions should be separated. As a rule, this separation should reachthe top decision-making level of the organization. The different business and reporting lines, boththose that take risk on behalf of the bank and those that assess and control it, present their viewsdirectly to the decision-making level.After the financial crisis, and the unpleasant surprises which were uncovered in a number ofinvestment and retail banks, the value of following this principle has been understood even moreclearly than before.The top management must be responsible for ensuring and overseeing a strong risk governanceframework, and must be able to carry this responsibility. This requires a systematic approach. Itincludes a strong risk culture, a well-developed and explicit policy regarding to risk taking and riskmanagement, up-to-date methodologies for measuring financial risks, and well-definedresponsibilities for risk management and control functions.An effective risk control function is a key component in the organization. This function isresponsible for overseeing risk-taking activities across the institution. The important thing is that itshould have the authority it needs. The risk control function should be independent, with sufficientstature, resources and direct access to the board.Risk reporting to the board requires careful design in order to convey bank-wide, individualportfolio and other risks in a concise and meaningful manner. Reporting should accuratelycommunicate risk exposures and results of stress tests or scenario analyses and shouldprovoke a robust discussion of, for example, the bank's current and prospective exposures(particularly under stressed scenarios).A balance should be found between the independence of the risk control function, on the onehand, and smooth horizontal information flows on the other. As emphasized in BIS principles forrisk management, for example, banks should avoid organizational "silos" that can impedeeffective sharing of information across the organization. Necessary cooperation between thefunctions should of course never compromise the special independent role of the risk controlfunction.In "ordinary", for-profit institutions, the main organizational challenge is to reconcile the businessorientation of the revenue-generating functions with the caution guarded by the risk controllingfunction. This balance has to be managed at a high, responsible decision-making level.A broadly similar, but wider balancing challenge exists also in central banks. Their problem oforganizing risk control and management is more complex than in for-profit institutions.While the central banks have important investment functions, much like other banks, they alsohave separate monetary policy responsibilities and functions. The organizational architecturemust therefore accommodate more distinct functional lines than in an ordinary financial institution– at least the investment function, the monetary policy preparation and execution, and finally therisk control function.The presence of the monetary policy preparation and execution function is an addedcomplication to risk management that is characteristic to central banks, when we compare themto other banks. Monetary policy planning and execution should not be hampered by hiddenconsiderations of risk or gain.Likewise, it is necessary that monetary policy decision are taken with full awareness of theirexpected financial consequences and the associated risks. Only then, with adequate riskinformation, can the responsible decision makers really discharge their responsibilities. 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
The idea of a completely independent risk control function had been around at least from 1990's,but it took the latest crisis to galvanize the central banks to take bigger steps. Before the crisis atypical solution was to have separate responsibilities at the board level, but not a fullyindependent business line or unit for risk management and control. This has been changing.In the Bank, which I know best, the risk control function was reorganized from the beginning of2009. A separate unit was established with its own reporting line to the board. This reorganizationhad been in preparation for a couple of years already before the crisis, but the perception ofincreased riskiness of the environment certainly accelerated the implementation of the change.Within the ECB, the audit committee has been active in promoting enhancements in the riskmanagement of the ECB and the Eurosystem as a whole. Especially at the Eurosystem level,the cooperation between member central banks was previously too limited and slow to cope withthe new situation which emerged during the crisis. A much more unified and timely view of theaggregate risks was needed.In September 2010, a separate system-wide Risk Management Committee was established.Previously, the system-wide cooperation on risk management matters had taken place in aworking group reporting to the Market Operations Committee. The creation of an independentcommittee signalled increasing weight on risk management and was in line with the principle ofindependence of risk management. Within the internal organization of ECB itself, the status ofthe risk management function was enhanced, too, and it was promoted to the level of adirectorate in 2012.These changes have been significant, but it would not be proper to claim that the development ofthe risk management organization and its activities in the Eurosystem are now complete. Theassessment and especially the quantification of risks is a task which is always incomplete andalways in need of further development. Nevertheless, I think that significant improvements havebeen achieved and the governors, the governing council and the board members have now amuch better overview of the financial risks of their banks and the whole Eurosystem than before.ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCYThe organizational principles that I discussed above relate mainly to sufficient internal informationflows within the institution. However, external information can be strategically just as important asinternal management information. Therefore, financial institutions, both ordinary banks andcentral banks need to reconsider from time to time their transparency and communication abouttheir risks. There are central banks, which have started to report publicly about their risks.Ordinary, for-profit banks need transparency at least vis-à-vis their customers, creditors andshareholders, as well as their supervisors. All these stakeholders are very interested in the risksof the bank they are dealing with.Central banks are in a somewhat different position. For one thing, the set of stakeholders ofcentral banks is broader. In particular, it includes political decision makers (in governments,parliaments etc.) and the general public as citizens, money-holders, voters and taxpayers. Inaddition to being larger, the interests of these political constituencies in the central bank are morecomplex and many-sided than the interest of the stakeholders in a commercial bank.Communication and transparency about financial risks is of course only one facet of the centralbank's general communication tasks. Another facet is policy transparency. Actually, these twoare closely intertwined: experience shows that it is clearly necessary, in order to maintain publictrust in the central bank's monetary policy and liquidity-supplying operations, to be clear about thereasons and consequences of the policies. Otherwise, the central bank may even endanger thenecessary public acceptance of its operations. 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
This has an important implication: The transparency and public reporting of central banking risksshould be embedded in a broader economic perspective. This does not only apply to the contentof the risk information per se, but we should probably develop new ways to present the financialrisk of central banks in their economic context, not only as isolated Value-at-Risk or ExpectedShortfall numbers (for example). The increased transparency along the lines that have beendeveloped has made a positive contribution, but still, it seems that finding new ways ofpresenting risks better in context could be very useful.In the final analysis, the concern about risks has to do with capital adequacy of the central banks.This must be maintained, with a margin of caution, at levels where the independence ofmonetary policy is not endangered. The central banks must be able to accumulate sufficientreserves and provisions to safeguard their position. As they are public bodies, this is also amatter of public trust and political acceptance, on which central banks depend.We might note that the Eurosystem and the ECB are in somewhat different position in thatregard than the Federal Reserve, for example. Because of its institutional position, the FederalReserve is able to operate with quite small own capital. In Europe, by contrast, the Central Banksare by construction financially more separated from the governments. This means that they mustbe quite self-reliant in terms risk-bearing capacity and of capital buffers.ON FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe changes in central bank's risk management have occurred in parallel with major reform inbanking regulation, globally and especially in the EU. These reforms have been necessary ongeneral terms, but as a by-product, they also facilitate the central banks' risk management tasks.First, better regulation will improve the creditworthiness of the central banks' monetary policycounterparts and thus make risk management easier for central banks. Direct credit risk will besmaller. Second, better regulation and more solid banks will also reduce the likelihood of marketdisturbances caused by shortages of liquidity, or runs for safe assets. This will reduce thecentral bank's burden in stabilizing the financial markets, and enable the central bank toconcentrate its attention better on its monetary policy tasks.The aspects of banking regulation that ease the burden on central banks include better capitaladequacy requirements, stricter liquidity norms, and the general improvement in supervision andsupervisory information, including the periodic stress tests. These stability-enhancingdevelopments will help to reduce the dependence of the financial system on central banks.In the euro area, in particular, central bank risk management benefits from the current Europeanprojects to complete the EMU, especially the Banking Union initiatives:Single supervisory mechanism has already improved supervisory information and the generaltrust on euro area banks, thereby facilitating the ECB's operative tasks. The European DepositInsurance Scheme, which I hope will move forward soon, will help stabilize bank liquidity evenunder future adverse shocks.The regulatory framework is not complete even when the projects I mentioned will be finalized. Itis not complete even from the central banks' risk management point of view.The constantly evolving financial industry brings up new challenges which must be taken intoaccount.Currently, the unregulated segment of financial intermediation ("shadow banks") are a source ofconcern. They make the central banks' job of protecting financial stability harder, because theyare not subject to the same monitoring and accounting scrutiny as banks, and as they cannot bemonetary policy counterparts of central banks, their liquidity can be more fragile. The 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
consequences of the activities of the shadow banking sector to the volatility of the supply ofliquidity is a challenge which awaits proper regulatory response.CONCLUSIONSThe central banks have faced new challenges in their risk management over the last decade.These challenges are in some respect similar to what other banks have met, but the policy roleof the central banks have made them even more complex.The central banks must consider not only their own risks but also broader risks in the financialsector and the macro-economy when they make decisions about what risk to take.The challenges in organizing the risk management function in central banks are morechallenging than in other financial institutions, because of the interaction of their policyresponsibilities,To cope with these challenges, it is essential that:While prioritizing their policy responsibilities, the central banks should take care of their financialhealth (adequate capitalization) so that they are not vulnerable to the financial consequencesfrom their policy tasks.Central banks need to ensure that the political decision-makers and the general publicunderstands what the central banks are doing and why. Lack of communication and lack oftransparency can breed suspicion that the central banks are taking risks that are excessiverelative to the benefits achieved with their policies. Deep and coherent participation by the centralbanks in the public debate at the national and euro area level are needed.In terms of financial regulation, the challenges that the central banks' policy responsibilities causeto their risk-taking capacity are met more easily if the financial health of the banking system issound; if the supervisory information is sufficient; and if crisis management procedures andinstitutions are up to their tasks. When those conditions are met, the central banks' mainfinancial stability task, the provision of liquidity to fundamentally sound institutions, is easier tofulfil. The central bank should not be expected to constitute "the only game in town".In the euro area in particular, I would call for determined completion of the banking union,including the resolution fund and common deposit insurance, as well as taking the capital marketunion forward in order to improve the resiliency of the European financial markets in general.These provide the best prerequisite for central banks to succeed in their work. 7 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches

All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 This month marks the 10th anniversary of the failure of Northern Rock.The failure of a middle size British mortgage bank was followed by the collapse of much bigger and globally systemic banks. But the picture of the queues forming outside the branches of Northern Rock remains for many the picture of the start of the financial crisis. Prior to September 2007, I knew of the existence of bank runs from economic history books, the experience of developing and emerging economies and the film of Mary Poppins.  Seeing one happen in London brought home that it is never different “this time”.  The fundamental basis of the financial system is trust.  And trust, if not properly managed and protected, can disappear instantaneously.  And once that happened, the UK had no effective way of managing the failure of a bank. And no way to avoid the taxpayer having to step in to stop such a failure leading to the loss of critical services to the economy and contagion to other banks. Anniversaries, even those of difficult events, offer a chance to step back and reflect – to ask whether we have learned the lessons of Northern Rock and the bank failures that followed? I want today to look at why we were unable safely to wind up a failing bank without taxpayer intervention, at the progress we have made in the UK towards rectifying those failings, and at some of the challenges that remain.   The pre-crisis regime The failure of Northern Rock in 2007 and later, of RBS and Lloyds exposed brutally that the UK lacked the tools needed to manage the failure of a bank. Depositors were expected to take comfort from a depositor compensation scheme based on the principle of ‘co-insurance’.  They were fully covered only for the first £2,000 of their deposit.  Any depositor with more had a strong financial incentive to run on hearing rumours that the bank was failing – which is what they did on hearing that Northern Rock was in receipt of emergency liquidity assistance from the Bank of England. When that happened, there was no public authority formally and clearly responsible for dealing with failing banks and with the powers to match.  The UK relied wholly on its standard corporate insolvency regime to handle the fall-out from a bankrupt bank.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3    This required an insolvency practitioner to protect the interests of creditors as a whole.  The public authorities had no means of directing the insolvency process to prioritise the protection of depositors, the continuation of the bank’s critical functions or wider financial stability concerns. There was no way to recapitalise a failing bank by bailing in its creditors.  As a result, when faced with the failure of a bank of any size, the UK authorities had only a stark choice between a very disruptive insolvency, putting financial stability at risk, or a taxpayer bailout.  The UK was not of course the only jurisdiction to discover in the financial crisis that it did not have an effective regime for dealing with the failure of banks.  And, as we discovered when Lehman Brothers failed, the authorities in different jurisdictions had no pre-agreed means of coordinating with each other on how to deal with the sudden failure of a major cross-border bank.  Nor had they any confidence that the actions taken by authorities in another jurisdiction would align to their own national interest.  With hindsight it is clear we had been lulled into a false sense of security.  In Britain, Northern Rock represented the first major run on a bank since the failure of Overend Gurney in 1866. Unlike, for example, the US, the UK had not experienced bank runs in the 20th century.    Banks in the UK had failed.  But insolvency had generally been avoided by the Bank of England twisting arms to ‘encourage’ other banks, to support a rescue ‘lifeboat’, as in the secondary banking crisis of 1973 or to take over the failing bank as with Barings in 1995.    The failure of BCCI in 1991 did lead to a protracted and difficult insolvency.  But the bank’s activities in the UK were not of a scale that posed risks to the UK financial system and economy  The Bank of England’s approach to bank failure, an approach shared by many central banks, was one of ‘constructive ambiguity’.  The aim was to guard against moral hazard by maintaining uncertainty about whether a bank in trouble would get liquidity support with the threat of insolvency in the background.   In the event the threat of insolvency proved neither credible nor effective. When Northern Rock got into trouble with £23bn in customer deposits and a balance sheet of £100bn, the UK financial authorities were left with no way of rapidly transferring parts of the failed bank’s business to another bank; or of recapitalising the bank by imposing losses on shareholders and creditors without serious risks to financial stability.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   And so, on 17 September 2007, the Chancellor was compelled to guarantee all Northern Rock deposits.  Subsequently the bank was nationalised to avoid insolvency and to allow the bank’s critical functions to continue while a buyer was found for its deposits.   The lessons of Northern Rock were dramatically underscored a year later by the failure of RBS and Lloyds. Faced again with the choice of insolvency or taxpayer intervention, the government was forced to inject £37bn into the two banks.  The banks were not put into insolvency and it proved impossible fully to write down the existing shareholders or impose losses on the bond holders.  The first lesson from this was that constructive ambiguity simply didn’t work. The market had always suspected this to be the case. The implicit subsidy enjoyed by the largest banks before the crisis illustrated the market’s assumption that the state would always intervene to prevent their bankruptcy. And the market was generally proved right.    The exception that proved the rule was the Fed’s decision to let Lehman Brothers enter insolvency.  The fallout globally from Lehmans demonstrated dramatically, why, for large banks that perform critical functions, insolvency is not a viable option.   The second lesson, which follows from the first, was that if we want, when a bank fails, to have better options than a disruptive insolvency or a taxpayer bailout, those options have to be put in place well beforehand. Doing so comes at a cost to banks and to public authorities. But if at the point of failure, there are no better options than were available in 2008, moral hazard cannot be avoided.   Rather than constructive ambiguity, we need credible clarity that when a bank gets into trouble, the losses will be made to fall on shareholders and creditors and not the taxpayer.  And if the bank provides critical services to the economy, that these can continue while the bank is resolved in an orderly way.   The Purple Book  It is in order to achieve such credible clarity, that next week the Bank will publish an update of its approach to resolution. This document – known by the colour of its cover as the Purple Book - was first published in October 2014. Its purpose is to set out very clearly the options that the Bank has to deal with a failure of a bank and the way in which we would use our powers.   Explaining how resolution is designed to work in practice and what is needed to remove barriers to resolvability are necessary steps to ensure that resolution regimes are credible.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   The Purple Book illustrates the scale of progress that has been made in the UK towards putting in place a credible and effective way of dealing with bank failures.  I would pick out three crucial areas of reform:  First, there is now a comprehensive statutory framework to deal with failing banks, for which the Bank of England is formally responsible. We have statutory powers to match this responsibility and there are a wide range of options available to us.    Unlike in 2008, there, is now a special bank insolvency procedure which requires that the insolvency practitioner prioritise pay-out of insured depositors or the speedy transfer of these deposits to a purchaser. Eligible depositors are protected up to £85,000.  ‘Co-insurance’ has been consigned to history.   For the large number of small building societies and banks, this procedure should mean that their failure can be managed and their depositors paid out or transferred quickly following entry into insolvency – leaving shareholders and creditors to take the losses.   But the larger banks that hold the majority of deposits in the UK provide critical functions for the economy.  These would be disrupted by insolvency, even in the new regime. Were a large bank to fail, the Bank of England can now trigger the use of ‘stabilisation’ powers outside insolvency.  These powers include ‘bail-in’ to recapitalise the bank by imposing losses on shareholders and creditors, so that its critical operations can continue. This provides time for the firm to be safely restructured to address the causes of failure.   Second, we are well on the way to ensuring that if a bank fails and is taken into resolution, there will be sufficient,  private sector, financial resources, in the form of debt and equity, that can be bailed in to absorb losses and recapitalise the bank so that it can continue to operate.  To achieve this the Bank has set every UK bank (and building society) a requirement for the minimum amount of such loss absorbing resources – known as MREL – it needs to hold. This requirement will need to be met in full by 2022. MREL covers both the capital a bank holds in going concern and the capital and debt that can be bailed in if it fails and enters resolution.   The biggest UK banks already have going and gone concern resources sufficient to absorb losses of almost a quarter of their risk-weighted assets, and are well on their way towards meeting their full MREL requirements. Current levels of loss absorbing resources mean that even if the major UK banks saw losses six times the losses they incurred over 2008 and 2009, there would be sufficient private sector resources that could be bailed in to recapitalise the bank and stabilise it without taxpayer support.  And next week, alongside the Purple Book, we will publish for consultation the Bank of England’s proposals on how these loss absorbing resources should be distributed within banking groups.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   In setting the timetable for meeting full MREL requirements, the Bank has considered the balance of costs and benefits.  Issuing MREL imposes costs on banks. These costs will be minimized if banks are able to build up their MREL loss absorbing debt to replace their existing debt as it matures. It could be counterproductive if, in seeking to impose requirements intended to address financial stability, we did so on a timetable that dislocated the banking system and made it more not less vulnerable during the process.   Third, statutory powers and loss absorbing resources are necessary but not sufficient conditions for an effective resolution regime.  There are other barriers to resolution that also need to be addressed.  Resolution must provide continuity, whether continuity of access to financial market infrastructure, continuity of contracts or operational continuity. For example, services such as IT that underpin critical functions will need to be set up in a way that enable them to continue in resolution.  The Bank is working alongside the PRA in assessing firms’ readiness to meet operational continuity in resolution.   We should however have no illusions about the resolution of a major bank.  If it happens, even when the regime is fully in place, it will be a very painful exercise.   Resolution is not a magic wand; losses will need to fall on creditors. Even if we are prepared in advance, stabilising a large failing bank will not be easy.   But taken together, these reforms mean that we would be able to handle a failing bank very differently today compared to 2008.    There are in place now credible options, other than insolvency or bailout, that ensure that bank shareholders and creditors will bear losses if a bank fails.   And we are much better able now than we were to ensure that a failing bank can if necessary be stabilised so it can continue to provide critical services to the economy.  What remains to be done?  However more remains to be done.  First and foremost, we need to implement fully the reforms I have mentioned.  Banks need to continue to build up the necessary loss absorbency and to restructure as necessary to ensure operational continuity in resolution.  This is perhaps an obvious point, but one that needs repeating.   It is 10 years since Northern Rock failed and memories may be beginning to fade.     
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   Ensuring that we have a better option than insolvency or a bailout, is not costless.  And, as that cost becomes apparent in a number of jurisdictions, there are increasingly voices calling for the reforms to be watered down or abandoned.  It is argued that they are too expensive for banks, especially small banks, to implement and will restrict lending to the real economy.    On the cost, I would emphasise the cost not only to the taxpayer but to the economy as a whole of disruptive bank failure.  In the UK, the going concern capital regime is based on assurance of there being an effective way to resolve failing banks.   Absent such assurance, if this risk of disruptive bank failure remained as in 2008, we would require banks to hold appreciably more capital to absorb losses.  In the UK, the Independent Commission on Banking suggested a capital surcharge of 3% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) for banks that could not be resolved.  In its 2015 assessment of capital adequacy, the Financial Policy Committee estimated that capital would need to be around five percentage points higher if there was no resolution regime in place.  It is also argued that resolution will not work; that while it may be a way of dealing with idiosyncratic failures, in a systemic crisis authorities will be reluctant to bail in shareholders and bank creditors.  This binary distinction between idiosyncratic failure and fully blown systemic crisis seems to me over-simplistic.  For sure, if we were suddenly to find ourselves pitched back into the middle of a systemic crisis, with a number of major institutions having failed or on the point of failure and a complete breakdown of trust and confidence, orderly resolution of individual banks in itself is unlikely to be able to stabilise the system as a whole.    But we did not suddenly arrive in late 2008 in the midst of full blown financial crisis.   Had the authorities had better, less disruptive options available over the previous 18 months to deal with a series of failing institutions, the disruptive, explosive nature of the crisis might well have been minimised.   There would still have been very major losses and failures.   But we would, in my view, have had a much better chance of a more orderly, less damaging correction of an overleveraged banking system.     And it is also probable that the buildup of leverage and bad debt itself would have been significantly restrained in the years before the crisis by the discipline imposed by shareholders and bondholders aware that they stood first in line to bear losses if the banks failed.  We not only have to follow through domestically.  There is further work to do to ensure that we can not only manage the failure of a bank large enough to be systemically significant in one jurisdiction, but that we can manage the failure of large, internationally active banks.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   Again, if we want better options than bailout or insolvency, we need to continue working now, internationally, to put those options in place.     This of course requires trust and cooperation between the home authority for the group and the host authorities of the jurisdictions in which it has major operations. But trust and cooperation, while necessary conditions, are not in themselves sufficient.     Home and host authorities needs to agree, in advance, on the resolution strategy for a major cross border banking group.  Hosts need to be confident that the chosen strategy is viable and that it will respect their own financial stability needs.   In other words, confidence that local operations will not be cut loose in resolution and that, if necessary, hosts have the ability to draw down loss absorbing resources through the parent.  We have made very significant progress in agreeing international standards on resolution.  And we have established crisis management groups, and, in the EU, resolution colleges, that bring together the regional supervisors for the major cross border banks.   These provide the mechanism for agreeing, in advance, the strategy for managing the failure of a major bank with a presence in a number of jurisdictions and for monitoring progress in making that strategy possible.    This requires the continued build up, in line with the agreed international standard, of loss absorbing resources that can be used to recapitalise the group in resolution.  And hosts’ confidence in the resolution strategy will depend on the contractually enforceable allocation of those resources across the groups major operating entities, again in line with international standards.   Recapitalising a bank in resolution by bailing in the private sector restores solvency.  But a solvent bank in resolution will still have liquidity needs.  Our first preference – and that of the resolved firm – would be for the bank to meet those needs from some combination of its own liquid assets and private funding sources.  But we cannot guarantee resolved firms will be in this position, even once they have been restored to solvency and are continuing to meet the requirements for authorisation.    Ensuring solvent firms in resolution have access to public sources of liquidity is therefore a critical part of an effective resolution strategy and an area where there is great merit in clarity.  The clearer it is to the bank’s creditors, counterparties and financial market infrastructure firms that a resolution comes with the expectation of access to public liquidity, if needed, the smaller the amount that may end up needing to be drawn-down. In contrast, doubts over whether and how liquidity will be made available to a bank upon its entry into resolution risk undermining a resolution, and leaving the authorities with a potentially far bigger problem.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   So it is important to ensure resolution and liquidity strategies are aligned - whether they are delivered by a single institution, as in the UK,   or by separate ones.  The Purple Book, to be published next week will set out the Bank of England’s approach to providing a liquidity backstop in resolution, where required.   To be eligible, a bank will need to be restored to solvency by the bail in of shareholders and debt holders.  It will need to meet the PRA’s authorisation conditions, including capital requirements, so that it can continue to operate while in resolution.  Solvent but illiquid banks in such a situation would have access to the Bank’s published facilities subject to meeting the necessary eligibility criteria.    To supplement those arrangements, the Bank also has put in place a new, flexible Resolution Liquidity Framework providing the tools to lend to banks which are in a Bank of England led resolution.1    Such liquidity may be secured against a wide range of collateral, building on the collateral eligible in Sterling Monetary Framework operations.2  The Bank’s objective would be to provide liquidity in sterling or foreign currency as required, in the necessary scale and for a sufficient period of time to allow the firm to make the transition to market-based funding.  The terms would be set in a way designed to support the effectiveness of the resolution regime, incentivise the transition of the firm back to market-based funding, and protect public money.    Confidence in the regime for the resolution of international banks is of crucial importance to the UK.  We are home to a number of major international banking groups.  But equally, if not more important, we are host to a very large number of foreign banks, many of which have sizeable wholesale market operations in the UK.  As the leading international financial centre, we import considerable risks from other jurisdictions.  It is therefore crucial to financial stability in the UK that we can rely on foreign banks operating in our jurisdiction having viable resolution strategies in line with international standards.  Absent such assurance, we would need to ensure the entities operating here have greater resilience locally.  Non bank resolution  It was the failure of systemic banks in the crisis that exposed the lack of an effective resolution regime.   But the lesson that if you want better options to deal with a failing financial institution they need to be put in place beforehand applies more widely than banks.                                                         1 RLF would not be available to any firm subject to an insolvency or administration procedure. 2 See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/money/eligiblecollateral.aspx 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   So we need also to think about whether resolution is necessary in other parts of the financial sector, particularly systemically important insurance companies and CCPs.  These did not fail in the last crisis.  But they may pose similar problems in a future episode of stress.   Insurance companies are very different animals to banks.  Insurer failure is more likely to be in much slower motion and solvent run-off may present a credible solution.   However we need to think carefully about whether we can rely wholly on that and what, if any, systemic risks could arise from insolvency of a major insurance company.   Given the relatively small amount of debt in insurance companies relative to policy liabilities, who should bear the losses in resolution? And what tools are needed to allocate them?  The answers to these questions are not yet fully apparent, though in my view, the case is probably made for a resolution regime for insurers, if only as a precaution should it turn out that run-off is not enough.  CCPs  CCPs are also very different to banks.  They exist to manage and reduce the risks faced by their members – to ensure financial contracts are reliably and transparently margined and collateralised.   The main prudential risks CCPs face is from the failure and consequently inability of clearing members to meet their obligations to the CCP.  The steps that have been taken since the financial crisis to increase the resilience and resolvability of their bank clearing members are therefore a key protection for CCPs.  But CCPs also need the backstop of a credible resolution regime.  The principal challenge here is not solvency per se but rather the ability of a CCP to restore itself to a matched book if members default, and to do so in a way that does not undermine the stability of the system.  CCP rule books provide for very substantial mutualised resources and a comprehensive series of recovery actions. These include, as a last resort, the cancellation or ‘tear up’ of contracts and the end of the clearing service.  However, waiting until the mutualised resources of a CCP are exhausted and subjecting participants to the unpredictability of a full tear-up may well pose unacceptable risks to financial stability.  Resolution allows the resolution authority to intervene, if necessary, to tear-up a subset of contracts earlier in the process than would be possible in CCP recovery, and before the mutualised resources in the CCP have run out.  The losses can then be spread across the membership in the order set out in the rule-book. This is key to allowing clearing members to measure and manage their exposures at a time of stress.   It is therefore important that if the resolution authority intervenes it avoids disturbing the order of losses in the rule-book.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   This requires a robust ‘No Creditor Worse Off’ (NCWO) safeguard which takes as its counter-factual the loss allocation rules in the CCP’s rule book.    The issue of NCWO protection is the subject of current debate in the draft EU regulation on CCP Recovery and Resolution. One school of thought is that it is essential to have a weaker NCWO safeguard so that resolution authorities have flexibility to deviate from the way in which losses would fall under a CCP’s rules.  This degree of flexibility puts particular focus on the objectives by which home authorities would exercise this discretion. Resolution aims principally to deliver financial stability. But in the case of a global CCP, whose financial stability will be given prominence?  This uncertainty may leave participants located outside of the home jurisdiction fearing that they will be exposed to disproportionately greater losses in order to protect the home jurisdiction’s financial stability.  The UK does not support that approach. As with banks, it is entirely possible to establish resolution frameworks for CCPs that ensure that interests are mutually aligned and that do not permit or require the home authorities to protect national financial stability at the expense of participants outside of that jurisdiction.  The conduct of CCPs depends on clarity and certainty. A regime that does not provide the same certainty as that set out in CCP rules runs the risk of undermining the very reasons why international leaders have placed CCPs at the heart of the response to the financial crisis.  Conclusion  To conclude. Anniversaries are not always milestones to celebrate – and the anniversary of the failure of Northern Rock is a case in point.  But even where the lessons of the past were painful, their anniversary provide a chance to step back and consider whether they have been learned.  The lessons of the crisis, of course, go much wider than resolution.  The first defence against bank failure is to ensure that banks are properly capitalised to withstand losses and continue to serve the real economy.  A vast amount of work has been done over the past 10 years to put in place capital and liquidity standards and stress testing regimes to ensure a much safer and stronger banking system.  Resolution should be seen as an integral part of making the financial system safer and stronger.  Credible resolution regimes that impose losses on shareholders and investors, rather than taxpayers, when things go wrong will incentivise banks to manage their risks properly.

There is still significant work to do to implement fully the resolution regime, domestically and internationally.  And resolving a failing bank will never be a simple or painfree exercise.

Vítor Constâncio: Developing models for policy analysis in centralbanksOpening speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at theAnnual Research Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 25 September 2017.*   *   *I am pleased to welcome you to the second Annual Research Conference of the EuropeanCentral Bank. Every year this aims to be our flagship research event, bringing togetheracademics and central bank researchers working at the cutting edge of economics.We value research because it contributes to shape the intellectual framework that we use tounderstand economic developments and to take policy decisions. We are especially keen tokeep abreast of new developments in the research frontier because they are on top of the newchallenges to understand the economy´s behaviour which is vital for devising appropriatepolicies. In the words of Christiano, the Great Recession was a macroeconomics earthquake towhich the field is still adjusting. Christiano highlights mainly three aspects: the need to recuperatethe Keynesian view that demand shocks and the paradox-of-thrift can be important for economicperformance, the notion that economy is not quickly self-correcting and requires public policiesintervention and, finally, that the financial sector can endogenously generate imbalances withsignificant consequences for the real economy. With hindsight, it is surprising how these pointswere neglected by mainstream economics for so long. Many other aspects can be usefullyadded to that list.First, that stabilisation policies are crucial and that not only growth counts as significantfluctuations leave behind permanent losses. Related to this, is the the notion that demandshocks can affect the supply side via hysteresis effects in labour supply and the capital stock viainvestment deceleration. The distinction between short- and long-term is necessary for theorisingand teaching, but often is not useful for policy analysis models.Second, the heterogeneity of agents, particularly of consumers, is important to understandaggregate behaviour, in view of indebtness, credit restrictions and income and wealthcomposition.Third, behavioural economics has also cast doubt on the full rational expectations paradigm as atoo demanding hypothesis about the cognitive powers of economic agents, especially for longhorizons. In this context, the myopic assumption explored by Gabaix (2017) is a welcomeddevelopment.Fourth, agents’ heterogeneity relates to the issue of distribution that had been neglected butwhich, with the use of Heterogenous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, helped bring to thefore as exemplified by the recent contribution of Ahn et al. (2017) at the NBER MacroeconomicsAnnual Conference. It shows how significant the feedback loop is and how models with realistichousehold heterogeneity fit empirical consumption dynamics better.Fifth, the assumption of a unique steady state is now challenged by the consideration of multipleequilibria, particularly some without full employment as seen in the work by Farmer andcollaborators. The idea of abandoning the notion of an aprioristic theoretical equilibria in favourof the pure interaction of heterogeneous agents with behaviour rules in ABMs (Agent BasedModels) is more controversial.A final point refers to the question whether conventional monetary policy is as powerful asportrayed in mainstream DSGE models via Euler equations. The protracted recovery seems togive ground to the old view of monetary policy effectiveness being asymmetric and weaker in1234 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
recessions. There is justification for rethinking a more active role for fiscal policy, following therecent papers by Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017). A reconsideration of the effectiveness ofboth macro policies has become even more necessary in view of the two major problems thatcentral banks are now confronted with: first, the lingering low inflation associated with flatterPhillips curves that impairs the policy transmission and, second, the need for policy instrumentsto deal with the next recession, even if a mild one.The various points I just listed are some of the relevant aspects of the on-going revision ofmacroeconomics and justify the point recently made by Blanchard that we need different types ofmodels to understand, forecast and analyse the economy and the policies necessary to addressits shortcomings. In that spirit, I will concentrate my remaining remarks on some on-goingdevelopments in the specification of macroeconomic models at the ECB.Desirable properties of policy modelsMacroeconomic models can be used for a variety of purposes in central banks. They are helpfulto articulate relationships between certain variables of interest in a systematic fashion, whileensuring that resource constraints are respected. They provide input to the complex process ofmacroeconomic forecasting. And they can be helpful to conduct scenario analyses and studypolicy counterfactuals.To perform these tasks effectively, a model should satisfy two simple criteria. First, since manypolicy questions are inherently quantitative in nature, a useful model must fit the data reasonablywell and should be able to produce effective economic forecasts. Model-based counterfactualanalyses will only serve as a credible benchmark for policy discussion, if the results arequantitatively plausible. In practice, this criterion has two implications. On the one hand, themodel should incorporate realistic elasticities. For example, the dynamic effects of changes inmonetary policy interest rates should be consistent with available reduced-form evidence. In theeuro area, the model should provide a reasonably good account of the inflationary impact ofnational fiscal expansions, or of developments in national wage negotiations. On the other hand,the model should provide a credible narrative for observed economic developments.The second criterion is really an implication of the first. Partly due to new research findings, partlyas a result of puzzling economic developments, we constantly update our beliefs on the keyeconomic mechanisms that are necessary to fit the data. The model should be reasonablyflexible to be able to adapt to a changing economic and policy environment and to speak tocurrent policy questions. The financial crisis is a case in point. The macroeconomic modelsmaintained by central banks in the early 2000s were not equipped to speak to all the questionsarising in the aftermath of the crisis without further adjustments. From today’s standpoint, theseadjustments are simply inescapable. We would like the model to provide a reasonable account ofthe dynamic effects of non-standard monetary policy measures. With policy rates at the effectivelower bound, we really need the model to provide realistic implications on the impact of forwardguidance. For me as a policymaker, it is of key importance that our models can be adapted fastenough to address newly emerging questions in a timely manner. Of course, in order to reap thebenefits of a flexible modelling framework, it is equally important to have expert staff using andenhancing the models in a practical and innovative manner.The new ECB multi-country model: ECB-MCThese considerations played an important role at the ECB, when we were just recently facedwith the decision of enhancing the multi-country (MC) model of the euro area. Which paradigmshould we adopt?One option was to remain within the DSGE framework. For over 10 years, DSGE models havebeen the key tool used for policy analysis exercises in many central banks. This has also been5 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
the case at the ECB, where the initial development of estimated DSGE models has takenplace. DSGE models are typically estimated and thus consistent with the data. They oftenreproduce the dynamic effects of changes in monetary policy interest rates that are observed inidentified Variable Autoregression Models (VARs.) This is also the case for the DSGE modeldeveloped in the Directorate General Research, the New Area-Wide Model, is regularly used forcounterfactual policy analysis.At the same time, a good fit of the data is to some extent accomplished by DSGE modelsthrough persistent shock processes, which questions the empirical validity of the model’sintrinsic propagation mechanisms. More importantly, DSGE models do not always provide aplausible story for observed economic developments. For example, so-called “technologyshocks” tend to play an overwhelmingly important role in accounting for the evolution of GDP,even when external data do not show any evidence of technological innovations. Moreover,DSGE models can only slowly be adapted to a new policy environment. The requirement of fullinternal consistency makes the incorporation of new features—be it a more granular financialsector, household heterogeneity or stronger nonlinearities—often very demanding.Enhancements come with long gestation periods, sometimes limiting the ability of DSGE modelsto speak to newly emerging policy questions, in a timely manner.In designing the new ECB-MC we have therefore started from the premise that, in the words ofOlivier Blanchard, “policy models” cannot be expected to have the same tight structure as“theory models”. We have decided to adopt a semi-structural approach inspired by twoguidelines: 1) include financial frictions or financial mechanisms that could allow monetary policyshocks to be transmitted via channels that were absent before the crisis; 2) adopt a more flexibleand empirically-driven approach.The emphasis is on equation-by-equation fit, while the cross-equation constraints are mostlyignored because they do not impinge on the model’s ability to provide sound quantitativepredictions. When introducing financial frictions, we have relied on a reduced form representationthat is consistent with different theoretical micro-foundations. This more flexible, semi-structuralapproach allows us to model a wide range of banking and financial variables, going from banklending spreads to term premia, without taking a stance on the exact theoretical mechanismlinking them to the macroeconomy.At its core, the new ECB-MC model is designed along the lines of the Federal Reserve’s FRB/USmodel. The behavioural decision rules of private agents are based on optimisation and in thelong run the model boils down to a neoclassical growth model. In the short run, however, it isassumed that agents face adjustment costs which imply staggered adjustment of the actual tothe desired levels.Challenges aheadI believe the design of the ECB- MC model will increase the robustness of our model-basedpolicy analyses and strengthen our capability to address newly emerging policy questions in atimely manner. The model development, which has been led by the Directorate GeneralResearch, is a joint effort of economists from a wide-range of policy areas inside the ECB,colleagues from national central banks and academic consultants. I am confident it will soon bepart of the ECB toolkit. However, it is easy to forecast that further refinements will prove to benecessary in the future, for the model to continue being a valuable policy tool. I specifically seefour areas where significant progress has already been made, but further improvements arelikely to be necessary.The first area is related to the modelling of aggregate consumption. I share the concern ofMuellbauer that the standard DSGE framework imposes unrealistic micro-foundations for thebehaviour of households as embodied in the ‘rational expectations permanent income’ model of678910 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
consumption. In typical representative-agent models, consumption behaviour is captured by anEuler equation, an inter-temporal optimality condition that links today’s level of consumption toexpected consumption in the next period and further into the future. In its linearised form, it doesneither envisage that consumers face idiosyncratic (household-specific) and uninsurable incomeuncertainty, nor that uncertainty interacts with credit or liquidity constraints. This is in starkcontrast to recent research that emphasises the importance of precautionary saving, liquidityconstraints, leverage and of heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in marginal propensities toconsume. Compared to simple representative-agent models, the ECB-MC clearly marks animprovement. The consumption function is explicitly affected by agents’ wealthholdings. Agents have shorter average horizons than presumed under the text-book permanentincome hypothesis and the model further allows for the presence of agents that do not optimizebut rather exhibit ‘hand-to-mouth’ behaviour. Last, but not least, risk aversion and incomeuncertainty also play a role for consumption behaviour. This setup, for example, allowsquantifying how larger income uncertainty reduces the power of forward guidance. All in all, I thinkthat we are moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, the modelling of aggregate consumptionis an area in which research is currently developing fast and we should be ready to learn fromnew findings.The second area of improvement concerns the modelling of expectations. As Sargent (1993)emphasizes, rational expectations can be a meaningful characterisation of the long-runequilibrium, but the transition to a new steady state might display non-rational behaviour. Anincreasing body of research aims to explore the implications of alternative types of departuresfrom rational expectations for business cycle dynamics in general, and the transmission ofmonetary policy in particular, as in the papers by Garcia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015), Gabaix(2017) or Fahri and Werning. Once again, the ECB-MC goes in the right direction. The modelcan be simulated under two expectation setups: (i) in a model consistent manner, and (ii) underthe assumption of bounded rationality where agents form expectations with a small-scale VARmodel. Other expectation formation mechanisms, such as learning or the use of marketexpectations, are also easily implementable. As was shown by Blanchard and co-authors in arecent study on the macroeconomic effects of changes in the expectations of long-runproductivity growth, different assumptions on the expectation formation mechanism can lead toconsiderably different outcomes. Assessing the most realistic way of treating expectations inpolicy models remains a crucial area for further work.The third area of improvement has to do with the nexus between inflation, wages and the realeconomy. When modelled through the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, the nexus seemsto have become weaker after the financial crisis.  Commentators have repeatedly talked abouta “missing disinflation” at the trough of the Great Recession, and about “missing inflation” inmore recent years. Recent studies have come up with alternative explanations for thesephenomena. For instance, the “missing disinflation” has been argued to be the consequence ofeither the presence of well-anchored inflation expectations, increased downward wagerigidities in recessions, or a fall in total factor productivity and increased costs of workingcapital. Understanding the underlying sources of this apparent structural change will beimportant for monetary policy. The semi-reduced-form nature of the ECB-MC makes it ill-equipped to address this deep question, but studying structural changes is challenging for allcurrent models built to study cyclical developments.The fourth and final area where further improvements are necessary is macro-financial linkages.I have already mentioned that the ECB-MC incorporates such linkages. Nevertheless, the exactway in which they affect the monetary policy transmission mechanism remains imperfectlyunderstood, even if the empirical literature is making important advances. These linkages arealso relevant for financial stability and may evolve in response to the recent reforms in theregulatory environment. This is why at the ECB we are also making parallel progress on this front101112131415161718192021 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
within the DSGE paradigm, through the 3D model. The 3D model has been developed under themacroprudential research (MaRS) network, and can be used to assess the macroeconomicbenefits and costs of macroprudential policies. “3D” alludes to the fact that, contrary to previousmodels, it captures the distinct benefits of capital requirements through reductions in default riskin the economy, not only for banks but also for borrowers, i.e. non-financial firms andhouseholds.Concluding remarksTo conclude, building models for policy analysis is associated with trade-offs. This is animportant reason for central banks to not rely on a single model and a single modelling paradigm,but to make use of a suite of models based on different paradigms. I could not agree more withBlanchard who recently expressed his view that also other types of general equilibrium modelsbeyond DSGEs are useful policy tools. I am pleased this view has been getting more tractionlately, as alternative types of models will continue to be part of central banks’ toolbox.Development of those models can greatly benefit from insights from academic research, so I amvery much looking forward to the contributions to be presented at this conference.Thank you for your attention.Christiano, L.

Carlos da Silva Costa: Risk management for central banksOpening remarks by Mr Carlos da Silva Costa, Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the JointBank of Portugal and European Central Bank Conference on "Risk Management for CentralBanks", Lisbon, 25 September 2017.*   *   *Thank you very much for your presence, I welcome you all and I hope that this conference andyour stay will be very pleasant as summer turns to autumn here in Lisbon.The first point I would like to make is that Carlos Bernardel, Helena Adegas and I first planned toorganise this conference two years ago. We are now able to say that it was the right decision,and I think that by the end you will be the first to witness that. When we took the decision to go ahead with this conference, risk management was an importantmatter. But now it is even more important. There is a lot of thinking available on this matter, butaside from the available thinking, we have a lot of problems to solve. And this means that weneed new thinking on ways to solve the problems linked to risk management.My opening remarks will take a different approach to my closing remarks at the end of theconference. I would like to speak initially about central banks and the way they face, or are facedby, risks. Central banks are ‘complex entities’ with broad mandates. Firstly, central banks arepolicy-makers and regulators. Secondly, they are also corporations and service providers. Andthey are asked to be accountable in both these capacities that are very important for theeconomy and society.As policy-makers and regulators, central banks pursue a public interest mission of deliveringprice stability and safeguarding financial sustainability. As corporations and service providersthey have to be well managed, they need to be efficient and they need to care aboutsustainability. The risk management framework within central banks needs to take into account these twodifferent – and sometimes conflicting – realities. As policy-makers, we need to understand thatthe financial crisis, and the context in which the crisis emerged and developed, provide amplefood for thought about the role of central banks, including the issue of risk management.Indeed, policy-making involves different types of risks and uncertainties.When we speak about risk management, it is not only about asset management, but also aboutrisk associated with our own decisions, to act or to defer action, because we are creatinguncertainties for third parties and for the economy. For instance, the central bank may base thedefinition of its policies on a faulty representation of reality, either because the models used areconceptually wrong or incomplete, or because the coefficients are no longer right. And if yourecall our past history of this crisis you see that these two risks were very present: the quality ofthe models and the quality, or the accuracy, of the coefficients.Under certain circumstances, the central bank may also lack the necessary tools to achieve itspolicy objectives; or it may have to cope with deficiencies in the institutional setting – and I haveplenty to say about the institutional setting and the difficulties created for the central bank by alack of the right institutional setting – or it may have to cope with failures in coordination with theother relevant policy-making authorities. And when we speak about coordination and risks for central banks, we also have plenty to say.Materialisation of these risks may lead to a late recognition of accumulating imbalances. This, in 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
turn, results in a failure to prevent imbalances from reaching a point when disruptive adjustmentbecomes inevitable and a crisis emerges. This means that our main risk as a central bank in terms of policy-making is to act at the rightmoment in order to avoid making later action harder, ultimately leading to a crisis.Once a crisis erupts, the nature of the risks changes, calling for more action by the policy-making authorities.Initially, the priority must be to manage the crisis and mitigate its immediate impact. I amreminded of the popular Portuguese saying: ‘In times of war there is no time to clean weapons’.And that is how it was during the crisis. When we are facing problems we need to act, despitethe presence of some risks. That is why initially the priority must be to manage the crisis and tomitigate its immediate impact.Unconventional, and often untested, measures are put in place, and the question arises as to,first: What are the right doses of the medicine and the right duration of the intervention? Then one has to worry about the adjustment process towards a new ‘steady state’, and second,about reducing the probability of similar crises occurring in the future. This means that we aresimultaneously in a situation where we need to ensure that the patient will survive, but the risksassociated with the medicine will also be under control. The dilemma here is again on theappropriate doses: How to facilitate and speed up the adjustment while minimising the risk of ‘curing thedisease and killing the patient’? And how can we smooth the adjustment without sowing the seeds of the next crisis? In other words, how can policy avoid tail risks? And at what cost?Also, policies designed to avoid tail risks often carry significant risks for central banks’ balancesheets. This is something that has been studied by Professor Ricardo Reis, who is with ustoday. Such policies, and their reversal in the future, may jeopardise central banks’ independenceand their ability to deliver on their objectives over the medium run. This means we need tounderstand that central banks need to act when facing difficulty, but at the same time actingcould be a big threat to the bank itself.So, when deciding on their policies, central banks need to consider not only the overall economicimpact of those policies, but also the possible implications for their own sustainability. These and other difficult questions and trade-offs have been very much present in central banks’deliberations over the past ten years; and they will not go away in the future because they will bepresent in managing the balance sheet.The second topic that we need to understand is that central banks are corporations and serviceproviders. And related to that are the risks associated with formulating monetary policy andensuring financial stability, as these activities will impact on their capacity to manage the balancesheet. Central banks also face a variety of other risks emerging from their operational activity,extending but not limited to those affecting:Asset management;Cash issuance;Payment systems;Information and communication systems, including cyber risks.Materialisation of any of these risks may have a severe impact on the central bank’s financial 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
position and reputation. Their prevention needs to be part of the central bank’s daily activities.On top of that, as banks with a balance sheet, with responsibility for the assets on the balancesheet and with the needs of a central bank, and also as entities that have supervisory powers,central banks need to set an example for the banking community and the financial system. Thismeans that we need to be the first to introduce new approaches, we need to be the first to thinkabout risks and we need to be the first to spread best practice among the financial community. In a nutshell I believe that to be effective, central banks need to be trusted; and in order to betrusted, they need:To have the ability to explain their policies and deliver on their mission;To be accountable for their use of taxpayers’ resources;And finally to lead by example.The road is very narrow and failure to deliver can cause serious and long-lasting reputationaldamage. Risk is so important because we are facing this risk always as front-runners when therisk emerges.A ‘risk-free’ organisation does not exist. This is something that we should emblazon on the frontof the central bank and also of the commercial banks: a risk-free organisation doesn’t exist. Andit is important for the central bank – within the constraints of the institutional and regulatoryenvironment that embraces its operations – to define the appropriate level of risk appetite andtolerance, and to monitor this risk in an effective and suitable way.A properly designed risk management framework in the central bank is a pillar of confidence andtrust in the financial system and in the wider economy. This is why conferences such as this are so important. By bringing together academics, policy-makers, practitioners and market analysts to exchange views – from very different, butcomplementary, angles – we are contributing to more robust policy frameworks and to morerobust institutions.And I think this is the main takeaway that we need to have at the end of this conference: the ideathat we can do better, but we cannot avoid risk; and the art of the central bank is to deal with therisk without losing sight of the two main goals, financial stability and monetary stability. To dothat, we may need to accept that some collateral effects are part of the process and are just theprice we pay in order to achieve the two main objectives.Thank you very much.  And thank you very much to those who are making presentations, those who agreed to take partin the discussions, and those who agreed to participate in this conference.It is my honour now to present to you Yves Mersch, member of the Executive Board of the ECB.It is a pleasure for me because I’ve known Yves Mersch for more than 30 years. We have beentogether in different roles, together in the same room, discussing the Maastricht Treaty.Yves Mersch was the chairman of the committee that discussed the Maastricht Treaty during thecritical period of time before its approval. He was instrumental and made a key contribution to thedevelopment of these negotiations. Afterwards we met in different roles, including an importantone that I would like to mention – that of being the first Governor of the Central Bank ofLuxembourg. And this means a lot! This means creating a bank from scratch. And creating acentral bank from scratch is not an easy task in terms of the relationship with the political power, 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
in operational terms, in terms of creating credibility, in terms of bringing together a team. And Ithink that this point needs to be emphasised because it is a very important achievement by YvesMersch. After that, Yves Mersch joined the Board of the ECB, and he is one of the individuals we count onheavily at the ECB, for three reasons. First, because he is very important for ensuring thesmooth running of the infrastructure that is critical for the working of the economy, for everythingconcerning currency issuance, everything concerning payments, and the major advances thathave been achieved. Second, he is very important because he is in charge of the legaldepartment, a critical department for ensuring central banks’ independence – in fact more thanjust independence – central banks’ obeyance to their ultimate objective. And third, as head of the legal department he is an important ally for us in the national centralbanks in order to preserve our independence where there are temptations to reduce thisindependence. To be clear, the temptation to reduce the independence of the central banks is notonly a characteristic of, I would say, the Southern countries. There are Nordic countries that havethe same temptation. This means that wherever the treasury is, there is also the temptation totake it. And it is not only a question for the Portuguese people or others: put the moneysomewhere and the temptation will arise, it may be sooner, it may be later, but it will arise. Yves Mersch is a key man for us, for our activity, because he is in charge of the department thatgives us the sponsorship that is needed to continue with our activity without any risks, i.e.institutional risks. And institutional risk is a big risk that central banks are now facing: if you look tothe United States or to Europe, you’ll see that the political and monetary centres have differentperspectives. To have someone in the legal department who knows very well which way is bestis very comforting and reassuring. So I give the floor to Yves Mersch, thanking him very much for the role that he plays in ensuringthe independence of the Eurosystem and ensuring that central banks at national level are in linewith the commitment that we undertook in the Maastricht Treaty. Thank you very much. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Page 1 of 9    Opening remarks by Francois Groepe, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the workshop on the impact of IFRS 9 on banks and regulators in Africa, jointly hosted by the Working Group on Cross-border Banking Supervision and the South African Reserve Bank  South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria 26 September 2017  Introduction  Good morning, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.  It gives me great pleasure to warmly welcome you to this workshop on the impact of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 on banks and regulators in Africa, which the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is hosting jointly with the Working Group on Cross-Border Banking Supervision.  I would like to thank the Association of African Central Banks and, in particular, the Working Group on Cross-Border Supervision of the Committee of African Banking Supervisors for being present here today. We are indeed privileged to host fellow central bankers and regulators from across the African continent to discuss matters relating to the implementation of IFRS 9. The SARB truly values the cooperation with its peers from the continent and opportunities like this allow us to nurture networks and build relationships, share experiences and learnings, and contribute towards improving the overall quality of our continent’s prudential supervision of the financial sector.    
Page 2 of 9  Financial reporting  It is believed that Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan monk known as the father of accounting, was the first to codify the double-entry system of bookkeeping in his mathematical textbook titled Summa de arithmetica, geometria proportioni et proportionalita which was published in Venice in 1494. The celebrated German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe sang the praises of this system and described it as the finest invention of the human mind as it allowed the merchant to survey the whole of his business activities at any time; he even suggested that ‘every prudent master of a house should introduce it into his economy’.  As any system, however, this system also has its challenges and shortcomings, and the renowned investor Warren Buffet warns that financial accounting is an imperfect language and that to understand accounting one needs to understand its nuances. Buffet further warns that, ‘in the long run, management’s stressing of accounting appearance over economic substance usually achieves little of either’. It is therefore critical that, to extract the most from the system of financial accounting, one is mindful of the inherent shortcomings of the system.  In order to address some of the challenges in this area, much progress has been made towards the ideal of developing a set of high-quality international accounting standards that are widely used. In this regard, international standard-setting bodies, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, play a vital role in working towards this goal. This Foundation has as its mission the development of standards that bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world and serving the public interest by fostering trust, growth, and long-term financial stability in the global economy. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent private sector body which was established in 2001 and operates under the oversight of the International Reporting Standards Foundation, has been tasked with the development and approval of IFRSs, as well as the issuing of interpretations of these IFRSs.  
Page 3 of 9  IFRSs are now required in 125 jurisdictions and South Africa too subscribes to the accounting standards issued by the IASB, as do many of the jurisdictions represented here today. Irrespective of whether your respective jurisdiction has adopted IFRS or not, I am sure that all of you will find benefit from the discussions and presentations that will take place during this workshop.  IFRS 9 and the G20  On 24 July 2014, the IASB issued a new accounting standard on financial instruments called IFRS 9, which replaced the existing standard, namely International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, and which has a mandatory effective date of 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 inter alia specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets and liabilities. One of the fundamental changes that IFRS 9 introduces is the concept of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provisioning. This new principle replaces the current incurred losses model and will materially change the way in which companies, and in particular banks, are required to approach and account for impairments for credit losses.  According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the great financial crisis of 2007-09 highlighted the systemic costs of a delayed recognition of credit losses on the part of banks and other lenders, and the application of the prevailing standards at the time was seen as having prevented banks from provisioning appropriately for credit losses likely to arise from emerging risks. These delays resulted in the recognition of credit losses that were widely regarded as ‘too little, too late’, and gave rise to questions of procyclicality by spurring excessive lending during the boom and forcing a sharp reduction in the subsequent bust.  The development of the ECL accounting framework is consistent with the call by the leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) in April 2009 to strengthen accounting recognition of loan loss provisions by incorporating a broader range of credit information. One of the consequences of this new framework is the fact that while, in the past, a loss event had to have occurred before an impairment was raised by a bank. The standard now requires that loss provisions be raised earlier and take into account not only past and present 
Page 4 of 9  information but also forward-looking information, which emphasises the future probability of credit losses in determining them. This standard is aimed at resolving the weaknesses identified during the global financial crisis of ‘too little, too late’ referred to above, and this will hopefully result in a more robust financial system that is more resilient and hence better able to withstand shocks.  The adoption of IFRS 9 will give rise to higher levels of credit impairments. A study undertaken by the European Banking Authority estimated that the implementation of IFRS 9 would give rise to an average increase of 13% in loss provisions compared to the current levels under IAS 39; it is further expected that the Core Equity Tier (CET) 1 ratios will decrease by an average of 45 basis points. Smaller banks, which mainly use the standardised approach to measuring credit risk, estimate a larger impact on their own fund ratios than the larger banks. Estimates of the exact impact differ, however, and only time will tell which of these estimates was accurate.  There are those that argue that the adoption of IFRS 9 may in fact increase procyclicality, because during recessionary conditions there may be a sharp fall in CET 1 capital levels and this, in turn, may lead to a sharp easing in credit extension due to the so-called ‘cliff effect’ of the staged approach prescribed by IFRS 9. Others, notably the BIS, reject this argument on the basis that banks, after the global financial crisis, are now better capitalised with higher buffers and thus are better able to absorb losses. They further argue that the early loss recognition of credit losses enables a quicker ‘clean-up’ of banks’ balance sheets, thus enabling them to support economic recovery.  This debate is clearly not yet settled and we will need to wait and see how this plays out during the next recession. The economic impact is, however, not only limited to the level of losses and the timing of the recognition; the implementation of IFRS 9 is also likely to impact on the pricing of products which may thus impact on overall credit extension within the economy and ultimately consumption and hence economic growth.  It is furthermore likely that banks’ earnings will be more volatile in the future due to the effect of the forward-looking approach that is required under IFRS 9. Therefore, 
Page 5 of 9  disclosure and the education of stakeholders on how to interpret financial information under IFRS 9 will be imperative and an important consideration.  Over the past two years, many seminars, workshops, and training sessions have been provided by a range of organisations. However, very few of these have focused on jurisdictions from the African continent. There are factors that are unique to Africa that need to be taken into account. With this workshop, we want to fill this gap and provide a platform for African regulators to discuss the specific issues and concerns that may affect them in the implementation of IFRS 9. In this context, we are very much looking forward to the presentation from the Bank of Zambia on its in-country regulator perspective.  Auditors  The BIS correctly points out that the effectiveness of the new standards will not only depend on how banks implement them but will also depend on the contributions of central banks, supervisors, and other stakeholders, such as auditors. The BIS highlights that supervisors can play a very important role in promoting sound bank implementation practices through their banking supervision activities in a manner that complements the efforts of accosting standard setters.  The auditing profession, as mentioned, is an important stakeholder when it comes to the implementation of IFRS 9, so a discussion of IFRS 9 would not be complete without reference to their role. There is little doubt that the audit profession is likely to be challenged with the introduction of IFRS 9. The reason is that the audit of accounting estimates, such as impairments, has always been a very complex area and the introduction of IFRS 9 will further add to that complexity.  We are extremely pleased to have multiple representatives from the audit profession in our midst today and tomorrow. We will listen to presentations from both PwC and KPMG dealing with audit expectations, while EY will provide us with their perspective during the panel discussion tomorrow. We especially want to welcome the representatives from PwC Kenya who will be sharing with us their experience to date. 
Page 6 of 9   Before I conclude, I would like to touch on two audit-related topics, namely mandatory audit firm rotation and the recent developments that engulfed the global audit firm KPMG.  The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) recently issued a new rule on mandatory audit firm rotation, which limits audit firm appointments to a maximum period of 10 years. The efforts by IRBA to improve independence are to be welcomed. The SARB has been proactive with regard to auditor independence, for example section 61 of the Banks Act provides that the Registrar of Banks must approve the appointment of an auditor before such an auditor can take up office. Such an appointment further requires that the Audit Committee do a proper assessment of the suitability of the auditor to hold office, after which the Office of the Registrar of Banks would also do a fit and proper assessment prior to the approval of the auditor’s appointment.  The SARB, from a supervisory perspective has furthermore, for many years now, required large banks to appoint joint auditors as this further reduces the independence-related risk. The SARB therefore, while broadly supportive of the principle of mandatory audit firm rotation, believes that banks should be exempted from these requirements as our supervisory standards and practices as it relate to auditor independence far exceed those that have recently been put in place. We further believe that the maximum period of appointment should be increased from the proposed 10 years to a longer period of between 15 and 20 years, as individual audit partner rotation is already in effect. The challenges around skills shortages are furthermore a reality that may act as an obstacle to achieving this objective of rotating audit firms after 10 years.  If mandatory audit firm rotation is retained in the current form, the SARB may be compelled to revisit the requirement of joint auditor appointments for large financial institutions due to some of these practical considerations. Although the removal of the requirement of joint auditors for large financial institutions will lead to reduced audit fees and other efficiencies, we believe that this is likely to weaken auditor independence and may detract from the current high levels of audit quality and thus possibly erode the effective oversight and supervision of banks. This would not be in the public interest. We 
Page 7 of 9  further remain unconvinced that mandatory audit firm rotation represents an effective policy intervention to address the stated secondary objectives of redressing the high levels of market concentration and to promote transformation within the auditing profession.  As a regulator, the SARB as a rule does not comment on individual firms. We, however, took the extraordinary step to comment publicly on the developments surrounding KPMG last week as they are the auditors to three of the big four banks, as well as to other banks and insurance companies. Our interest stems solely from a public policy perspective that arises from our financial stability mandate. We had noted with concern the regrettable auditing practices and serious errors of judgment that had occurred at KPMG and which had led to significant damage being inflicted on certain individuals, organisations, and the country as a whole.  During our engagement with the local and global leadership of KPMG, we have noted the increasing and firm commitment of the new management team to fully own up to past mistakes and to work towards restoring the public trust. The recent announcements in this regard are recognised as important first steps towards this end and we are eagerly awaiting the results of the independent investigations undertaken by IRBA and the more recently announced one by KPMG. As a regulator, we do not pick winners or losers, but we are concerned stemming from our extensive experience of regulating banks this unfolding situation may take the form of a bank run with contagion risk that extends beyond an individual firm. This situation calls for thoughtful leadership and restraint as we believe that our economy will be better served if we can avoid further market concentration within the auditing and auxiliary professional services sector.  These recent developments have, however, provided us cause to pause. In the coming months and years, the following policy considerations may need to be pondered in the interest of further strengthening governance and transparency within the auditing and accounting professions. These include:  
Page 8 of 9  (i) The requirement that audit firms may be ‘too big to fail’ and whether this may require regulatory intervention, including limiting the extent to which audit firms provide non-audit services, especially to audit clients. The imposition of caps regarding the value of non-audit services rendered to audit clients and prohibiting the rendering of certain category of non-audit services to audit clients in line with the reforms announced by the European Commission in 2016 should enjoy serious consideration.  (ii) A far greater degree of disclosure and transparency by the auditing and accounting profession are required, given the public functions that audit firms perform when they inter alia attest the financial statements of public companies. Hence, consideration should be given to making the full public disclosure of a comprehensive set of audited financial statements mandatory, irrespective of the form or legal structure of ownership of such firms.  (iii) The appointment of independent boards of directors and the strengthening of the risk management function within audit firms will further strengthen oversight and governance within auditing and accounting firms.  (iv) The publication of an integrated report by the large and medium size audit firms as this may contribute to improve transparency around transformation initiatives and could assist to accelerate transformation within this sector. Full disclosure regarding compliance with governance frameworks such as King IV could also assist in improving governance arrangements within these firms.  While this list is not exhaustive, it would be useful if there were a public discourse around these policy questions. We firmly believe that the implementation of some of these proposals may go some way to strengthening the governance within the audit and accounting professions and could assist to further support and possibly strengthen the trust that society places in them.    
Page 9 of 9  Conclusion  The saying goes that change is the only constant in life. IFRS 9 certainly represents a major change for the banking industry. It is certainly a change that needs to be embraced. The regulated sector will be looking towards their regulators for guidance, hence we need to be up to date and well versed in order to be able to provide effective guidance. To this end banks, auditors and regulators will have to work together to ensure that the implementation of IFRS 9 will be a success. I hope that this workshop will contribute towards this goal.  I am sure that during the next one and a half days, there will be very interesting and fruitful discussions that will benefit all the jurisdictions present here today and even after the workshops, I am sure conversations will continue. I wish you well on your IFRS 9 implementation journey and hope you will enjoy the workshop.  Thank you.  
SpeechCentral Bank Independence in RetrospectGuy Debelle Deputy GovernorAddress at Bank of England Independence: 20 Years On ConferenceLondon – 28 September 2017It is a pleasure to be here today to celebrate 20 years of central bank independence for the Bank ofEngland.I have been tasked with discussing central bank independence in retrospect. In part, this is becausea little more than two decades ago, Stan Fischer and I wrote about central bank independence inprospect and posed the question: How Independent Should a Central Bank Be?When we asked that question in 1994, central bank independence was all the rage. I wrote my PhDdissertation at MIT on it, under Stan's expert tutelage. A bit further up Mass Ave, Adam Posen waswriting his PhD dissertation at Harvard on the very same issue. In New Zealand, the government hadestablished a new framework for independence for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) in1989, which granted the RBNZ significant independence, including making the Governor directlyaccountable for any failure to achieve the price stability objective. The framework for the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) had just been established, which legislated a very high degree of central bankindependence. Looking back, that may have been the high-water mark for central bankindependence. Though, of course, the Bank of England's independence was still to come, so perhapsthat was the apogee!Fast forward to today and central bank independence is no longer in the ascendancy. Its legitimacyand effectiveness are under scrutiny. Is this ‘the end of the era of central bank independence’?The answer to that question is no, in my opinion. The reason why has a lot to do with the answerthat Stan and I proposed in answering the question of how independent should a central bank be.﻿[*]﻿[1]﻿[2]
We made the important distinction between goal and instrument independence, arguing that centralbanks should be goal dependent but have instrument independence. That is, the goal(s) that thecentral bank is pursuing should be determined by the political process. But, once given the goal, thecentral bank should be able to pursue the goal as it sees fit, with appropriate accountability.That distinction we drew between the two aspects of independence stands up to scrutiny twentyyears on. If anything, I would argue that the experience of the past two decades serves to reinforceour conclusion, with the Bank of England's own experience being a prime example.In my remarks today, I will first revisit the motivation for central bank independence. I will then askwhether those justifications are still relevant today. Or is central bank independence a solution toyesterday's problems? I will then discuss why central bank independence is under more threat todayand ask whether modifications to the model of central bank independence are required.Three Foundations of Central Bank IndependenceFirst, I would like to revisit the three foundations of the arguments supporting our conclusions ongoal dependence and instrument independence. The first foundation was the performance of theBundesbank. We questioned how effective the Bundesbank had been, in the sense that recessionswere at least as costly (in terms of lost output) in Germany than they had been in other countrieswith less independence. That is, the sacrifice ratio in Germany was not lower, which would have beenexpected if there had been a material credibility benefit from the Bundesbank's independence.We cautioned against the cult of central bank independence, that is, the need to avoid excessiveconcentration on inflation avoidance. Hence the conclusion that a central bank should have goaldependence.Second, there was the academic literature. Stan and I noted that much of the academic literaturefocused on rules versus discretion in the context of dynamic inconsistency. Dynamicinconsistency doesn't have any particular implication for central bank independence. A rules-basedmonetary policy can be implemented mechanically by an agency with neither goal nor instrumentindependence. The argument won out in favour of discretion; if not in all of the theoretical literaturethen absolutely in practice. But both in practice and to a large extent in theory, the solution was inthe form of ‘constrained discretion’. The constraint on discretion is the goal for the central bankset by the government. The central bank has complete discretion as to how best to achieve that goal.Given discretion, what then is the best institutional framework? Stan and I also noted that KenRogoff's conservative central banker could be too inflation averse to be socially optimal. Theoptimal degree of central bank independence was ‘chosen by trading off the reduction in meaninflation secured by conservatism against the less than optimal trade-off between inflation and outputvariability produced by that same conservatism’. Carl Walsh took up this point in designing asocially optimal incentive contract for central bank governors, and the New Zealanders went a fair﻿[3]﻿[4]﻿[5]﻿[6]﻿[7]
way towards operationalising it.Third there was the empirical evidence of Alex Cukierman, Alesina and Summers, and Grilli,Masciandaro and Tabellini. Those papers showed a clear negative correlation between averageinflation and central bank independence, and this result was influential in the changes to central bankindependence that occurred around this time. Stan and I drilled down empirically into what particularaspects of central bank independence underpinned this correlation and concluded that inflationperformance is likely to be better if there is goal dependence and instrument independence.Before discussing how these foundations stand up to scrutiny two decades later, I will spend sometime talking about the overlap between central bank independence and inflation targeting.The issue of goal dependence raises the question about what are the appropriate goals for a centralbank. At the same time as central bank independence was coming to the fore, inflation targeting wasin its nascence. Indeed, I attended a conference here at the Bank of England in 1995, organised byAndy (Haldane), on the brand-new topic of inflation targeting. The New Zealanders hadadopted the first formal inflation target in 1992. The Canadians and Swedes followed. The UK hadjust adopted an inflation target. It is noteworthy that this was a couple of years before the Bank ofEngland received its independence.Andy wasn't sure whether to invite the RBA as we had put in place a ‘soft’ version of inflationtargeting around 1993, in marked contrast to the (then) hair-shirted framework of the NewZealanders and the Canadians. Graciously he erred on the side of inclusiveness in inviting GlennStevens and me to talk about the Australian model. That model now looks very much like thestandard flexible inflation-targeting framework that is practiced here in the UK and elsewhere,including both NZ and Canada.Inflation targeting and central bank independence are sometimes conflated given their similar birthdates in a number of countries. In part this is because both can been seen as a response to theinflation experience of the 1970s and 1980s. The problem at hand was how best to establish andmaintain a low inflation environment while delivering the desired macroeconomic outcomes.But the nature of the underlying issue that the two were intended to address was quite different. Thepolitical business cycle was one of the primary motivations for central bank independence. Thetemptation to run the economy too hot in the lead-up to an election argued for the allocation ofmonetary policy management of the economic cycle to an agency insulated from the political cycle.While one might argue that the political business cycle is less of a consideration today in manycountries, its current abeyance should not be assumed to be a permanent state of affairs. Moreover,it still very much remains a live issue in a number of emerging markets.In contrast, inflation targeting arose in part because other monetary frameworks had seemingly﻿[8]﻿[9]﻿[10]
proven unable to deliver the appropriate degree of inflation control. As Governor Bouey of the Bankof Canada famously said, ‘We didn’t abandon monetary targets, they abandoned us'. In that regard,Mervyn King describes inflation targeting as a coping strategy, coping with the inability of othermonetary policy frameworks to deliver the required outcomes.Central banks in many cases didn't have a lot of public credibility in terms of macroeconomicpolicymaking. In the Bank of England's case, it wasn't the monetary policy decision-maker, so theinstitution itself didn't have any track record of monetary policymaking. So in the UK, as in NZ,Canada and Australia, there was a need to build that track record. A track record requires a track.Inflation targeting provided that track. Here was a goal over which the central bank believes it has asizeable degree of influence. The inflation-targeting framework provides a benchmark against whichthe central bank can be held to account in close to real time. If successful, then credibility is likely tobuild through time.The Foundations for Central Bank Independence in RetrospectUltimately the proof of the central bank independence pudding is in the eating. Has central bankindependence delivered? The subsequent two decades have clearly seen low inflation. Somewhatironically, the problem today is that inflation is too low, which has contributed to the claim thatcentral bank independence, and particularly inflation targeting, is the solution to yesterday's problem.Certainly, up until 2007, the low inflation outcomes did not come at the cost of inferior outcomes interms of output or employment. This was Mervyn's ‘nice’ decade.But were these ‘nice’ outcomes causation or correlation? It is difficult to disentangle from otherinfluences, including the emergence of inflation targeting as the operating framework for manycentral banks. There is also the integration of the Chinese economy into the global economy and thesignificant disinflationary impulse that came with that.Ed Balls and his co-authors have revisited the empirical findings of Stan's and my paper and showthat they stand up with the addition of 20 years of data. They demonstrate that the negativecorrelation remains between the instrument independence of the central bank and inflation.There is also a strong test case in the recent experience in the UK. The period between mid 2010 andmid 2012 saw a prolonged period of inflation above target. Yet inflation expectations remained wellanchored. This was reflected in subdued wage outcomes, leading to a significant decline in realwages.This event seems to me to demonstrate that the credibility of the Bank of England in terms ofinflation control was well entrenched. Could such a conjuncture have been achieved in earlier periodsin the UK? The experience of earlier decades suggests that it is highly likely that inflationexpectations would have gone up with inflation. How much this can be attributable to central bank﻿[11]﻿[12]
independence or the inflation target is difficult to disentangle. But the fact that the Bank of Englandhad the independence to pursue the inflation target set by the Chancellor must count for something.The fact that the target was not adjusted upward to accommodate the rise in inflation is alsoconsequential. The Bank of England did not have a political incentive to achieve surprise inflation,Barro-Gordon style.That's the good news. The economic outcomes of the 1990s and 2000s in terms of low inflation, lowunemployment and lower economic volatility are at least partly attributable to central bankindependence. The political business cycle has been largely absent from discussions for some timenow, particularly in the advanced economies.In the end, though, this assessment mostly relies on assertion, rather than empirical proof,particularly for the advanced economies. The unknowable counterfactual as to what would havehappened in a world of less central bank independence remains just that, unknowable. The emergingeconomies provide a more fertile ground for empirical validation, although China stands as a verylarge counterexample.Central Bank Independence under Threat?But there is also the bad news. Why is central bank independence under pressure today?In summarising the economic outcomes over the past two decades, I stopped short of the financialcrisis and its consequences. Clearly the output performance since the crisis has been inferior (labourmarket outcomes less so), although inflation has generally been low and stable. In some cases, theconcern has been that inflation has been too low. The UK is not obviously one of these cases, giventhat the average inflation rate over the past decade in the UK has been 2¼ per cent, slightly abovethe middle of the inflation target. Similarly, in Australia the average inflation rate has been2.4 per cent, again right around the middle of the inflation target.How much these outcomes can be attributed to monetary policy settings, both before and after theonset of the financial crisis, is a hotly contested debate. I will not add to that debate here, but simplynote that the unsatisfactory post-crisis growth experience is a significant contributor to the currentscrutiny of central banks and their independence.In this regard, I am concerned that along with insulating the setting of monetary policy from thepolitical business cycle through central bank independence came a belief that monetary policy wasthe only game in town for demand management. This belief was reinforced by the success of themacroeconomic management after the 1990s recessions up until 2007.After the onset of the crisis, with a rare exception in 2008-2009, demand management continued tobe the sole purview of central banks. Fiscal policy was not much in the mix. This put additionalpressure on central banks. Given their mandate, as long as there was something that could be done
to achieve the goals given to the central bank, however small the impact, then that something had tobe done. Otherwise there was a serious risk of undermining the legitimacy of the central bank'sindependence.As we know, that took a number of central banks into the territory of the zero lower bound, andbeyond in some cases. In some respects, monetary policy around the zero lower bound, particularlyin the form of quantitative easing, starts to morph into elements of fiscal policy. In the frameworkthat Stan and I used to examine the appropriate degree of central bank independence, governmentspending or fiscal policy more generally had a central role to play that the central bank needed totake account of. There were different outcomes depending on the nature of the interaction betweenthe central bank and the government (in game theoretic terms, it depended on which was theStackelberg leader or whether it was a Nash solution). But fiscal policy did play an important role indemand management. Monetary policy was not the only game in town.Central bank independence does not imply the complete delegation of demand management to thecentral bank. The achievement of the output and inflation goals of the central bank is very much afunction of the fiscal response too. There is a risk that the cult of central bank independence hasplaced excessive pressure on the central bank to always do more.Stan and I examined the issue of instrument independence in a ‘normal’ macroeconomic world,where changes in interest rates within standard historic ranges were sufficient to achieve the desiredmacroeconomic outcomes. Again, that is not the environment that a number of economies haveexperienced over the past decade, where policy settings have moved into ‘unconventional territory’.Unconventional monetary policy has the possibility to undermine the support for instrumentindependence because of the interaction between the central bank's asset purchases and thegovernment's debt management strategy.Mervyn King noted that ‘inflation targeting as a practical definition of price stability is separable fromour understanding of the economy, which can evolve’. I would make the same argument aboutcentral bank independence as an overarching framework for monetary policymaking. My view is thatinflation targeting and central bank independence are being blamed for economic outcomes that arenot a consequence of either of them, but rather of our understanding of the way the economyoperates. Legitimate criticisms of central banks' understanding of the economy can be made, but thatdoes not delegitimise the overall operating framework. But a great strength of central bankindependence and inflation targeting is that one's view of the transmission mechanism can evolveover time while the basic architecture of the policy framework remains unchanged.Besides that, a new threat to central bank independence comes from the greater focus currently onthe distributional consequences of monetary policy. Monetary policy has always had distributionalconsequences. The primary transmission of monetary policy decisions is through two relative prices:﻿[13]
the interest rate and the exchange rate. The interest rate is the intertemporal price of substitution,which has distributional consequences between savers and investors, as well as across generations,as indeed does inflation itself. The exchange rate has distributional consequences between the tradedand non-traded sectors of the economy as well as cross-border distributional implications. It is alsoimportant to note that unemployment has larger, first order consequences for income distributionthan either the interest rate or the exchange rate. But these distributional effects of monetary policyhave always been present. Why is this so much more of a threat to central bank independencetoday?One plausible explanation is the lower level of nominal growth, and particularly wage growth. Theconcerns around income distribution are much starker (though not necessarily any less), whennominal wages are stagnant for a significant share of the population. Another possible explanation isthat if a primary transmission channel of unconventional monetary policy is through asset prices(including house prices), then the wealth channel may be playing a disproportionately larger rolethan in the past. The distributional impact of the wealth channel may well be larger than that of otherchannels of monetary policy transmission. If the distributional impact of monetary policy channels islarger now than it was in the past, this can compromise the legitimacy of instrument independence.Financial Stability and IndependenceStan and I also addressed the question about goal dependence coming from the standardmacroeconomic perspective of the day. One aspect that has changed post-crisis is the heightenedfocus on the financial stability goal of central banks. The Bank of England is a prime example of this.One question that arises is how the financial stability goal interacts with the inflation target. Is it aseparate goal for the central bank that sets up potential trade-offs or is it aligned with the inflation-targeting goal? If it is separate, should the central bank have independence in how it defines the goalof financial stability? Should it have complete instrument independence as to how it pursues thatgoal?The goal of financial stability has generally been left vague. To some extent, it has been defined onlyin the negative. That is, we can all agree that financial instability was present in 2008 and that wasnot a good state of affairs. But it is much harder to get agreement on what are the importantelements of financial stability and how central banks should go about achieving them. The long-lasting, and still very active, debate about whether the central bank should lean against the wind isthe best example of this. It brings to the fore a number of issues: is there a trade-off between theinflation target goal and the financial stability goal? Does the goal of financial stability need to bebetter defined than it is at the moment? If so, by whom? Should the central bank have completeindependence to pursue its goal of financial stability with whatever instruments it so chooses,including when the distributional implications of some of those instruments are much starker? Thequestions do not have a straightforward answer. I would hope they would be a hot topic for PhD
students today in the way that central bank independence was when Adam Posen and I were PhDstudents.AccountabilityOne of the points that Stan and I were at pains to stress was the importance of central bankaccountability. It is the very bedrock of central bank independence in a democratic society. Italleviates the criticism that central bank independence is inappropriate because macroeconomicpolicy decisions are being taken by unelected bureaucrats. I find this criticism misplaced. There aremany instances where the goals of public policy have been set by the political process but are thenimplemented by (unelected) public servants. That is, the bureaucracy has instrument independencein many different areas. This set-up is not unique to central banks. But it does underscore theargument for goal dependence. The central bank is accountable to the political process in achievingthe goals given to it.Over the past two decades, accountability has changed substantially. Again the Bank of England is agood example. There are regular appearances before the Treasury Select Committee. The volumeand content of central bank publications is considerably larger and more detailed than twenty yearsago. The number of speeches is dramatically higher and the messaging more transparent. No longeris it the case that a Governor would say: if you understood what I said, I must have misspoken.So with independence has come the accountability. The accountability is to the politicians and thepopulation at large, not a small group of central banking aficionados, nor the financial markets.That means that, unlike the Delphic Oracle, it is important that the utterances of central banks areunderstandable.Another important distinction, in my view, between the Delphic Oracle and central banks is that theaccountability is confined to the goals given to the central bank. The central bank should not beregarded as a font of all wisdom. To do so risks comprising the independence in the areas thatmatter.ConclusionCentral bank independence was in the ascendancy twenty years ago when the Bank of England wasgiven its independence to pursue its inflation-targeting goal with complete instrument independence.The framework adopted in the UK was very much along the lines that Stan and I envisioned when wewrote on this topic a few years earlier, namely that a central bank should have goal dependence andinstrument independence and should be held accountable for its decisions through the politicalprocess. The subsequent economic performance of the UK economy validates that choice of regime.The macroeconomic outcomes through the remainder of the 1990s until 2007 certainly do. Whateverfailings led to the financial crisis and its long-lived consequences, I am not convinced that central﻿[14]﻿[15]
bank independence was a contributing factor. Indeed, I think the experience of the UK economythrough the past decade underlines the value of the independence given to it.I do not regard central bank independence as fighting yesterday's war. The theoretical and empiricalunderpinnings of central bank independence remain as valid today as they did twenty years ago. Thelinks between monetary policy, fiscal policy and financial stability policy may be more prominent nowthan they were two decades ago. One can question the central bank's understanding of thefunctioning of the macroeconomy and the monetary policy transmission process, but that is aseparable issue from the validity of independence. That said, the questioning of the framework itselfis a vital quid pro quo for independence. The accountability of central banks to the political processand the public more generally is critical. To be able to take independent decisions about theappropriate stance of monetary policy, a central bank has to appropriately justify them.While the combination of goal dependence and instrument independence in terms of monetary policyhas stood the test of time, the equivalence in terms of financial stability is more an open question.Both the goal of financial stability and the instruments are much less clearly defined at present. Whilecentral bank independence in terms of monetary policy was all the rage in the first part of the 1990s,a similar focus in terms of financial stability today is warranted.EndnotesThanks to Stan Fischer for his education, example, guidance and support over many years.

Italy’s banks in the new European system  Italy’s economy was already weak when the 2007-08 global financial crisis struck. Its productive system was structurally incapable of delivering innovation, efficiency and genuine development; its financial system was overly reliant on banks. The old dinosaur that was its banking system had already begun to stir back to life, but many banks lagged behind as a result of ingrained bad habits in governance and management. These weaknesses fed on each other and were decried at conferences and publicly condemned. Given that they were also deeply rooted in the country and its history, at least its recent history, a solution appeared remote.         If you get a raging temperature when already under the weather, you run a serious risk, as Italy did in these years. The country is only now coming round and while not yet decisive, the signs are encouraging.     What happened outside our borders in recent years – worldwide efforts to draw up new regulations for finance, banking union in Europe and its first faltering steps – will be analysed by future historians.1 Europe’s banking union is here and we must ensure it functions smoothly, starting with the Single Supervisory System (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) established in Frankfurt and Brussels. I will return to this point shortly. 1For an overview of these events from Italy’s perspective, see I. Visco, speech at the 23rd ASSIOM FOREX Congress, Modena, 28 January 2017; S. Rossi, ‘The Banking Union in the European integration process’, delivered at the conference on European Banking Union and bank/firm relationships, CUOA Business School, Altavilla Vicentina, 7 April 2016. 3                                                             
From a legal perspective, banking union formally rests on numerous and complex legislative acts, which I will refer to using their English acronyms. For the euro area only, there are the two SSMR and SRMR Regulations establishing the new bodies tasked with supervision and banking resolution, dating from 2013 and 2014 respectively; for the European Union as a whole, we have CRD IV (the Capital Requirements Directive), followed by the CRR (Capital Requirements Regulation), both from 2013; finally, there is the BRRD (Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive), from 2014, and the DGSD (Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive), also dated 2014. Several of these acts are still being revised and refined.    On the question of banking resolution, a vital component in the overall project for banking union, the European Commission’s July 2013 Communication updated its own earlier interpretation of the rules on State aid in the banking sector. Taken together, the BRRD, DGSD and this Communication have played an important role in the case of the failing Italian banks that were wound up, placed under resolution or sold to other banks.    Banking union makes sense if markets and investors believe that Europe’s banks are European first and foremost, and only then Italian, German or French. It follows that if a bank is in difficulty, it must be a matter for Europe, not just for the country in which that bank is headquartered. This implies the sharing of risks, both at private and public level, a concept that many countries have yet to accept. For several good reasons, I might add. However, one point must be clear: banks run many risks that have to do with how they are managed, but they also share with the State in which they are established – and whose government bonds they hold in their portfolios – what is commonly termed sovereign risk. In the euro area today this is a 4  
reflection not only of idiosyncratic factors in that State, but also of the possibility – which the markets continue to entertain, though much less than in 2011 – of a euro break-up and the redenomination of credits into renascent national currencies. This element of risk must be eliminated by driving the message home at every opportunity: whatever happens, the euro will endure.  Proceeding with banking union necessarily implies sharing banking risks: all countries must work to make this a reality.    The problems besetting the ‘business of banking’ today What problems do Italian banks face today, now that the fall-out from the crisis, specifically the ratio of non-performing loans, is slowly diminishing? Essentially, our banks generate too little profit, even excluding the cost of bad loans. To understand why, it helps to look at what has happened internationally. Over the last five years the return on capital and reserves, namely the return on equity (or ROE), of our banks has been virtually nil, while in the euro area ROE has been just under 2 per cent and in the United Kingdom it has hit 3; in the United States it has reached as much as 9 per cent.  Italian banks have not only had to make enormous write-downs of non-performing loans on their balance sheets, they have also had to bear higher costs than in other countries. Up to now, traditional lending, especially when concentrated around smaller customers, has obliged banks to allocate a large amount of human resources per unit of revenue; moreover, for our major banks labour productivity, expressed as the value added per employee, is modest, averaging 5  
€124,000 over the last five years, compared with €170,000 for a sample of large European groups with similar business models. The low interest rate environment, created the world over by monetary policies, has squeezed interest margins and reduced profits. Although this is a global phenomenon, Italian banks have suffered more than those of other countries owing to their traditional business model: for several years their ROE has been much lower than the cost of capital, which does not make it easy for them to find new funding on capital markets. As we see, Italy’s entire financial structure is in difficulty. Despite the progress made in recent years, we still have companies that are poorly capitalized (as well as too small on average) and a bloated banking sector within the financial system.  And yet the overall size of Italy’s financial sector is no greater than that of other advanced countries. On the contrary! At the end of last year, the financial debt of the private sector (excluding banks and other financial entities) was below 120 per cent of GDP, compared with around 160 per cent in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States. But, for our companies, equity finance accounts for only 46 per cent of their total liabilities, compared with an average of 53 per cent in the euro area. Moreover, they turn mainly to banks rather than to financial markets or non-banking intermediaries: bank loans represent more than 60 per cent of firms’ financial debts, while the euro-area average is not even 40 per cent and in the United States and the United Kingdom it is one third.  6  
As a result, Italian banks, even the largest ones, have specialized in retail lending to firms. They are therefore more exposed to adverse cyclical conditions.  The transition of the Italian financial system  The rules are changing The response of governments and supervisory authorities to the global financial crisis has focused on two key concepts: ‘more capital in banks’ and ‘no more taxpayer-funded bail-outs’. This is not all: action has been taken on liquidity, securitizations and off-balance-sheet transactions. Limits on leverage have also been recognized as necessary supplements to risk-based capital requirements. Even stricter rules have been envisaged for systemically important financial institutions. Instead, less attention has been paid, at least so far, to two extremely important non-banking topics: the shadow banking system and over-the-counter derivatives transactions.  Has the pendulum swung too far towards rules for banks? Many institutions have naturally begun to think so. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is where the world’s supervisory authorities are now debating this question, during the negotiations on the proposed Basel III reform package, which should reinforce and refine banking supervision rules. I have three observations to make, in line with the stance adopted by the Bank of Italy. First observation. A period of adjustment for the reforms will be needed to produce a stable legal framework, otherwise uncertainty will increase, as will risks and the costs of banking. We must allow the rules to settle into place and then look at their effects on business conduct 7  
and models. The  burdens, especially for smaller banks, need to be reduced where possible, though how this is to be done is a subject for discussion. Second observation. The desire for a period of stability is not to be confused with an easing of the rules, and the USA is currently wrestling with this problem. The Fed has defended the reforms it made in response to the global financial crisis by showing how they have strengthened the banking system without limiting economic growth. However, the new administration has yet to define its negotiation strategy. This uncertainty, which can occasionally be seen in the position taken by American representatives in some international forums, deprives the entire international community of important leadership.  Third observation. Work is ongoing in the euro area on regulatory and institutional reforms. This is a good thing as banking union is still incomplete. Yet in Europe, we also need to consolidate what has already been achieved, starting with the SSM and the SRM, the two organizations responsible for the supervision and resolution of euro-area banks. Practices need to be harmonized by taking the best from each national system without prejudice. Progress is under way, including a contribution from Italy, and must be continued.  Rules can contribute to forging the business model for all banks. If the rules change, banks must take this into account when deciding on their identity and strategy. We hope that the uncertainties in the global and European regulatory framework will be dispelled as soon as possible, because banks, especially in Italy, must reinvent and redefine themselves; and do so also in the light of new technologies.  8  
 Technology and its uses are changing FinTech is the new buzzword at the centre of any debate on the future of banking. FinTech companies make use of existing technology, and of new technology as it becomes available, to offer financial products to their customers that up to a few years ago could only be purchased through a bank. This business is expanding rapidly in the markets for loans, payment services, and financial advice and has managed to attract substantial funding from venture capital and private equity firms: last year such firms invested more than $13 billion in FinTech. This is still a trifling amount compared with the trillions of dollars involved in global finance, but its growth is exponential.  Until very recently, the banks benefited from being the main gateway to the financial world for most of the population. By providing a simple but fundamental product like the current account, they were able to reach a vast client base and make profits. Today, FinTech companies are trying to unpack the bundle of financial services offered by the banks, leaving the latter with only the least profitable ones.  FinTech uses innovative data analysis techniques (artificial intelligence and machine learning) to process efficiently the information that individuals and companies put online, sometimes unknowingly (big data). Using this data, algorithms calculate the creditworthiness of those applying for a loan and the result is available, on digital platforms not requiring a bank to act as intermediary, to the savers who directly disburse the financing. The method seems particularly profitable when an individual or a small company is asking for a loan: in this case, according to the advocates of FinTech, an algorithm based on big data is far more efficient than an office peopled by bank clerks.  9  
FinTech companies are radically changing the relationship between clients and financial service providers, even in terms of usability.  They mainly meet the needs of younger people, enabling them to conduct financial transactions at any hour of the day or night using their mobile devices.  This poses a serious threat to traditional banks. The only factor that keeps borrowers and lenders tied to a traditional bank is trust, based on familiarity with other human beings behind a counter or even based purely on a brand. This is an imponderable factor, one that is difficult to predict. Certainly, the banks will have to give much more importance to the digital distribution channels and radically alter the way that client data are analysed and stored. Substantial investment in technology and human capital will be necessary.  Another option for traditional banks is to acquire one or more FinTech companies, as seems to be happening with payment services. Smaller banks could team up with FinTech companies and outsource some of their own business, as has happened in many English-speaking countries.  FinTech also raises questions and problems for those with a public responsibility as financial regulators and supervisors. There is a risk, for instance, of enlarging the boundaries of shadow banking, that is financial entities that elude any kind of supervision. Progress cannot be stopped, but it should be pointed in the right direction in the public interest. We are already considering the best approach to take.   The system’s transition The financial crisis, the global reaction that widened and hardened the perimeter of banking regulation, the tumultuous developments in 10  
technology and in the market and, in the case of Italy, the long-standing problems in the structure of the economy require that our financial system be transformed. The changes are already under way, and the system is in a state of transition.  Throughout the euro area, the banking system has progressively consolidated since the crisis. At the end of last year, the number of banks was just over 5,000, a drop of 25 per cent compared with eight years ago, while the number of residents per bank branch has grown by more than 30 per cent. In Italy, the first figure is in line with the euro-area average, while the second is lower (19 per cent), but nonetheless considerable.  Similarly, the productive capacity of Italy’s banking industry is no more excessive than that of the euro area. At the end of last year, the number of residents per bank in Italy was about 100,000, much higher than the average of 67,000 in the euro area and 48,000 in Germany, even if the number of residents per bank branch was lower: about 2,000 compared with 2,300 in the euro area and 2,600 in Germany.   However, the future does not so much hinge on the number of banks and bank branches, as on the composition of the financial system and the types of activities that banks undertake. I mentioned earlier that our financial system perceives firms as being overly indebted, especially towards banks but without them having benefited in terms of profitability. In order to increase the profitability of the Italian banking system and make it sounder, counterintuitive events are necessary: firms must increase their capital and diversify their sources of financing in order to reduce the role played by banks in the financial system. 11  
Signs of this are already apparent. The moderate expansion in bank lending to firms in recent years, despite its recent recovery, is also a result of this process. From 2012, firms’ leverage (the ratio of debt to debt plus equity) has fallen, the share of bonds in total financial debt has increased and the share of bank lending has diminished in equal measure. Changes in the composition of financing sources, initially limited to large industrial groups already active in the bond market, are now being seen among smaller firms as well.    Over the past few months individual savings plans (PIR funds) have been introduced, i.e. instruments offering tax breaks and designed to channel investment directly towards Italian firms. The experiment has thus far been a success, attracting a net amount of approximately €5 billion. Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) are another relatively new addition to the market, with growing success: in essence they are small private equity funds that gather resources from a limited number of investors solely on the basis of the personal reputation of the promoters. The resources are used to purchase equity in a target company, to be acquired within a set time limit after the vehicle has been established. SPACs are listed companies and serve to accelerate the listing of the target company. *** It is not enough for Italy to change the composition of its financial structure. Banks must advance their business model by accepting and facilitating a narrowing of their traditional role. In the long run, regulatory and technological changes make the Italian model of banking that prevailed in the ten years prior to the global financial crisis no longer sustainable. However, the transition to a new model is far from being free of obstacles and risks. For example, 12  
the immediate repercussions on employment of a rebalancing of the financial structure that lowers the share of the banking sector must be considered carefully, and tools to upgrade the skills of redundant staff must be set up – as we have already begun doing. There is no one solution. Each bank is a unique case and generalization must be avoided. Some banks might increase the supply of bond or share placement services to small and medium-sized enterprises, leveraging the wealth of information gathered over time: in short, this would translate into less direct credit but greater support and the provision of collateral for firms seeking access to financial markets. Other banks might remain totally retail-oriented but enhance their use of digital tools, boosting their online channels and expanding the transactions and services available through them. Such decisions are up to the banks. Analysts and supervisors can only try to glimpse the trends and prospects that, interspersed with risks, lie in the mist that always clouds the future. Of one thing we can be certain: the financial and banking systems cannot remain as they are if we want our country to return to a path of growth as it has done in the past.  13  
Andreas Dombret: Germany's banks - the moment of truth fordecision-makersSpeech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank,at the Bain Bankers Lounge, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2017.*   *   *1. Introduction: structural change reaches a tipping pointLadies and gentlemenBanking is necessary, banks are not.Don’t worry: that’s not my view, but that of Bill Gates. What this bon mot, uttered more than 20years ago now, tells us is that structural change in the banking sector is not as new as it mightseem.In fact, it’s something we are almost taking in our stride these days. For years now, there hasbeen constant talk of upheaval and revolution, of banks dying off and structural change. But onthe face of it, not much has actually happened. One could be forgiven, then, for thinking that wehave more or less accepted structural change as an annoyance – even if it is a bearable one –rather like a visit from the banking supervisor.My view where technological progress is concerned is a different one. Annoying though it may beto some, it’s no good shrugging one’s shoulders at it, nor is there any escaping it. The bankingsector has reached a tipping point in its evolution. That is, we have reached a position whereeven the smallest change will unleash a wave of innovation in the banking world.That is because technological progress always stands for upheaval, for a redirection of society’sresources. Sooner or later, activities which once created significant value become automated,standard processes.And this trend has now reached the financial sector as well. Ever more once-innovative bankingoperations are being standardised and performed by technology.Ladies and gentlemen, I have a confession to make. There are some sides of structural changewhich I, too, struggle to come to terms with – to this day, I would much rather type on aBlackberry than swipe on an iPhone.But in my capacity as a banking supervisor, I do wonder that if banking is possible without banks– who, then, will provide tomorrow’s customers with the banking services they require?That’s not a question I can answer straight up. There are, however, five theories on the future ofbanking I would like to discuss with you today. 2. Reliance on net interest income needs to stopLet’s begin with the question of earnings. My first theory is this. Germany’s banks and savingsbanks continue to be over-dependent on revenues from interest business. This is preventingthem from being profitable in the long run.Net interest income at German credit institutions has been shrinking for years now. To this day,they still haven’t managed to refocus their strategies on the new normal, which is why theirprofitability has been ebbing away. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
That was a very clear message from our low-interest-rate survey, which we released threeweeks ago in conjunction with the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin. Our findingsshow that small and medium-sized German credit institutions are expecting their profits tocontinue shrinking between 2016 and 2021, according to their planning. They are also projectinga remarkable 16% drop in their return on total capital.Monetary policymakers are a popular scapegoat for this malaise – it is their low policy rates,some say, which have caused earnings to dry up in the banking sector. But that, I feel, would beoversimplifying things. If the ECB Governing Council considers an accommodative monetarypolicy stance to be appropriate, it also needs to set interest rate levels accordingly. Monetarypolicymakers are, after all, responsible for the entire euro-area economy. Seen through thatprism, banking sector profitability is just one aspect, albeit an important one.As understandable as the criticism directed at interest rate policy may seem from theperspective of German credit institutions, there’s a risk they might overlook the bigger economicpicture.I say that partly for historical reasons. Interest rate levels in Germany have generally been on thewane for more than 30 years now, notably on account of demographic and macroeconomicfactors. Unsurprisingly, then, the German banking sector’s interest margin has been steadilynarrowing for more than 30 years as well. Hence, accommodative monetary policy is just one –albeit important – aspect. That said, interest-driven business models have been under pressurefor quite some time already.And yet we are seeing very little in the way of adjustment. The business models of small andmedium-sized German institutions, in particular, tend to be more reliant on interest business thanthose of their international peers, despite the fact that some of them can generate sufficientprofits even in this challenging setting.My conclusion, then, is this. Excessively interest-heavy business models are particularlyexposed to structural change. It is becoming increasingly important to tap new sources ofincome.3. Flight into risk isn’t the answerOne simple escape route out of this malaise, it would appear, is a flight into risk – the search foryield is what I’m talking about here. My second theory, then, is this. Banks and savings bankswould be unwise to escape from structural change by fleeing into risk.And the longer the low-interest-rate environment persists, the greater the risk of institutions takingon excessive risk. After years of de-risking, we are now seeing the first signs in Germany of agrowing willingness to assume risk.Prices in financial markets are leaping from one all-time high to the next – the only thing is,volatility is conspicuously low, despite the absence of a consistently robust economic andpolitical backdrop.What’s the story for banks and savings banks? Interest rate risk remains at an elevated level. Inreal estate business, there are budding signs that institutions are softening their credit standards.Our low-interest-rate survey likewise points to an increase in risk propensity. One-third of smalland medium-sized German credit institutions are planning to increase their business volume andrisk taking. However, they do not wish to increase their capital to the same extent – in themedium term, that will erode their resilience.As we all know, one swallow does not make a summer. Not just that, taking on more risk, in and 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
of itself, isn’t a problem, not yet at least – after all, managing risk is the raison d’être of creditinstitutions. I am still at ease right now, because the stress tests we conducted as part of thelow-interest-rate survey show that more than 95% of banks would satisfy the broadly basedcapital requirements even in crisis scenarios.And yet caution is warranted on two counts. For one thing, banks and savings banks need tometiculously check whether they have tabs on the effects of the risks in their portfolios and canhandle them when a crisis strikes. For another, taking on more risk – be it through portfolio shiftsor extending the balance sheet – does nothing to resolve structural issues. At best, it will provideshort-lived respite from earnings problems.4. Credit institutions need to be open-minded to new forms of value creationAnd that brings me to my third theory. If banks and savings banks are to fix their earningsproblems once and for all, they will need to tap new sources of income and be open-minded tonew forms of value creation. And I dare say that simply hiking the prices for existing serviceswon’t go far enough. Especially if competitors don’t follow suit.I have little time for overblown forecasts predicting that banks and savings banks will all bereplaced by fintechs in the future. Hugely successful though Amazon has been, town centres arestill abuzz with shoppers. As ubiquitous as smartphones are nowadays, people continue to sendletters – but mail firms need to evolve to make up for the downturn in postal business, forexample, by delivering parcels sent by online mail order companies.I firmly believe that credit institutions will continue to exist in the future – but only the ones whichare willing and in a position to embrace change.No-one can say for sure what banking business will look like some years hence. Institutions cancounter this uncertainty by exploring what it is that customers – both legacy and new ones –actually want; and also by harnessing the digital expertise of fintechs instead of regarding themas some kind of nemesis.Take a look at customers and you’ll see that, millennials notwithstanding, there is more than onetype of customer out there. Plenty of people still prefer to bank via traditional channels. It’s justthat their share will continue to dwindle – making structural change an increasingly pressing topicfor institutions.I would also recommend harnessing the benefits of swarm intelligence. Open banking systems –arrangements where banks open up their data to trusted fintech partners which then provideapps for bank customers – are increasingly catching on, meaning that there is scope for new feemodels and for boosting customer satisfaction.Open banking systems do have their risks, though – in this case, cyber risks. I am pleased tonote that our low-interest-rate survey shows that institutions are planning to step up investment inthis field – but at present many of them are still vulnerable. This is a hugely important topic to mebecause I feel it is still being neglected. We intend to increasingly probe the extent to which creditinstitutions can handle cyber attacks.Yet at the same time, supervisors are keen to take account of the competitive environment. TheSingle Supervisory Mechanism, of which we are a member, today released a consultation onguides concerning the assessment of licence applications – and this explicitly also addressesthe question of fintech credit institution licence applications. I urge banks and fintechs to use theconsultation phase constructively. 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
5. Banks and savings banks must become more efficientI come now to the cost side and to the challenge of compensating for declining income throughgreater efficiency.This brings me to my fourth theory: German credit institutions could provide their services moreefficiently. Once again, I would draw your attention to the low-interest-rate survey, whose findingssuggest that small and medium-sized German institutions are expecting their cost-income ratioto increase. Unfortunately, this puts German credit institutions at the bottom of the Europeanleague.If the cost-income ratio remains poor because of a failure to significantly bring downadministrative costs, then more has to be done. An optimist would therefore hope that the onlyreason why the numbers remain unsatisfactory is that the banks and savings banks are busyinvesting in things such as new IT infrastructure, better risk management systems and moreefficient processes. I fully support those institutions which are doing just that, but I have to saythat there are still many institutions which are not.And I am talking here about all three pillars of the German banking system, although perhaps notto the same extent in each case. We point out these differences in our conversations with thesector associations, and I hope that what we tell them sinks in, because differences candefinitely be a sign that more has to be done in some quarters than in others.Banks and savings banks will have to become even more efficient, and they will have to do so ina new, tougher regulatory environment. What I am getting at here is that the regulatoryframework cannot be loosened so as to allow inefficient institutions to kick structural change intothe long grass.I readily admit that credit institutions incur costs because of regulation and oversight. But a bankor savings bank which cannot survive in an effective regulatory and supervisory environmentneeds to urgently rethink its business model.It goes without saying that adapting to the new regulatory requirements is a mammoth task, andthe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory reforms which have yet to be put in place is clearly aproblem. What will Basel III bring with it, and what will it mean for banks in the EU?This is why we are making every effort to complete Basel III without creating excessive burdens.Once that has been done, Basel III should, as far as possible, be implemented in a way that iscommitted to the Basel rules.But there is one thing we must ensure: namely, that we remain true to the original intention of theBasel Accords: to provide global rules for global credit institutions. For all the others, I would liketo see appropriately gradated rules. This is something which we can achieve by means ofthe CRR and CRD: by applying smart threshold values, below which simplified rules apply, andby putting in place a separate oversight regime for the smaller institutions, what is referred to asthe “Small Banking Box”, which we are currently lobbying for in Brussels.6. Not even mergers shield institutions from structural changeLadies and gentlemen, regulation must not and never will be an instrument of structural policy.That is something which the market players need to decide among themselves. And this bringsme to my final theory, which is that mergers and takeovers will not make banks and savingsbanks immune to structural change.Many commentators believe that fierce competition in the German banking sector makes furtherconsolidation inevitable, and I for one share that view.1 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The forms which consolidation takes will be determined by customer behaviour and the banks’response to that behaviour. Capacity reduction by existing institutions is likely to play a major partin this.The specific question which we have to ask is therefore, will there be more mergers and, if so,can they alleviate the problems associated with structural change?Again, our low-interest-rate survey provides some interesting insights: about one in every nine ofthe nearly 1,600 institutions which took part in the survey are already in the process of mergingwith another institution or have specific plans to do so. And a similar number of institutions think ita plausible proposition that they could be taken over as part of a merger in the next five years.But I wish to warn against unrealistic expectations: there are numerous examples of mergerswhich have failed. This is because, for a merger to succeed, a number of important conditionshave to be fulfilled. For example, there have to be sustainable synergies in the business modelsor in regional coverage.There is no exhaustive list of factors which determine success, nor is there a blueprint forsuccess. German institutions must therefore perform a comprehensive health check in order todetect avoidable problems at an early stage.Even where mergers are successful, however, new opportunities for value creation do not comeabout automatically, and customer needs are not automatically better served.7. ConclusionsLadies and gentlemen, an animal that tries to resist evolutionary change because it is notcongenial risks becoming another animal’s dinner. Similarly, technological progress changesvalue creation in the banking sector. There is no escaping this simple truth. Adapt or die.It is undeniable that monetary policy and regulation are currently having major side effects on thebanking sector, but we cannot allow these side effects to blind us to the uncomfortable fact that itis precisely the new, creative and innovative forces that are destroying existing structures in thebanking sector.Every bank and every savings bank must ask itself if it wants to be part of the creative force, partof the new structures, or part of a ruined structure. I dare to suggest that most of you wish tobelong to the first group. Do you believe that it is possible without taking courageous decisions?Without risky decisions? Or without unpopular decisions? I do not.Creative decisions presuppose creative questions: questions which show the world in a newlight. In Germany’s banking landscape, the questions which are being asked are all too oftenframed in a decades-old mould of thinking. So, to misquote title of a song by German singer InaDeter, perhaps the country needs new bankers?Essentially, it does, because you will not be able to lead your institutions to a new era with the oldthinking. Banks are becoming service providers with banking licences; account holders and bankcustomers are becoming “users” who require a broad spectrum of flexible financial services. So,yes, a new world needs new bankers, or at least experienced bankers who have the courage totake innovative decisions.My challenge to the sector is therefore to perform a mental demolition of established institutionswherever necessary and to rebuild them on green-field sites. Today’s banks will only besuccessful tomorrow if they have enough new bankers, or take new decisions.I will be pleased to take your questions and hear your comments.1 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches

Benoît Cœuré: The use of local currencies in EU canddate andpotential candidate countriesSpeech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe International Conference on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Central Bank ofBosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, 22 September 2017.*   *   *Dear Governor,Dear Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,Dear Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina,Dear Ambassador,Dear colleagues from the central banks,Ladies and gentlemen,I am delighted to be here in Sarajevo today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Central Bankof Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH). I would like to thank Governor Softić for the invitation tospeak to you on this occasion.When the CBBH was founded in 1997, people in western Europe were still paying with theirnational currencies. The ECB did not yet exist and there had not even been a decision on whichcountries would eventually participate in monetary union from its launch. For a European centralbanker, this almost feels like ancient history. The past 20 years have been too hectic, too excitingand too eventful to fully appreciate the passage of time.So significant birthdays are always a welcome opportunity to take a step back and consider whathas worked and what has not. And for the CBBH, like for many other central banks, there canonly be one yardstick to measure success: the achievement of monetary stability, the primaryobjective of the CBBH. And looking back over the past 20 years, you clearly have delivered onyour mandate. By effectively implementing the currency board arrangement, you created trustand confidence in the currency and you were able to secure this confidence over time. I wouldlike to congratulate the past and present management and all staff of the CBBH for this successover the past 20 years.Your achievements are particularly remarkable when seen in the light of the challenges you havefaced in implementing the monetary framework. A small, open economy like Bosnia andHerzegovina, where total merchandise trade accounts for more than two-thirds of nominal GDP,is constantly exposed to foreign shocks that are often hard to anticipate. This is a demandingenvironment for central banks, in particular when several shocks hit the economy at the sametime, as has been the case in recent years. In fact, it is probably fair to say that the globaleconomy was in almost constant flux following the outbreak of the financial crisis ten years ago.Here in Europe, of course, and in the euro area in particular, we faced significant challenges thatrequired unprecedented action by central banks and governments.So the current resilience and broad-based strengthening of the global economy represents awelcome change for policymakers, here and in many other parts of the world. An increasingnumber of economies, across both advanced and emerging markets, are benefiting from therecovery. Unemployment has fallen to pre-crisis levels in many countries. And the broadstabilisation of oil prices has reduced the strong disinflationary pressures that were puttingadditional downside pressure on headline inflation at a time of economic hardship in many 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
regions around the globe.The euro area too is now contributing to global growth, rather than subtracting from it, in largepart thanks to the range of monetary policy measures taken by the ECB in recent years. This iscertainly good news for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where exports to the euro area account formore than half of total exports.Making the cyclical recovery sustainableAt the same time, the current global cyclical recovery also harbours risks – risks of complacencyand inaction. Despite the encouraging upturn in growth and the shift in consumer and investorsentiment, some of the more fundamental obstacles to sustainable growth have notdisappeared. In the euro area, for example, there is still considerable scope in all Member Statesto improve the range of economic, social and legal frameworks that shape the conditions inwhich households and businesses operate. We should not allow ourselves to succumb to thefalse impression that the current cyclical recovery will heal all wounds.Deep-seated structural reforms are needed to boost potential growth, raise productivity, increaseresilience to shocks and, ultimately, foster sustainable real convergence among Member States.In a speech in Brussels a few months ago, I highlighted the clear empirical relationship in Europebetween the quality of institutions and GDP per capita.For more information, see B. Cœuré (2017), “Convergence matters for monetary policy”, speechat the Competitiveness Research Network (CompNet) conference, Brussels, 30 June.This means that sustainable growth requires unfailing policy efforts to ensure that our institutionsare fit for purpose.In a globalised world, where we are more likely than not to be directly affected by the actions ofothers, this is probably true for all countries, whether inside or outside the euro area or the EU.What the EU offers, however, is a framework to overcome common global challenges together,as long as all Member States play by the rules. For candidate and potential candidate countriesthis means that adopting suitable economic and legal structures and putting in place theappropriate institutions in good time will allow many of the benefits of EU membership to befrontloaded.This also applies to central banking. The ECB, and in fact the entire European System of CentralBanks (ESCB), supports central banks in the region on their path towards joining the EU. Whilethe ECB plays no formal role in the EU accession process, it contributes in its areas ofcompetence. As you know, we maintain close relations with central banks in candidate andpotential candidate countries, which will eventually become part of the ESCB and later theEurosystem.Through technical cooperation, we also support central banks in building and enhancinginstitutional capacity. This may take the form of EU-funded programmes, twinnings with ESCBnational central banks or regional workshops and seminars hosted by the ECB. The CBBH wasone of the first beneficiaries of such technical cooperation in the region through EU-funded andECB-coordinated programmes in 2007 and 2010–11. These programmes also involved manyEU national central banks and are remembered as being very successful.In addition, the ECB contributes to the assessment of the Economic Reform Programmes ofcandidate and potential candidate countries as part of the EU’s economic and financial dialoguewith applicants. Here the ECB naturally focuses on monetary and exchange rate policies andfinancial stability. Our views then feed into the joint conclusions of the economic and financialdialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey.1 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
This year the ECB recommended that countries take five main actions: (i) adopt and implementcomprehensive non-performing loan (NPL) resolution strategies; (ii) strengthen the use of localcurrencies; (iii) expand the analytical and policy toolkits of central banks; (iv) reinforce themedium-term orientation of fiscal policies; and, finally, (v) improve the overall business andinstitutional environment, with a view to reducing external vulnerabilities, among other things.Many of these recommendations also apply to current EU Member States, as I alluded to before.In particular, low productivity, together with large stocks of NPLs and sovereign debt, remain adrag on growth in large parts of the euro area. Also with respect to the third recommendation, onexpanding the policy toolkit of central banks, the ECB is no exception. The environment of lowinterest rates and low inflation forces us to constantly review and upgrade our analytical toolkit toensure we take the best possible decisions in our pursuit of price stability.See also Draghi, M. (2017), “The interdependence of research and policymaking”, speech at theLindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, Lindau, Germany, 23 August.Unofficial euroisation as a policy challengeLet me therefore spend a few minutes on the one recommendation that is specific to candidateand potential candidate countries, albeit not uniformly to all, namely that the use of localcurrencies be strengthened.As you know, the high degree of unofficial euroisation is a striking feature of the banking systemsin the Western Balkans. In the region as a whole, on average 56% of total loans and 52% of totaldeposits are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, in most cases the euro.Mid-2017 data. For further details, see the special feature on “Unofficial euroisation in CESEEcountries” in the International role of the euro, ECB, 2017, pp. 45–49.This phenomenon, also known as currency substitution, is driven by many factors, such as lowconfidence in the domestic currency, which is often the result of not-so-distant memories ofmonetary instability.Another factor relates to the fact that the risk premium on loans in the domestic currency ishigher, thereby providing an incentive to take out foreign currency loans. Lower funding costs, inturn, are often supported through strong integration with the euro area via trade and financialchannels, but also via migration and remittances, which contribute to the holding of bankdeposits in euro. All this is conducive to widespread unofficial “euroisation”.But a high degree of foreign currency use also has serious drawbacks. For example, unofficialeuroisation, while being a sign of trust in the euro as a stable store of value, constitutes afinancial stability risk in the event of sudden and substantial exchange rate fluctuations.Households and firms may suddenly no longer be able to service their foreign currency-denominated debt, creating credit risk for banks. The same holds true for dollarisation in otherparts of the world, as the Asian financial crisis vividly demonstrated.Unofficial euroisation also impedes monetary policy transmission and may limit the overall roomfor manoeuvre of monetary policy. In Albania and Serbia, for instance, where central banks haveadopted inflation-targeting frameworks, exchange rate flexibility remains relatively limited aspolicymakers are mindful of adverse balance sheet effects resulting from sudden and substantialexchange rate fluctuations. In countries that have opted to stabilise the exchange rate in the firstplace, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, maintaining the credibility of the framework remainscentral to keeping financial stability risks contained.Prospective EU countries that have their own legal tender and monetary policy have recognisedthese risks and constraints, and are thus making efforts to promote the use of the local currency,23 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
in line with the ECB’s recommendations. This is certainly not an easy task. Success cruciallyhinges upon the track record of the domestic monetary authority in maintaining monetarystability. To this end, central banks in the region have made laudable progress in recent years.Efforts need to be channelled towards extending this track record.History teaches us that central banks’ success in sustainably maintaining confidence in thecurrency critically hinges on two elements: political independence and a clear mandate. TheECB was successfully built on these principles. Independence and a clear stability-orientedmandate ensure that central banks are not overburdened with pursuing other, potentiallyconflicting objectives, and that monetary policy makes the best possible contribution to growthand employment. They are therefore also a necessary condition for strengthening the use oflocal currencies.Experience in other regions of the world – in Latin America, for example – suggests that targetedprudential measures as well as deeper local capital markets in domestic currency can reinforcethe use of local currencies.Windischbauer, U. (2016), “Strengthening the role of local currencies in EU candidate andpotential candidate countries”, Occasional Paper Series, No 170, ECB, April.Such advances should ideally be embedded in a carefully designed comprehensive strategyinvolving all relevant stakeholders. Serbia adopted such strategies in 2012, and Albania has doneso more recently, while other countries have started to put in place measures of this nature orare considering designing similar strategies.So progress is clearly visible, in particular on the lending side, but more remains to be done.There are certainly no quick fixes, as currency substitution tends to be a sticky phenomenon. Butthe drawbacks of unofficial euroisation deserve policymakers’ attention. The expectation thatcountries will at some point join the EU, and eventually also the euro area, should not divertattention from such policy efforts.ConclusionRemaining challenges, however, should not distract from past achievements. So let meconclude by congratulating you once more on the impressive track record that the CBBH hasbuilt up over the past 20 years.The ECB will continue to offer technical cooperation and advice whenever possible, and we willaccompany you and other central banks in the Western Balkans on your journey towards the EU.We look forward to our future work with colleagues from the region, including you, GovernorSoftić, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish you and your colleagues all thebest for the next 20 years and beyond.Thank you for your attention.For more information, see B.

Page 1 of 10    Keynote address by Lesetja Kganyago,  Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,  at SAICA’s Courageous Conversation Session  Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, Johannesburg 26 September 2017  Sovereign rating downgrades and their impact on the poor  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.   The sovereign ratings of South Africa, which are the key theme of my speech this evening, have been a prominent concern for policymakers and investors alike in recent years, and will again feature heavily in policy discussions as the year-end approaches. Following the gradual and regular improvement in our country’s sovereign ratings from the advent of democracy to the mid-2000s, which saw South Africa regain investment-grade status, South Africa’s credit standing has again deteriorated in recent years.   Both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rating agencies started downgrading South Africa in 2012; this process culminated in the loss of investment-grade status (for foreign-currency debt) in 2016 with two of the three major rating agencies. Further reviews of South Africa’s ratings are due before year-end. Our growth and fiscal performance, in particular, are therefore under a high degree of international scrutiny at present.  
Page 2 of 10  The financial market and policy implications of rating downgrades are well documented, ranging from difficulties in getting non-resident investors to finance the current account deficit, through a greater volatility of financial markets, to higher costs of borrowing for the sovereign. What many people are less familiar with are the implications for the public at large, for incomes and inequality, and in particular for the lower-income segment of the population. These are the points that I would like to discuss this evening.   The general public, in particular the poorer households, may wonder how a rating downgrade can directly affect their daily lives. After all, poor people do not borrow overseas; they do not run businesses that are dependent on financing by foreign investors; they rarely travel overseas; they do not directly hold shares in listed companies.   Some voices, indeed, may go further and say that South Africa’s government should not pay excessive attention to the decisions of foreign-based rating agencies. These voices may argue that the decisions of rating agencies mostly affect wealthy individuals and have limited bearings on the economic well-being of the poorer majority. Let me explain why such thoughts are misguided.  Irrespective of its direct implications, a sovereign rating downgrade does have indirect impacts on all the citizens of the country. These can be felt harder by the poorer households who, unlike the wealthier ones, do not have the possibility of ‘hedging themselves’ from the consequences of a downgrade by diversifying their assets. There are five major channels through which the recent rating downgrades can undermine the well-being of poorer households, which I will discuss more in detail. 
Page 3 of 10   The ratings of a listed entity (be it a government or a corporation) are meant to reflect its ‘credit quality’. Hence, they are used by international investors to gauge the risk of buying the bonds issued by that entity. In theory, therefore, these investors will – subsequent to a downgrade – require a premium in the form of a higher interest rate, or they will shun these bonds altogether. South Africa requires foreign investors to finance its external deficit (as its imports regularly exceed its exports). A rating downgrade therefore means that financial markets will move to a new equilibrium where the interest rates on bonds are higher and the exchange rate of the rand is weaker than before the downgrade.   Obviously, the recent empirical evidence is clouded by the fact that many other factors, bar sovereign ratings, influence the price of South African financial assets. Nonetheless, a standard measure of sovereign credit risk for South Africa, namely the credit default swap (CDS) spread, has underperformed compared to its emerging-market peers in recent years, and is now trading at similar levels to non-investment-grade countries. This is clear evidence that investors are requiring a higher risk premium, if only in relative terms, on South African government debt. The increase in the yield on inflation-linked bonds issued by National Treasury, over the past two to three years, is another such indication. Even after being fully protected against inflation, bond investors require a higher return – even as global economic factors have continued to depress risk-free, real interest rates all over the world.   These higher yields on South African bonds will, over time, negatively affect the poor. As the South African government faces a higher cost of borrowing, it will have to devote a larger share of its (finite) resources to 
Page 4 of 10  servicing debt. Already, estimates by National Treasury indicate that government debt-servicing costs are expected to represent 10.4% of total budget spending (and 3.5% of GDP1) in 2017/18, up from a low of 7.0% in 2009/10. This stands in contrast to the years prior to the global financial crisis, when the improvement to South Africa’s credit rating coincided with a gradual decline in the share of public spending devoted to servicing debt.   In turn, when debt-servicing costs rise faster than the overall budget, the amount of money available for other missions – especially those of utmost importance to the poor, like public health, education, infrastructure, and social services – is reduced. Across the world, countries with the lowest creditworthiness and with the most difficult access to international market financing are generally those with the poorest Human Development Indices. To a large extent, poor households ‘pay’ for the low credit quality of their sovereign.   Some may argue that, faced with higher debt-servicing costs, there are policy alternatives to curbing redistributive government expenditure, such as increasing public borrowing or raising taxes on higher-income households. However, these alternatives are probably not sustainable in the long run. Simply adding to borrowing would most likely, over time, prompt further downgrades, raise interest rates, and threaten a financial crisis. From 26% of GDP just before the global financial crisis, South Africa’s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 52% in the current financial year, even without including contingent liabilities. (This is, effectively, a doubling of the ratio in less than 10 years.) From what was                                                            1 gross domestic product 
Page 5 of 10  a relatively low level by emerging-market standards in the 2000s, South Africa’s debt-to-GDP ratio has moved to a relatively high position, which could – if continued – reduce our country’s relative attractiveness to global investors.  Equally, raising taxes on higher-income households and corporations, in a country where the tax system is already fairly progressive (and the tax burden, at least by emerging-market standards, relatively high), could undermine the already anaemic pace of economic growth or trigger capital outflows. For the state to effectively help the poor, it needs maximum fiscal space, and that means (among other things) well-managed public finances and sustainable debt burdens. This also has key repercussions for monetary policy’s ability to best contribute to sustainable long-term economic growth. In the event that public finances keep deteriorating, a country can experience ‘fiscal dominance’ – when the central bank’s interest rate policy is primarily dictated by the need to ensure adequate financing of the budget deficit at the expense of other, real, economic considerations. It is easy to see how this can be a suboptimal outcome from the point of view of economic development.  Fortunately, these difficult trade-offs have to be made by duly elected representatives of the people of South Africa. As the South African Reserve Bank, we only look at what the implications of these are for monetary policy.  Furthermore, a rating downgrade will not only affect the price of government debt; it will also affect what is paid by all the other bond issuers in the country – raising, for instance, the cost of issuing and servicing debt for banks and state-owned utilities. To maintain profitability, 
Page 6 of 10  it is likely that banks will pass on these higher costs to their customers, in the form of higher rates on loans or higher bank fees or lower interest rates paid on deposits. In fact, higher funding costs for banks may be one of the reasons why the spreads between bank lending rates and the repurchase rate as well as deposit rates have widened since the global financial crisis. With many low-income households relying on cash loans for meeting their subsistence needs (often at already-high rates) or using bank deposits as a major form of savings, one can easily see how higher borrowing costs of banks can penalise them. Equally, if a state-owned utility like Eskom is forced to pay higher interest rates on its debt, such costs are likely to ultimately be passed through to their customers – in the form of higher electricity tariffs, including for poorer households.  Separately, South Africa’s domestic savings are insufficient to meet its investment needs. Offshore borrowing is therefore required to fund growth and development. So, any downgrade in sovereign ratings is bound, sooner or later, to have negative consequences for the exchange rate of the rand. This, too, can potentially harm the poorer households.   Historically, because of the openness of the South African economy, a depreciation of the exchange rate has tended to raise inflation. In turn, a higher rate of inflation hits the most vulnerable harder, especially people who depend on basic grants which only get adjusted once a year at most. In particular, food prices and transportation costs rise on the back of rand depreciation. This reflects one of two things: either the need to import some of these goods (for instance petrol, which will over time affect the prices of public and collective transport) or linkages between the prices of foodstuffs and those of agricultural commodities on the global market. These items account for a larger part of total expenses for the poorer 
Page 7 of 10  households. For example, according to calculations by Statistics South Africa, food and non-alcoholic beverages account for 48% of consumption expenses for the 10% poorest households, compared with a weight of only 17% for the whole population.  The impact of a rating downgrade on financial markets may also have more direct implications for the poor than generally assumed. As mentioned earlier, poor households do not directly hold share portfolios, but some – in particular, older people who worked for a while in the public or private sector – rely on payments from pension or provident funds as their main, if not sole, source of income. If the value of financial assets declines, the money available in these pension and provident pools will shrink accordingly. Separately, research shows that some of the savings vehicles typically used by poor people, such as stokvels, are gradually being invested in financial assets to create wealth rather than being used solely for short-term purposes (such as, for instance, to cover funeral costs).2 Again, any drop in the value of these financial assets would undermine the efforts aimed at creating wealth through such savings vehicles.  Finally, rating downgrades cast general doubts on the long-term economic and financial health of a country. This is because downgrades typically weigh on business confidence, undermining companies’ willingness to invest in new productive capacities and boost the size of their workforce. At worst, businesses fearing a worsening economic future may shed jobs, resulting in an overall decline in the number of employment opportunities throughout the country. In South Africa, unemployment exceeds 27% of                                                            2 See ‘Investments in stokvels gaining ground’ published on the Fin24 website on 9 July 2014. 
Page 8 of 10  the workforce, while the ability to find a job often provides the main chance to escape poverty for an individual and his or her family. Declining job opportunities would therefore risk aggravating the incidence of such poverty.  Arguably, many of the channels described above operate through investor sentiment and financial asset prices, including the exchange rate of the rand. One can therefore argue that so far, in particular since the latest rating downgrades, the reaction of financial markets has been rather benign. For instance, the yield on the 10-year South African government bond is still close to the average of the past five years, and the 5-year CDS spread on South African sovereign debt is around its lowest since late 2014. As for the rand, it has recovered by about 20% on a trade-weighted basis from the lows it had reached in early 2016.  Yet this relative stability is fragile, dependent on developments that may reverse in the not-too-distant future. The lack of a strong sell-off in either the rand or local bonds has more to do with a conjunction of favourable international factors than with investors downplaying the possible negative consequences of a downgrade. In particular, the factors referred to are the improvements in global economic developments, the absence of inflationary pressures in the advanced economies, and a still-accommodative stance by the world’s major central banks. These factors have ensured that capital continues to flow to the emerging world, even to countries which have experienced a deterioration in their creditworthiness. But these flows could easily reverse. And amid tighter global financial conditions, investors would be more likely to differentiate between stronger and weaker sovereign credits. Should South Africa face another global shock, like it did during the 2008-09 global recession, its 
Page 9 of 10  recent rating downgrades could well make it more vulnerable to that shock.   Admittedly, some commentators claim that further downgrades to South Africa’s sovereign ratings would not starve the country of foreign capital, as other investors – specifically, funds of a more speculative nature – would still buy domestic financial assets. However, apart from the fact that these investors would require a higher return on South African assets than recent historical norms, their investments would be more short-term in nature, most likely resulting in a higher volatility of market prices. This, in turn, would increase the climate of uncertainty facing domestic businesses, with negative consequences for fixed investment, job creation, and therefore poverty and inequality.  In conclusion, let me say that a sovereign rating is not a policy goal per se. Rather, it is a reflection of a broad range of economic, social, and political factors that constitute the creditworthiness of a country. Key among these factors is the strength of our institutions, including the Chapter 9 institutions, the judiciary, and the South African Reserve Bank. These institutions underpin our democracy and our creditworthiness. It is this creditworthiness that policymakers should strive to improve, for goals that include development and poverty reduction. As international experience shows, it is failure to generate sufficient economic growth and to maintain healthy fiscal and external balances that keeps large portions of a country’s population in poverty. For South Africa’s economy to become stronger and more resilient, and to make inroads into poverty, we need not only to avoid further downgrades; we should also ensure that the recent downgrades are eventually reversed.

Vítor Constâncio: Macroprudential stress-tests and tools for thenon-bank sectorRemarks by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the EuropeanSystemic Risk Board (ESRB) Annual Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2017.*   *   *1. Introduction: Systemic risks in the non-bank sectorAssessing the impact of a large shock on financial soundness of non-bank financial institutions,stress testing can improve measurement of the risks and can help in the calibration ofinstruments mitigating those risks. There is a need to further develop these policy tools while atthe same time adaptation of stress test models towards integrating different agents into asystem-wide tool is important. The ESRB – in its strategy paper on macroprudential policybeyond banking, for example, emphasises the need to develop a wider financial stability toolkit,including top-down stress tests, for example, for asset managers, the need to operationalisemacroprudential instruments for which a legal basis has already been created or the need toinvestigate the potential for increasing the consistency of available macroprudential instrumentsacross sectors. In its report on stress test analytics for macroprudential purposes in the euroarea, the ECB also outlines the plans for extending stress testing into other sectors, mostprominently the shadow banking sector, but also into the stress testing of central counterpartiesand insurance and pension funds.Let me first set the stage by reiterating the two main systemic risks stemming from the non-bankfinancial sector.First, the increasing size and growth of the euro area investment fund sector has the potential toamplify financial stability risks, both in terms of liquidity and leverage. As an example of thestructural change in the European financial sector, it is worthwhile noting that the size of themoney market and investment fund sector represented only 17% of banks’ total assets in 2008but is now at 40%. Whereas the banking sector shrank by 18% since the crisis, the fund sectormore than doubled since 2008.The continued inflows into bond funds for example, may raise concerns about suddenredemptions in response to a more widespread repricing in global fixed income markets, if itwere to occur. Large redemption calls can have widespread amplification effects in financialmarkets. There are signs that fixed income investment funds have increased their risk taking inrecent years via a higher asset allocation to lower-rated debt securities and an increasedduration in their fixed income portfolios. At the same time, there is evidence that redemptionpatterns can be procyclical, which can foster adverse market dynamics when asset prices aredeclining.Second, the procyclical nature of margin and haircut-setting practices of market participants andliquidity risk propagation in collateralised securities financing and derivatives transactions is aconcern for financial stability. These practices stimulate the build-up of excessive leverage andfunding risk in good times, while amplifying funding stress and deleveraging in bad times.Collateralised transactions, while limiting counterparty risk, have the potential to amplify fundingliquidity risk or market risk via fire sales in a stress scenario. The resulting propagation of riskmay be material and potentially of systemic nature. Non-bank financial institutions can be part ofthe risk transmission mechanism, in particular, since they do not have recourse to central bankliquidity.123 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
2. Macroprudential stress test to gauge the magnitude of the risks stemming from thenon-bank financial sectorSo the questions arise: how to appropriately measure these risks and how to derive policyinstruments that are effective in mitigating these risks? What are the challenges formacroprudential stress tests to provide meaningful indicators to measure and predict the level ofsystemic risk, the position of the economy in the financial cycle and consequently the adequatestance of macroprudential policies?In recent years, stress testing has become an increasingly prominent approach to gaugingimpact of a large shock on the agents’ financial soundness and on the market functioning.Developed originally for assessing banking system resilience, macroprudential stress tests haverecently been extended to cover a wider range of non-bank financial institutions: let me mentioninsurance companies (conducted by EIOPA), CCPs (conducted by ESMA) and asset managers.This more recent development is largely reflecting the increasing importance of non-bankfinancial institutions within the EU financial system.However, stress testing tools for non-banks are still in a fledgling state, in particular in how theycapture system-wide effects. Let me elaborate on what needs to be improved to operationalisethem.First and foremost, in order to conduct proper stress test analysis for the non-bank financialsector, data availability needs to be significantly improved. A successful application of thesystem-wide stress test models hinges upon availability of reliable data sources for modelcalibration and validation. In general, the availability of sufficiently granular and historical dataseries for the non-bank financial sector is still lagging behind the situation on the banking side.These concerns notwithstanding, it should be acknowledged that data availability is improving insome areas following some important initiatives of financial regulators and overseers. In Europe,trade repository reporting under EMIR is one example that can shed light on interconnectednessvia derivative markets. Another European initiative to improve information about SFT should golive in Q1 2019 with the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) transactionreporting obligation.Furthermore, ad hoc, targeted data collections can help improve the calibration of stress testingmodels and inform further required changes to the regular financial reporting. If properlyconstructed, such ad hoc data collections can provide deep insights into potential shocktransmission channels. I would like to stress that the research community can offer usefuladvice on relevant data dimensions in this regard and therefore should be actively involved indesigning such data collection templates.As far as the second enhancement is concerned, existing non-bank stress test approaches needto better account for interactions between agents. We know from experience that the impact of astress test event hitting a financial institution is often amplified via its interactions with the rest ofthe financial system. Therefore, failing to account for such interactions may risk overestimatingthe resilience of single institutions and the system as a whole. Some extensions to the traditionalstress testing have already been operationalised, at least for the banking system. I would like toemphasise the inclusion of strategic behaviour (e.g. balance sheet portfolio optimisation inSTAMP€ analytical framework of the ECB), game theoretical approaches to handle strategicresponses to shocks and activity of other market participants (e.g. in the MFRAF stress testingframework of Bank of Canada), network effects capturing interlinkages (e.g. in the RAMSIframework of Bank of England or the ECB top-down stress test model) or feedback loops withthe real economy (e.g. DSGE models in STAMP€).45678 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Third, as their business models and behaviour differ from traditional banks, specificities of non-bank financial institutions have to be considered carefully when designing tools to stress them.Both the policy and academic communities are looking into ways to enhance stress testingmodels for macroprudential policy. STAMP€ is one example. Let me mention a few othersfocusing on integrating behaviours of different types of agents and on analysing the increasingpool of data. One enhancement is about fire sales mechanisms stemming from interactionsbetween banks and shadow banks. Another example worth mentioning is about systemicaspects of liquidity and its links with solvency conditions accounting for pertinent interactionsbetween market participants captured in an agent-based modelling fashion. Though, what isstill required is further strong support from the research community to provide theoreticalfoundations for the various components of the stress test apparatus.3. Macroprudential tools to address the risk stemming from the non-bank sectorDespite these limitations, we should also note the progress made in understanding how stresstesting exercises, in particular, have the potential to support macroprudential policy in the design,calibration and assessment of the impact of macroprudential tools.Let me now turn to the state of play regarding the implementation and progress made for someof the specific macroprudential instruments that authorities would need, should systemic risksmaterialise.On the global level, the 2017 FSB policy recommendations on asset management structuralvulnerabilities, now being operationalised by IOSCO, are expected to reduce liquiditymismatches in open-ended funds. Importantly, recommendation 8 captures the potentialmacroprudential role for authorities to provide direction on the use of liquidity risk managementtools (e.g. suspension of redemptions) by funds in extraordinary circumstances. In the area ofliquidity mismatch, the recommendations also address the potential use of system-wide stresstesting by authorities. Leverage recommendations focus on the measurement and monitoring ofleverage within investment funds, including data for synthetic leverage calculation.On the European level, on-going work of the Expert Group on Investment Funds (EGIF) developsrecommendations that are addressed to funds and asset managers. Given that the investmentfund sector is growing relative to the financial system as a whole, the ESRB is analysingsystemic risks posed by liquidity mismatch and leverage in the types of investment fundsexposed to these risks.To highlight the importance of this work, let me preview results of an ECB Occasional Paper tobe published soon. The study shows, for a large sample of European Alternative InvestmentFunds (AIFs), that open-ended leveraged funds experience greater investor outflows after badperformance than unleveraged funds.This can be explained by investors expecting proportionally larger valuation losses whenremaining invested in leveraged funds. During stressed periods, leveraged funds need to de-lever proportionality more than unleveraged funds in order to obtain liquidity to cover margin callsand higher haircuts on leveraged positions. Also, leveraged funds have to sell relatively moreassets following redemption requests to keep the leverage ratio constant. To the extent theseasset sales impact market prices or are sold at fire sale prices, the net asset value of theportfolio declines.These new findings on the greater vulnerability of leveraged funds to potential investor runssupport the idea that mismatches between the portfolio liquidity and redemption terms ofleveraged funds are undesirable for more leveraged funds from a macroprudential perspective.They also complement existing evidence on the greater sensitivity of investor outflows to badperformance in illiquid versus liquid funds, which can be explained by higher liquidation costs for9101112 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
less liquid assets.Within the EU, competent authorities already have legal powers to impose macroprudentialleverage limits on AIFs, such as hedge funds, bond funds and funds-of-funds. The ESRB hasmarked the operationalisation of this existing policy tool as a key part of the agenda to developmacroprudential policy beyond banking. Achieving this goal is important and may require anEU-level framework to assess financial stability risks related to leverage in the investment fundsector and to evaluate potential designs for macroprudential leverage limits.For risks in SFT and derivatives, as I have laid in a keynote speech at a dedicated conferencelast year here at the ESRB, I am convinced that macroprudential margins and haircuts aretools that have the potential to allow authorities to control the build-up of excessive leverage inthese markets. Importantly, these tools can reach beyond the banking system and also addressthe build-up of leverage and liquidity risks in parts of the financial system, where we have seenrapid growth in recent years.Since then, we have made some progress on this front. For example, the ESRB has published acomprehensive report on the macroprudential use of margins and haircuts this year. The reportdescribes in detail the mechanics of how these tools would affect leverage and procyclicality.Nevertheless, the report also acknowledges a number of implementation challenges and calls forfurther empirical and conceptual analysis.So let me conclude by saying that despite the progress made, there is more work to be done: onthe operationalisation of tools, on further improving data or the interaction with the policy andresearch community to enhance stress testing models. I would therefore encourage authorities,including the European Commission, the ESRB but also ESMA to continue to contribute towardsthis goal.Macroprudential policy beyond banking: an ESRB strategy paper.Examples include definitions of leverage, taking into account differences and interdependencies betweensectors or macroprudential instruments, such as instruments that address procylicality of initial margins orhaircuts, especially in securities financing transactions and derivativesStamp€ Report.The need to be able to capture system-wide effects in non-bank stress tests is strongly advocated by e.g.the FSB.J.

Carlos da Silva Costa: Regulatory and supervisory institutionalframeworks in EuropeOpening remarks by Mr Carlos da Silva Costa, Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the SeventhBank of Portugal Conference on Financial Intermediation, Lisbon, 7 July 2017.*   *   *It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th Banco de Portugal Conference on FinancialIntermediation.This conference series has taken place every other year since 2005 (when it was called the“Conference on Financial Fragility and Bank Regulation”). It aims to bring together senior andyoung researchers from academia and central banks to discuss the most recent developmentsin financial intermediation, markets and regulation.Back in 2005, awareness of the challenges ahead in terms of financial stability was alreadyincreasing. Some key topics were becoming important in the theoretical and policy debate:rapid financial innovation in a context of international integration;liquidity management practice and the associated systemic risk;the role of central banks as lenders of last resort; andthe set of problems related to “too big to fail” financial conglomerates. When the international financial crisis began, followed by the European sovereign debt crisis andthe vicious circle linking sovereigns and banks in several countries, these issues became a focalpoint. Many new topics also joined the research agenda, such as:the misuse of the so-called originate-to-distribute model, in particular resorting to complexderivatives and other opaque products;the pro-cyclical nature of the existing capital regulation framework;the adequacy of financial regulation and supervision frameworks. Banks were forced to adapt their business models and management strategies. In particular, thevery low interest rate environment and the unconventional monetary policies conducted by themain central banks dramatically changed the operating environment and the incentives for banksand markets. At present, there are four key issues that in my opinion deserve the attention of policy-makers and researchers:1. The regulatory and supervisory frameworkAn economy’s regulatory framework reflects society’s preferences in terms of risk protection.These preferences evolve over time and in tandem with them the supervisory regulatoryframework.In the aftermath of the recent crisis, the public asked for stricter financial and supervisoryregulations. This led to a significant change in financial regulation, guided by two main concerns:improving financial institutions’ governance models; reducing their degree of risk and creatingcapital buffers to absorb risk, should it materialise. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
But more recently the idea that we have reached a point of overregulation has started to emergein the public debate and consequently proposals for deregulation and arguments for greatersupervision discretion have been put forward. This discretion poses serious problems of transparency and of equal treatment, due to thetemptation to shape the financial system by handing regulatory powers over to supervisoryauthorities. A clear distinction should be made between regulatory and supervisory functions.This segregation is key to ensuring a greater balance of powers and responsibilities, allowingproper accountability.2. Regulatory arbitrageThe financial crisis also showed the limitations of decentralised supervision in a world ofincreasingly integrated financial markets and institutions. We are now in a process of movingfrom a situation in which the regulatory and supervisory frameworks were of nationalcompetence to a situation where there are common rules and in the euro area also a commonsupervisor.A need for greater cross-border integration of financial regulation and supervision emerged fromthe policy debate and motivated the still on-going reform of Basel rules and the creation of theBanking Union in Europe.However, the degree of implementation of the post-crisis global regulatory reform agenda acrosscountries varies significantly, giving rise to regulatory arbitrage. This is reflected in the search forgaps in national legislation that justify avoiding compliance with previous internationalagreements, as well as in the behaviour of the authorities that accommodate specificrequirements, conditions and interests of the major international financial conglomerates.It is very important to identify and assess what the risks and cost of regulatory arbitrage are.3. Regulatory flaws in the European regulationThe current Banking Union framework suffers from a critical weakness: its micro approach tomanaging banking crises disregards the financial stability risks resulting from interventions inailing banks. The current resolution framework does not envisage a credible public backstop andlacks government stabilisation tools. In fact, the framework governing intervention in problematic banks does not take into account thefact that the need to preserve financial stability must always prevail over the specific rules ofintervention in banks. As recent cases illustrate, the European bail-in framework does notexclude bail-out events when financial stability issues (or the public perspective of it) are at stake.In addition, there is also the question of whether the lender of last resort is prepared and willing tolend all the liquidity that is needed when a bank is in distress but is still solvent. Otherwise, thetrigger for a banking failure is not insolvency but illiquidity. Another limitation stems from the rules on MREL (minimum requirement for own funds andeligible liabilities) and TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity), which are good ideas for banks thatare mainly financed in the market, but do not work as expected for banks essentially dependenton deposits. The latter are obliged to go to the markets and to issue debt with high costs that, inall likelihood, will be taken up by other banks, thus creating negative externalities for the stabilityand resilience of the financial system as a whole.This is particularly worrying because it can undermine the construction and sustainability of theBanking Union.  2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
4. Financeable risk and risk that is acceptable to societyBanks take risks as part of their normal activity. However, when such risks are excessive theycan lead to huge losses – not only for banks and their investors, but for the whole economy. Regulation plays a key role in reducing vulnerability and sources of risk and in containing thecosts of financial instability when it arises. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that thehigher the capital required for the banking system, the higher the intermediation cost, decreasingthe credit multiplier. A banking system with minimum risk means a banking system withmaximum cost and, hence, smaller capacity to finance investment. If it is accepted that thefinancial system has to take some risk, regulations must lay down how society should reactwhen risk becomes systemic, for instance, setting out the role of the different stakeholders inthese cases.Regulations should seek to make the financial system safer, but flexible enough to fulfil itsfunction as a driver of economic development while being adaptable to new paradigms, namelyto those resulting from technological innovation. Society’s preferences in terms of financialsecurity are not always consistent with the economy’s financing needs or risks arising frominnovation.I will stop here, resisting the temptation to keep talking about these important and fascinatingissues related to the regulatory and supervisory institutional frameworks in Europe. Let me justwish you a rich and fruitful debate and a very pleasant stay in Sintra.Thank you for your attention. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
  www.bportugal.pt        1    Public Finance Workshop on Fiscal-Structural Reforms Opening Remarks by Banco de Portugal Governor, Carlos da Silva Costa1 Lisbon, 3 July 2017  Good morning ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today to open this workshop on ‘Fiscal-structural reforms: towards economic growth and the sustainability of public finances’. On behalf of Banco de Portugal and the organising team, a very warm welcome to you all!  As you are aware, this workshop, hosted by Banco de Portugal, was organised in the context of the annual meeting away from Frankfurt of the Working Group on Public Finances of the European System of Central Banks. The workshop gathers here today an outstanding group of fiscal experts coming from central banks, fiscal councils, and other national and international institutions.  Let me take this opportunity to reaffirm in particular the importance of fiscal councils and other independent fiscal watchdogs for the pursuit of sound public finances in our countries.  Global economic activity is gradually recovering. However, structural challenges persist in many countries, including low productivity growth, high unemployment, insufficient levels of investment, high public and private indebtedness as well as weaknesses in the financial sector. How can structural reforms help? These reforms are key to improving long-term economic growth prospects and to reducing our economies’ vulnerabilities to future adverse shocks. However, it should also be taken into consideration that they may be associated with some negative effects in the short and medium term, as reform implementation is not without economic and social costs. Structural reforms may be linked to fiscal policies through various channels. This workshop will focus on a specific subset of structural reforms, namely fiscal-structural                                                                         1 Version prepared for presentation. 
  www.bportugal.pt        2   reforms. Fiscal-structural reforms encompass areas like taxation, social security and pension systems, healthcare, education, justice, the institutional framework and public finance management, among others. They should be distinguished from the standard use of discretionary fiscal policy to fulfil short- to medium-term objectives.  The post-crisis period has witnessed a reduction in fiscal imbalances in Europe. However, debt ratios remain at record highs and risks to the sustainability of public finances persist in several countries. Fiscal space for expansionary policies is limited and further consolidation is needed.  Against this background, fiscal-structural reforms gain prominence as an approach to improve the efficiency and quality of public finances. Indeed, if well designed and implemented, they can support inclusive economic growth, ensuring their long-run sustainability.  Notwithstanding their potential benefits, the implementation of effective fiscal-structural reforms faces several tough challenges.  First, they should preferably be part of a broad package of other necessary structural reforms. As such, the assessment of the potential impact on the economy is usually complex and requires a comprehensive approach. The technical expertise to make a correct assessment of the likely effects of reform is paramount for an efficient design.  Second, and closely related to the previous point, the planning of such reforms has to take into account the institutional and legal framework in each country. Indeed, the political decision-making process, the type of government, the existing domestic laws, in particular at constitutional level, and external rules like those included in the Stability and Growth Pact for European Union members, are important aspects to be taken into account. Sometimes, the improvement of this institutional and legal framework is in itself an important prerequisite for the feasibility and success of other reforms.   Third, the technical expertise required for the planning of reforms should have a strong base in the country implementing them, along with ‘national champions’ supporting the reforms on their own merits. Domestic “ownership” is critical. Reforms should never be understood by society as an imposition from abroad, either from the IMF or from the European institutions.   
  www.bportugal.pt        3   Fourth, careful attention needs to be paid to the communication strategy and redistributive mitigation measures. Both are key to ensuring adequate support from the public and to containing populist appeals targeted at those parts of society that are potentially most adversely affected by the reforms. Indeed, some of these reforms may involve long implementation periods, with transitional arrangements, and often lead to changes in the distribution of income and wealth. This may create pockets of discontent in spite of the clear overall benefits for the society. Lack of understanding of these challenges by decision-makers may seriously jeopardise the expected outcomes.  Last but not least, the length of the political cycle often proves insufficient to provide the right incentives for the effective implementation of fiscal-structural reforms. Therefore, broader agreements across the political spectrum, if possible, significantly increase the likelihood of reform success. However, by their nature and especially in those countries most in need of them, such agreements have been quite hard to achieve lately.  All in all, I am convinced that sustainable public finances and better long-run economic performance pose significant challenges that should be tackled without delay. The long-term benefits of structural reforms decided today will far outweigh their short- and medium-term costs, in particular if reforms are appropriately designed in order to mitigate the latter while not jeopardising the former.   Today we have gathered here all the ingredients for a rich and fruitful debate on the topics I have touched upon.   I thank you all for your participation and wish you a very pleasant and constructive workshop. 
  News conference   Page 1/5    Berne, 15 June 2017 Andréa M. Maechler Introductory remarks by Andréa M. Maechler  I will begin by reviewing the situation on the international financial markets. I will then address some developments on the Swiss money and foreign exchange markets – specifically the establishment of SARON as the leading reference rate for interest rate derivatives and the adoption of a global code of conduct for foreign exchange market transactions.  Situation on the financial markets Let me start with developments on the international financial markets.  Overall, positive sentiment has continued to prevail since the beginning of the year. Economic conditions have provided favourable momentum, with data pointing to ongoing recovery in both Europe and the US. Furthermore, companies on both sides of the Atlantic reported solid profits in the first quarter. The principal beneficiaries of these developments have been the equity markets, both in the advanced and the emerging economies (cf. chart 1). Various major equity indices have repeatedly recorded historical highs in the year-to-date period. While the SMI has not yet hit its historical high, it too made substantial gains and recently closed up 8% on the beginning of the year. Heightened political uncertainty has had no lasting effects on the equity markets.  This assertion is borne out in risk perception metrics. Volatility derived from option prices (implied volatility) once again fell substantially. On the US equity market, volatility approached historical lows at times in May and June (cf. chart 2). Heightened political uncertainty has, however, occasionally left its mark on the bond and foreign exchange markets. For instance, demand for highly rated government bonds has remained strong since the start of the year. In addition, despite largely positive economic data, the inflation outlook for the major advanced economies is still muted. As a result, yields on highly rated government bonds have changed only marginally since the beginning of 2017 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Andréa M. Maechler News conference   Page 2/5   and have remained low (cf. chart 3). In Switzerland, too, the yield on ten-year Confederation bonds has remained essentially unchanged.  On the foreign exchange market, the Swiss franc experienced repeated episodes of upward pressure as a result of heightened political uncertainty in Europe. The elections in the Netherlands and France, as well as the UK’s upcoming Brexit negotiations with the EU, generated increased demand for currencies considered particularly safe by investors. After the presidential election in France, the euro strengthened and pressure on the Swiss franc subsided. Since the beginning of the year, the euro has gained around 3%. The Swiss franc is now trading close to where it was at the start of the year, and thus remains significantly overvalued. Despite ongoing normalisation of monetary policy in the US, the dollar has depreciated roughly 5%. Establishment of SARON as reference rate for interest rate derivatives Let me now turn to innovations on the Swiss money market. For some time, efforts have been under way worldwide to reform major reference interest rates such as Libor. These reforms aim to put existing benchmarks on a more solid footing and, where necessary, to develop alternatives. In the case of Libor, these reforms are still ongoing.  In the context of these reforms, a decision has already been made to discontinue the TOIS fixing on the Swiss money market and replace it with SARON at the end of 2017. This is due to the fact that, despite various reform attempts, the volume of transactions underlying the TOIS reference rate has remained too low for efficient price formation. Transaction volume is not expected to be an issue with SARON. Unlike the TOIS fixing, which is calculated using data contributed by a panel of banks, SARON is based on actual market transactions and binding quotes. This fact reinforces trust in SARON and makes it more attractive as a reference rate for all money market transactions. Progress has already been made in establishing SARON on the Swiss money market. For some weeks now, it has been used as the reference rate for interest rate derivatives; hence, quotes for SARON interest rate swaps (SARON swaps) are already being offered. We can observe this in chart 4, which plots the curves for TOIS and SARON swaps. We see that the yield curve for SARON swaps already covers all maturities. Moreover, the SARON yield curve is below the TOIS curve. This is because, unlike the unsecured TOIS fixing, SARON, as the secured overnight reference rate, is risk-free.  Although the volume of SARON swaps is still small, many players are in the final stages of preparing to enter this market. Both the transaction volumes and acceptance of this market among market participants are expected to increase in the coming weeks and months. The Swiss National Bank is supporting and assisting in continued efforts to establish SARON on the Swiss money market. 
 Berne, 15 June 2017 Andréa M. Maechler News conference   Page 3/5   New code of conduct for global foreign exchange market transactions  That brings me to the new global code of conduct for foreign exchange market transactions known as the FX Global Code. Published at the end of May, this new code aims to define clear rules of conduct for all those transacting business on the foreign exchange markets, with a view to enhancing efficiency. A well-functioning foreign exchange market is in the interests of all market players, not least the central banks. Various central banks, including the SNB, have therefore been working alongside private sector partners to draft the FX Global Code.  The code of conduct affects all foreign exchange market activities – from communications with market participants to risk management and the execution of transactions. As a global set of rules, the new code replaces all existing codes of conduct for foreign exchange markets and, as such, establishes clear and uniform guidelines. It should be noted that the FX Global Code applies not just to market participants, but to market infrastructure providers as well; it thus encompasses all relevant foreign exchange market actors.  While the FX Global Code is classified as self-regulation, the SNB expects its regular counterparties to implement the new code and to abide by the agreed rules.

    31.082017 Welcome address First Annual Research Conference of the Banco de España Luis M. Linde Governor   

  3/4 Buenos días, good morning to everybody. Let me welcome you all to the first Annual Research Conference of the Banco de España. We plan to make this conference our main research event each year. So, we hope that today’s edition is the first of many to come. Our aim is to bring together scholars and policy-makers to express views and discuss on the key policy questions for central banking, both from an academic and a practical perspective. The conference reaffirms the Banco de España’s commitment to research as an indispensable tool for economic policy-making.  Good research strengthens the foundation of our policy framework and lays the groundwork for the models we use in our economic and monetary policy analysis. The Banco de España commits significant resources to research. Let me give you some figures. Currently, according to the IDEAS database, our Bank ranks third in research among national central banks in the Euro zone. In 2016, researchers at the Bank published more than 30 working papers. Indeed, research is not a matter of quantity, but of quality; in the last few years our researchers have published in top journals such as Econometrica, the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the various American Economic Journals and the Journal of Monetary Economics, just to mention a few examples. Over the last three years, fifteen young economists holding PhDs from renowned international universities have joined the Bank’s staff.  I am pretty confident that our research output will be improved and enhanced in the future. Challenges for macroeconomic research Today and tomorrow you will be talking essentially about macroeconomics. Looking forward, macro policies, monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policies, are facing a number of challenges that require deep theoretical and empirical analysis. Perhaps, first of all, we need to understand the causes and consequences of the current levels of low inflation in most developed economies, despite the fact that most major central banks have introduced unprecedented monetary measures to support activity and growth.  Several explanations, ranging from a “debt supercycle” to a secular stagnation have been proposed. If natural rates at very low or even negative levels are here to stay, central bankers will have to rethink our standard toolbox and to decide which policy measures put in place during the last decade should be maintained. In this respect, I think that the first paper of the conference, which analyzes the effects of negative nominal interest rates, will offer new insights on this important topic. Secondly, we need to improve our understanding of the links between monetary policy, macroprudential policy and financial stability.  The financial crisis underlined how an impaired financial system could cause severe economic damage and disrupt the transmission of monetary policy. Moreover, following the financial crisis, many central banks have provided with new macroprudential tools that remain largely untested.  The question of which should be the role of central banks in 
 4/4  financial crisis prevention or mitigation is still far away from reaching any definite answer.  Several papers in this conference will deal with this important issue. Third, we need to have a better understanding of how monetary policy and other macroeconomic policies are transmitted.  By now, it is clear that the standard new Keynesian framework, which still shapes our general view of the basic elements of monetary policy, has some relevant shortcomings. For example, recent research has underlined how additional channels related to household and firm heterogeneity may provide a more realistic depiction of how monetary and fiscal policies affects the economy, modifying –or even overturning- some of the prescriptions derived from models with representative agents. This is a line of research linking both empirical and theoretical work that may have consequences for our work as central bankers. Your discussions over the next couple of days will help to improve our understanding of some of these complex issues, ranging from the emergence and consequences of bubbles in asset markets,  to the role of individual heterogeneity in the transmission of macro policies and in the aggregate incidence of financial frictions. Conclusion To conclude, I would like to say that both policymakers and academics face new challenges in our understanding of how central banks should act in order to fulfill our mandates and maximize the welfare of the citizens we work for. Meetings such as this Conference provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen the links between central bankers and academics.   I wish you a very productive meeting and a pleasant stay in Madrid, expressing my gratitude for your attendance to this First Annual Research Conference of the Banco de España.  Thank you very much for your attention.   
Mario Draghi: Building on the achievements of post-crisis reformsSpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank and Chair of the EuropeanSystemic Risk Board, at the second annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 21September 2017.*   *   *It is my pleasure to welcome you to the second annual conference of the European SystemicRisk Board (ESRB).The conference coincides with the tenth anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis inthe summer of 2007. The crisis shook the European Union to the core, and required substantialpolicy actions to stabilise the economy and the financial system. With a return to stability havingbeen achieved, it is important that we take time to reflect on what we have learnt, what we haveachieved over the past ten years, and where we need to do further work.The crisis taught us that individual banks and the banking system as a whole needed to be moreresilient than they were pre-crisis. As a result, many reforms have been put in place in recentyears. Our banking regulation and supervision have become stricter. Moreover, the Europeanregulatory framework now places greater emphasis on identifying and addressing system-widerisks. This includes the establishment of the ESRB and the creation of macroprudentialinstruments assigned to public authorities.A more resilient post-crisis banking sectorIn the banking sector, significant efforts have been made in recent years to increase resilience. Inthe euro area, for example, the average Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutionsrose from 7% in 2008 to 13.5% by end-2016. And banks are required to set up solid governancestructures and prudent risk management practices. Moreover, resilience is now tested morerigorously in a forward-looking manner. The EU-wide stress tests coordinated by the EuropeanBanking Authority (EBA) have become an important tool for quantifying banks’ capital needs, witha view to ensuring that they would be able to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers evenduring a severe recession. Post-crisis prudential rules have also provided public authorities with macroprudential tools toaddress systemic risks in the banking sector. And the understanding of how to calibrate andimplement these tools has advanced. For example, all Member States now have acountercyclical capital buffer framework that is fully operational.  Four Member States haveannounced a non-zero buffer rate for domestic exposures.Yet despite these steps forward, it is important to remain vigilant. One important aspectconcerns the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policies. Financial andbusiness cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances cangrow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation. In such an environment, theuse of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may leadto substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This isparticularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financialimbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets orcountries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances.Indeed, the ESRB last year identified medium-term vulnerabilities in some countries’ residentialreal estate sectors – precisely the type of situation that macroprudential policies are designed toaddress. It published country-specific warnings to eight Member States in November 2016, inaccordance with its mandate to identify and flag significant systemic risks.1,23456 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
But beyond increasing the resilience of the banking sector, there is also a need to address theremaining legacies of the crisis. Two important aspects are the resolutionof already impairedassets, and better accounting for impaired assets for the future.Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks’ balancesheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector wasaround €1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that thatcollateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral andprovisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks’ profitability,however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of grossexposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks,against only 0.8% for US banks.The outstanding stock of NPLs is a consequence of cyclical and structural factors. First, thesevere recession resulting from the global financial crisis led to a deterioration of the quality ofbanks’ loan books. The current economic expansion should therefore help to improve the assetquality of European banks. At the same time, structural weaknesses still persist. These includeinadequate internal governance structures in banks, ineffective and costly debt recoveryprocedures in some Member States and misaligned incentives that prevent a quick resolution ofNPLs. To this end, the ESRB has proposed a series of measures to complement those alreadybeing taken at EU and euro area level.In the short term, the ESRB’s proposals focus on strengthening banks’ NPL management,including their prudent measurement and the valuation of the associated collateral. Policymakerscould aid this process by developing blueprints for asset management companies, accompaniedby harmonised data templates across the EU.Measures should also concentrate on insolvency regimes, debt recovery and servicingcapacities with a view to improving recovery rates from NPLs. Over a longer horizon, secondarymarkets’ trading platforms should be further developed. And banks also need to be givenadequate incentives, in particular in relation to accounting for impaired assets.From 1 January 2018 onwards, a new accounting standard for the classification andmeasurement of financial instruments, known as IFRS 9, becomes mandatory in EU. At therequest of the European Parliament, the ESRB has recently published a report on the financialstability implications of IFRS 9, which concludes that it is a major improvement, particularlyregarding accounting for NPLs. The most important change introduced by IFRS 9 is the shiftfrom an incurred loss approach to an expected credit loss approach for measuring impairmentallowances. This means that banks will have to recognise impairments earlier, curtailingexcessive forbearance towards NPLs and helping ensure that banking sector repair takes placein a timelier and more comprehensive manner in future downturns. A recent impact assessment,based on a sample of 54 banks across 20 Member States published by the European BankingAuthority, suggests that the introduction of IFRS 9 would lead to an increase of provisions ofabout 13% on average.The expected credit loss approach also means that banks will have to react in their accounting tonew and forward-looking information as it is received. This means that impairment allowancesmay increase suddenly and significantly when economic conditions deteriorate, which couldhave certain pro-cyclical effects. The ESRB report considers a number of policies that couldaddress such effects.For example, stress testing could be used as a means to gauge the variation in impairmentallowances associated with adverse scenarios, in order to ensure that sufficient capital buffersare in place and to allow for remedial policy action if required. If banks can withstand ahypothetical adverse scenario, they would likely be able to cope with the early recognition of7891011121314 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
expected credit losses under a real downturn, as required by IFRS 9.Identifying and addressing risks beyond the banking sectorGiven the bank-based nature of the European economy, the state of the banking sector is centralto our assessment of systemic risk. But the financial system is constantly evolving. Since 2008,the assets of the non-bank financial sector in the euro area have roughly doubled and are nowslightly larger than those of the banking sector. The path to growth set out in the EuropeanCommission’s Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) means that the non-bankfinancial sector is likely to play an increasingly important role in financing the economy. Thisevolution offers many opportunities: it would provide new sources of funding for business, and itwould help increase options for investors and savers.Yet, as financial intermediation shifts from banks to non-banks, existing risks may migrate andnew risks may emerge. It is important, then, to identify such risks and to develop tools to mitigatethem.Take, for example, the issue of interconnectedness between different parts of the financialsystem. Interconnectedness – be that through direct exposures or indirectly via common orcorrelated asset holdings – is a natural feature of an integrated financial system. But during timesof financial stress, interconnectedness transmits and potentially amplifies shocks, and can leadto contagion. Full visibility is of the essence here.In this regard, the second EU Shadow Banking Monitor, published by the ESRB earlier thisyear, analyses a unique data set collected by the EBA. The data show that exposures of EUbanks to shadow banking entities amount to over €1 trillion.Focusing on a more granularsubset of these exposures, the analysis finds that 60% of EU banks’ exposures to shadowbanking entities are to entities domiciled outside the EU. These findings highlight the global andcross-border interconnectedness of the banking and shadow banking systems and the need forinternational cooperation in monitoring and addressing cross-sectoral risks. Unilateral actionsand isolated national attempts are predisposed to fail.When moving from identifying to addressing risks in the financial system, a number of elementsneed to work in tandem: good regulation and supervision make individual firms safer; recoveryand resolution regimes provide legal certainty when a firm gets into trouble and they ensure thatfailure is orderly; and macroprudential policy looks beyond individual institutions and deploys toolsto target systemic risks.A recovery and resolution regime is particularly important for central counterparties (CCPs),which have become critical hubs in the financial system. Legislation in this area is progressing,and the ESRB continues to identify areas of refinement to better address macroprudentialconsiderations. This includes the need for cooperation and coordination between resolutionauthorities for banks and CCPs, as distress of a CCP would typically be triggered by distress inone or more banks that are clearing members of the CCP.Creating a harmonised recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector across theEU is also important. Ordinary insolvency procedures may not always be consistent with policyholder protection and financial stability objectives. This means that they may not suffice tomanage the failure of a large insurer or the simultaneous failure of multiple insurers in an orderlyfashion. For example, Romania developed a comprehensive recovery and resolution frameworkof this kind following difficulties faced by two large insurers in 2014 and 2015. And theNetherlands and France are in the process of developing such frameworks after experiencing thenear-failure of some financial conglomerates during the global financial crisis.Addressing systemic risks requires macroprudential tools that public authorities can use.1516171819202122 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Reflecting this, the ESRB recently noted that there is a need to establish a comprehensivemacroprudential toolkit beyond banking, which to date is lacking. Of course, specific tools stillneed to be developed. The ESRB has done preliminary work assessing what those tools mightbe. One example is the macroprudential use of margins and haircuts, on which I updated theEuropean Parliament earlier this year. ConclusionLet me conclude.Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are moreresilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and toolsto tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created afinancial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy.At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, whererisks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to bemindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond thebanking sector.I hope that when you return to your institutions, this conference will have strengthened yourresolve to address the challenges in banking and beyond that are discussed here. On that note, Iam pleased to open this second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board.For example, the most recent stress tests by the European Banking Authority in 2016 included 51 banks from 15EU and EEA countries, covering around 70% of banking assets in each jurisdiction and across the EU. SeeEuropean Banking Authority (2016), “2016 EU-wide stress test results”, July.The ESRB has contributed a macroprudential perspective to these stress tests and developed surveys toconsider feedback loops.

Philip Lowe: The next chapterAddress by Mr Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the American Chamberof Commerce in Australia (AMCHAM), Perth, 21 September 2017.*   *   *I would like to thank Andrea Brischetto for assistance in the preparation of this talk.I would like to thank the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia for the invitation to speaktoday. It is a pleasure to be in Perth again.This lunch is being held at a time when one chapter in Australia’s economic history is drawing toa close and another is about to start. A main theme in the chapter that is about to come to an endis the mining investment boom. That boom, and its unwinding, has been central to the story ofthe Australian and Western Australian economies for more than a decade now. The new chapterwill, almost certainly, have a different central theme.Today, I would like to provide a sketch of some of the likely plot lines of the next chapter. Beforedoing that, though, I will reflect on the current chapter.The current chapterThe storyline of the current chapter is well known. It has had two main plot lines.The first was a troubled global economy. A decade ago we had the global financial crisis and theworst recession in many advanced economies since the 1930s. A gradual recovery then tookplace, but it was painfully slow. Recently, things have improved noticeably and unemploymentrates in some advanced economies are now at the lowest levels in many decades. Throughoutthis chapter, central banks have mostly worried that inflation rates might turn out to be too low,not too high. Interest rates have been at record lows. And workers in advanced economies haveexperienced low growth in their nominal wages. So it’s been a challenging international backdrop.The second plot line was the resources boom. Strong growth in China saw strong growth indemand for resources. Prices rose in response, with Australia’s terms of trade reaching thehighest level in at least 150 years (Graph 1). Then an investment boom took place in response tothe higher prices, with investment in the resources sector reaching its highest level as a share ofGDP in over a century. And now we are seeing the dividends of this, with large increases inAustralia’s resource exports. 1 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
Overall, it has been a reasonably successful chapter in Australia’s economic history. Realincome per person is around 20 per cent higher than it was in the mid 2000s and real wealth perperson is 40 per cent higher. Australia is one of the few advanced economies that avoided arecession in 2008. And the biggest mining boom in a century did not end in a crash, as previousbooms did. Our interest rates remained positive, unlike those in many other advancedeconomies. Since the mid 2000s, the unemployment rate has averaged 5¼ per cent, a betteroutcome than in the previous three decades. Inflation has averaged 2½ per cent. And over thisperiod, GDP growth has averaged 2¾ per cent, higher than in most other advanced economies.So, taking the period as a whole, it is a positive picture.At the same time, though, as the chapter draws to a close, we do face some issues. I would liketo highlight three of these.The first is the recent slow growth in real per capita income. For much of the past two decades,real national income per person grew very strongly in Australia (Graph 2). We benefited fromstrong productivity growth, higher commodity prices and more of the population working. Incontrast, since 2011 there has been little net growth in real per capita incomes. This change intrend is proving to be a difficult adjustment. The solutions are strong productivity growth andincreased labour force participation. 2 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
A second issue is the unusually slow growth in nominal and real wages. Over the past fouryears, the increase in average hourly earnings has been the slowest since at least the mid 1960s(Graph 3). This is partly a consequence of the unwinding of the mining boom but there arestructural factors at work as well. The slow growth in wages is putting a strain on householdbudgets and contributing to low rates of inflation. 3 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
A third issue is the high level of household debt and housing prices. Over recent times,Australians have borrowed a lot to purchase housing. This has added to the upward pressure onhousing prices, especially in our two largest cities, where structural factors are also at work.Australians are coping well with the higher level of debt, but as debt levels have increased relativeto our incomes so too have the medium-term risks. The very high levels of housing prices in ourlargest cities are also making it difficult for those on low and middle incomes to buy their ownhome.So as we turn the final pages of this chapter, these are some of the issues we face. But as weturn these pages, we also see improvements on a number of fronts.Business conditions, as reported in surveys, are at the highest level in almost 10 years. Thereare also growing signs that private investment outside the resources sector is picking up. Wehave been waiting for this for some time. For a number of years, animal spirits had beenmissing, with many firms preferring to put off making decisions about capital spending. It appearsthat some of this reluctance to invest is now passing. According to the June quarter nationalaccounts, private non-mining business investment increased strongly over the first half 2017, tobe around 10 per cent above the level at the start of 2016. Non-residential building approvalshave increased to be above the levels of recent years and there is a large pipeline of publicinfrastructure investment to be completed (Graph 4). The decline in mining investment has alsolargely run its course. 4 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
There has also been positive news on the employment front. Over the past year, the number ofpeople with jobs has increased by more than 2½ per cent, a positive outcome given that theworking-age population is increasing at around 1½ per cent a year. Growth in full timeemployment has been particularly strong. The various forward-looking indicators suggest thatlabour market conditions will remain positive in the period immediately ahead.Here in Western Australia, there are also some signs of improvement after what has been adifficult few years. The drag from declining mining investment is diminishing. Businesses arefeeling more positive than they were a year ago and employment has been rising after a period ofdecline. At the same time though, conditions in the housing market remain difficult, with housingprices and rents continuing to fall in Perth. Weak residential construction has also weighed onaggregate demand over the first half of this year, although building approvals and liaison reportspoint to some stabilisation in the period ahead (Graph 5). 5 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
For Australia as a whole, the recent national accounts – which showed a healthy increase inoutput of 0.8 per cent in the June quarter – were in line with the Bank’s expectations. These, andother recent data, are consistent with the Reserve Bank’s central scenario for GDP growthaveraging around the 3 per cent mark over the next couple of years. This is a bit faster than ourcurrent estimate of trend growth in the Australian economy, so we expect to see a gradualdecline in the unemployment rate. This should lead to some pick-up in wage growth, although weexpect this to be a gradual process given the structural factors at work that I have spoken abouton previous occasions. We can also expect to see a gradual increase in inflation back towardsthe middle of the 2 to 3 per cent medium-term target range.There are clearly risks around this central scenario. We would like to see the improvement inbusiness investment consolidate and a continuation of job growth at a rate at least sufficient toabsorb the increase in Australia’s workforce. Some pick-up in wage growth in response to thetighter labour market would also be a welcome development. So these are some areas to watch.But as things stand, the economy does look to be improving.The next chapterI would now like to lift my gaze a little and turn to the next chapter in our economic story. I wouldlike to sketch out four of the possible plot lines, acknowledging that, as in all good stories, thereare likely to be plenty of surprises along the way.Shifts in the global economyA first likely plot line, as it has been in previous chapters, is the ongoing shift in the globaleconomy. Here, changes in technology and further growth in Asia are likely to be prominentthemes. 6 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
In some quarters there is pessimism about future prospects for the global economy. Thepessimists cite demographic trends, high debt levels, increasing regulatory burdens that stifleinnovation and political issues. They see a future of low productivity growth and only modestincreases in average living standards.It’s right to be concerned about the issues that the pessimists focus on, but I am more optimisticabout the ability of technological progress to propel growth in the global economy, just as it hasdone in the past. We are still learning how to take advantage of recent advances in technology,including the advances in the tools of science. In time we will do this and new industries andmethods of production will evolve, some of which are hard to even imagine today. So there is stillplenty of upside. The challenge we face is to make sure that the benefits of technologicalprogress are widely shared. How well we do this could have a major bearing on the next chapter.Beyond this broad theme, it is appropriate to recognise the important leadership role that theUnited States plays in the global economy. If the US economy does well, so does most of therest of the world. The United States has long been a strong supporter of open markets and arules-based international system. It has been the breeding ground for much of the progress intechnology. And it has been a safe place for people to invest and an important source of financialcapital for other countries. It is in our interests that the United States continues to play thisimportant role. A retreat would make our lives more complicated.Another important influence on the next chapter is how things play out in China. While growth inChina is trending lower, the share of global output produced in China will continue to rise, as percapita incomes converge towards those in the more advanced economies (Graph 6). As thisconvergence takes place, the structure of the Chinese economy will change and so too willChina’s economic relationship with Australia. Exports of resources will continue to be animportant part of that relationship, but increasingly trade in services and other high value-addedactivities, including food, will become more important. Notwithstanding this, there are risks on thehorizon, with the Chinese economy going through some difficult adjustments. One of these is theswitch from a growth model based on industrial expansion to one based more on services.Another is managing an increasingly large and complex financial system. Australia has a stronginterest in China successfully managing these challenges. 7 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
Another shift in the global economy that could shape the next chapter is the growth of othereconomies in Asia. Developments in India and Indonesia bear especially close watching. Both ofthese countries, especially India, have very large populations, and per capita incomes are stillquite low. In time, the effects of economic progress in these countries and others in the regioncould be expected to have a substantial effect on the Australian economy, just as thedevelopment of China has.Normalisation of monetary conditionsA second likely plot line of the next chapter is a return to more normal monetary conditionsglobally. Since the financial crisis we have been through an extraordinary period in monetaryhistory. Interest rates have been very low and even negative in some countries. Central bankshave greatly expanded their balance sheets in order to buy assets from the private sector(Graph 7). This period of monetary expansion is now drawing to a close. 8 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
Some normalisation of monetary conditions globally should be seen as a positive development,although it does carry risks. It is a sign that economic growth in the advanced economies hasbecome self-sustaining, rather than just being dependent on monetary stimulus. It would also liftthe return to many savers who have been receiving very low returns on interest-bearing assetsfor a decade now.On the other side of the ledger, periods of rising interest rates globally have, historically, exposedover-borrowing somewhere in the global system. Investment strategies that looked sensiblewhen interest rates were very low tend not to look so good when interest rates are higher.We can take some comfort from the major efforts over the past decade to improve the resilienceof the global financial system. But at the same time, investors have increasingly been preparedto take more risk in the search for yield. Many continue to expect a continuation of low rates ofinflation and low interest rates, despite quite low unemployment rates in a number of countries.So this is an area that is worth watching. If higher interest rates are the result of a surpriseincrease in inflation, financial markets could be in for a difficult adjustment.A rise in global interest rates has no automatic implications for us here in Australia.Notwithstanding this, an increase in global interest rates would, over time, be expected to flowthrough to us, just as the lower interest rates have. Our flexible exchange rate though gives usconsiderable independence regarding the timing as to when this might happen.Higher levels of debtThis brings me to a third plot line: that is, how we deal with the higher level of household debt andhigher housing prices, especially in a world of more normal interest rates.It is likely that higher levels of household debt change household spending patterns. Havingincreased their borrowing, households are less inclined to let consumption growth run ahead of 9 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
growth in incomes for too long. Higher levels of debt also mean that household spending couldbe quite sensitive to increases in interest rates, something the Reserve Bank will be paying closeattention to.To date, households have been coping reasonably well with the higher debt levels. Theaggregate debt-to-income ratio has trended higher, but the ratio of interest payments to incomeis not particularly high, given the low level of interest rates (Graph 8). Housing loan arrearsremain low, although they have increased a little recently, especially here in Western Australia.Over recent times, one issue that the Reserve Bank has focused on is the build-up of medium-term risks from growth in household debt persistently outpacing that in household income. Ourconcern has been that, in this environment, a small shock could turn into a more seriouscorrection as households seek to repair their balance sheets. We have been working with APRAthrough the Council of Financial Regulators to address this risk. The various measures arehaving a positive impact in improving the resilience of household balance sheets.A broadening of the drivers of growthThe fourth likely plot line is a broadening of the drivers of growth in the Australian economy. Howthe next chapter in our economic history turns out depends partly on our ability to lift productivitygrowth across a wide range of industries. The resources sector will, no doubt, continue to makean important contribution to the Australian economy, but it is unlikely that it will shape the nextchapter in our economic history as it did the current chapter. With another major upswing in theterms of trade unlikely and the working-age share of our population having peaked as thepopulation ages, improving productivity will be key to growth in our national income.The drivers of growth are changing: they increasingly depend on our ability to produce innovative 10 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
goods and services in a rapidly changing world. In this world, it is difficult to make precisepredictions about where the jobs and growth in our economy are going to come from in thefuture. But it seems clear that we will be best placed to take advantage of whatever possibilitiesarise if businesses and our workforce are innovative and adaptable.Australia is fortunate to have a natural resource base that provides an important source ofnational income, and this will remain the case. But in this next chapter we will need to look moredirectly to the skills of our workers and our businesses to drive economic growth. If we are totake advantage of the opportunities that are offered by technology and growth in Asia, we need aflexible workforce with strong skills in the areas of problem solving, critical thinking andcommunication. Investment in human capital will be one of the keys to success. We also need acompetitive business environment that encourages innovation. How well the next chapter turnsout will depend on how we do in these areas.So, in summary these are some of the themes we might expect to see in the next chapter – theimpact of technology and the growth of Asia; the normalisation of monetary conditions; theeffects of higher levels of household debt; and the capability of our workforce and businesses tobe flexible, innovative and adaptable.This is, obviously, not a complete list. There are clearly other factors that could have a majorinfluence on the storyline, including how geopolitical tensions are resolved and how we adjust toclimate change. And no doubt there will be surprises as well.But overall, I remain optimistic about how this next chapter might unfold. While we have ourchallenges, some of which I have talked about, we also have some advantages. We have astrong institutional and policy framework, a skilled, growing and diverse population and a wealthof mineral and agricultural resources. We have strong links to Asia, the fastest growing part ofthe global economy. We also have a flexible economy with a demonstrated capacity to adjust toa changing world.These factors should give us confidence about our future. But we can’t rest on this and there area number of significant risks. The world is a competitive place and the global economy iscontinuing to go through some challenging adjustments. If we are to do well in this world, weneed to keep investing in both physical and human capital. We also need to keep investing inpolicy reform.Finally, I have said relatively little about monetary policy today. This is partly because there areother forces that are likely to be more important in shaping the next chapter of the Australianeconomy. Monetary policy has an important role to play in supporting the economy as it goesthrough the current period of adjustment. It can also help stabilise the economy when it is hit byfuture shocks. Monetary policy can make for a more predictable investment climate by keepinginflation low and stable. Having a competent, analytical, transparent and independent centralbank can also be a source of confidence in the country. But beyond these effects, monetarypolicy has little influence on the economy’s potential growth rate.Over recent times, the Reserve Bank Board has not sought to overly fine-tune things. We haveprovided support and allowed time for the economy to adjust to the new circumstances. In itsdecisions, the Board has been careful to balance the benefit of providing this support with therisks that can come from rising household debt. As things currently stand, we look to be oncourse to make further progress in reducing unemployment and moving towards the midpoint ofthe medium-term inflation target. This would be a good outcome.Thank you for listening and I look forward to answering your questions.  11 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF BANK GABORONE MAUN BRANCH  Keynote Speech  by  Moses D Pelaelo Governor, Bank of Botswana  September 11, 2017   Good morning and thank you all for being part of the official opening of the Maun branch of Bank Gaborone.  Today marks yet another important milestone in the history of Bank Gaborone in Botswana. Last year, on March 22, the bank opened its doors to the residents of Palapye, that was just two years after the opening of the Kang branch (in 2014) in Kgalagadi North, where, by the way, to date, Bank Gaborone is the only bank in that village. It is, therefore, commendable that in a period of three years, Bank Gaborone has added three new branches, to take the total to 9 and 17 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). This becomes even more significant if we consider the fact that Bank Gaborone started its operations in Botswana in 2006 and, in a relatively short period of 11 years, it has expanded its network of branches, comparable in number to, or even, surpassing some of the older banks in the country.  The bank also provides electronic banking services, which further extends its coverage and footprint.  
2  I should also recognise that, Bank Gaborone employs 261 people, mostly Batswana, hence, contributing to the economic and social well-being of the employees and their families.   Distinguished Guests, what I have just said about Bank Gaborone, demonstrates a clear commitment and contribution to Botswana’s financial inclusion agenda. The strategy of expanding the branch network beyond cities, potentially opens up access to banking services to a greater number of individuals and businesses, including small and medium scale enterprises and, indeed, the informal sector.  By so doing, Bank Gaborone is adding to the inputs and resources needed to enhance productivity of economic pursuits, and for the community to harness and profit from business opportunities.  The extended outreach of financial services being undertaken by Bank Gaborone accords well with the nation’s Financial Sector Development Strategy and, ultimately, contributes to the aspiration of inclusive economic growth.   Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, as you may be aware, Bank Gaborone is a member of the Capricorn Group - a financial services group with its roots in Namibia, offering banking, insurance and asset management services in 
3  Botswana, Namibia and Zambia.  In Botswana, the bank’s financial position has grown steadily since commencement of operations, in 2006.  Total assets increased from P268 million in June 2007 to P4.6 billion in June 2017; lending increased from P197 million to P3.2 billion in June 2017; while deposits grew from P188 million to P3.9 billion in June 2017.  The bank has, therefore, in a relatively short period, mobilised approximately P4 billion worth of financial resources. These resources have been productively employed and distributed, in the form of loans and other credit facilities, to support real economic activity in diverse sectors across Botswana, including consumption spending.   As a regional bank and being relatively new, it is expected that the bank and its design of products will continue to be well aligned to contemporary domestic market requirements. Notably, for the area around Maun, this branch of Bank Gaborone is invariably expected to support the various facets and business value chains in the tourism and agricultural sectors associated with this region. In this way, Bank Gaborone would be contributing to sustainable economic activity and inclusive growth in this part of Botswana.   
4  It is worth pointing out that the tourism industry, of which Maun is a significant player, accounted for 3.9 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2016, through industries such as hotels, restaurants, travel agents, airlines and other passenger transportation services. The same industries contributed 2.6 percent to total employment in 2016.   It is therefore expected that the provision of additional or enhanced financial services, in the form of transactional accounts, savings products, credit extension, payments and other banking services offered by Bank Gaborone, as well as other players of course, should help sustain the contribution of the tourism sector to GDP. In turn, this should foster economic diversification and broad-based private sector development, both of which are critical for endurable economic growth and raising living standards of our people.    To the Maun residents and North West community, in general, we should recognise that the Maun branch of Bank Gaborone is a business that needs a good and durable customer base in order for it to be profitable and sustainable.  Therefore, you are all encouraged to use the branch and, of course, all other licensed banks in your 
5  area, to save money and undertake other financial transactions. Similarly, it is my expectation that Bank Gaborone will take full advantage of the Botswana payments and other public infrastructure, partnership with mobile operators and other Electronic Payments Systems, to enhance financial inclusion; and this includes providing the much-needed support for the informal businesses in Botswana in general and Maun, in particular.   Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,  In addition to what I have just said, I wish to implore the Maun community to engage banks with viable borrowing proposals that are sustainable and can yield positive returns.  Equally, important, and having obtained loans and other credit facilities, borrowers should honour their obligations by adhering to the repayment programme agreed with banks.  Distinguished Guests, I am making this point because the Bank of Botswana is concerned about the recent observed upward trend in non-performing loans.  While this trend could be, in part, due to sluggish global economic activity and idiosyncratic business performance and environment, there is some evidence of lack of financial discipline on the part of some individuals and poor management practices by some businesses.  There is also an undesirable creeping culture, on the part of some 
6  customers of banks, of failing to repay their obligations to banks according to the agreed schedule.    Let me, therefore, take this opportunity to remind you, Distinguished Guests that, in the main, banks in Botswana are funded mainly by depositors/savers’ funds. Therefore the Board and management of a bank have a fiduciary duty and responsibility to ensure that the lending and credit underwriting standards are sound; the bank is managed in a safe and prudent manner, to safeguard depositors’ funds and ensure that these borrowed funds are not lost through uncollectable loans. In this context, I should therefore caution that, where a borrower is in default, the bank is entitled to institute lawful, procedural and ethical recovery procedures including attachment and liquidation of property pledged as collateral to recover its money.  Moreover, providing for a loss or writing off a loan in the bank’s books, as a non-bankable asset, does not extinguish the debt the customer owes to the bank. In this case, the bank is only being prudent and adhering to sound accounting and international financial reporting standards. The defaulting customer continues to be obliged to repay.  In this context, let us always remember that a safe, sound and stable banking system is a necessary condition for sustainable economic development.    
7  Director of Ceremonies, Distinguished Guests, I am reliably informed that Bank Gaborone, which identifies with the mission statement: “to make banking a rewarding experience for all stakeholders”, has a strong customer-focus orientation that should make it a good business partner. I am also aware that customers have demonstrated their confidence in the bank’s service delivery by voting it the “Best Bank in Customer Care”, during a customer service survey carried out by KPMG in 2013 and 2016.  This is commendable and trust that the Maun community will soon have a reason to validate these accolades.   In terms of Corporate Social Responsibility, Bank Gaborone qualifies to be called a good corporate citizen, as evidenced by its participation in charitable activities, including Financial Literacy Programme, through which the bank educates Batswana on financial matters.  Other Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives include support for youth football development; involvement in the Diabetes Apple Project and Journey of Hope for raising breast cancer awareness; and sponsoring Lady Khama Charitable Trust, UB Foundation and Kang Primary School.   
8  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me to comment on a few other issues of topical interest.  First, the status of liquidity in the banking system; one of the key economic functions of a bank is to manage and provide liquidity to firms and other economic entities.  As many of you will be aware, liquidity and maturity transformation is the essence of banking. In this regard, banks should ensure that, at all times, they have adequate funds, including contingency funding sources, to meet their financial obligations.  These obligations typically include customer withdrawals and drawdown of loan facilities, as well as the capacity to accommodate growth and profit opportunities, such as new credit requirements by their clients. Therefore, liquidity is a critical and integral component of a bank’s operations, strategy and governance framework.  Consistent with our principal objectives, as the central bank and regulatory authority, namely, “to promote and maintain monetary stability, an efficient payments mechanism and the liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a soundly based financial system”, the Bank of Botswana monitors banks on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continually meet the minimum prudential thresholds, in this case, liquidity ratios; and that there is no constraint to transmission of the monetary policy stance.  
9  It is for this reason that, the Bank of Botswana stands ready to inject and/or withdraw liquidity from the banking system and, also, provide overnight credit facilities to solvent banks, if needed, to meet temporary liquidity shortfalls.  These form of support by central banks is common across the world, as it is central to the primary objective of “fostering monetary, credit and financial conditions conducive to the orderly, balanced and sustainable economic development” of the country. As regards the current status and health of the banking system, I can report that banks have sufficient liquidity, totalling approximately P19 billion, inclusive of Bank of Botswana Certificates and balances held abroad, both of which could be liquidated in case of need, with minimal capital loss, to finance any effective and viable demand for credit.  However, it should be noted that the distribution of liquidity amongst banks will vary from time to time.   Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, the second issue relates to the conduct of banks in accepting foreign currency denominated deposits. Consistent with international norms, and as is the case in many jurisdictions, Botswana’s banking and other laws permit non-residents to open accounts in local banks.  I should note here that, similarly, Botswana residents do open and 
10  operate accounts in other countries, subject to compliance with Botswana tax and other applicable laws.  However, there is a legal requirement to declare any cross-border transfers, including cash in any currency equivalent to    P10 000 and above.   In opening accounts and accepting deposits by foreigners (non-resident accounts), the local banks are doing so in compliance with Botswana laws.  Banks are, however, required to consistently undertake effective due diligence, including strict application of the Know Your Customer procedures for any such transactions and/or customers. These include obtaining customer identity documents, residence status, address, business location and sources of income; this is done at account opening and on an ongoing basis. Banks also need to ensure that any cross-border cash deposits and similar inward transfers are supported by duly completed and valid documents, when processing such transactions.  It is also important to indicate that banks have a screening process to ensure that entities and individuals on the International Sanctions Lists do not use the Botswana banking system as a conduit for illegal activities and other forms of financial crime.  Banks also routinely monitor 
11  accounts for suspicious activity and file Suspicious Transactions Reports (STR) with the Financial Intelligence Agency.  While it is not evidence of illegality, the Report triggers appropriate steps, including follow up action by relevant authorities, such as the Bank of Botswana, Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority and other law enforcement agencies.  Having said that, I can confirm that both the Financial Intelligence Agency and the Bank of Botswana continue to monitor and enforce, in line with their respective mandate, local banks' compliance with applicable laws, business conduct requirements, as well as the Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism protocols.  This leads me to the third topical issue, namely, cyber-crime and related other financial crimes.  Distinguished Guests, technology is the future of banking and many of us welcome the benefits of new information and communication technologies, in various facets of our lives, including enhanced cost-effective access to financial services and the associated convenience of conducting banking and other transactions.  However, in as much as these technologies increase efficiencies and bring other 
12  economic benefits, the speed, scale and the cost of any fraudulent activity perpetrated through these channels can be enormous, ruining the lives of many and causing major harm to institutions and society, in general.   These financial crimes can take many forms including unauthorised cash withdrawals from customers’ bank accounts at Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), identity theft, scanning and cloning of bank cards, disruption or compromising business processes, internal fraud and, more broadly, cyber-crime.  If not properly mitigated, these crimes can discourage members of the public from entrusting their savings with banks and this could undermine public confidence and trust in the banking system.  Consequently, we need to be on guard, as institutions, businesses and individuals to mitigate cyber-crime and other forms of financial crime risks.  The National Banking Week message by the Bank of Botswana, in 2011, articulated the issue well as follows that; “combating fraud is an on-going shared responsibility by all interested parties; it requires the involvement of the Bank of Botswana, banks and the vigilance of members of the public.  Vigilance is all the more important as the banking system diversifies and competition intensifies by way of new entrants to the market, increased branch network, 
13  new products, and progressive globalisation of banking services”.  I trust, in closing, that the presence of Bank Gaborone here in Maun, will add value to the community and the broader region, by expanding banking services and that there will be a mutually rewarding and enduring bank-customer relationship.  Mr Coetzee, once again, and through you, I would like to thank the Board, Management and staff of Bank Gaborone, for inviting me to be part of this occasion. I wish Bank Gaborone every success and hope that it will continue to grow and expand its services across the country.   Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my honour and privilege to declare the Maun Branch of Bank Gaborone officially open.  I thank you for your kind attention.   
 1 of 5   Conference „20 Years of Stability“ Governor Senad Softić, Ph.D. Welcome speech Sarajevo, 22 September 2017  Your excellencies, distinguished guests,   I would like to welcome you to this Conference and thank you for recognizing the importance of our institution’s anniversary. Central banking in Bosnia and Herzegovina has a history much longer than 20 years. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a sovereign country, has established its first Central Bank (the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina) in 1997, with a mandate guaranteed by the Constitution to implement monetary policy throughout the entire country under the currency board arrangement. The main objective of the Central Bank has been to achieve and maintain the stability of domestic currency, the convertible mark, the only legal tender in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The task was very complex because at that time there were four currencies in use in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Constitution defined that the first Governing Board of the Central Bank would include the Governor appointed by the International Monetary Fund in consultation with the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and three members nominated by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to specific circumstances related to the establishment of the Central Bank, it was also defined that the first Governor would not be a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina or a citizen of any of the neighboring countries.  In the years of Central Bank development that followed, we saw three phases. 
 2 of 5  The main functions of the Central Bank, as defined by the Central Bank Law, were established in the period until 2000. Since 11 August 1997, all prices and all payments have been denominated in convertible marks. Since the beginning of 1999, the convertible mark has been the only legal tender in internal payment operations, supported by the modern payment systems in the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, introduced in 2000. During this time, the Central Bank was growing and expanding the network of its organizational units in Sarajevo, Mostar, Banja Luka, Brčko and Pale.  During the following ten year period, the focus was on the strengthening of the financial system and macroeconomic stability. Since the very beginning of our operations, long before other institutions in the country, we have recognized the importance of macroeconomic statistics and invested efforts in its development.  Having in mind the significance of macroeconomic statistics for the public, and by implementing constantly the adjustments with the international standards, we have managed to provide the international relevance of our country.   By using the mechanism of banking supervision coordination, we have managed to consolidate the data from Entities’ Banking Agencies, reporting on the financial soundness indicators for the entire banking system.   Several years later, these activities resulted in:  the continued monitoring of systemic risks in the Standing Committee for Financial Stability, chaired by the Central Bank,   regularly performed macroeconomic stress tests, and  the signed memoranda on understanding and cooperation with regulators from the home countries of the banking groups operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  We have also established the Central Credit Registry which helps banks to manage risks, having insight into the credit histories of their clients in the entire country.  
 3 of 5  Our cash operations underwent a serious test in October 2008, when, our citizens, in panic, withdrew significant amount of deposits from banks in only several days. Thanks to the prompt response, we provided enough foreign currency, mostly euro, confirming in that way the full coverage of the convertible mark.  During the recent years, in the third phase, the Central Bank has had an increasing prominent role in fulfilling the international obligations of our country. During this period, we continue to strengthen our functions and resources.  In addition to regular publications, we prepare other analytical publications, such as the ECB Assessment on Financial Stability for EU Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries.  We have representatives in many working bodies, groups and institutions at the local and international level, particularly in the European integration field, for example, with the aim to prepare the answers for the European Commission questionnaire.  Through the intense cooperation between the Central Bank and its partner institutions, such as the European Central Bank, we are working on:  the implementation of new rules and policies,   changing our practices and   training our staff in compliance with the European standards. This contributes to the development of the culture that will help the entire society to recognize the Central Bank’s independence as a public interest.  We also highly appreciate the support of the International Monetary Fund, which had a key role in the establishing of the Central Bank twenty years ago. We hope that such support will continue in the future, especially in the activities aimed at the strengthening of the banking system in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 4 of 5  We also appreciate the valuable support which we received during this period from the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and institutions such as the World Bank, USAID, GIZ and other, for significant projects we implemented together. In the future, the Central Bank will continue with its mission to:  harmonize with the EU standards,   modernize and improve its work, payment systems, cash management operations,   increase institutional quality by using the best practices and experiences of other, fully developed central banks.  In the end, allow me to say that I am proud that the Central Bank is a fully independent, credible and transparent central bank, presenting the anchor of the country’s macroeconomic stability.  For all these years, in the complex reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one thing has been certain: the value of convertible mark, expressed in euro, has never been questioned.  I also have to emphasize that this institution’s successful performance is brought about by its human resources. The Bank’s highly skilled employees have been dedicated to developing this institution and achieving the results that we are proud of today. The success that we have achieved during the last twenty years and the contribution we have made to the society that we serve are largely due to the trust invested in the Central Bank.  Therefore, my dear colleagues, representatives of the government and friends, representatives of the  media that have professionally reported on our work, thank you for the support that you have always provided to the Central Bank and its objectives! The Governing Board, the Management and the employees of the Central Bank will continue to work in the way which will prove worthy of your confidence.  
 5 of 5  Thank you once again for celebrating with us this important anniversary and we wish you a pleasant stay in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  ### 
Timothy Lane: How Canada's international trade is changing withthe timesRemarks by Mr Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the SaskatoonRegional Economic Development Authority, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 18 September 2017.*   *   *IntroductionMy theme today is international trade, which is the lifeblood of the Canadian economy.Throughout our history, we have successfully relied on our exports and imports, particularlyduring the vast expansion of global trade in the decades following the Second World War, tosupport our rising standard of living. Today, exports and imports represent about 65 per cent ofour output, one of the highest ratios among the G7 countries.Few places in Canada illustrate the importance of trade and innovation as vividly asSaskatchewan. Historically, people living on the Prairies relied on exporting grain—and, morerecently, potash and oil—to markets outside Canada’s borders. They imported many of theproducts they consumed and the tools they used, from T-shirts to tractors. In the first severaldecades of Confederation, they often chafed at the trade barriers that were put in place to protectand nurture the growth of the manufacturing industries of central Canada. What is remarkable ishow nimble businesses in this province have been. They have adapted and innovated not only togrow market share but also to develop new products and markets for them.In recent years, the pattern and drivers of trade both nationally and in Saskatchewan haveevolved dramatically in response to forces that have been acting at the global level. Innovations inmany areas, notably information and communications technologies (ICTs) and logistics, havegiven rise to the development of new products and new ways of producing and trading them. Aparticularly important trend has been the emergence of global value chains (GVCs), with variousstages of production located in different countries.In this context, the progressive lowering of trade barriers worldwide has had outsized effects.Trade agreements have enabled much closer economic integration, and trade flows haveburgeoned, leading to increases in productivity and living standards.These trading relationships are now being called into question. Populist movements in some ofour major trading partners are demanding new trade barriers. However, such protectionistmeasures would undoubtedly mean less trade, which would reduce economic growth. While Ican’t comment on the specifics of any particular agreement, we have certainly been assessingthis shift toward protectionism, how it might affect the outlook for growth in Canada and itstrading partners and ultimately what it would mean for the conduct of our monetary policy.In my presentation today, I’ll review the changing nature of international trade, the factors, suchas innovation, that are propelling it and the benefits to Canada. I’ll discuss the challenges Canadafaces in its international trade and how they affect our economic outlook. I’ll conclude with whatthis means for monetary policy.The great unbundlingWe used to think that the greatest benefits of trade accrued to countries with market dominancein specific industries. Think of Switzerland and watches or France and wine. Historically, Canadaexported what we had in abundance—raw materials such as fur, fish and timber—and importedmanufactured goods. Of course, this is still the case for much of our trade. But the biggestincrease in world trade in recent decades has been intra-industry—that is, two-way trade within a 1 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
given industry (Chart 1). Some of that simply reflects product differentiation: Canada exports ryewhisky and imports scotch and bourbon. But, even more importantly, the expansion of intra-industry trade has been enabled by the unbundling of different stages of the production process.Consider the automobile industry: Canada both exports and imports auto parts at different stagesof production as well as the finished product. The potential for this kind of unbundling wasunleashed by technological innovations, particularly advances in ICT, which enabled the logisticsneeded to manage a supply chain that criss-crosses international borders. Bank of Canadaresearch has shown that the separation of production into stages significantly increases theeconomic gains from trade.In a world of GVCs, easing trade restrictions can also have outsized, positive effects on theeconomy and on trade flows. This has been described as “leveraging” because every unit of thefinal product—say, every car—incorporates a great deal of trade in the intermediate products andany reduction in costs imposed on trade can have cascading effects. Lower trade barriers alsomake it less expensive for firms to allocate different stages of production to countries where theyare most efficiently produced.What are the benefits to Canada of barrier-free, intra-industry trade within GVCs? Within anygiven industry, lowering trade barriers enables more efficient producers to expand to supply awider market. That further lowers their costs as they move to a larger scale. Other, less efficientproducers or plants may shrink or fail.  Canada’s experience with the 1965 Auto Pact, the 1988 Free Trade Agreement with the UnitedStates and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are good examples of theeconomic impact of lowering trade barriers. The North American market opened in the wake ofthe agreements (Chart 2). Employment in manufacturing declined in the short term, butproductivity rose and, in the longer term, the number of jobs in the economy increased. Efficientplants were able to expand to a scale that allowed them to capture even greater efficiencies. Theimprovement in productivity supported the growth in the overall earnings of workers.12345 2 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Exports and imports are a two-way street—and both help deliver the benefits of barrier-freetrade. Canadian firms can compete in foreign markets partly by making use of lower-costimported inputs, which raises their productivity. And their exports of intermediate products arelinked to their trading partner’s trade performance. For example, when we export machinery tothe United States, it is an efficiency-enhancing input into their exports.Benefits from opening trade may also come from increased competition. This is the result ofboth opening one’s home market to imports and gaining access to foreign markets.Creative destructionMore generally, innovation drives changes in trade patterns. This is economist JosephSchumpeter’s idea of creative destruction. The new replaces the old. Firms inventing newproducts may expand their exports by penetrating new markets. They can also develop newproduction processes that enable them to produce at lower cost.There are many such examples throughout the economy—in the high-tech industry as well as inmany other sectors. For example, 45 years ago here in Saskatchewan, pulses such as lentilsand peas were a small part of the province’s farm economy. In the 1970s, however,researchers at the University of Saskatchewan began searching for a protein crop tocomplement wheat, which was suffering from an oversupply and low prices. They saw theopportunities in lentils and developed new varieties suitable to the climate and soils ofSaskatchewan. Today, the province is the world’s largest exporter of green lentils and the world’ssecond largest producer (Chart 3). In 2016, exports of the crop generated more than $2 billion insales.678910 3 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Innovations in the production process can also drive export growth. Historically, this has been amajor part of the history of Saskatchewan. New technologies, such as farm machinery and seedvarieties, drove the consolidation of Prairie farms to take advantage of the greater ability tocultivate and harvest crops on a larger scale. Saskatchewan’s farm production and exportsexpanded massively, even while its population steadily declined. That freed up workers to moveinto job opportunities opening up elsewhere in the economy, while increasing the productivity andincomes of those who remained (Charts 4a and b). This is a story that has a personalconnection for me: half of my great-grandparents were farmers in the Prairies, but none of theirdescendants is still farming. 4 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
 I’ve been talking about how innovation drives trade, but the reverse is also true: trade opennessdrives innovation, too. This happens for two reasons. First, access to foreign markets exposesfirms to new technologies and provides incentives for them to invest in producing moreefficiently. And second, competition from trade encourages firms to innovate and invent newproducts to maintain market share. Trade is also an important channel for knowledge to spill overacross borders: an operation in one country can become competitive by combining its homeadvantages with the best techniques developed elsewhere.While trade and innovation have always been interconnected, the nature of theseinterconnections is changing rapidly with recent advances in digital technology, touching virtuallyall sectors of the economy. We are only beginning to appreciate how new fields, such as artificialintelligence, cloud computing, additive manufacturing and big data, may play out in new tradepatterns. Even calculating their economic impact is challenging. Returns from patentedintellectual property (IP), such as software, are an increasing part of value added in electronicproducts, and these are hard to measure. That’s also true of trade in IP services, which isbecoming increasingly important. Google Chrome and Dropbox—distributed worldwide acrossthe Internet—are good examples. Since they do not physically cross the border, there is nocustoms paper trail, and they are difficult to track. They are also provided free to many users, soit’s hard to place a value on them.This whole process of expanding two-way trade and technological advancement is playing out inmyriad industries. It is one of the most important drivers of Canada’s growth potential, which, inturn, underpins rising living standards for Canadians. While these are basically positivedevelopments, they do pose important challenges for society and for policy-makers.Both trade expansion and innovation are by their nature disruptive for firms and individuals. Theyspur growth by enabling more advanced and efficient activities and encouraging producers toexpand, displacing less efficient activities and producers. This is an integral part of the wholeprocess. Improved productivity is essential to compete internationally; without increases in1112 5 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
productivity, the business itself and all of the associated jobs can be lost.Historically, these changes have created many more job opportunities than they have eliminated.In particular, Canada’s service sector, which has become an increasingly important source ofexports, has created many new jobs paying above-average wages. But still, some workershave been left behind. Moreover, the rewards for innovation, particularly in the digital economy,often accrue to the few who own the related IP.Can public policy help smooth the transition? I should make it clear that this is not part of theBank of Canada’s monetary-policy remit, which is to keep inflation low, stable and predictable,allowing Canadians to make spending and investment decisions with confidence. But thedisruptive effects of trade and innovation have been major topics of discussion internationally.These are very challenging issues that do not offer easy solutions. Clearly, we can’t turn back theclock on technological innovation; nor is the answer to try to limit its scope by closing ourborders. What we can try to do is focus on supporting workers as they adapt to changingeconomic realities. That requires investments in retraining and lifelong learning as well as socialsafety nets. Another priority is to make sure that profits, including those derived from IP, can’t beshifted to avoid taxation. This includes stronger international co-operation—an area where theG20 has made meaningful progress.Trade and Canada’s current economic situationNow let me discuss the part international trade plays in Canada’s current economic situation.The period since the early 2000s has been challenging for Canadian exporters. The commoditysupercycle not only created opportunities for resource exporters but also put upward pressure onthe Canadian dollar, undermining the competitiveness of Canada’s non-commodity exports.Then, during the Great Recession of 2007–09, foreign demand for our products collapsed, andour exports plunged by about 20 per cent. They rebounded quickly but then hit a long stretch oflacklustre growth. This was part of the broader global pattern: before the crisis, global trade hadbeen expanding by more than 7 per cent a year—about twice as fast as the world economy.Since then it has been growing at a much more modest pace, closer to the rate of GDPgrowth.Because Canada’s relatively weak export performance has been a central aspect of oureconomic situation, the Bank of Canada has examined it in increasing detail. New measures ofexternal demand for Canadian exports have been constructed, which better take into accounthow Canadian industries are positioned in GVCs. Our staff have also constructed newmeasures of Canada’s effective exchange rate that better capture Canada’s competitiveness,not just relative to our export markets but also relative to third countries (Chart 5). This analysiscontributes to a better diagnosis of Canada’s loss of competitiveness.13141516 6 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Moreover, in keeping with the new concepts in international trade that I have been describing, ourresearchers have been examining Canada’s exports at an increasingly disaggregated level,down to the individual firms involved. During the recession and its aftermath, many Canadianexporters went out of business. With those firms went many of their supply-chain linkages.Another complex set of adjustments have been playing out during the past three years, with theplunge in prices of oil and other commodities. The economic and human costs to the resource-producing regions were huge. For Canada’s economy to continue growing, the non-resourcesectors—manufacturing and services—needed to grow faster and export more. Increasingforeign demand and the 25 per cent decline in the value of the Canadian dollar were forcessupporting this adjustment. While this expansion of non-commodity exports did take place—exports of services were especially robust—the expansion was smaller than expected based onprevious experience. Regaining market share was not just a matter of getting foreign customersto switch to a Canadian product. It often depended on a reassessment of where to locateproduction within a GVC—decisions that are typically not made often. To support the continuinggrowth of our international trade, many new linkages may need to be constructed as both newand existing firms emerge with new ideas and expand their activities to a sufficient scale. Thisprocess inevitably takes time and is still not complete.The prolonged weakness of Canadian exports has meant that Canada’s economy has needed torely on other sources of demand to drive its growth. In particular, we have depended heavily onhousehold spending, supported by very low interest rates.Now, economic data show that growth in Canada is becoming more broadly based and self-sustaining. We are seeing widespread strength in business investment and exports, inconjunction with a global economic expansion that is becoming more synchronous (Chart 6).Imports are also expanding; the increases we are seeing in imports of machinery and equipmentand of various intermediate products are early signals of rising business investment. It was inthis context that the Bank of Canada decided, in July and again earlier this month, to raise our 7 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
policy rate. We will be paying close attention to how the economy responds to both higherinterest rates and the stronger Canadian dollar.Looking ahead, Canada’s openness to international trade is an important determinant ofCanada’s economic growth potential—that is, of how fast the Canadian economy can growwithout giving rise to inflationary pressures. That growth potential could be greater than we think—if businesses find new ways to engage with GVCs and develop new products and processesto make them more productive and competitive. As in the past, further expanding Canadian firms’access to markets and to imported inputs could unlock more opportunities. An example is theCanada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, most of which willbe implemented in the next few days.  But some other developments are more concerning. With the rise in protectionist sentiment insome parts of the world, we have been entering a time of heightened uncertainty about the rulesof the game on international trade. The possibility of a material protectionist shift—particularlyregarding the outcome of negotiations on possible changes to NAFTA—is a key source ofuncertainty for Canada’s economic outlook.Given the nature of international trade in the 21st century, the stakes are very high. As Idiscussed, the economic benefits we have experienced from trade liberalization were not only inexpanding the markets for Canadian exports. We also benefit from the greater efficiencies thatcan be achieved by those exporters that do expand, the heightened competition and betteraccess to imported inputs that come with greater openness to imports, and the resulting spur toinnovation throughout the GVCs. If trading rules are changed in a way that undermines thesebenefits, the result would be both lost external demand for exports and lower potential growth forCanada as well as for the United States and other trading partners. 8 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
ConclusionAs an open economy, Canada’s fortunes will continue to rise or fall with trade, as they havethroughout our history. Global economic forces—the sharp movement of commodity prices; theGreat Recession and the lacklustre global economy in its aftermath; and, for much of the pastdecade, a strong Canadian dollar—battered many of our export industries and splintered theirsupply chains. Rebuilding them requires the emergence of brand-new industries and thedevelopment of new linkages to international trade networks. While it will take time for many ofthese adjustments to play out, we are now seeing encouraging signs that exports and businessinvestment are broadening and strengthening.    At the Bank of Canada, we have made a lot of progress in understanding the changing nature ofworld trade and especially why it has taken so long for our exports to recover. But as thedynamics of trade continue to evolve with technology and other forces, we will closely monitorand analyze these developments. This is essential, given the importance of trade to theeconomic well-being of Canadians.  I would like to thank Patrick Alexander and Karyne Charbonneau for their help in preparing thisspeech.R.

   Annual Financial Lunch of the French Chamber of Great Britain London, 23 November 2017  Speech by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France   “Europe, France and the United Kingdom:  facing our common economic challenges”         Press contact: Clémence Choutet (+ 33 1 42 97 74 51; clemence.choutet@banque-france.fr). 
Page 1 sur 5  Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be in London today and I wish to thank you for inviting me to speak at your Annual Financial Lunch. The destiny of France and the United Kingdom has indeed been linked for a very long time; the existence of the French Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain, which was established 143 years ago, is a good illustration of these firm and lasting ties. In this regard, I would like to express our full solidarity for the series of terrorist attacks that hit London recently. King Georges VI declared in 1940, and his words still apply to this day, that: “It is not the walls that make the city, but the people who live within them. The walls of London may be battered, but the spirit of the Londoner stands resolute and undismayed.”  I believe that the spirit of resilience that is so characteristic of Londoners is what we need the most in times of crisis. We are and will always remain close friends and partners, even if we will no longer – unfortunately – be in the same European Club when Brexit is completed. Today, I will first elaborate on two challenges that will continue uniting us: the need for good national economic policies, pro-business and long-term oriented; and the need for active multilateralism to face our global challenges. Then, I will dwell on a challenge that we will have to address together: our future relationship and Brexit.   ** I. The need for pro-business and long-term national economic policies  Let me start with the challenge of national economic policies. In the euro area, the economic recovery is now robust and broadly-based across countries and sectors. GDP growth should stand at at least 2.2% in 2017 according to our ECB forecast. The ECB’s accommodative monetary policy has contributed to this acceleration of growth in the euro area. Yet monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. Structural reforms in each country, along with stronger European coordination, are of the essence to boost potential growth in the medium term and to treat the fatal disease of mass unemployment. In recent years, several European countries, including in Southern Europe, have successfully carried out in-depth reforms that are yielding positive results in terms of growth and employment. Germany, the Netherlands and Nordic countries, as well as Spain and Portugal, are proof that economic success,  a solid single currency, and the European social model are compatible. We should run  pro-business, long-term oriented, fiscally sound economic policies, while keeping the core elements of a common social model, which can be the DNA and pride of Europe in this highly divided world. The social model that we share in the Eurozone combines a high level of public service, relatively low levels of inequality – much lower than in the United States – and a good intensity of social dialogue. Call it “social market economy” if you want, without prejudice to the intense and legitimate debate within the UK today.  
Page 2 sur 5  In France, growth has started to pick up, reaching 0.6% and 0.5% in the second and third quarters of 2017 respectively. However, despite strong job creation, the unemployment rate is still high, at 9.4% in the third quarter of 2017. Therefore, stepping up reforms is now a priority in France too, with a focus on two main areas: sustainably consolidating our public finances, and aiming to achieve a structural economic transformation, with a major simplification effort in the labour market, and large-scale investment in education, vocational training and apprenticeships.  The new government, under Mr. Macron’s Presidency, has made decisive steps in that direction. I stress this as an independent central banker. As regards public finances, France still has one of the highest public spending levels among OECD countries, at 56% of GDP in 2016. The French government is committed to reducing this ratio by 3 GDP points within the next 5 years. Besides, measures have been taken to keep public deficits below the threshold of 3% of GDP. For the first time in 10 years, the government deficit should be below this threshold in 2017 (2.9%). Needless to say, these efforts have to be pursued in the future, as the European Commission stressed yesterday while acknowledging the progress France had already made.    As regards the structural transformation, the government has decided to act rapidly by passing legislation by decree in the first months of its mandate. A substantial labour market reform was approved last summer and has already been implemented. It provides more flexibility to firms by giving social partners more room for negotiation and reducing uncertainties regarding contract terminations. Moreover, measures were announced to promote employment by reducing labour costs: the transformation of the CICE – credit tax for competitiveness and employment – into a permanent reduction of social contributions, and the transfer of social contributions financing health and unemployment insurance to a flat income tax with a larger base (CSG). In addition, measures have been taken to reduce the tax burden on investment; the abolition of wealth tax on all financial investments, the reduction of the corporate income tax towards the EU average or the flat tax at 30% on capital income. By supporting equity financing, these measures should hopefully enhance the creation and development of firms, especially innovative SMEs. Funds will be devoted to vocational training. A forthcoming reform of vocational training and apprenticeship is expected next year, which is badly needed as the French economy is still experiencing labour shortages despite high unemployment. These reforms should have a significant impact on growth and employment in the long term.    
Page 3 sur 5  II. The need for active multilateralism to face our global challenges. Let me now turn to my second point: the need for active multilateralism to face our global challenges. In the current context, international cooperation between countries is maybe more important than ever. Beyond the EU’s borders, and with all our partners, we have to strive to maintain the collective rules of the game in order to preserve the improvement in the global economic environment.  The global recovery has indeed been gathering pace since 2016: according to the latest IMF forecast, global growth should stand at 3.6% in 2017, after 3.2% in 2016. However, there are two major risks threatening growth: first, financial instability, with the continued rise in global public and private debt since the start of the 2000s – from 190% of global GDP in 2001 to 230% in 2016. The 2008 crisis stemmed from this, but this trend has unfortunately not slowed down since; the private debt in emerging countries (namely corporate debt) has risen particularly rapidly. Any temptation to dilute the financial regulations implemented in the wake of the 2008 crisis would be all the more worrying.  Since the G20 summits of London and Pittsburgh in 2009, the regulatory effort that has been undertaken is unprecedented, in particular in the banking sector: by increasing both the quantity and quality of banking sector own funds, the Basel III reform has considerably enhanced the robustness of banks; in addition, it ensures better account is now taken of the diverse risks to which banks are exposed, thanks to the introduction of two new liquidity ratios for bank cash levels. But beyond Basel III, we should finalise measures that target non-banks. We must ensure a balance between financing channels. The priority has now shifted from the solvency of banks, which has improved substantially, to the liquidity of the shadow banking sector, particularly funds and asset management companies that are exposed to the risks of sudden panic-driven runs. We have to make sure that this internationally agreed regulatory framework is implemented everywhere with consistency. Unilateral deregulation would be nothing less than a lose-lose scenario with serious consequences for the stability of the global financial system – we would be paving the way for the next financial crisis – as well as the competitive landscape for US, British and European banks. As Bank of England Governor and Financial Stability Board Chair Mark Carney advocated in Washington in April, what we need is: “the combination of robust international standards and greater trust as a consequence of transparent implementation and intensive supervisory cooperation”.  The second risk is related to the protectionist tendencies in the United States, after the election of the president. We, Europeans, shoulder-to-shoulder with Canada, Japan and others elsewhere, must resolutely defend international economic relations based on 
Page 4 sur 5  commonly respected rules and multilateral institutions: their deterioration would dampen world trade and economic activity.  III. Our future relationship and Brexit. There is one obvious challenge nevertheless that we will have to face together: our future relationship and Brexit. A year and a half ago, the British people chose to leave the EU and, even if we regret it, we respect this democratic decision. Now we have to work towards reducing uncertainty and the negative impact it may have for the United Kingdom and, albeit to a lesser extent, for the European Union. The Banque de France is not directly involved in the Brexit negotiations; this falls within the remit of governments and the European Commission, and more specifically Michel Barnier, who is conducting this mission with impressive commitment. I sincerely wish that we can achieve a constructive agreement. Let me say it loud and clear: no one is seeking to punish the UK in any way and we truly hope to keep the UK as a close partner. But preserving the interests of the EU, its citizens, its businesses, its Member States, means that the agreement with the UK should not undermine what we have managed to achieve in Europe in the economic field: one of our strongest assets is our single market; it removes all internal borders and regulatory obstacles to the free movement of goods, capital, services, and persons in the European Union. For the sake of consistency, there is one principle in particular to which we have to stick in preparing the agreement between the EU and the UK: in the single market, you cannot separate access and rules. For the financial services industry, this means that you can hardly expect to obtain a European passport if you do not accept the single market's rules.  London is and will remain in the future a global financial centre, but the architecture of the European financial system may have to evolve in this regard. We cannot foresee the outcome of the negotiations – which I hope will be in the interest of both parties – but all actors should as of now undertake all the necessary preparations to avoid any potential “cliff-edge” risk. London will and should probably continue to attract and transform savings from all over the world. In this respect, on a more personal note, allow me to comment on what I read with surprise in some British newspapers last July: I personally never met with the City’s Special Representative to the EU, Mr Browne, and the Banque de France has never wished for Brexit to be detrimental to the City of London, and we have friendly and frequent contact with the City of London Corporation.  But, besides savings from the rest of the world, the savings of the EU-27 Member States will be increasingly handled within the single market, given its significant size and the safety of its 
Page 5 sur 5  rules. This means that we will move towards some degree of “Europeanisation” for wholesale banks, insurers and asset managers.  It is symmetrically the duty of Europe and its member countries to be business-friendly and attractive to the financial industry. We should not achieve this by lowering the bar for our common regulations: the SSM, EIOPA and ESMA are duly mobilised to prevent certain entities that keep their resources outside the EU from setting up empty shell corporations in the EU, mere company name plates, to benefit from passporting rights. We should rather be attractive by offering a stable and favourable framework for investors, including infrastructures, labour skills and labour laws, and taxes. There is some fair but positive emulation in this regard. In this new environment, the Paris financial centre has obvious advantages, building on the very welcome measures announced in July by our Prime Minister to strengthen Paris’ attractiveness. To name a few, France has the biggest investment banks in continental Europe, the largest asset management industry and is the leading private equity investor; and French universities are renowned worldwide for the excellence of their finance teaching. And, last but not least, Paris will have the privilege of welcoming the EBA. Furthermore, the euro area has to keep control of the risks regarding its currency, the euro, and euro-based transactions. Some financial market infrastructures located in London, which are key for the EU, will soon become off-shore to the EU as a consequence of Brexit. This is particularly problematic when these infrastructures could put the EU’s financial stability at risk, as they represent 70% of the daily euro clearing business, equivalent to around EUR 930 billion (GBP 792 billion) in trades per dayi. This is the reason why the Commission proposed – and we support – a location policy for CCPs. Clearing activities in euro, for all those of “super-systemic” importance, must be located where the supervision of the Eurosystem can be exercised effectively. It is a matter of consistency for monetary policy and financial stability.  ** To conclude, let me quote a sentence attributed to one of the great British statesmen, Benjamin Disraeli: “circumstances are beyond human control, but our conduct is in our own power.” We are indeed going through a difficult period, which puts the friendship between our countries to the test. But we have to face it together. Our objective should be to reach a lasting and consistent agreement allowing our countries to remain closely linked to each other in the future. I believe that it is our common desire and interest. Thank you for your attention.                                                             i House of Lords, report 2016 ; https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/81/81.pdf 
William C Dudley: Higher education - financing, costs and returnsOpening remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, at the Conference on “Higher Education Financing and Costs andReturns of Higher Education”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City, 7 December2017.*   *   *Good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed for today’s conference onthe costs and returns of higher education and higher education financing.  I am delighted to seesuch broad interest and attention from the academic community on this topic. The role ofeducation and education financing in today’s labor market and economy has never been moreimportant.  It is a topic that I have spoken about frequently during my tenure here at the New YorkFed, especially with regard to education’s importance for economic mobility. Understandingeducational investment decisions and their macroeconomic implications requires rigorousanalysis from top academic researchers like you.  Let me briefly discuss some developmentsthat I find particularly significant and worthy of investigation. As always, what I say represents myown views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the FederalReserve System.As has been well documented by Raj Chetty and his co-authors, income inequality hasincreased in recent decades, while economic mobility has stagnated.  Meanwhile, absolutemobility appears to have fallen, indicated by the declining share of children who earn more thantheir parents.  The combination of high inequality and low mobility is problematic, because itmeans that being born into a low-income family is more consequential today than in the past. Since education is a key determinant of upward mobility, one way to increase economic mobilityin the United States would be to increase overall post-secondary educational attainment.  Thereare, however, a number of important barriers to achieving that goal.First, many high school students and their parents appear to lack accurate information about thereturns obtained from a college education.  New York Fed research shows evidence ofsystematic underestimation of the average benefits—and overestimation of costs—of a collegeeducation, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college households.  Research byCaroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner shows that among low-income high school students, evenvery high achievers are poorly informed about the academic options that are available and theireffects on career opportunities.  This research finds that the provision of relevant information canlead to markedly better outcomes.A second impediment is the lack of preparedness among new college entrants, with largenumbers of those students needing remedial courses that earn no college credit.  Low readinesscontributes to persistently low college completion rates, especially among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students.  Higher dropout rates, in turn, contribute to a substantialreduction in the net expected and realized returns from college attendance.The third major barrier to college attendance and completion is the rise in the cost of a collegeeducation.  While a college education is generally a good investment, the cost of attending a four-year college has risen considerably faster than wages over the last several decades.  Thismeans that college has become increasingly unaffordable—which can act as a drag oneconomic mobility and the growth of a college-educated workforce, and by extension, onproductivity growth and living standards.As has been well documented by my New York Fed colleagues, many young Americans haveadjusted to rising tuition and fees by taking on more debt.  This trend highlights the importance ofthe federal student loan program, which has helped mitigate the impact of the shift in financing of1 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
higher education from state and local funding to students and their families over the past fewdecades.  However, the end result is that more students leave college with significantly higheramounts of debt.  Student loan debt has more than tripled over the past two decades and nowtotals over $1.4 trillion.It is important to consider what these changes in financing higher education mean for economicmobility.  First, New York Fed researchers have documented that a large percentage of studentborrowers—especially those who attend less selective colleges or drop out—have troublestaying current on their loans, and often become delinquent and default on their debt.  We alsoknow that these factors—slow repayment, delinquency, and default—are most prevalent amongthose from more modest family circumstances.  In addition, there is evidence that student debtacts as a drag on homeownership.  Specifically, our research indicates that when college tuitionrises in a state, it leads to higher levels of student debt and a lower homeownership rate.  Thesefactors matter for inequality and social mobility, because increasing home equity is the majorform of wealth accumulation for the great majority of American families.  Thus, rising tuition andchanges in the way that college is financed appear to have diminished the ability of highereducation to lift people from poverty into the middle class.Of course, students’ reliance on debt and the returns from graduating vary across educationalinstitutions.  Of particular interest here is recent work by Raj Chetty and his co-authors showingthat some colleges—some of which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems—appear to be much better at fostering economic mobility than others.  In other words, they acceptrelatively large numbers of lower-income students while also producing large numbers of highearners, which means that these institutions facilitate considerable upward mobility.  Learningexactly how they do it and how it can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for furtherstudy.  Recent research by Caroline Hoxby to assess differences in productivity acrosseducational institutions makes important progress in that direction.In summary, academic research on the financing, costs, and returns of higher education is moreimportant now than it has ever been.  We are pleased to have many of those researchersparticipating in this conference. I would like to thank Raji Chakrabarti and Wilbert van der Klaauwand the New York Fed’s Research Group for organizing this timely conference, and for bringingtogether this superb group of scholars.  Thank you all for your participation.  I wish you a veryproductive and enjoyable conference.Betsy Bourassa, Rajashri Chakrabarti, Andrew Haughwout, and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparingthese remarks.1 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Kevin Stiroh: Misconduct risk, culture and supervisionRemarks by Mr Kevin Stiroh, Executive Vice President of the Financial Institution SupervisionGroup of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Culture Roundtable Session withBusiness Schools and Financial Services Industry, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, NewYork City, 7 December 2017.*   *   *Good morning everyone.Thank you for joining us at the New York Fed today and for your ongoing participation in theimportant discussion around culture and ethics in the financial services sector. This workshopand discussion are a critical part of our ongoing collective efforts on promoting financial industryculture reform. Business schools serve as a major supply source of the talent pool for mid-levelmanagement positions in the industry. This relationship makes aligning business educationcurricula and pedagogy with demands around improving industry culture a mutually beneficialstrategy.While your conversation today has focused on the role of academia and industry, I want to takethis opportunity to share with you how I’ve been thinking about the role of bank supervisors in theculture reform dialogue. I am the head of the Supervision Group of New York Fed, but myperspective and approach are influenced by my background and training as an economist. You’llhear me talk about frictions and market failures; about production processes and intangiblecapital; and the conceptual rationale for a role for the official sector.There are, of course, multiple ways to consider the relationship between culture and banksupervision. I hope my remarks, which are based on a whitepaper we published earlier today, willoffer a complementary perspective to the type of work already underway by other supervisorsand regulators, including the UK regulators (FCA and PRA), the Australian Prudential RegulationAuthority (APRA), DeNederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),and other institutions like the Financial Stability Board and the Group of Thirty (G30). I amfocusing my remarks today specifically on “misconduct risk,” but the conceptual arguments andframework apply more broadly to financial sector risk management in general.Please note that the views I express today are my own and they do not necessarily reflect thoseof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.Misconduct RiskA primary goal of bank regulators and supervisors is to support the sustained provision offinancial services to households and businesses in a fair and transparent way. In order to do this,we examine financial institutions, individually and collectively. We assess safety and soundnessto ensure firms have the appropriate risk identification and risk management processes forprudent banking. We hold them to standards that require them to be resilient to a broad range ofpotential risks such as credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.One specific risk is employee “misconduct risk.” We define this as the potential for behaviors orbusiness practices that are illegal, unethical, or contrary to a firm’s stated values, policies, andprocedures. The impact of employee misconduct extends beyond the individual and can impactthe firm as a whole, as well as the economy and financial markets more broadly. That is,misconduct risk has both prudential and financial stability implications.For a firm, employee misconduct can make it less resilient by diverting management attention,by harming the firm’s reputation in a way that impedes its business, by driving adverse change inthe composition of the workforce, or by depleting its capital through losses or fines. Since 2008,1 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
for example, firms have paid, in aggregate, in excess of $320 billion in fines related tomisconduct.For the broader economy and financial markets, misconduct can inflict harm directly onconsumers and employees. In addition, over time, market participants may lose confidence inthe financial sector as a whole and adversely impact the sector’s critical role in financialintermediation. In 2016, for example, Gallup found that confidence in the financial sector hadfallen by half over the previous decade.These incidents of misconduct can introduce frictions and raise the cost of financialintermediation, which in turn, reduces the flow of productive financial services. These sorts ofexternal effects that spill over to other firms, consumers, and businesses are a critical rationalefor official sector intervention related to employee misconduct.In the U.S., official sector concern with the damage inflicted by employee misconduct dates backto the Banking Act of 1933. More recently, supervisors have traditionally addressed firm’smanagement of misconduct risk by assessing the effectiveness of firms’ risk management andinternal control functions, such as compliance and audit. Yet, despite regulations, supervisoryfocus, and firms’ own efforts, significant misconduct risk and bad outcomes continue. Why?What explains this persistence?One hypothesis is that recent problems are just a stream of idiosyncratic events, random drawsof “bad apples.” Another hypothesis is that some firms have operational weaknesses, “badprocesses,” that allow these outcomes to occur. I don’t believe, however, that either of thesehypotheses tells the whole story.Root cause analyses of many recent cases of misconduct in the financial sector suggest thatmisconduct is not just the product of a few individuals or bad processes, but rather the result ofwider organizational breakdowns, enabled by a firm’s culture. From both a prudential perspectiveand a financial stability perspective, misconduct risk threatens our core supervisory objective tosustain the efficient provision of financial services to the economy. This suggests thatsupervisors have an obligation to promote strong internal practices and behaviors that mitigatemisconduct risk and create a healthy culture.Misconduct Risk and Cultural CapitalOne way to think about this is “cultural capital.” A firm’s cultural capital is a type of asset thatimpacts what a firm produces and how it operates. It is analogous to physical capital, likeequipment, buildings and property, or to human capital, like the accumulated knowledge andskills of workers, or reputational capital, like the franchise value or brand recognition. Culturalcapital is an input into a firm’s production process—impacting how it does its business.Cultural capital is an intangible asset. That is, we generally experience the impact rather than thething itself—but its impact can be measured, assessed, and ultimately influenced. For example,in an organization with a high level of cultural capital, misconduct risk is low and observedstructures, processes, formal incentives, and desired business outcomes are consistent withthe firm’s stated values. The unspoken patterns of behavior reinforce this alignment. Problemsare escalated to senior managers routinely, as employees feel empowered to raise their handand believe that their efforts will result in meaningful responses. And senior leaders advancethrough the organization because, in addition to strong business performance, they set a credibletone from above by modeling behaviors consistent with the firm’s values.By contrast, consider some characteristics of an organization with low levels of cultural capital.In these firms, formal policies and procedures do not reflect “the way things are really done.” Thestated values of the organization are not reflected in senior leader behaviors and actions of the234567 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
organization’s members, and misconduct results from norms and pressures that driveindividuals to make decisions that are not aligned with the values, business strategies, and riskappetite set by the board and senior leaders. Employees do not speak freely when they haveconcerns, and senior managers or the board of directors do not find out about improper conductuntil it is uncovered by the authorities. Rules may be followed to the letter, but not in spirit. All ofthis increases misconduct risk and potentially damages the firm and the industry over time.Like other forms of tangible and intangible capital, firms must invest or its capital will deteriorateover time and adversely impact the firm’s productive capacity. To be clear, cultural capital is notloss absorbing like equity capital, but it can be loss preventing by influencing decisions,behaviors, and outcomes over time.Market Failures and Misconduct RiskIf this is the case and misconduct risk is bad for the firm, some obvious questions follow: Whydon’t firms invest in cultural capital and reduce the risk themselves? Why do regulators andsupervisors need to get involved?I believe firms are ultimately responsible for these decisions and we do observe progress. Manylarge financial firms have increased their attention to misconduct risk and cultural drivers in thewake of serious frauds and enforcement actions over the past several years. But, the degree ofcommitment and progress in these efforts has not been even across the industry and serious orpersistent misconduct continues in some firms.So, why wouldn’t a firm do more? One can turn to traditional economic theory to offer anexplanation for why a firm might underinvest in cultural capital. Firms may operate with levels ofcultural capital beneath both the social optimum and even the private optimum due to differenttypes of market failures. Today I will consider three well-known phenomenon—externalities,principal-agent problems, and adverse selection—that may explain why misconduct risk persistsand why firms might underinvest in cultural capital relative to what might be socially optimal.ExternalitiesExternalities are the impact that one actor has on other, unrelated actors. Externalities can drivea wedge between private and socially optimally outcomes and, from a supervisors’ perspective,lead firms to underinvest in their own resiliency by ignoring the broader impact of bad outcomeson the financial sector and the real economy.In other contexts like environmental policy, externalities such as pollution motivate governmentintervention. In banking regulation, externalities are the conceptual driver behind the enhancedprudential standards for capital, liquidity, and risk management that are currently applied to thelargest, most systemically important financial institutions.Principal-agent problemsPrincipal-agent problems reflect incentives for employees to act in ways that don’t align with thebroader interests of management or shareholders. This can lead to excessive risk-taking,underinvestment in risk-reduction and risk-control mechanisms, and a focus on short-termreturns at the cost of long-run viability. Think about the trader who is compensated on short-termP&L and not long-term value creation.These issues can be amplified by the opacity intrinsic to many financial activities that allowsmisconduct to persist and erodes the cultural capital of the firm.8 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Adverse selectionAdverse selection occurs when those particularly ill-suited for something are the most likely toparticipate. This could be a complicating factor in this context if conduct-related events changethe composition of a firm’s workforce. Firms with relatively low cultural capital (and a relativelyhigh tolerance of misconduct risk) may attract and retain employees and clients more inclined totake inappropriate risks and push beyond internal limits and controls. Further, high-qualitydirectors, executives, and employees might leave such firms or decline to join them, depletingthe firm’s human capital and contributing to the deterioration of cultural capital.Role of the Official SectorThese are some of the types of market failures that may explain why a firm might not investenough in its cultural capital to mitigate risks, including misconduct risk. And they suggest a rolefor the official sector to encourage resiliency, including investment in cultural capital, beyondwhat the firm would choose to do on its own. That is, if firms don’t have sufficient incentives toovercome these forces, then the official sector should push toward a better outcome.In the case of misconduct risk, supervision seems like a particularly appropriate approachbecause the hard-to-define and evolving nature of behavior likely prevents easy regulatorysolutions. Though some rule-writing could help re-align incentives, misconduct risk can takemany different forms and, by its nature, seek to circumvent the rules.Essential drivers of culture and of misconduct risk, for example, relate to leadership and “tonefrom above,” areas that are inherently behavioral and qualitative in nature. Supervisors canassess behaviors in an ongoing manner and help to identify potential risks.I’ll note that the need for a supervisory focus on employee misconduct and its underlying driversdates back one and a half centuries to the origins of bank supervision. Then, in the U.S., theemphasis was on the “responsibility and integrity” of bank managers and directors and itsrelationship “to public confidence.” Part of the role of supervisors is to close gaps in the rulesto advance safe and sound banking practices that support the sustained provision of financialservices. Issues like misconduct risk and culture likely fall in these gaps because they involve theattitudes, norms, and behaviors and suggest a critical role for supervisors in addressing theserisks.ConclusionTo conclude, misconduct risk poses clear threats to both prudential and financial stabilityobjectives. The work supervisors do to address misconduct challenges is critical because thereare limits to the regulatory or deterrence and enforcement approach. To understand how a firmmanages misconduct risk and to improve resiliency and reduce the potential for unwanteddisruptions to financial intermediation, we must increase our focus on firms’ decision-makingpractices and behaviors as a core aspect of good governance. We can draw from the growingliterature about the root causes of misconduct and the underlying factors that drive unhealthycultures to support this goal.However, as I am sure you already appreciate, addressing culture reform across an entireindustry is a complex challenge and there is no one action or approach that will fully address it.We all must be willing to work at this from our various vantage points, as supervisors, asacademics, and as industry participants. As you reflect on the conversations you have had today,the points that were raised, and the potential paths forward, I encourage you to consider theimportant role you each play and the potential impact we, collectively, can have by workingtogether toward the ultimate goal of ensuring a safe and sound financial system that supportseconomic growth and stability.91011 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

Vítor Constâncio: Challenges for euro area monetary policy in early2018Speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 32ndInternational ZinsFORUM, Frankfurt am Main, 6 December 2017.*   *   *The Governing Council of the ECB at its October meeting decided to reduce the rate of monthlyasset purchases. In my remarks today, I would like to explain the rationale behind that decision,and how it remains consistent with our mandate for price stability.In short, as our asset holdings rise and the growth outlook improves, unchanged policyparameters actually imply greater monetary stimulus. Furthermore, I am confident that theapparent disconnect between growth and inflation is a temporary phenomenon and that inflationdynamics will increase.It is therefore possible for us to scale back our net asset purchases, while keeping our policysufficiently accommodative to support those inflation dynamics. If one extrapolates from thecurrent brighter economic outlook, one cannot imagine that we would need to extend further ourpresent purchases. A symmetric approach to our inflation mission would therefore be moreappropriate than a one-dimensional promise to do more in case of deflation. Managing QExit willbe challenging, however.While ending the purchase programme quickly could provoke undue market reactions, we shouldnot overlook the fact that the longer our asset purchase programme continues, the less effectivethe programme and the greater the risks attached to it become. Having a credible view of the exitis important to keep any such risks contained.The recent policy decisionLet me begin with the adjustments to our monetary policy parameters made in the OctoberGoverning Council meeting. The asset purchase programme will be extended to September2018, at the lower amount of €30 billion per month, or beyond if necessary, until the GoverningCouncil sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its definition of pricestability.This decision was made in an environment of robust demand growth, but with still modestincreases in the underlying inflation rate. We have now benefited from 18 uninterrupted quartersof economic growth, with indicators pointing to continued robust growth. The unemployment gap– an established measure of labour market slack – is now closed, and employment has reachedits highest ever level in the euro area.In short, our monetary policy has successfully stimulated demand and returned slack resourcesinto productive use. One would expect this strong demand to generate a marked increase ininflationary pressures. Yet this has not yet fully materialised in the euro area, although signs ofinflationary pressures and limits to the lags have been constant for the last six month. Why thenhave we reduced our purchases before without there being a substantial adjustment in inflation?The decision to reduce the monthly rate of purchases rests on two factors. The first involvesunderstanding how the stimulus provided by our asset purchases evolves over time, and thesecond relates to the relationship between output and inflation.The recessions caused by the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis requiredsignificant monetary stimulus to counter the large degree of slack in the economy and ensurethat inflation remained consistent with our price stability definition. Monetary policy also had to 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
react to a number of headwinds, which reduced the impact of a given level of interest rates oneconomic demand.Some, such as an ageing population and the slowdown in measured productivity growth, arelonger term in nature. Others were more temporary. The process of deleveraging pushed updesired saving, uncertainty weighed on investment and a prolonged period of low inflationthreatened to de-anchor inflation expectations, with a risk of outright deflation.But as the ongoing recovery gains momentum, the influence of these temporary headwinds isfading. Fears of deflation have dissipated. In these circumstances, unchanged monetary policyparameters would in fact imply an unwarranted increase in monetary stimulus, and when onelooks at the 10-year German government bond yield since the summer one might conclude that,despite fewer purchases, we had eased our monetary policy, a step which does not correspondto our plan.A further reason why the Governing Council elected to scale back our monthly purchases is that,as the size of our portfolio increases, the marginal impact of a given level of purchasesincreases. Owing to our already large bond holdings, the free float of securities is nowsubstantially lower than when we began our programme in 2015. This increases the relativeshare of our purchases in the market, and therefore the impact of those purchases per billioneuro spent. In other words, a slower pace of purchases today can have an equivalent effect onyields as a higher pace yesterday.Moreover, as the stock of bonds rises, our reinvestment needs rise in tandem and we have toincrease our gross purchases – that is, our net purchases plus our reinvestments; and do that inan environment of lower new borrowing in most euro area countries. This means that, even witha slower pace of net purchases, the Eurosystem will still have a substantial presence in themarket. Indeed, cumulative redemptions of around €150 billion are expected in 2018.For all these reasons, an adjustment to our policy stance was necessary at our last meeting. Bythe same logic, we should be able to further adjust our policy in the future as confidenceincreases about the robustness of the recovery without choking off growth or inflation. And themore the recovery advances, the less the economy depends on unconventional monetary policystimulus and benefits from balance sheets repair, structural reforms and fiscal tailwinds.As for the current rate of inflation, it is worth noting that the euro area is by no means the onlydeveloped economy exhibiting robust output growth with inflation rates below historicalexperience. I do not have time today to do justice to all the various explanations put forward byeconomists. In truth, I’m not particularly persuaded by any of them. I do not believe that suchfactors will prevent us from achieving our mandate over the medium term. We may take a littlelonger to achieve our objective, but achieve it we will.Let me focus on just one explanation – that the relationship between domestic slack and inflation,termed the Phillips curve, has become so flat that changes in output have little effect on inflation.Prolonged periods of low inflation can reduce wage growth, since wage-setters pay someattention to past outturns. Moreover, job insecurity, digitalisation and high unemployment haveencouraged unions to prioritise employment over wages. And the deep downturn has led tobroader slack in the labour market – i.e. involuntary part-time and temporary work – that needs tobe reabsorbed before wage pressures rise.Yet we are going through a transition phase out of a very deep crisis, and these downward forcesshould wane. Indeed, the difference between the headline unemployment rate and broadermeasures of labour market slack has already edged down in the past two years. The share offirms that say that labour shortages are limiting their production is at its highest level ever inmanufacturing and services. This is translating into higher wage growth now, and in turncontributing to a pick-up in inflation. Various measures of underlying inflation, which is key for1 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
assessing durability, appear to have turned a corner.I say “appear”, because policymakers should be humble in their pronouncements. Estimates ofthe degree of slack in the economy vary widely and are often revised. Model outputs, howevercomplex they may be, should be treated with due caution, and judgement based on experienceremains an essential part of the policymaking process. We should avoid making unwarrantedstatements about points in time too far into the future over which we have little true visibility.It also means that policy decisions not only should be based on the most likely outcomepredicted by models, but should also take into account the balance of risks. There are timeswhen the risk of inaction far outstrips the risk of action, and the prudent course is to act withvigour. Introducing asset purchases to stave off the risk of deflation is one recent example. Butthere are also times when the balance of risks lies in the opposite direction, and prudencedictates that policymakers should be more circumspect.Future challenges for monetary policyOn that note, while I believe that the forces already at work should in due course bring an end tothe need for asset purchases, it is a matter for the ECB’s Governing Council to decide on theexact timing of such a move. Our approach should evolve in tandem with our improvedexpectations for developments in the real economy and ensure that our mandate for pricestability is fulfilled over the medium term.Let me instead spend a few moments considering some of the risks we face in implementing ourpolicy over the coming years. I should also add at this point that these risks are likely to grow thelonger our asset purchase programme continues.The first risk relates to the subsiding deflationary headwinds I have already mentioned. Could itbe that our current monetary setting is suddenly too accommodative? In short, because of theuncertainties and imprecisions involved in measuring slack and inflationary pressures in theeconomy, we might find ourselves behind the curve without realising it. Hence, through the longand variable lags of monetary policy, we will end up with inflation above the rate consistent withour price stability mandate.This would require a sharp correction of the monetary policy settings in years to come. Yet sucha correction of interest rates would pose risks to the financial sector. Banks could be hit hard asfunding costs rise faster than interest income on outstanding loans.The second risk is a related one, in that these factors could have already unwound, and inflationcould turn out much higher than we expect over the course of 2018. We would find ourselvesbehind the curve – and realise it – but the optimal monetary policy response would involve ushaving to adjust our forward guidance.This forward guidance was put in place to stabilise market expectations and to enhance theeffectiveness of our asset purchases. This is because we indicate that interest rates will riseonly when we are “well past” the horizon for asset purchases. So prolonging asset purchasespushes out market expectations of the first rate rise, depressing interest rate expectationsacross the curve. Of course, the effectiveness of that guidance also relies on market beliefs ofour future actions.In effect, forward guidance is a promise not to react to data outturns in the future so as topersuade markets to maintain low expectations for interest rates. But if we offer guidance thatextends too far into the distance, beyond the point where we can form reasonable expectationsabout the economy, it risks unduly tying our hands unless this is backed by unanimity in theGoverning Council.2 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
This is a particular risk at present when, as I described earlier, any future increase in interestrates needs to be gradual, and hence moving late could result in policy remaining too loose fortoo long. Certainly as the time comes to reconsider our monetary policy stance during the courseof 2018, we should reflect at length on the degree to which we wish to pre-commit ourselves.Risks to monetary policy extend beyond the immediate outlook for inflation. Our policies havereduced the spread over risk-free interest rates paid by households and firms for their borrowing,and unblocked the flow of credit to the real economy. Such spreads are at their lowest ever level.Yet reduced spreads may encourage investment in businesses that are only profitable at lowinterest rates, and such loans risk turning sour as interest rates rise. Indeed, banks and investorsmay be tempted to “search for yield”, without being adequately recompensed for the risk they aretaking on. The normal place for monetary policy is not at the long end of the yield curve, but at theshort end.The focus of monetary policy is of course on our price stability mandate, and ensuring financialstability risks are adequately mitigated is the role of microprudential supervision andmacroprudential policy. While there is little evidence at present of area-wide credit-fuelledbubbles, there are some notable localised pockets, such as in commercial real estate, andevidence of “search for yield” behaviour.The financial crisis showed how such risks can interfere with the smooth operation of monetarypolicy through their effects on banks, which remain a key part of the monetary transmissionmechanism in the euro area. We should therefore bear in mind that these risks could potentiallycomplicate our ability to meet our price stability mandate in the future.There are other longer-term risks to monetary policy, namely through the allocation of credit toboth productive and unproductive firms. By reducing interest rates for all firms, monetary policymay indirectly permit inefficient firms to remain in business – becoming so-called zombie firms.This blunts the productivity-enhancing function of downturns to bring about “creative destruction”,whereby inefficient firms are forced out of business, freeing up resources to move to moreefficient firms and boosting aggregate productivity. Indeed, there is evidence that creativedestruction was weaker during the Great Recession than in previous downturns and thatzombie firms have weighed on productivity growth in some euro area countries.Productivity growth plays an important role in raising aggregate living standards, but it alsoaffects the conduct of monetary policy. Higher productivity growth spurs investment, andexpectations of higher future income encourage households to spend more today. Thus slowerproductivity growth requires monetary policy to lower interest rates by more than would otherwisebe the case to stimulate the economy. Given that interest rates are currently low, and our stockof purchases is quite large, this would restrict our ability to respond to future downward shocks.What I have just explained are the economic risks arising from a potential misallocation betweenproductive and unproductive businesses brought about by our asset purchases. But there arealso legal risks for the ECB regarding our Treaty obligations. Article 127 requires that we “act inaccordance with the principle of an open market economy … favouring an efficient allocation ofresources”. Thus, in respecting our price stability mandate, we should only do as much as isnecessary, and be aware of potential side effects from running expansive policy for too long.An important principle of an open market economy is price formation in markets through theinteraction of private sector agents. It should be those interactions that ensure correct pricing,notably of credit risk, and not the interactions created by our asset purchases.It is clear that, with the Eurosystem now owning public and private sector assets amounting toover €2 trillion, we have become a bigger player in the market than ever before. This means thatwe are now buying bonds from more price-insensitive investors, such as pension funds and34 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
insurance companies, bidding up the price at which we need to pay. Liquidity conditions areexpected to become more challenging in certain market segments the longer the purchasingprogramme remains active.As such, we have to be mindful not to exert an undue influence on price formation.Another potential complication relates to our public sector purchases. A key safeguard that wehave set up for these purchases is to operate so-called “blackout periods”, where we do not buyaround the date of a new issuance. This facilitates price formation and ensures that Article 123 ofthe Treaty is fully respected – the monetary financing prohibition.Mindful of self-imposed constraints in this respect the remaining space for both net and grosspurchases will largely be in newly issued bonds. This poses some potential complications thatwe have to monitor very closely.ConclusionLet me conclude.The recovery in the euro area continues at a robust pace, employment has risen strongly. Bothwages and underlying inflation appear to have turned the corner.At its October meeting, the Governing Council chose to reduce the rate of net asset purchases,which, as I have explained today, prevented an unwarranted increase in monetary stimulus. Wewill continue to monitor developments in the economy and set policy in a way that is consistentwith our price stability mandate.In doing so, we must also take into account the balance of risks when setting policy.If we withdraw our monetary policy stimulus too early and too fast, asset prices could drop andyields rise sharply, with negative spill-over effects to the economy. At the same time, we have tobe mindful, as our asset purchase programme continues, that the risks attached to it mayincrease the longer it lasts. Nourishing a market belief that the exit might be permanentlypostponed could exacerbate the potential cliff effects. A credible perspective on exit is needed tokeep these risks contained.A sense of proportion will therefore be crucial in managing the QExit.See, e.g., Gordon, R. (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living since the CivilWar, Princeton University Press.

Takako Masai Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Hyogo Bank of JapanDecember 6, 2017(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1 I. Developments in Economic Activity and Prices I would like to start my speech with a look at developments in economic activity and prices.  At the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2017, the Bank of Japan published the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, or the Outlook Report. In this report, the Bank presented its projections for Japan's economic activity and prices through fiscal 2019.   I will explain developments in economic activity and prices by presenting the main content of the Outlook Report.  A. Overseas Economies Let me first touch on developments in overseas economies. The Bank's assessment is that overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace on the whole.  In terms of the outlook, advanced economies are projected to continue growing steadily, and a recovery in emerging economies is likely to take hold on the back of the steady growth in advanced economies and the effects of policy measures taken by emerging economies. A similar view was presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released in October 2017 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In recent years, the IMF has often revised downward the projections for global growth, but from early fiscal 2017, it has revised them upward.  Looking at developments by major region, the U.S. economy has continued to recover, mainly in household spending, owing to a steady improvement in the employment and income situation. As for the outlook, the economy is expected to continue to see firm growth driven by domestic private demand.  The European economy also has continued to recover steadily and it will likely follow a moderate recovery trend.  
2 The Chinese economy will likely continue to broadly follow a stable growth path as the authorities conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a timely manner.  Other emerging economies and commodity-exporting economies have picked up on the whole, particularly reflecting an increase in exports, the past bottoming out of commodity prices, and the effects of economic stimulus measures in those economies. The growth rates of these economies are likely to increase gradually, due mainly to the spread of the effects of steady growth in advanced economies.   In my view, the downside risks to the global economy have been diminishing on the whole, partly because concerns over the financial sector in Europe have abated. In this situation, I am paying particular attention to firm international commodity prices; namely, crude oil prices. While uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook have been easing, it is likely that commodity-related fixed investment, which has been curtailed over the last few years, will start increasing. I expect there to be a strong possibility of the global economy continuing its steady growth through fiscal 2018.  B. Japan's Economy and Price Developments 1. Current situation Now I would like to discuss developments in economic activity and prices in Japan.  The Bank's assessment is that Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. In fiscal 2017 to date, the Bank has revised up its economic assessment twice. Industrial production has been on an increasing trend, reflecting the increases in demand both at home and abroad, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. As a result, the output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- has improved steadily.  On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend with corporate profits and business sentiment improving. According to the September 2017 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), business fixed investment plans for fiscal 2017, especially those of large enterprises, showed firms' solid 
3 stance. This is evidenced by, for example, the fact that fixed investment on a basis close to GDP definition saw a year-on-year increase of 6.9 percent -- a level clearly exceeding the past average of 4.9 percent for the September Tankan surveys during the period of fiscal 2004-2016. Private consumption has increased its resilience against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, and housing investment has been more or less flat. Exports have been on an increasing trend on the back of the growth in overseas economies that I mentioned earlier.  One of the features of the ongoing expansionary phase is that the economy has been growing across a wide range of regions, firm sizes, and industries in comparison with past expansions. In the latest September 2017 Tankan, the diffusion index for business conditions in small firms reached its highest level in almost 26 years. In the Regional Economic Report, many regions have revised their economic assessments upward in 2017. Indeed, the Kinki region, which includes Hyogo Prefecture, has revised up its assessment in the two previous reports released in July and October.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent.  2. Outlook I will now look at the outlook for Japan's economy during the projection period, which covers from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019. The economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the government's large-scale stimulus measures. Exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend along with the growth in overseas economies. Reflecting this outlook, Japan's economy is likely to maintain growth during this projection period at a pace above its potential, mainly through fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, it is expected to continue expanding, although the growth pace is projected to decelerate due to a cyclical slowdown in business fixed investment and the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled in October 2019. Looking at the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts in the October 2017 Outlook Report, the real GDP growth rate is projected to be 1.9 percent for fiscal 2017, 1.4 
4 percent for fiscal 2018, and 0.7 percent for fiscal 2019. Let me explain the outlook in detail by major component. First, business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing moderately. This is because, in a situation where extremely stimulative financial conditions are maintained, fixed investment will be positively affected by (1) an improvement in corporate profits, (2) the materialization of the effects of projects conducted under the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, and (3) moderate improvement in growth expectations. Specifically, an increase is likely to be seen in investment, particularly (1) that related to the 2020 Olympic Games and urban redevelopment projects, (2) that aiming at improving efficiency and saving labor in order to deal with the labor shortage, and (3) in research and development for growth areas. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend, due mainly to an increase in employee income as well as replacement demand for durable goods, and housing investment is expected to remain more or less flat. Exports are likely to be firm as a trend for the time being, underpinned by those of IT-related goods and capital goods, in which Japan has a comparative advantage. Thereafter, they are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend, due mainly to the improvement in overseas economies. Industrial production will likely continue to increase firmly for the time being, and thereafter is projected to continue on a moderate increasing trend.   The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase toward around 2 percent. This is because, although upward pressure of energy prices is likely to wane gradually, firms are likely to gradually shift their stance toward raising wages and prices with an improvement in the output gap, and inflation expectations are expected to accelerate moderately. In the short run, the rate of increase in prices of food products and goods related to daily necessities in particular is expected to accelerate gradually with a moderate increase in private consumption, and moves to pass on the increase in labor costs to prices of general services, including dining-out and housework-related services, are likely to prevail. Looking at the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts in the October 2017 Outlook Report, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is projected to be 0.8 percent for fiscal 2017, 1.4 percent for fiscal 2018, and -- on a basis excluding the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike -- 1.8 percent for fiscal 2019. 
5 I believe that there are the following upside and downside risks to the outlook. Risks to Japan's economic activity are developments in overseas economies, such as the U.S. economic policies and geopolitical risks, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations, as well as fiscal sustainability in the medium to long term. Risks to prices are developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations, the fact that there are items for which prices are not particularly responsive to the output gap, as well as developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward. I hold the view that, while downside risks to Japan's economic activity are limited, those to prices are fairly significant. This is particularly so because of the considerable uncertainty as to how far firms will adopt a shared attitude toward raising prices.  II. The Bank's Monetary Policy Next, I will talk about the Bank's monetary policy. With a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank has been maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions by pursuing strong monetary easing.  A. Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control The framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control the Bank has adopted consists of two major components.  The first is an "inflation-overshooting commitment" in which the Bank commits itself to continuing to expand the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. It aims at raising inflation expectations by demonstrating the Bank's unwavering determination. I will come back to this point again later.  The second component is "yield curve control," in which the Bank controls short-term and long-term interest rates. In the current framework, it sets the short-term policy interest rate and the target level of the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields as its operating targets. At present, in the guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level at around 0 percent, and conducts JGB purchases 
6 so as to achieve this target level. B. The Aim of Strong Monetary Easing Since the introduction of QQE in April 2013, the basic mechanism of monetary easing itself has not changed; that is, (1) pushing down the entire yield curve through the Bank's large-scale purchases of JGBs and (2) raising inflation expectations through the Bank's strong commitment to the 2 percent price stability target. These factors lead to a reduction in real interest rates.  Now, why does the Bank think that it is necessary to reduce interest rates to extremely low levels? The basic mechanism of monetary easing consists of driving real interest rates below the interest rate neutral to economic activity and prices; that is, the natural rate of interest. Japan's natural rate of interest has followed a downward trend, mainly reflecting the deceleration in the potential growth rate.1 The estimation results obtained by the Bank's staff suggest that the natural rate of interest has been at around 0 percent recently. Given that estimates of the rate differ depending on the methodologies employed, they should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error; however, the results show that the rate has been at an extremely low level. Therefore, in order to realize accommodative financial conditions with such a low level of the natural rate of interest, it is necessary to bring interest rates down further. I consider that the current highly accommodative financial conditions -- created by the yield curve control in this way -- have strongly supported Japan's economic activity from the financial side.  C. Toward Changing the Norm for Prices Japan's economy has suffered from deflation for more than 15 years, since the late 1990s, with the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI being about zero or slightly negative. One likely reason why it has been taking time for the deflationary mindset to be dispelled in Japan is that households and firms have been adaptive to the deflationary environment. Despite the strong monetary easing being pursued for almost five years, the 2 percent price stability target has not been achieved. This confirms that the deflationary mindset was more                                                    1 Such a downward trend in the natural rate of interest is not unique to Japan, but rather is a global phenomenon. This is one element behind the fact that, since the global financial crisis, interest rates in Japan, the United States, and Europe have declined to lower levels than ever before. 
7 persistent than initially had been assumed, although there were external factors such as the substantial decline in crude oil prices. Having said that, it is still necessary to pursue strong monetary easing; that is, to drive real interest rates sufficiently below the natural rate of interest. Meanwhile, almost five years have passed since the Bank introduced QQE, and I believe that the positive effects and side effects of QQE continue to warrant careful examination.   Recently, price increases around the world have been relatively weak, and many have been pointing out that the factors behind this are the deepening of globalization and digitalization. As research on these factors is still in progress, the empirical evidence has not yet yielded conclusive results.2 I consider it important to fully take into account the effects of such changes in the economic structure on prices. However, even if the effects stemming from globalization and digitalization have been pushing down prices in advanced economies to some extent, I think price developments in Japan are quite different from those in the United States and Europe. This is because inflation expectations seem to be anchored at around 2 percent in the United States and Europe, with the price indexes showing that the underlying trend has been at around 1.5 percent, despite the past experience of the substantial decline in crude oil prices. On this point, in Japan, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) remains in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent -- as I mentioned earlier -- and that in the CPI (less fresh food and energy) is still in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent.  In order to achieve the 2 percent price stability target in Japan, it is necessary that (1) the deflationary mindset be dispelled, and (2) the perception that prices of goods and services as well as wages are supposed to go up every year by around 2 percent becomes firmly entrenched in society as a whole -- or, in other words, the 2 percent inflation takes hold as a                                                    2 The well-known argument that a global approach should be taken into account in the basic determinants of inflation is one made by Claudio Borio, Head of the Monetary and Economic Department of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). For the recent empirical analysis, see the following: Auer, Raphael, Claudio Borio, and Andrew Filardo. "The globalisation of inflation: the growing importance of global value chains." BIS Working Papers no. 602 (January 2017). https://www.bis.org/publ/work602.pdf. Meanwhile, there has been no confirmation of any noticeable, direct influence of global slack on domestic inflation, according to the analysis conducted by economists from the Federal Reserve Board. For details, see the following: Ihrig, Jane, Steven B. Kamin, Deborah Lindner, and Jaime Marquez. "Some Simple Tests of the Globalization and Inflation Hypothesis." International Finance vol. 13, issue 3 (December 2010): 343-375. Federal Reserve Board staff have updated the latter analysis using data through early 2017, and have confirmed that their argument remains valid. 
8 norm for prices. In this regard, it is essential that the Bank be committed in its conduct of monetary policy so as to achieve the price stability target, as I mentioned earlier. In the meantime, maintaining effective communication between the Bank and the government is crucial. Furthermore, nationwide changes are needed in the overall behavior and awareness toward prices. Of firms that have raised prices of their products and services recently, many have done so for the first time in more than two decades, and at present, firms themselves have limited experience in terms of raising prices. Moreover, consumers are not yet accustomed to an environment where both wages and prices increase at a certain pace. Thus, a change in the norm does indeed mean changes in various aspects of society. Financial literacy -- the next topic I will touch upon -- may seem unrelated to economic activity and prices or monetary policy at first, but I believe it does in fact have a connection with changing the norm I just described.  III. Initiatives to Improve Financial Literacy A. Global Awareness of the Importance of Financial Education The importance of financial education has been reaffirmed worldwide in the wake of the global financial crisis. In 2012, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed the High-Level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education, which was then endorsed by the G-20 at their summit in Los Cabos later that year. According to the OECD, financial education is not merely the dissemination of financial knowledge, but "the process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice, develop the skills and confidence to become more aware of financial risks and opportunities, to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and to take other effective actions to improve their financial well-being."3 There has been widespread progress in initiatives to improve financial education, based on the principles endorsed by the G-20 leaders. It has been reported that the number of governments that have adopted national strategies for financial education has increased to almost 60.                                                     3 OECD, "Recommendation on Principles and Good Practices for Financial Education and Awareness" (2005). http://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/35108560.pdf. 
9 B. Importance of Improving Financial Literacy in Japan As part of this global movement, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) and Central Council for Financial Services Information (CCFSI) established the Committee for the Promotion of Financial Education in 2013, and have been strengthening their initiatives to promote financial and economic education.4,5 Let me also mention the government's growth strategy, the Investments for the Future Strategy 2017, approved by the Cabinet in June 2017. The strategy refers to the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA), a tax-free small-lot investment program introduced in 2014. It states that, in order to promote households' stable formation of assets, the government will further disseminate and promote the NISA system, including the introduction in January 2018 of the installment-type NISA, and enhance the financial and investment education that leads to improved practical knowledge of investment among households. I believe that it is crucial to improve financial literacy given the situation where many people feel somewhat uncertain about the future. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the Bank of Japan aims to achieve the 2 percent price stability target, and in a society where wages and prices rise in a stable manner, financial literacy becomes even more important. Therefore, I believe that the promotion of financial education in Japan is now particularly significant.   A number of surveys on financial literacy have been conducted in Japan, with their results revealing many challenges. One such survey is the Financial Literacy Survey conducted in 2016 by the CCFSI. In international comparisons, Japan ranked 24th out of 31 countries and economies in terms of the percentage of correct answers given to common financial questions.6 According to another survey, the percentage of correct answers given to a                                                    4 Since 1950, efforts to encourage voluntary and proactive savings, with the aim of realizing economic autonomy, were led by the Local Councils for Savings Promotion. The Central Council for Savings Promotion was established in 1952 as the focus for private organizations related to this movement. This was then reorganized as the Central Council for Savings Information to concentrate on public relations activities providing accurate knowledge and information regarding the economy, finance, and currency. The council was then renamed as the CCFSI (Secretariat: Public Relations Department, Bank of Japan) in 2001. 5 As suggested by the April 2013 report of the Study Group on Financial Education under the FSA, the Committee for the Promotion of Financial Education (Secretariat: CCFSI) was established to address challenges facing the promotion of financial and economic education. 6 The Financial Literacy Survey is Japan's first large-scale survey covering 25,000 individuals chosen in proportion to Japan's demographic structure. The comparison with overseas was done in 
10 question about the meaning of deflation was slightly above 20 percent.7 Obviously, it is no wonder that we face many challenges in financial education, as is the case with education in general. My concern, however, is the possibility that there is not sufficient recognition in Japan of the necessity for financial education in the first place. For example, in a survey of adults conducted in 2016 by the FSA, about 70 percent of respondents answered that they "have not participated in investment education," and about two-thirds of these respondents stated that they "do not wish to acquire financial or investment knowledge." This means that nearly half of all respondents in the survey indicated such unwillingness. My impression is that investment, in particular, is still perceived as something that wealthy people do.8 While this may be partly due to the prolonged period of deflation, I believe it is important that the necessity of financial education gain more recognition in Japanese society. I feel that an increase in such awareness is similar to a rise in public acceptance of a certain degree of increase in prices. It seems to me that both are indicative of a social norm where it is taken for granted that wages and prices rise in a stable manner.                                                                                                                                                      terms of the simple average for the percentage of correct answers given to six common questions in the OECD survey, which was conducted in 30 countries and economies in 2016. 7 The multiple-choice question asked: "Which of the statements is correct in times of deflation, where prices continue to decline?" There were three answer choices: (1) "Borrowing is profitable because the value of money increases"; (2) "Borrowing is unprofitable because the value of money increases"; or (3) "Borrowing is unprofitable because the value of money decreases." The survey covered men and women living in Japan, aged from 20 to 69, with 1,000 people providing valid responses to the questions. The results were published in The Nikkei on September 2, 2017. 8 According to the National Survey on Securities Investment conducted in 2015 by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, about 30 percent of respondents answered that securities investment was "something that wealthy people do." The survey was conducted on 7,000 men and women living in Japan who were at least 20 years of age. 
Mario Draghi: ECB press conference - introductory statementIntroductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, and Mr VítorConstâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 14 December2017.*   *   *Introductory statementLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council,which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Mr Dijsselbloem, and by theCommission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECBinterest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for anextended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that from January 2018 weintend to continue to make net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), ata monthly pace of €30 billion, until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and inany case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflationconsistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditionsbecome inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path ofinflation, we stand ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. The Eurosystemwill reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for anextended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long asnecessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriatemonetary policy stance.Our monetary policy decisions have preserved the very favourable financing conditions that arestill needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to,2%. The incoming information, including our new staff projections, indicates a strong pace ofeconomic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook. The strong cyclicalmomentum and the significant reduction of economic slack give grounds for greater confidencethat inflation will converge towards our inflation aim. At the same time, domestic price pressuresremain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Anample degree of monetary stimulus therefore remains necessary for underlying inflationpressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the mediumterm. This continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases that wedecided on at our October monetary policy meeting, by the sizeable stock of acquired assetsand the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Theeconomic expansion in the euro area continued in the third quarter of 2017, when real GDPincreased by 0.6% quarter on quarter, after 0.7% in the second quarter. The latest data andsurvey results point to solid and broad-based growth momentum. Our monetary policymeasures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to support domesticdemand. Private consumption is underpinned by ongoing employment gains, which are alsobenefiting from past labour market reforms, and by rising household wealth. Businessinvestment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, risingcorporate profitability and strengthening demand. Housing investment has also risen further overrecent quarters. In addition, euro area exports are being supported by the broad-based globalexpansion. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.4% in2017, 2.3% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the September 2017 ECBstaff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised upsubstantially.Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. On the one hand, thestrong cyclical momentum, underpinned by continued positive developments in sentimentindicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises in the near term. On the other hand,downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors and developments in foreignexchange markets.According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in November,up from 1.4% in October. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have moderatedsomewhat recently, in part owing to special factors. Looking ahead, on the basis of currentfutures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to moderate in the comingmonths, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices, before increasing again. Underlyinginflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policymeasures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slackand rising wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the September 2017 ECBstaff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up,mainly reflecting higher oil and food prices.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, withan annual rate of growth of 5.0% in October 2017, from 5.2% in September, reflecting the impactof the ECB’s monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquiddeposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor tobroad money growth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.4% in October, after 9.8% in September.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.9% inOctober 2017, after 2.4% in September, while the annual growth rate of loans to householdsremained stable at 2.7%.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing ‒notably for small and medium-sized enterprises ‒ and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals comingfrom the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetaryaccommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, butclose to, 2%.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas mustcontribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducingvulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries needs to besubstantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euroarea productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid andbroad-based expansion strengthens the case for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularlyimportant in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit fromintensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Afull, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential toincrease the resilience of the euro area economy. Strengthening Economic and Monetary Unionremains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing discussions on completing thebanking union and the capital markets union, and on further enhancing the institutionalarchitecture of our Economic and Monetary Union.We are now at your disposal for questions. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
  1  Modesty in times of uncertainty Monetary policy after the crisis  Business Economists’ Annual Dinner (London, 29 November 2017) Speech by Klaas Knot  Introduction Good evening everyone. Thank you for inviting me here to share my thoughts on monetary policy. We stand at an important turning point, 10 years after the global financial crisis began to unfold. During the crisis, monetary policy stepped in with unprecedented measures. At each new turn of the crisis, we as the Eurosystem took action and designed new policy measures where necessary. These measures proved successful. Now, a broad-based economic expansion is taking hold across the euro area. As the economy is enjoying robust growth, it is giving us the opportunity to take a step back from the crisis mode.   Against this background, tonight I want to elaborate on the following. The current inflation outlook poses no threat to price stability. Despite undershooting its inflation aim in the near-term, the ECB is thereby fulfilling its mandate. This is thanks to a combination of monetary policy measures, including the Asset Purchase Programme, which has achieved what could reasonably have been expected. The slow inflation convergence towards our medium-term objective is due to global supply factors largely outside the realm of central banking.   In this situation, continued monetary expansion is not a free lunch. Unconventional monetary policy is more intrusive than conventional monetary policy. It creates deeper market distortions that can generate misallocation and financial stability risks. As long as the standard economic relation between domestic slack and inflation, the so-called Phillips curve, fails to assert itself, adding ever more stimulus makes our policy increasingly procyclical, reinforcing these risks.  
  2  I therefore want to argue for modesty in monetary policy-making. We need more emphasis on the medium-term orientation of our inflation objective. Patience is thereby of the essence. Absent deflation risk, a full phasing-out of net asset purchases from September 2018 onwards is warranted. Our communication will have to shift accordingly, from net asset purchases and incremental stimulus towards reinvestment and preservation of broadly accommodative financing conditions.   A quick look back Let me begin by taking a quick look back. The euro area has endured some rough times. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the euro area weathered a sovereign debt crisis and a severe recession. These developments affected financial market actors, households, firms and governments. In an attempt to soften the impact of the crisis, the ECB took unprecedented monetary policy measures. Liquidity was provided in full allotment, and for longer periods than ever before. Interest rates were cut below zero, and several outright purchase programmes were set up. An indicator developed by the Dutch central bank shows that our actions were collectively equivalent to cutting short-term interest rates to around -4%.1 Faced with severe challenges, the Eurosystem responded forcefully.   Being here in London tonight, allow me to highlight one crucial moment 5 years ago, when the functioning of sovereign debt markets in the euro area was severely undermined in the presence of redenomination risk fears. On July 26, 2012, our President Mario Draghi gave his famous “Whatever it takes” speech. Shortly after, the ECB announced its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme. Markets calmed down, in the knowledge that the central bank would intervene if needed. As they quickly realized the futility of speculating against the central bank in its lender-of-last-resort capacity, no purchases whatsoever were required under the OMT. This policy was successful on all accounts.                                                  1 Christiaan Pattipeilohy et al., “Assessing the effective stance of monetary policy: A factor-based approach”, November 2017. 
  3   Chart 1: Euro area inflation   Stemming a speculative attack on the integrity of your currency is one thing, controlling inflation is clearly a different ballgame. Whereas a central bank can credibly promise to do “whatever it takes” in lender-of-last-resort capacity, financial markets should not overestimate central banks’ ability to fine-tune inflation.   Since the acute crisis abated, euro area inflation has been low and rising only slowly. As chart 1 illustrates, core inflation fluctuated slightly below 1% between 2014 and early 2017, and has yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained uptick. It is good to realize that stubbornly low inflation is not just a European phenomenon. Inflation in the US today, once corrected for imputed housing costs and thereby made comparable to our HICP measure, is actually lower than in the euro area, even though the economic and monetary policy cycles in the US are several years ahead compared to the euro area.  -101234121314151617HICPCore inflation (excl food & energy)Euro area inflationAnnual percent change
  4   The universal nature of subdued inflation is increasingly linked to favourable supply-side developments such as technological advances and globalisation of product, labour and capital markets. The resulting disinflationary factors are global in nature and largely outside the realm of individual central banks. They have altered domestic inflation processes and have thus complicated the life of central bankers around the world.2  Chart 2: Euro area GDP growth   The inflation outlook I would nonetheless argue that the current low inflation rates, despite falling short of our medium-term objective, do not constitute a threat to price stability. The current inflation outlook should be assessed against the background of a robust expansion of the eurozone economy. As chart 2 illustrates, the euro area is currently enjoying its fifth consecutive year of GDP growth. Since mid-2014 this growth can also be dubbed “reflationary”, in the sense that quarterly growth readings have consistently outpaced potential growth rates.                                                   2 Claudio Borio, “Through the looking glass”, OMFIF City Lecture, London, 22 September 2017. -0,6-0,4-0,20,00,20,40,60,81,0121314151617Euro area real GDP growthQuarter-on-quarter percent change
  5   Against the backdrop of a reflating economy, the inflation outlook is consistent with our aim of an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. It should be emphasized that from the ECB’s early days onward, the medium term has been defined as a flexible concept. It depends on the shocks hitting the economy and the efficacy of the monetary policy transmission that should bring inflation back on target. The global financial crisis was arguably much deeper than the average shock foreseen at the euro’s inception, and the financial fragmentation it created within the euro area severely impeded monetary transmission. In a context of such widespread financial imbalances, the ECB’s first chief economist, Otmar Issing, argued that “there is little sense in continuing to pursue an inflation forecast for consumer prices over a horizon of one to two years. In such circumstances it may instead be advisable to set interest rates with a view to a time frame extending well beyond conventional forecast horizons.”3   Concerns have been voiced that a prolonged period of low inflation could lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. While the conceptual relevance of this argument is beyond dispute, there are some challenging issues in operationalising it in the monetary policy process. Market-based and survey-based measures of inflation expectations exist, but they both come with a range of caveats and have often provided conflicting signals as to whether inflation expectations were anchored or not. Moreover, the mechanism by which inflation expectations affect actual price- and wage-setting behaviour is far from understood. I therefore sympathize with former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo, who recently argued that “inflation expectations are bearing an awful lot of weight in monetary policy these days, considering the range and depth of unanswered questions about them”.4                                                    3 Otmar Issing, “The ECB and the euro - the first five years”, Mais Lecture at the City University Business School, London, 12 May 2004. 4 Daniel Tarullo,”Monetary policy without a working theory of inflation”, Hutchins Center working paper #33, October 2017, and “Fed has no reliable theory of inflation, says Tarullo”, Financial Times, 4 October 2017.   
  6  All in all, I am confident that our monetary policy measures will continue to work their way through the transmission mechanism. Also at current low inflation rates the ECB is fulfilling its price stability mandate and successfully protecting the purchasing power of European citizens.   Current policy stance So where does this assessment leave me in terms of the current monetary policy stance? After all, the crisis is several years behind us, the economy is enjoying solid expansion, price stability is not in jeopardy, yet many of our unconventional monetary policy measures are still in place. Liquidity operations are still conducted under fixed-rate full allotment, significant volumes of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations are still outstanding, and the deposit facility rate is still in negative territory. But the measure that has attracted most controversy in the recent years is our Asset Purchase Programme (APP). As you will be aware, the programme has just been extended until at least September 2018, albeit at a reduced pace of 30bn a month. As stated in our Introductory Statement, “The recalibration of our asset purchases reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim.”  Although at past occasions I have been sceptical about the APP’s effectiveness with respect to raising inflation, the APP has contributed to four important achievements which I would like to recall here. First, the APP has further eased financing conditions across the euro area up to the point where borrowing costs are no longer an impediment to whatever spending decision. This also means that since monetary policy constraints have become de facto non-binding, the marginal benefits of further accommodation are negligible. Second, financial fragmentation between euro area countries has been reduced and monetary transmission has become much more homogeneous across Member States than was the case during the crisis. Third, the APP has supported the strong economic expansion I talked about earlier. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the tail risk of a 1930s type deflationary spiral has been averted. In doing so, the programme has achieved what could reasonably be expected from it. 
  7   With deflation risk clearly off the radar, the main rationale for employing the APP has therefore ceased to exist. Fear of relapse owing to an alledgedly premature discontinuation of net purchases seems rather overdone. The programme has simply run its course. Continuing the programme for the sake of fine-tuning inflation rates to precise values below, but close to, 2% suggests a degree of control over the inflation process that is at least debatable.   Risks and side effects At the same time, continued monetary expansion is not a free lunch. Unconventional policy measures can have unconventional consequences that even professional economists cannot always oversee. A prolonged period of low interest rates, ample liquidity and prominent central bank intervention in markets has given rise to potential misallocation of credit and wider resources toward zombie firms.5 Risk premia are compressed to a point where they no longer reflect the assets’ inherent risk characteristics. The dynamics of preventing financial markets to adequately price risks for an extended period of time takes our economies into largely uncharted territory.    These financial stability risks also need to be considered when assessing our monetary stance. While some would argue that prudential and not monetary policies should address financial stability risks, I tend to agree with former Bank of England deputy Governor Charles Bean that there are “important qualifications to this somewhat Panglossian view of the ability to maintain both price stability and financial stability by assigning monetary policy to the former and macroprudential policy to the latter.”6 After all, only monetary policy sets “the universal price of leverage”.7 Conversely, materialization of financial stability risks can also become detrimental to price stability.                                                   5 Viral Acharya, Tim Eisert, Christian Eufinger, and Christian Hirsch, “Whatever it takes: The real effects of unconventional monetary policy”, SAFE Working Paper Series, No. 152, 2017. 6 Charles Bean, “The future of monetary policy”, speech at the London School of Economics, London, 20 May 2014. 7 Claudio Borio and Mathias Drehmann, “Financial instability and macroeconomics: bridging the gulf”, September 2009. 
  8  Procyclicality In the current context, financial stability risks interact with the issue of procyclicality. The failure of the traditional Phillips curve relation between the business cycle and inflation to thus far assert itself makes monetary policy increasingly procyclical. Economic growth in the euro area passed its cyclical trough in the first quarter of 2013, while core inflation bottomed out early 2015. Yet until at least September 2018 the APP will be adding stimulus. Not only in terms of length, but also in terms of magnitude of the expansion, the economy is in outstanding shape. With real GDP growth hitting levels above 2% year-on-year, the monetary policy stance is increasingly out of sync with the business cycle.  Chart 3: Euro area business cycle and monetary policy decisions   A simple historical comparison serves to illustrate this point. Chart 3 shows that during previous upturns, that is when the euro area composite Purchasing 303540455055606599000102030405060708091011121314151617Mean of PMI +/- ½ standard deviationComposite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indexPolicy easing (rate decrease or APP decision/expansion)Policy tightening (rate increase)Euro area business cycle and monetary policy decisionsPMI number on y-axis, with 50 marking difference between business cycle expansion and contraction
  9  Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at similar levels above its long-term mean, policy was generally tightening instead of the current prolonged easing.8  Obviously, the main factor underlying this contrasting pattern is the weak and elusive character of the traditional Phillips curve relationship between cyclical conditions and inflation. Whether this is merely a temporary or a more permanent phenomenon is a topic for ongoing debate. My colleague Mark Carney, for example, has recently argued that “globalisation has been accompanied by a weakening in the relationship between domestic slack and domestic inflation, and by a corresponding strengthening between global forces and domestic prices”9. Also in the euro area, the strong recovery of the labour market has yet to translate into upward pressure on wages and prices.  Communication Patience is therefore needed for our monetary stimulus to unfold. The reflating economy will ultimately translate into increased pressure on wages and prices. This may however take time. Central banks can only affect the price level with “long and uncertain lags”. Consequently they cannot be over-ambitious and try to steer price developments in the short run, nor should they seek to precisely define the horizon of their action.10 As we intend to reinvest maturing securities for an extended period of time, financial conditions will likely remain accommodative long after net asset purchases will have come to an end.  In view of the above, we have to adjust our communication. With a medium-term focus in mind, we need to highlight patience and confidence in the measures that we have already taken, while at the same time remaining realistic about what our measures can and cannot achieve. We will need to cater for the possibility that a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation (SAPI) can only be achieved well after net asset purchases will have come to an end. Fortunately, our                                                  8 Moreover, data since the 1960s show that once the recovery took hold, the first policy rate increase has typically taken place after 10 quarters in Germany and 11 quarters in the US, on average. As indicated earlier, the current euro area recovery is enjoying its 19th consecutive quarter of growth. 9 Mark Carney, “[De]Globalization and inflation”, 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, 18 September 2017. 10 Otmar Issing, “Inflation targeting: a view from the ECB”, “Inflation Targeting: Prospects and Problems” Symposium St. Louis, 16-17 October 2003. 
  10  monetary policy stance is more encompassing, and all our measures are geared towards this objective. The focus in communication therefore needs to shift to the other elements of our policy toolkit, such as forward guidance on key policy rates, together with the ongoing stimulus provided by the stock of our asset purchases.   Conclusion Let me conclude. Our economy is in the midst of a strong cyclical upswing. Far-reaching policy measures have contributed to cement growth, avert deflation risk, and enhance the cohesion of the monetary union. Although raising inflation towards our aim is taking longer than expected, current inflation rates are not a threat to price stability. With actual growth exceeding potential and labour market slack falling, inflationary pressures will eventually unfold. At the same time, the longer the Phillips curve fails to assert itself, the more procyclical policy might become, and the greater is the likelihood of financial stability risks building up.   Patience and confidence should therefore replace suggestions of open-endedness in our communication. Absent deflation risk, a full phasing-out of net asset purchases from September 2018 onwards is warranted. Preservation of existing stimulus will be more than sufficient to reach our inflation objective, albeit at a medium term that may be further away than many of us are used to.   Let me then end with the more than relevant words of Augustus William Hare, “True modesty does not consist in an ignorance of our merits, but in a due estimate of them". Let us be modest and take a realistic look at what our measures can and cannot achieve in our efforts to maintain price stability.  I thank you for your attention.  
Jens Weidmann: Welcome remarksSpeech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of theBoard of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the SAFE/CFS/DeutscheBundesbank lecture on "Making inclusive growth a reality" by Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Frankfurt am Main, 5 December 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionDear TharmanDear President WolffDear OtmarLadies and gentlemenI wish you a warm welcome to today’s lecture on “Making inclusive growth a reality", which isorganised jointly by the Center for Financial Studies (CFS), the Research Center SAFE andthe Deutsche Bundesbank.How to achieve inclusive growth featured prominently on this year’s G20 agenda of “Shaping aninterconnected world". With that in mind, I am especially delighted to welcome Tharman, DeputyPrime Minister of Singapore, to speak on this issue today. Singapore was one of Germany’sguest countries during the 2017 G20 presidency, and Tharman has first-hand information on thetopic of inclusive growth, having been one of the protagonists of this year’s G20 meetings inBaden-Baden, Washington and Hamburg.In addition to his duties as Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman serves as Coordinating Minister forEconomic and Social Policies in the Singapore Cabinet and is Chairman of the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore’s central bank and financial regulator.He also chairs the Group of Thirty, a consultative group on international economic and monetaryaffairs that seeks to deepen understanding of international economic and financial issues.Tharman previously headed the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the key policyforum of the IMF, where he was the first Asian chair.Furthermore, he is Chairman of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global FinancialGovernance, a role to which he was appointed by the G20 finance ministers and central bankgovernors in April 2017 to recommend reforms to the system of multilateral financial institutions.It was in this capacity that he led the first Eminent Persons Group Symposium with internationalorganisations, academics and renowned experts yesterday and today atthe Bundesbank premises here in Frankfurt.His broad set of national responsibilities and his wide-ranging experience on global issues puthim in an excellent position to speak on the topic of today’s lecture.2. Inclusive growthAccording to an IMF note prepared for and presented to the leaders at the G20 Hamburg summitin July this year, "inclusive growth is a priority that resonates globally today". And, in contrast tosome of the other topics discussed at the Hamburg summit, the G20 member states wereunanimous in supporting the objective of inclusive growth.So what does inclusiveness mean with respect to growth? Let’s start by breaking the term 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
“inclusive growth” down into its two components: “inclusive” means sharing the benefits ofgrowth amongst all, and “growth” can be simply stated in economic terms as a long-termincrease in real GDP.Thus, we are talking about economic prosperity for the benefit of everyone. Put this way, itbecomes obvious that inclusive growth is not a recent invention but rather an economic goal thatis just common sense. After all, back in 1957, Ludwig Erhard, the former German Minister forEconomic Affairs and later Chancellor, entitled his book on the German Social MarketEconomy "Wohlstand für Alle", which translates as “prosperity for all".Although the invisible hand at work in a market economy leads to an efficient allocation ofresources, it is now widely accepted that the market mechanism on its own creates winners andlosers. While technological change generally leads to an increase in production capacities, itaffects workers with different capabilities in different ways.Obviously, a far-reaching redistribution would hamper incentives. Excessive public expenditure— or speaking more generally – excessive redistribution through the tax system might harm thepotential for sustained growth because entrepreneurs and workers become discouraged.On the other hand, "excessive inequality is not conducive to sustainable growth" either, asChristine Lagarde rightly stated. Excessive inequality can harm growth because it dampens theprospect for a significant part of the population of ever participating in the country’s prosperity.And so it is a matter of course that in most countries, the public sector shares in individuals’income to a certain degree by imposing taxes, with the majority of these countries imposingprogressive taxes. This enables the public sector to supply public goods. Achieving socialcohesion by means of social security transfers, building human capital by subsidising education,and promoting the labour market participation of women, the long-term unemployed and low-skilled workers – all of these things can boost not only inclusion, but growth as well.Bearing this in mind, it is important to find the right calibration of growth policies.The public debate on inclusive growth policies often takes the development of economicinequality over recent decades as a starting point. Rising inequality is seen as a major challengearound the world. However, the perception of steadily rising inequality depends strongly on the indicator used.When you look at the Gini coefficient of net income, for example, which is a commonly usedmeasure of inequality, inequality across countries has decreased over the last two decades.Within countries, however, we see a mixed picture of higher Gini coefficients since the 1990s insome advanced and emerging countries, yet lower coefficients in other countries. Of course, Gini coefficients looking at the distribution of net income after taxes and transfers areonly one of many measures. The dispersion of gross market income, the distribution of wealth,the median income and poverty rates are other measures that seek to quantify economicinequality. Further measures describe inter-generational distribution by looking at demographicaspects and public debt. All in all, there is no uniform answer to the question how inequality hasevolved over the last decades.3. ConclusionNotwithstanding the difficulties associated with measuring inequality meaningfully, policies thatachieve both inclusion and growth are especially sought after. We need to ensure thatenterprises and their employees are properly equipped to harness the opportunities presented byglobalisation and technological progress, and that they are able to cope with structural change,especially through better education and life-long learning.123 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

François Villeroy de Galhau: Monitoring financial stability, withactive monetary policiesSpeech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at a conference atthe London Business School, London, 23 November 2017.*   *   *Accompanying slidesLadies and Gentlemen,Price stability and the prevention of financial imbalances are often two sides of the same coin.Indeed, price stability and financial stability are supposed to be complementary and mutuallybeneficial. During the recent crisis in the euro area, the transmission mechanism of monetarypolicy was hampered by a fragmented interbank market, as borrowing conditions deteriorated instressed countries. The resulting deterioration in the economy in turn contributed to a furtherworsening of the financial stress, in what we call a real-financial feedback loop.To cope with this difficult situation, the policy response in the euro area was twofold. First, weadopted an active monetary policy and launched unconventional measures that included thecredit easing package. Second, we set up a Banking Union and assigned new macroprudentialpowers and tasks both at the European level (the ECB, the ESRB) as well as at the nationallevel. In France, the Haut Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF or High Council for FinancialStability) was created in July 2013 as the French authority with the legal ability to impose bindingmacroprudential measures.The economy is now recovering, so the medicine seems to have worked. However, our attentionis now turning to the potential side effects of our treatment. Monetary policy in the euro area ismaintaining short-term nominal interest rates at very low levels, and through our forwardguidance, rates are also very low up to medium-term maturities. But, as the economy isrecovering and we are progressing towards our inflation target, the Governing Council clearlydecided on 26 October to pursue the gradual normalisation of our monetary policy. We willcontinue along this road, but financial stability concerns could be increasing. It has recently beenargued that this could result in unwanted side effects in terms of asset price misalignments orspur a search for yield that would entail excessive risk taking.The issue of the side-effects of monetary policy is not entirely new. Monetary policy is neverneutral since it works its way through to the real economy via its effects on financial conditions,that is to say the current and expected cost of borrowing liquidity, and in turn on asset prices andrisk premia, even in normal circumstances. Let me first say some words on bank profitability –which is not the only element of financial stability (1). I will then discuss the price of assets andthe financial cycle (2), before turning to the relation for policy makers between monetary policyand macroprudential policy (3). Lastly, I will say a few words on how we should completefinancial regulations (4).*    *    *1. – Let me start with bank profitabilityIt is true that low interest rates may affect the interest margins of banks since the latter cannotgenerally pass negative rates on to depositors. Also, because these institutions engage inmaturity transformation, both the slope and level of the yield curve matter for their profitability.But let me comment on what I see as the predominant effects of interest rate cuts since 2014.Our monetary policy is driving up real asset prices and lowering debt-servicing costs. Indebted 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
corporations, households and governments can improve their balance sheets and yet maintain asteady spending trajectory with improved growth prospects. As a matter of fact, the ongoingrecovery in the euro area has been synonymous with lower unemployment (7 million jobs havebeen created since 2013), resulting in higher disposable income [SLIDE 2]. In turn, this hassignificantly lowered the risk of default borne by the banking sector. Banks have also benefitedfrom very low interest rates through cheaper funding and significant capital gains on their long-term assets.So far, these effects seem to have compensated for the reduction in the bank interest margins.In a recent ECB working paper by Altavilla, Boucinha and Peydró, the authors even argue thatthere is no causal relationship between low interest rates and reduced bank margins. The lattereffect is due more to the past deterioration in macroeconomic conditions than to active monetarypolicy.A comprehensive assessment of our current policy package should not only look at the intendedconsequences and side effects that can be observed, but also weigh them up against whatwould have happened in the absence of our exceptional policy [SLIDE 3]. How profitable wouldour banking system now be had we not eliminated the 2014–15 deflation risk? The landscape forour banking system would have been somewhat dire. In a deflationary environment – and wehave avoided this lethal danger thanks to our monetary policy –, the debt-servicing cost forborrowers is heavier in real terms. Defaults are more frequent, and less sustainable debts resultin higher credit spreads. The risk of a debt deflation spiral then increases further. But this hasbeen avoided in the euro area and if the price of this is a temporary reduction in bank interestmargins, then it is worth incurring such a secondary side effect.2. – Let me turn now to the price of assets and the financial cycle            At the level of the euro area, we consider the financial stability situation to be overall undercontrol. The solvency ratios of significant euro area institutions have improved continuously since2014, reaching 15% on average in Q2 2017. Overall private debt in the euro zone diminished asa share of GDP: 128% in 2011, 122% today. Non-performing loan ratios have also declined,especially for small and medium sized enterprises. I support the recent SSM initiative forprovision rules for new flows of NPL, despite all the criticisms. Moreover, after some years ofsubdued financial cycles, most cycles in euro area countries have normalised and in somecountries they have even accelerated [SLIDE 4]. This is the case for France, and should it be aconcern?In France, asset prices are currently rising in a context of low market volatility. Since low volatilityand abundant liquidity may encourage risk-taking behaviour alongside search-for-yield behaviour,we must be vigilant against the risk of a widespread mispricing of financial assets that couldhinder the economic recovery. To give you some numbers: residential real-estate prices areback in positive territory, with year-on-year growth of 2% in real terms, and the commercial real-estate sector is still buoyant. Our main alert is on non-financial corporation debt, which is now74.4% of GDP against 61.8% in 2010 [SLIDE 5]. Overall, private debt in France now amounts to130.5% of GDP.I do not want to bombard you with numbers but the main difficulty now is for policymakers todisentangle from these positive figures what is a desirable consequence of our monetary policystance and what clearly signals a potential financial risk that we must address.3. – Policy makers: can monetary policy and macroprudential policy be best [better?]combined?As said, overall private debt in the euro zone has diminished as a share of GDP. But in somecountries, the financial cycle is picking up, while at the same time inflation has been slowly12 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
increasing, but remains below our target.Already before the 2008 crisis, central bankers firmly believed that price stability is a necessary –and for some even a sufficient – condition to ensure financial stability. This view is referred to asthe ‘Jackson Hole consensus’. Following the financial crisis, financial imbalances were seen as ahuge source of disruption which decision-makers needed to remedy, questioning the relationshipbetween monetary and financial policy tools and objectives. Let me give two polar views on that.A first approach, in line with the ‘Jackson Hole consensus’, is to clearly separate monetarystability from financial stability. In line with the Tinbergen rule and the Mundell efficiency principlerespectively, one policy should fulfil one objective and each policy tool should be assigned to theobjective it can fulfil the best. In this regard, monetary policy would not be efficient at mitigatingfinancial imbalances but would not generate them either.On the other side, an extreme approach is to consider that both policies are strongly intertwinedand that their respective objectives could be merged: in this case, monetary policy could reducerisk taking and target asset price bubbles.I consider that full adherence to the separation principle and the combining of objectives are bothapproaches that are too radical to conduct monetary and financial stability policies. Theimplementation of unconventional policies has blurred the frontier between the two objectives. Letme quote here my colleague Vice-President Vítor Constâncio: “Macroprudential policy andmonetary policy rely on separate tools and aim to achieve different objectives. Yet, they need tobe co-ordinated, which is a non-trivial task.” It is a wise view. Keeping monetary policy alignedwith its primary objective of price stability but not blindly sticking to the separation principle mayhelp us to manage our two main objectives and strengthen our credibility.As you may know, the Banque de France, like many other central banks, has had the dualmandate of maintaining price stability and preserving financial stability since 2013. The financialstability mandate is demonstrated by the fact that the governor of the Banque de France has thesole right and responsibility to make proposals for implementing macroprudential instruments tothe High Council for Financial Stability, the French macroprudential authority. I consider thisspecific role assigned to the governor of the Banque de France as an opportunity to make priceand financial stability objectives more consistent.First, macroprudential policy complements the monetary policy framework decided at the euroarea level, by adjusting it to national specificities and addressing idiosyncratic financial stabilityrisks while maintaining the harmonious transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.Second, macroprudential policy may help to fine tune the overall impact of monetary policy byensuring that the risk-taking channel is not disproportionate in some specific sectors/countries, inorder to prevent systemic risk. Let me give you two examples of what we monitor very closely inFrance: the increase in commercial real estate prices in Paris, and the rise in corporate debt.Having said this, I do not mean that there is no hierarchy between the two objectives. I call forstrong complementarity, not for a merging of objectives. To be more explicit, I consider that amonetary policy strategy that targeted asset prices would be a mistake. As central bankers, weneed to avoid confusing economic agents; our role is to anchor expectations and ensurebusiness continuity.4. – There are still challenges to be addressed to provide authorities with the necessarypolicy toolbox for financial stabilityFor it to be more effective, we still face a number of challenges in order to achieve an optimalmacroprudential regulatory framework. First, we have to complete the regulatory framework forbanks, by finalising the Basel III reform: I strongly wish and hope that we can reach a fair and3 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
reasonable agreement soon. A revision of the European Macroprudential Framework is currentlyunderway at the European Commission level. Moreover, decisive progress should be made tobetter provide macroprudential authorities with policy tools properly designed to address financialrisks beyond banking. Market financing, shadow banking, Fintechs, pension funds, financialinnovations are all part of the scope of macroprudential policy, insofar as they have the potentialto pose a financial risk to our economies. Our next issue is less the solvency of banks than theliquidity of non-banks.It is also our duty to complete the European regulatory framework with the finalisation of theresolution mechanism to make the functioning of the banking sector smoother – in line with thespirit of the Banking Union, also enabling the Capital Market Union (CMU) to bloom, within theholistic approach of the “Financing Union for Investment and Innovation” I have suggested.Finally, we must ensure that the new regulatory framework is consistently implementedeverywhere, and avoid any backtracking outside Europe. Financial stability is a global commongood, and as such, regulatory arbitrage must not become an option.*    *    *Let me conclude. Credibility for central bankers now rests on admitting that monetary policy andmacroprudential policy are somewhat porous, especially in a situation where we could have anupward financial cycle associated with weak inflation. This calls for a consistent action by centralbanks that covers both areas: price and financial stability. Moving away from an overly strictseparation principle, let us try to be complete and consistent central bankers playing an activerole in monetary policy as well as in macroprudential policies.Altavilla C., Boucinha M., Peydro JL, 2017, Monetary Policy and Bank Profitability in a Low Interest RateEnvironment, ECB Working paper series #2105, October 2017.Ratio of non-financial agents’ debt to GDP, first quarter 2017.

1  10 Years of Romania’s EU Membership: Looking to the future Liviu Voinea, Deputy Governor, National Bank of Romania   26 October 2017   Ten years after Romania’s EU accession, the world has changed dramatically: the global financial crisis of 2008-09 led to the revision of rules in the international banking system, to growing social discontent with major consequences in terms of flourishing populism and protectionism, as well as to a reshuffle of maps – be they geopolitical, military or economic.   Uncertainty is running higher today than prior to the crisis and the room for quantitative easing policies based on stimulating demand has narrowed considerably.  Looking ahead, both the European Union and Romania need structural reforms.  As regards the EU:  Many steps have been taken so far at institutional level: Stability and Growth Pact, CRD IV (Capital Requirements Directive), Banking Union, SRB (Single Resolution Board), SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism), ESRB (European Systemic Risk Board). When needed, monetary policy undertook – in Europe as well, similarly to the US, UK or Japan – to escape recession and deflation and to foster renewed economic impetus.  A challenge to the EU is to maintain the pace of economic growth as the ECB gradually exits from quantitative easing.  Another challenge facing the EU is to manage Brexit properly and avoid other exits, which would question the very essence of European identity.  
2   The EU should continue and complete institutional reforms, by finalising the Banking Union, the aspects regarding the operationalisation of EDIS (European Deposit Insurance Scheme), by setting MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities) for banking groups; moreover, the EU should move towards a fiscal union without debt mutualisation, should leave less room for discretion and comply with rules once they have been adopted, it should clarify the fine balance between the consolidated microprudential supervision of banks and national accountability in terms of resolution.  But maybe the most important factor for the cohesion and coherence of the European project is the success in safeguarding the four fundamental freedoms: the free movement of capital, goods, services, and above all persons within the Union. A Union that would waive these principles would no longer be the Union that was established in 1957 and that Romania joined 10 years ago.   As regards Romania:  Romania has accomplished a lot in the past ten years: nominal convergence, real convergence in part, financial stability, it has gained market confidence and has implemented structural reforms.  In order to carry on with real convergence, Romania has to exploit its growth potential and to get as close as possible to full employment.  With a view to achieving these goals, we should focus on a number of issues related to real convergence which were less debated in the first ten years.  The demographic problem: the equivalent of approximately 30 percent of the labour force in Romania and of 13 percent of the total population work abroad (from 3 percent in 2005). This is Romania’s lost GDP. 
3   Moreover, even now, when Romania’s economy reports above potential growth rates, the country continues to record negative birth rates. The ageing of the population affects potential GDP; and it is not only about ageing – ageing is doubled by a high rate of people at risk of poverty (around 40 percent in 2016).   According to in-house studies that refer to a panel of 6 Central and Eastern European countries and cover the period from 2005 to 2016, a 1 percent increase in the share of population aged 65 and above triggers a 1.3 percent decline in potential GDP.  Real convergence is measured not only in quantitative terms, in cold figures, but also in qualitative terms. For instance, over 90 percent of the population owns a house, but housing quality is the lowest in Europe (about 30 percent of the individuals have no access to basic sanitary facilities and around 70 percent live in overcrowded dwellings).  The living standards and the wage differential further account for emigration waves even amid the high economic growth. This is a deeply uneven growth at both interregional and intergenerational levels, which is unbalanced in terms of structure and which reinforces inequalities within the society (the Gini coefficient stood at 38 percent in 2015).  The growth potential should be enhanced also by an increase in capital flows and stock, the absorption of EU funds and a better allocation of resources via investment prioritisation.  Achieving convergence is not enough, as convergence should be sustainable, balanced and equitably distributed.  Real convergence should be pursued not only in terms of income, but also in terms of output structure, by means of the level and composition of budget revenues and expenditures. 
4   Good European practices should be used to fight tax evasion and strengthen financial discipline.  In the medium run, a balanced primary budget should be ensured and the MTO (medium-term objective) should be again pursued; public debt should be maintained at sustainable levels and inappropriate incentives leading to over-indebtedness of private sector and households should be avoided.  It is necessary to improve the access to financing. 83% of households have 6% of deposits, whereas 0.3% of households hold 25% of deposits. Housing loans have been accessed by only 1% of very low income earners (the 1st quintile) and by only 4% of relatively high income earners (the 4th quintile). 12% of the highest income earners (the 5th quintile) have accessed housing loans.  A roadmap is necessary for joining the euro area.  The public goods that should be preserved and even strengthened include: the country’s security, financial stability, investors’ confidence.  European Union – Romania joint agenda for 2019  Conclusion of Brexit negotiations.  Completion of important files, such as the prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to sovereign risk (the bank-sovereign link), EDIS (European Deposit Insurance Scheme), euro area reforms.  2020 budget – better use of resources.  Aligning the budgetary provisions of the NATO with those of the EU. Exemption of the rise in military expenditure, for NATO countries that are EU Member States, from the EDP (excessive deficit procedure) rule and from the MTO (medium-term objective).  Monetary policy normalisation and fiscal policy sustainability. 
KGORI CAPITAL BUSINESS CLUB SEMINAR  THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION IN MACROECONOMIC POLICY MANAGEMENT  by  Moses D Pelaelo  Governor, Bank of Botswana   October 3, 2017   Director of Ceremonies  I am pleased and indeed it is an honour to be part of this important information sharing and empowering Seminar, organised by the Kgori Business Press Club. The initiative for this forum resonates with the Bank’s desire to contribute to the development of informed financial and economic journalism as a means of improving transmission of market information, as well as incisive commentary on policy analysis and decisions.  For a number of reasons, a central bank needs to continually interact and disseminate information to stakeholders. Such interactions and communication clarify the Bank’s role and, therefore, reinforces the effectiveness with which it discharges its mandate of ensuring price stability, sound financial and well-
2  functioning payments systems and, more broadly, financial stability. Director of Ceremonies, the subject of my remarks this morning is ‘The Importance of Communication in Macroeconomic Policy Management.’ For this purpose, let me distil macroeconomic policy into three distinct elements, namely fiscal policy, monetary policy and exchange rate policy; and for convenience add financial sector policies in order to complete the interactive and inherent relationships involved.   Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, you will appreciate that individually and together, these policies are intended to affect the behaviour of economic agents, which is, their response in terms of the supply and demand factors of economic activity.  At a broad level, this entails decisions to invest, save, consume, and/or trade across borders.  In this regard, the relative incentives across sectors and industries engendered by the various policies and instruments will have an impact on the rate of economic growth, in other words, the pace of increase in national wealth and living standards. Evidence from the 2007/08 global financial and economic crisis indicates that if not well managed and coordinated, macroeconomic and financial 
3  policies also have the potential to undermine economic growth.   At this point, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, let me take a moment to illustrate the influence of the various policies and related instruments on real economic activity: Starting with Fiscal Policy - In a situation of slow economic growth, fiscal policy might involve increase in expenditure or reduction in taxes by Government to stimulate activity. In the event, spending by government and lower taxes generate an increase in demand, including consumption, providing an incentive for businesses to invest and increase operations to meet the higher demand; thus making positive contribution to economic growth.   Monetary Policy – With regard to monetary policy, again assuming a need to support growth, a reduction of interest rates by the central bank, in the right level of doses, will lower the cost of finance, therefore, potentially leading to higher demand by consumers and investment by businesses, ultimately raising the overall rate of economic growth.   Exchange Rate Policy – A discretionary devaluation or maintenance of an undervalued exchange rate could be undertaken in order to enhance the competitiveness of the 
4  domestic industry in external markets and against imports. This is relevant for supporting sustainable industrialisation and diversifying sources of growth, and may similarly raise overall rate of economic growth.   Financial Policies – In this area, a sound, stable and inclusive financial sector not only facilitates the conduct of transactions and payments, but it is also the conduit through which macroeconomic policies are transmitted to real economic activity. Thus, there is need for continuous attention to ensure the developmental aspects, as well as integrity, safety, stability and a well-functioning financial sector to support sustainable and inclusive economic growth.   Distinguished Guests, I now to turn to the role of communication in ensuring ultimate efficacy of the various policies or actions and decisions. Efficacy or potency in this regard would mean policy action having the desired or intended outcome.  In the examples given above, this would mean higher rates of economic growth with respect to fiscal and monetary policies and a faster pace of industrialisation arising from the exchange rate policy.  
5  Going back in history, there was a time when policymaking was shrouded in secrecy, with policy framework and actions designed to surprise the market; the language of policy makers was coloured by obfuscation and ambiguity in order to generate uncertainty. In particular, a mystique surrounded central banks. The former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank (FED) Allan Greenspan even said in 1987, “Since I have become a central banker, I have learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said”.  Indeed, in a Speech in 2014, the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, pointed out that there was a time when the FED would not even publish its interest rate decisions. At the time the FED would let the outside world derive the interest decisions from the market reaction; it was only in 1994 that the FED decided to make its interest rate decisions public in real time.   No doubt things have changed and economic policy making now involves phrases such as “forward guidance” as a real policy tool designed to enable markets and the public to anticipate the direction, magnitude and timing of policy action. And in this regard, the manner and wording of communication becomes crucial.  
6  Therefore, I will argue that communication is an instrument of macroeconomic policy, without which the desired outcomes would not be realised or would be realised only sluggishly. There are two related dimensions to this. First is, economic and policy awareness that helps the public and economic agents to anticipate policy action; the so called expectations.  Second is the direct relaying of information on policy action and the intended outcome.   In both these cases, three pillars support effective communication. On one side is the policy institutions, in the middle, a vibrant and knowledgeable media, while an economically aware, participative and responsive market and economic agents are the third pillar. That said, in order for the communication tool to be effective in macroeconomic policy formulation, the institutions and frameworks for policy need to have sufficient integrity. In turn, integrity is derived from clarity with respect to governance, policy setting, operational and accountability frameworks, as well as transparency and consistency.   Regarding general awareness and understanding of economic and financial matters, we need to appreciate that, generally, economies are characterised by business cycles of varying lengths and intensity, driven by various factors. 
7  While, there is no time to go into details, the message I am relaying is that the various macroeconomic policies are programmed to respond to such cycles. Therefore, economic awareness entails understanding the state of the economy, the current cycle, the direction or momentum, and, therefore, anticipate policy direction. Thus, in terms of macroeconomic indicators, an up-cycle is normally characterised by acceleration in economic growth and credit demand, and an increase in inflation. In this instance, a well-informed market and public will anticipate that the next set of policies would be contractionary. The converse is true, where sustained low and falling inflation, depressed economic growth and credit demand should engender expectations of expansionary or accommodative monetary policies.   Therefore, in this environment of well-informed expectations and trust in the stabilising capacity and potency of instruments arsenal of the authorities, there is less risk of market overreaction to the path of economic indicators. Indeed, economic agents might take stabilising and policy reinforcing decisions. Consequently, once a policy-setting institution has built up integrity and reputation, markets and economic agents generate belief and respond accordingly 
8  because the institution consistently does what it says it will do in given circumstances.  I will now illustrate, and indeed reinforce, how communication is evolving with respect to two areas of macroeconomic policy formulation in Botswana. You will appreciate, that in the areas of monetary policy and exchange rate policy, there is ongoing improvements and clarity relating to institutional setting, policy framework and parameters, instruments and decision-making cycles and dissemination platforms. In my view such developments have greatly improved understanding and efficacy of these policies.  Regarding monetary policy, the Bank of Botswana has now entrenched a price stability objective of 3 – 6 percent, where the institutional set-up entails six pre-announced meetings in a year, of the Monetary Policy Committee that assess developments, economic outlook and make a policy decision. A media briefing, and a Statement announcing the policy decision and related background information follow each meeting. The annual Monetary Policy Statement and its Mid-term Review serve as the anchor for dissemination of the monetary policy framework, policy analysis and guide for expectations on economic and policy outcomes.  
9   In this regard, awareness of the policy framework, institutional arrangements for decision-making and consistency, promote the necessary integrity and transparency that foster efficacy of monetary policy. In essence, economic agents are able to anticipate, as well as respond to policy action. In addition, markets are more aligned to the policy stance. We, therefore, view the maintenance of a transparent and accountable monetary policy and the related communication strategies, as contributing to sustained attainment of the inflation objective.  The exchange rate policy is also much more transparent. It is now clear to the market that we have a fixed exchange rate, albeit in a crawling band arrangement, pegged 55 percent to the SDR and 45 percent to the South African rand. It is also known that the exchange rate is continuously adjusted using an annual rate of crawl  based on the difference in the projected inflation of the trading partner countries and Botswana’s inflation objective;  this rate of crawl is public knowledge, typically announced at the beginning of the year. Such transparency has removed uncertainty in the management of the exchange rate. Thus, economic agents can use market information and forecasts 
10  with respect to the freely traded currencies (that constitute the Pula basket) and inflation, to anticipate the Pula exchange rate. In this regard, certainty about the policy path helps to anchor economic decisions in a manner desired by policy action, and that is supportive of industrialisation and economic growth objectives.  Distinguished Ladies and gentlemen, effective communication also entails common understanding and usage of language.  In this regard, there is need, on the part of policy-setting institutions, for consistency in definitions, in the meanings of adjectives attributed to magnitudes of changes and movements in economic indicators, as well as the wording/interpretation of policy action (or non-action). To the extent that such common language is accepted and used by the media, policy analysts and commentators, it becomes a tool in policy formulation that has an intended impact on economic decision making. However, on the other hand, misreporting, either deliberately or due to lack of understanding of some key concepts, could cause unnecessary confusion in the market and, therefore, be detrimental to the implementation of these macroeconomic policies.  Communication also entails proper identification of spokespersons for the policy setting institution and matters 
11  on which they are responsible. A proper arrangement in this regard, promotes credibility and effectiveness of policy communication. For example, the Governor of the central bank is normally and appropriately the singular voice on monetary policy, while the Minister responsible for finance or treasury, is the singular voice on fiscal policy.  In concluding, I want to point out that, dissemination platforms are also an important component of policy effectiveness, and determine the reach and credibility of macroeconomic policy. For the Bank, we find high-level gatherings such as the launch of the Monetary Policy Statement, Economic Briefings following publication of the Annual report, as well as media briefings following Monetary Policy Committee meetings, to be very important. These facilitate both information dissemination, exchange of ideas, as well as feedback and evaluation of their performance.  Extensive use of the website also allows for wider and continuous access to information and external contributions and commentary. The Bank also finds that research and publications, as well as participation in workshops and seminars, help to project the quality and content of the Bank’s work, which also engenders credibility and integrity of the sources of policy analysis and decisions.  
12  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to end here and I would be happy to continue the dialogue as you make observations, comments and ask questions. 
Muhammad bin Ibrahim: Readying the financial sector amid theevolving war on terrorism financingWelcoming remarks by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia(Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Third Counter-Terrorism Financing Summit 2017 "PoweringRegional Solutions Through Strengthened Alliances and Innovations", Kuala Lumpur, 22November 2017.*   *   *“Readying the financial sector amid the evolving war on terrorism financing”Welcome to Sasana Kijang, Bank Negara Malaysia. We are pleased to host the 3rd JointRegional Counter-Terrorism Financing Summit 2017 with our partners, the AustralianTransaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and Pusat Pelaporan dan AnalisisTransaksi Keuangan (PPATK) Indonesia.The Summit, which was first held in 2015 in Sydney, has now become a hallmark event for manyacross the region; policy makers, law enforcement personnel, the financial intelligencecommunity and financial industry players. The Summit is a cumulation of the year’s work inproducing impactful outcomes for counter terrorism financing. With over 400 participants fromover 30 countries and international organisations, this Summit is a testament to our commitmentand determination to strengthen our cooperation in combating undesirable financial activitiesacross the globe.The nature of terror and terrorism financing is much more complex, say, compared to ten yearsago. Numerous new methods to raise, move and store funds, were conducted through small-scaled transfers via banks or money services businesses. And in some cases, via physicaltransportation of cash. Recent advancements in financial technology provide new opportunitiesfor anonymity. We should envisage that terrorist financiers will attempt to benefit fromanonymous transactions made possible by innovations of new payment products and servicessuch as internet-based payment systems, prepaid cards and virtual currencies.Likewise, fundraising through social media and other online platforms suchas “crowdfunding” have increased in prominence, in addition to other more traditional sources offunds such as proceeds of criminal activities, conventional donations, and funding fromlegitimate purposes.As change is a constant, collation of data points that this environment will continue to persist.Global internet users have increased from 397 million in the year 2000 to nearly 3.9 billion as ofJune 2017, an impressive growth of almost 1000%.Similarly, global investment activities in the FinTech industry have increased from USD9 billion in2010 to USD25 billion in 2016. If this trend is anything to go by, the financial industry will be hardpressed to mitigate, identify and prevent cases of abuse in the system.There is no doubt that rapid technological developments have offered immense potential foreconomic growth. Unfortunately, they have also spawned new ways for terrorist organisations toacquire, move and manage their funds. There are other risks not anticipated before, such asremote radicalisation via the internet that has resulted in an increase in the number of smallterrorist cells and “lone wolf actors” that makes detecting and halting terrorism financing evenmore challenging.In light of this development, the role of financial sector as a bulwark against terrorists financingbecomes even more critical. The financial system must always be in a state of readiness toidentify and effectively prevent any emerging risk of terrorism financing. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Let me suggest a three-pronged strategy to erect stronger defences within the financial system.This will include capitalising on technology, promoting clever partnership between the authoritiesand industry, and closer international cooperation.Capitalising on technologyWhile technological misuse poses a danger to society’s wellbeing, technology is also an effectivetool to counter terrorism financing. Akin to using a diamond to cut a diamond, we must harnessthe vast potential in technological innovations to reinvent and reinforce our lines of defence.A rule-based system, which is at the core of many of such preventive programmes today isbecoming increasingly ineffective. The reliance on automated systems to monitor and detectsuspicious transactions have served us well, but as we move forward, we need to do more. Weneed new tools. The adoption of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data technologyare tools that would likely be imperative, as suspicious transactions become more complex andharder to detect.As we learned from the Innovation Forum at this Summit, the use of artificial intelligence and bigdata will have the potential to increase efficiency and accuracy of assessments that is essentialin a dynamic environment. The banking sector needs to adopt the latest and most advancedtechnologies to improve its risk management framework.We need to prepare ourselves, as according to many pundits, digital currencies will become thenew norm. The advent of digital currencies as some have forecasted, will mark the beginning ofa new era in the financial sector. As authorities, we cannot be oblivious to these developments.As such, Bank Negara Malaysia has initiated the foundational work for the development of aregulatory structure for digital currencies. Beginning 2018, Bank Negara Malaysia will designatepersons converting crypto currencies into fiat money currencies as reporting institutions underthe Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act2001. This is to prevent the abuse of the system for criminal and unlawful activities and ensuringthe stability and integrity of the financial system.Strategic partnership Dynamic collaboration between the public and private sector is imperative to create anenvironment conducive for the creation of innovative solutions. One of the main findings from theGlobal FinTech Report published by PWC recently is that legislation is not keeping pace withinnovation, creating significant uncertainty. This tells us that a more adaptable structure in policy-making, that minimises bureaucratic hurdles or “red tape”, could be advantageous under thecurrent dynamic environment to encourage potentially important innovations.For that reason, Bank Negara Malaysia launched its very own FinTech Regulatory Sandbox in2016 to allow experimentation of FinTech solutions in a ‘live’ environment. A number of innovativefinancial solutions have been allowed to operate under this Sandbox initiative, including an e-KYCsolution that could revolutionise the AML/CFT framework in the financial sector in Malaysia. Thisinitiative allows for the viability of new technologies to be tested in a controlled environment whilesimultaneously exploring potential risks and the mitigating measures.In addition, Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to foster cooperative platforms between theauthorities and financial institutions to enable “rapid responses” to terrorism financing threats.Early this year, we facilitated an information sharing platform between law enforcement agenciesand selected financial institutions to swiftly and effectively mitigate risks and respond to threats.Greater access of intelligence information for financial institutions and the increased threats fromISIL had resulted in the upward trend of reporting of Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs). To 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
put it in perspective, in 2015, the financial intelligent unit (FIU) received 93 terrorism financingrelated STRs which led to 14 disclosures to law enforcement agencies. In comparison, betweenJanuary and June 2017, we received 346 terrorism financing related STRs which have led to 34disclosures to law enforcement agencies. Importantly, the quality of STRs submitted has alsoimproved.Bank Negara Malaysia is also in the midst of finalising the details of a new requirement for theBanking and Money Services Business sector to report remittances in high risk areas. The highrisk areas will be determined based on the law enforcement agency’s intelligence on areas thatthey view may pose higher risks for funding of terrorism activities.This is consistent with the Terrorism Financing Regional Risk Assessment findings at the 2ndCTF Summit in 2016 in Bali, where one of the priority actions identified was for FIUs to improvethe visibility and insights into the nature of terrorism financing in the region. The idea is intendedto help FIUs gain better insights into the role of financial and transit hubs in regional andinternational terrorism financing networks.Closer international cooperationAnother area to ensure an effective mitigating strategy requires closer regional and globalcooperation, particularly in the sharing of intelligence and technical know-how. Terrorism andterrorism financing are global issues that demand global solutions. Sharing of intelligence andexpertise across borders will go a long way towards enhancing the effectiveness of our riskmanagement framework.In this regard, the various working groups under the CTF Summits, the Financial IntelligenceConsultative Group and International Community of Experts have done commendable efforts andinitiatives in building capacity and sharing operational experiences in the region. This mustcontinue to be strengthened given the challenges that we will face.ConclusionThe fight against terrorism financing is an on-going battle that will continue to evolve in line withthe ever-changing landscape of the financial industry. In the era of rapid technologicaladvancements, it is essential that the financial sector’s risk management strategy remains agilein order to mitigate emerging risks. This requires not only the development of innovativetechnology-based deterrents and pro-active detection systems, but also effective cooperationbetween the public and private sector, law enforcement domestically and across borders. We stand ready to work alongside all key stakeholders, in both the public and private sectors,local and abroad, to ensure our financial sector is resilient to face the threat of terrorism financingwithin the country and in the region. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
1    Speech by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France and  President of the ACPR  ACPR conference of 22 November 2017 Bank resolution: from regulation to implementation   Ladies and Gentlemen,   I am delighted to welcome you to this new conference organised by the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution. For the first time, the morning of this conference will focus on bank resolution. This is always a somewhat paradoxical subject: if we are spending time on it today, it is in the hope that we will never have to deal with it in the future. "Si vis pacem, para bellum", as the Romans said... just as they prepared for war to maintain peace, we must be fully prepared for a crisis if we are to avoid it. But I would like to start by noting an important victory: that of Paris and France, which will welcome the European Banking Authority. It represents an achievement for a highly motivated and dynamic team, as well as a threefold recognition, i.e. that of the attractiveness of France and the Paris financial centre today; the richness of a financial ecosystem that boasts one of Europe's most impressive talent pools; and lastly, I believe, the quality of the public regulators and the supervisor – the ACPR. And the European Banking Authority's decision to move from London to Paris clearly bodes well for other post-Brexit financial relocations. There is no better time to talk about resolution, as this year, 2017, has seen the adoption of the first resolution decisions and the management of several crisis cases, which have been a baptism of fire for the Single Resolution Mechanism.  
2  The Banking Union, which is a major step forward for the euro area, is now operational, based on a single rulebook and – already – two pillars: the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) since the end of 2014; and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) since the beginning of 2016. Those two pillars should be supplemented by a third pillar, Deposit Insurance, for which we will need to find practical and reasonable compromises. But today I would like to focus on two cross-cutting challenges that are less often discussed: consistency and consolidation. As you will see, both involve resolution. However, it is my goal this morning to go further and consider the completion of the Banking Union as a whole.  I. The first challenge is to achieve better consistency between regulation, supervision and resolution, at three levels:   - First, consistency in the concrete mechanisms: finalising and simplifying the resolution pillar should be a priority. The case of the Italian bank failures has illustrated just how complex it is to combine the resolution regime laid down in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) with the State aid framework for orderly liquidation. In addition, confidence in the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and its capacity to intervene has to be bolstered. The setting-up of a common backstop, as mentioned in the European Commission’s communication of 11 October, is a promising avenue, which could take the form of a credit line granted by the ESM (the European Stability Mechanism). If it is placed within the ESM's remit, the rules for triggering this backstop could be introduced during the ESM governance review. Furthermore, this avenue could provide a partial response to the issue of the liquidity of newly resolved entities – mainly the “good banks” –, which has not yet been addressed with sufficient clarity: liquidity support from public sources, beyond what can legitimately be expected from the Eurosystem, should be clarified.   - Second, consistency in the legal framework and requirements: faced with the accumulation of new and “separate” requirements, we need to adopt a holistic and consistent approach in order to avoid a prudential overload. In particular, the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirement resulting from the new international framework requires a consistent adaptation of the European minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). Therefore, the MREL targets should be set on the basis of updated prudential requirements – pillar II and buffers – and the most up-to-date financial position of the banks concerned. It is a question of consistency. In the same vein, the consequences of the Basel III reforms package – when it is finalised – should be carefully 
3  taken into account, as it may lead to increased risk-weighted assets, which could in turn impact the MREL. All these regulatory developments, combined with changes to pillar II capital requirement amounts, could lead to over-calibration: each individual decision may be warranted; but their somewhat disorderly accumulation is not. And naturally, in setting these requirements, we must not jeopardise the level playing field between euro area banks and their international competitors.  - Third, consistency in the interaction between authorities, which should be improved: the case of Banco Popular in Spain, although it was resolved satisfactorily, also demonstrated the importance of swift and close cooperation between supervisory and resolution authorities, both at European and national levels. There is no denying that there is still a need to better coordinate the roles of the different European authorities – the SSM and ECB, the SRM, the Commission, and the European Banking Authority – in order to have a more clearly established “pilot in the plane” for crisis management. We still need to define the roles in order to decompartmentalise the different pillars and guarantee a continuum, which is vital to the smooth running of operations. But we must give our unequivocal support to these authorities in the performance of their duties: when the SSM, chaired by Danièle Nouy, and the ECB propose standards for the provisioning of new non-performing loans, they are operating fully within their remit to prevent future crises and ensure the convergence within the euro area that is at the heart of the Banking Union. We will see what the precise outcome of the present dialogue will be, but already I would like to say that I find some of the resistance shown by banks generally, and even more so, the controversy that has arisen in Italy in particular, inappropriate and unfounded. For non-performing loans, we have to plan ahead if we are to stop picking up the pieces afterwards. If we ever needed proof of the necessity for independent European supervision, this controversy has provided it.  II. The second challenge is to encourage consolidation within the Banking Union   Consolidation must be the result of consistency, and consistency is considering the Banking Union as a unique jurisdiction.  - We must therefore stop hindering cross-border bank consolidations in the euro area. 
4  We need to ensure that the implementation of new regulations does not give rise to new barriers. The development of cross-border banking activities is essential to reinforcing the single market, facilitating the allocation of savings and financing investment. We still lag far behind the American market in this respect: the market share in the United States of the top five banks is more than 40% whereas the market share in the euro area of the top five banks is less than 20%. Sound and safe cross-border consolidations would make banks better able to diversify their risks across the euro area, and channel savings more effectively towards productive investment. This is what I called a "Financing Union for Investment and Innovation", notably to shore up equity, which is the key to an innovation economy. The aim is crystal clear: within a Monetary and Banking Union, a cross-border merger must not be more difficult and cumbersome than a “domestic” merger.  Several levers must be pulled if the obstacles to these activities are to be removed. From a supervisory point of view, this involves promoting a consolidated approach by granting more waivers on liquidity and capital so as to allow more flexible capital allocation and limit ring-fencing. From a resolution point of view, internal MREL requirements should be a tool to facilitate the resolution of institutions, but they would become meaningless if calculated on a national basis. They must be calculated at the level of the Banking Union, considered as a unique jurisdiction. Indeed, compartmentalising an internal MREL within national borders would be an obstacle to the single market and European banking cross-border mergers. As a first concrete step, I suggest that the European Banking Authority publish a comprehensive stock-taking of all the regulatory and supervisory obstacles to cross-border activities and mergers. *** Conclusion: Banks must be prepared for these extreme situations because: - There is no such thing as zero risk, despite the improvements to prudential regulations and the reinforcement of banks' financial capacity. - The failure of a single participant, even one considered to be secondary, can have systemic effects, as even the largest groups are now no longer immune. Since 2011 and the end of the "too-big-to-fail" doctrine, these groups have become increasingly aware of this, and have drawn up their recovery plans and worked closely with the authorities to ready themselves for crisis situations.  The role played by the authorities in these continued efforts is crucial. Accordingly, the ACPR in France, and the ECB and the SRB at Banking Union level, guide and support these efforts, while also preparing for failure scenarios.  
5   To this end, as of 2015, the ACPR has provided a decisive boost that has led to the drafting of the first resolution plans by France's leading institutions. Today, all institutions under the authority of the Single Resolution Board have a resolution plan in place. As for the institutions under the direct responsibility of the ACPR, a first wave of plans has been completed and plans will be finalised for all the 142 institutions concerned at the end of 2018.  These combined efforts to pre-empt and to manage crisis situations must therefore be maintained in order to ensure the continuity of banking operations that are essential to the functioning of the economy, to avoid harming financial stability, to protect the resources of the Member States and to strengthen protection for depositors and investors.  
Page 1 of 12   An address by Daniel Mminele,  Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Sixth Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Annual Summer Macro Investor Conference  Johannesburg  24 November 2017  Macroeconomic policy and financial risks – From 2017 into 2018   Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  Thank you for the invitation to deliver the keynote address at this sixth Bank of America Merrill Lynch Annual Summer Macro Investor Conference.   The end of the year is upon us. No later than yesterday did the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) conclude its last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting for the year. It is around this time when many analysts and forecasters publish their respective outlooks for the year ahead, complete with „baseline scenarios‟ and a list of the major risks thereto. But to what extent will these risks differ from those that most of us flagged as the biggest threats 12 months ago? Does the way in which economic agents and policymakers responded to those threats hold lessons for the future? Or do we face as many uncertainties now as we did last year?  As American author David Levithan once said: “The mistake is thinking that there can be an antidote to the uncertainty.” We have to strive to achieve the best we can under the circumstances.  
Page 2 of 12 In trying to tackle the questions I have just posed, I will look back at some of the global risks which both official and private forecasters highlighted at the turn of 2017, to try and gauge the extent to which these risks materialised, if at all. I will also consider whether any new risks are emerging as we approach start of 2018, which may deserve our attention in the year ahead. I will then zoom in on South Africa‟s situation, analysing how much the global environment has influenced domestic developments over the past year and, equally, how new global uncertainties may combine with local issues to influence monetary policy over the coming year. At the end, I will also briefly touch on yesterday‟s monetary policy decision, assuming however, that most of you would have seen our statement.  What investors feared most in early 2017  There was a general feeling of economic optimism, albeit a prudent one, at the start of 2017. For example, in its World Economic Outlook Update published in January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wrote that „in [the] advanced economies, a modest and uneven recovery [was] expected to continue, with a gradual further narrowing of output gaps‟. Yet, in the same document, the IMF also warned that risks to the global outlook remained „tilted to the downside‟ and related to „ongoing adjustments in the global economy‟. Fears of disorderly adjustment were indeed numerous, including in the US1 – the major country which had recovered relatively fast from the global financial crisis even though it had been at its epicentre.  Indeed, because the imbalances created by the global crisis had healed earlier than in other jurisdictions, the US was also the first advanced economy to raise its interest rates from the zero-lower bound. This process was initially very gradual. However, the US Federal Reserve System (Fed) then signalled a likely acceleration in the pace of interest-rate increases (and and that it would embark on the process of reducing in its balance sheet) as it had become increasingly confident of meeting its medium-term growth and inflation goals. In light of the earlier key influence that low US interest rates had exerted on boosting risk appetite and compressing term premiums in global financial markets, investors became concerned about a reversal of these earlier favourable market developments.                                                             1 United States 
Page 3 of 12 The election of a new US administration in November 2016, which pledged large-scale tax cuts and an „America first‟ approach to external trade, compounded market fears of a disruptive rise in US interest rates and an appreciation of the dollar.  In fact, many observers viewed the 2016 presidential election result in the US as one of many examples – albeit a key one – depicting a general shift of voters in advanced economies towards populist politics and policies, including a rejection of several key tenets of the wave of globalisation over the past few decades. The growing hostility towards these tenets – including free trade, free capital flows, and easier cross-border movement of labour – was seen at its strongest in continental Europe. With key elections scheduled throughout 2017, not least in France and Germany, observers feared a move towards populism that had the potential to torpedo the already delayed eurozone economic recovery.   At the same time, at the other end of the Eurasian continent, economic observers noted some stabilization in the Chinese economy and capital markets, yet doubted whether this pattern would be durable in light of the continued growth in imbalances that it seemed to involve, not least of which was the ongoing build-up of corporate debt, especially in state-owned enterprises. In turn, investors feared that China would continue to suffer capital outflows, which might force the authorities to again allow the kind of depreciation in the yuan exchange rate that had prompted a tightening in global financial conditions in late 2015 and early 2016.   Concerns about the sustainability of economic stabilization in China also raised worries that the prices of many commodities (in particular of metals and minerals) could experience a renewed sell-off in view of China‟s key role in shaping demand for these commodities. Furthermore, the last few months of 2016 saw a jump in crude oil prices as key producers, both inside and outside of OPEC2, somewhat surprisingly agreed on freezing production levels. As the market adjusted to a new supply-demand equilibrium, the possibility of a further rise in oil prices at a time when other commodity prices could be on the back foot posed a risk to the economic recovery of both the advanced economies and the oil-importing emerging economies.                                                             2 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
Page 4 of 12  The global backdrop that proved benign in 2017  However, as we look back at the developments over this year, we can be thankful that most of the risks I have listed above did not materialise. In the US, policy normalization continued largely like the Fed had anticipated at the start of the year. The FOMC3 raised its Federal funds target rate by 25 basis points each at its March and June meetings, and markets largely anticipate a third hike in December, which would bring the funds target rate to 1.25-1.50%, in line with the median forecast of the FOMC participants at the start of 2017. Separately, the Fed began the gradual unwinding of its balance sheet in October.  Yet these steps have not triggered the yield-curve steepening or the sell-off in riskier assets that many feared. In fact, on 17 November, the 10-year US Treasury yield stood at 2.36, which was 8 basis points lower than at the beginning of the year. The yield curve has thus flattened. At the same time, US corporate credit spreads, both investment-grade and high-yield, are lower than at the start of 2017, and the S&P 500 equity index has rallied by 15% over the period.  Several factors contributed to this solid market performance. On the macroeconomic front, while real economic activity in the US continued to expand at a solid pace, price and wage inflation kept undershooting most official and private forecasts. Indications that prices may have become structurally less responsive to an erosion of economic slack, as well as perceptions that potential US GDP4 may have slowed over time, led the FOMC to lower its medium-term projection for the equilibrium Federal funds rate, even as monetary accommodation was being withdrawn.5 At the same time, expectations for a quick and sizable fiscal stimulus in the US, which could have been a justification for a faster pace of monetary tightening, gradually faded throughout 2017.   The economic recovery in the eurozone continued to display stronger momentum than had been expected at the start of the year. Consensus forecasts for GDP growth                                                            3 Federal Open Market Committee 4 gross domestic product 5 As of the December 2016 FOMC meeting, its median projection for the medium-term Federal funds   rate was 3.0%; it declined to 2.75% by the September 2017 meeting. 
Page 5 of 12 in 2017 and 2018, which stood at 1.3% and 1.6% respectively at the beginning of the year, have since been revised upwards by 0.9 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But the so-called „populist risk‟ has not disappeared. While the anti-mainstream candidates did not cause major upsets in elections in France or the Netherlands, the results still generally confirmed that a significant portion of the electorate chose candidates who were openly critical of globalisation and of the policy consensus that has prevailed over the past few decades. Nonetheless, this political background did not prevent a further rise in business and consumer confidence in the region. If anything, the current confidence readings in the eurozone stand well above the average of the past decade and their increase has been broad-based across countries.  The Chinese economy also performed somewhat better this year than most analysts had anticipated. While a degree of policy tightening, mostly through stricter regulation, did weigh on certain components of domestic demand, Chinese exports benefitted from an improved global and regional trade environment. At the same time, the authorities‟ tighter regulatory stance appears to have succeeded in curbing specific components of private-sector financing (specifically the funding of and by shadow-banking institutions) while keeping bank loan growth relatively stable and thus avoiding a broad-based credit slowdown. Finally, pressure on China‟s capital account has continued to moderate, allowing official foreign-exchange reserves to edge up again after the losses of the previous years.  With respect to the oil market, OPEC members appear to have largely complied with their late-2016 deal to limit output, although that agreement has not been the „game changer‟ that some observers had feared, in part because of the US shale industry‟s ability to quickly ramp up production once oil prices exceed the break-even point. Admittedly, oil prices posted significant gains in the latter part of the year, rising from a low of US$44 per barrel in mid-June to US$63 per barrel as of 23 November. Yet this move seemed to be more a reflection of stronger demand (as global economic growth exceeded expectations) than of a supply constraint that could endanger the economic recovery.  Overall, considering that many of the risks feared in early 2017 did not materialise and the fact that the „push and pull‟ factors have remained favourable, the year saw 
Page 6 of 12 renewed and solid net non-resident capital inflows into emerging markets, including South Africa. In an October report, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) projected that such flows would rise to US$1.1 trillion this year, or to about 4% of emerging-market GDP – meaningfully higher than the lows of 1.5% in 2015 although still far off the pre-crisis peak of over 9% in 2007. The bulk of the improvement would reflect debt portfolio and banking-related flows. Indeed, the IIF estimates that in the first 10 months of 2017, the former totalled US$162 billion versus only US$37 billion for the whole of 2016.  What should we worry about for 2018?  Of course, the fact that major risks did not materialise in 2017 should not breed complacency about the coming year, even though most official and private forecasters broadly agree about a continuation of the broad-based, relatively inflation-free economic expansion in most regions of the world in 2018. History teaches us that it is often when most observers concur about the low probability of negative scenarios that these unfold. The trigger of the next downturn may well be an event that no forecaster sees as a risk right now. Nevertheless, economic downturns – beyond their immediate trigger – always have deeper underlying causes. Let me list a few of these underlying trends which could be sources of fragility for the world‟s economy.  First, considerable uncertainty remains about the long-term impacts of the large-scale monetary stimulus put in place by the major central banks since the global financial crisis as well as about the (more short-term) implications of its gradual unwinding. While the degree of global monetary stimulus has so far had surprisingly little impact on inflation, the debate remains open as to whether this pattern will continue once output gaps have fully closed and once legacy issues from the crisis (for instance in the banking sector) have finally been resolved. Equally, analysts debate whether even a gradual unwinding of central banks‟ balance sheets can trigger a quick decompression of term and risk premiums across major financial assets. Because the size of these balance sheets (relative to world GDP) is unprecedented, guidance from economic history is limited.  
Page 7 of 12 Second, the recent cyclical improvement in global GDP growth may mask persistent issues around low trend gains in productivity which, if unresolved, could result in economic agents and financial market participants being over-optimistic about future economic activity. In most of the large economies, both average labour productivity and total factor productivity have slowed in the past decade or so – a trend which, at least in the advanced economies, has predated the global financial crisis. The exact causes of this „secular stagnation‟ are not yet fully understood, and economists disagree on how long it may last. As of yet, there are limited signs that this trend is reversing.  Third, despite efforts at deleveraging in some sectors and in some countries, global debt, as a share of GDP, remains higher than before the global financial crisis. Data from the Bank for International Settlements show that, as of the first quarter of 2017, total credit to the non-financial sector (in all reporting countries) stood at 219% of GDP compared to 185% at the end of 2008.6 While the credit to households has stabilised relative to GDP, the financing extended to general government and non-financial corporations has steadily increased. If unchecked, this rising trend has the potential to trigger phases of financial instability in the future, weighing on growth and undermining financial assets.  In fact, in many cases the market valuations of these assets already appear elevated relative to long-run norms, which increases their vulnerability to any potential repricing of risk. And while these valuations may not be inconsistent across different categories – the equity risk premiums over bond yields, for example, are relatively large – this does not preclude a situation where all asset categories sell off together. The catalyst for such a sell-off need not be an economic one. Geopolitical tensions in regions as diverse as the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea indicate that the world is not necessarily a safer place than in previous decades.     The global backdrop and the South African economy  Let me now turn to the influence that this global backdrop has had, and is likely to have, on the South African economy.                                                             6 These statistics use credit data at market value, converted at PPP-adjusted exchange rates. 
Page 8 of 12  As I have mentioned above: the relatively benign global environment, coupled with the failure of key risks to materialise, has supported a continued inflow of capital towards emerging markets in 2017 – and South Africa was no exception. IIF statistics show that, in the first 10 months of the year, net non-resident purchases of South African debt instruments totalled US$4.9 billion, up from US$1.9 billion in the whole of last year.   Such inflows, up to the last couple of months, have helped the country‟s financial assets to weather unfavourable domestic growth developments as well as political and policy uncertainty without any major, or lasting, consequences. For example, from early January to the end of August 2017, the rand‟s trade-weighted exchange rate depreciated by only 2.5% and the yield on the benchmark R186 government bond declined by 35 basis points. In addition to global factors, downside surprises in domestic inflation figures for most of the first half of the year as well as a reduced deficit on the current account have contributed to the resilience of domestic fixed-income assets.  Yet, South Africa‟s domestic problems have prevented the country from fully benefiting from the benign global backdrop that historical experience and international comparisons would suggest. In fact, while the global risks seen at the start of 2017 did not materialise, several domestic risks became a reality, especially later in the year. This was illustrated by the depreciation of 6.3% in the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand and a rise of 53 basis points in the benchmark R186 government bond yield from the end of August to the end of October 2017.  Real economic growth failed to display any meaningful acceleration after a poor performance in 2016, despite the rebound in agricultural production following the previous year‟s drought. At present, the SARB forecasts average growth of only 0.7% in 2017, after a mere 0.3% last year. Hence, the gap between South African GDP growth and world GDP growth, which was minimal up to 2013, continues to widen.  Disappointing economic growth, together with the surprisingly low buoyancy of major tax revenues relative to their bases, has compounded the fragility of South Africa‟s fiscal situation.  
Page 9 of 12  For several years already, projected fiscal consolidation and debt stabilization have had to be postponed because of GDP growth shortfalls relative to budget projections. However, the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement of October 2017 not only saw a meaningful upward revision to deficit estimates for the current year, but also did not project a reduction in that deficit in the outer years. Consequently, the debt-to-GDP ratio is now projected to keep rising throughout the period, approaching 60% by 2020/21. This mixture of weak growth and rising debt – the two concerns repeatedly flagged by ratings agencies – suggests that South Africa must increasingly be wary of possible further downgrades to its sovereign ratings. Following the announcement by Fitch Ratings yesterday that it has affirmed South Africa‟s BB+ rating (which in their case applies to both local and foreign currency debt), announcements will be made later today by both S&P and Moody‟s on the outcome of ratings reviews recently undertaken by them.   While exhibiting uncertainty and generating volatility, the recent behaviour of financial markets clearly highlights this risk. Admittedly, as I have indicated earlier, the global economic and financial backdrop has sheltered South African assets for most of the year. Yet they underperformed relative to their emerging-market peers. For example, in the first nine months of 2017, the J P Morgan emerging-market foreign-exchange index appreciated by 5.6% while the rand gained only 1.3% against the US dollar. Such an underperformance was already a warning sign of the relative unattractiveness of South African assets, as generally, in periods of improved global risk appetite, both the rand and domestic bonds tend to outperform their peers. In recent weeks, and in particular since the upward revision to the deficit and debt projections in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, the sell-off in both the local currency and domestic bonds is a much clearer indication of investors‟ nervousness about South Africa‟s rising economic and fiscal risks as we draw the curtain on 2017 and move towards 2018.  Recent monetary policy developments  The SARB cannot ignore this recent shift in the balance of risks affecting South Africa‟s economy or the way it is perceived by financial markets. Obviously, the 
Page 10 of 12 central bank does not target the exchange rate or the level of bond yields, as its mandate is to keep inflation within the 3-6% target range.  Nonetheless, market developments are important inputs in policy formulation – fairly directly for the exchange rate (which impacts on inflation with a lag) and more indirectly for the level of bond yields (which reflects investors‟ perceived risks to the inflation outlook and how they expect monetary policy to respond as a consequence).  In its July meeting, the MPC of the SARB lowered the repurchase rate by 25 basis points, both in reaction to a sequence of better-than-expected inflation data and a stronger likelihood that inflation would remain comfortably within the target range over the forecast period. In fact, the SARB‟s projections for both headline and core inflation in 2018/19 had been revised downwards on several instances in the first half of the year. Nonetheless, the MPC guarded against expectations that this rate reduction would mark the start of an easing cycle and warned that any future moves would remain data-dependent. This reflected a high degree of uncertainty about the future inflation profile; the decision was also informed by the MPC‟s continued discomfort with the broad measures of inflation expectations remaining uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range.  By its September meeting, the MPC was of the view that the balance of risks to inflation had tilted to the upside and warranted a more cautious approach, and thus decided to leave the policy rate unchanged.   At the conclusion of our MPC meeting yesterday, we decided to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75 per annum. Our decision to err on the side of caution at the September meeting appears to have been correct, as upside risks to the inflation outlook have increased in the last two months.  The Bank‟s inflation forecast shows some deterioration, with inflation expected to be 0.2 percentage points higher in both 2018 and 2019, at levels of 5.2 and 5.5 per cent, respectively. These revisions were mainly influenced by a weaker exchange rate path, higher international oil prices, and higher average wage growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period.  Yet this „baseline scenario‟ only tells part of the story. Although inflation is not expected to breach the upper end of the target range over the forecast horizon, as 
Page 11 of 12 indicated, the risks to the outlook are currently assessed to be skewed to the upside, at a time when imminent key event risks contribute to an environment of heightened uncertainty.  In light of the growing fiscal risks and increased domestic financial market volatility, the MPC has to be cognisant of the possibility that the inflation outlook could deteriorate further. The MPC also has to weigh the risks I have outlined earlier, including the possibility that the global environment could turn less favourable, which, in the current circumstances, could exacerbate the downward pressure on domestic financial assets.  At the end of the day, the MPC is well aware of the current weakness in economic growth, with continued downside risks, and will, wherever possible within its mandate, strive to support an improvement in economic activity through an appropriate monetary stance. However, in an environment characterised by elevated uncertainty, where inflation expectations could become unanchored, the best approach for the SARB is to minimise the number of threats to price and financial stability. Consequently, the MPC will continue to closely monitor both global and domestic developments as well as their implications for the inflation outlook, and will act accordingly.  Conclusion  While acknowledging that five weeks can be a long time in economies and markets, I think we can reasonably safely already draw the conclusion that the global backdrop in 2017 proved to be more benign than many had anticipated. For the first time in many years, the outlook is finally looking promising, with global growth gathering momentum, without yet generating too much inflation. Financial markets have generally performed well.  South Africa faced a particularly challenging domestic environment, which affected growth performance, mainly because of low business and consumer confidence. We failed to fully take advantage of the global cyclical upswing. The inflation outlook improved during the year, and inflation is expected to be inside the target range over the forecast horizon. But more recently upside risks to the inflation outlook have been intensifying, which will require careful monitoring.   
Page 12 of 12  As Niels Bohr said: “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it‟s about the future”. We do not know what 2018 has in store for us, and how the global risk profile will unfold.    The relatively benign global backdrop in 2017, should not make us complacent, but rather encourage us to take advantage of the current cyclical economic upswing to strengthen our structural reforms and implement growth-friendly policies that are needed to boost economic growth and create employment.   In South Africa, 2018 provides an opportunity to press the “reset button” and, through a collaborative approach, to try and break the self-reinforcing negative feedback loop of policy uncertainties, low private-sector confidence, subdued investment in productive capacities, and poor competitive performance.      Thank you.     
Jens Weidmann: Monetary union – ever a work in progress? Theeuro area torn between the Maastricht framework and fiscal unionSpeech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of theBoard of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 21st RWI (Leibniz-Institut fürWirtschaftsforschung) Economic Discussion, Essen, 29 November 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenMany a joker in his time has answered the question “How do I get to the philharmonic hall?” withthe punch line “Practice, practice, practice."As my musical talent would certainly never have got me onto this stage, I am all the more gratefulto you, Mr Schmidt, for the opportunity to talk here today about current monetary policy and thearchitecture of monetary union.I will be discussing what needs to be done to make monetary union stable, and what rolemonetary policy plays in this endeavour.2. Congratulations to Wim KöstersBut first of all, I would like to say a few words about Professor Wim Kösters, who is retiringtoday. It is a special honour to pay tribute to his long and successful career as an academic, anacademic manager and a supporter of young talent.Mr Kösters, you have been a member of the RWI’s Board of Directors since 2003 in yourfunction as an academic manager. It is partly down to you, then, that the RWI ranks amongGermany’s foremost economic research and policy consulting institutions. The LeibnizAssociation shared this view in its 2012 evaluation, hailing the work of five out of the RWI’s sixresearch areas ratings as “good” to “excellent".First-rate research and problem-driven policy consulting calls for well-trained and motivatedemployees who are the brains and soul of any institution. But as we all know, that kind of talentdoesn’t just spring up like mushrooms. Hence the particular importance of nurturing up-and-coming talent – at the RWI, at the Bundesbank and at the many other enterprises and institutionsacross Germany.Bearing that in mind, Mr Kösters, it is greatly to your credit that you have done so much for somany years to foster gifted students and doctorate candidates. You have been a member of theboard of the Cusanuswerk scholarship body’s gifted education foundation since 2008, as well asits chairman since 2011. Incidentally, there used to be long-standing ties between theCusanuswerk and the Bundesbank – you took over as chairman back then from Hans Tietmeyer,the former president of the Deutsche Bundesbank. I’ve had the numbers checked: since youbecame a member of the foundation’s board, more than 3,000 students have been sponsored.And at the RWI, too, you helped to create an environment in which the next generation ofacademics can reach their full potential. The great many RWI employees who submit their PhDthesis each year attest to your achievements.And let’s not forget the many academics trained personally by you, Mr Kösters, in your chair,among them Professor Ansgar Belke, who will be taking part in the subsequent panel discussion.That panel discussion will be discussing a topic to which you have devoted yourself as an 1 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
academic since the 1990s, and one which is close to my own heart: the prerequisites for makingmonetary union a union of stability.3. European integrationLadies and gentlemen, even though today’s event is essentially a gathering of economists, thereis one point which must not be forgotten when discussing monetary union: namely that the eurowas also a political project from the outset. As early as 1949, the French economist JacquesRueff declared that money would pave the way to European integration. In his own words:“Europe will either be built on money or it won’t be built at all."The unification of Europe after the Second World War was a political vision intended to bringlasting peace and stability to the continent. To put it in the words of Jean Monnet, the greatEuropean and winner of the Charlemagne Prize, and whose name your chair, Mr Köster, alsobears: “By creating Europe, the Europeans are building a true foundation for peace."Yet it was the integration of Europe’s economies that was a major catalyst for Europeanunification. And this in itself has produced remarkable results. Economic integration – in otherwords, the elimination of trade barriers and the harmonisation of regulations – boosts prosperity.Free trade enables each of us to specialise in what we’re best at. Economies of scale can beharnessed more readily. Plus a bigger market results in greater competition. And this in turnfosters innovative power and productivity.It is, of course, impossible to say exactly how the economy would have fared in the absence ofEuropean unification. The impact of the single market on the prosperity of European states,however, has been considerable. It is estimated that European economic integration has boostedannual economic output by between 5 and 25 per cent.   That’s a handsome 1,450 to 7,250euro per capita.There is no question that economic and monetary union was the boldest step towards deepereconomic integration. And at the same time, it was a twin promise: of price stability, and ofstronger long-term economic growth.There is a broad consensus that EMU has so far succeeded in delivering on the first of thosepromises. I dare say that significantly fewer people would claim that it has done likewise on thesecond.For one thing, mounting economic competition across borders has been driving change, just liketechnological progress has, and many people are afraid of this. If the benefits not just ofeconomic integration but of innovation as well are to be felt by the greatest number of people, theframework conditions also need to be right. Flexible economic structures and a good educationsystem, say, are prerequisites for sustainable growth and for ensuring that many people canshare in the opportunities offered by technological progress and international trade, for example.For another thing, though, the financial and sovereign debt crisis shook the euro area to its core.Taxpayers were forced to step in for billions upon billions of euro in bank losses. Joblessness insome member states rocketed to levels hitherto unseen in the post-war era. To all intents andpurposes, European and global institutions became the ancillary government in individualcountries. And many saw the rescue packages as the first step on the road towards a transferunion – something which had been categorically ruled out prior to the launch of monetary union.Many perceived the problems instigated by the crisis to be huge. Some even thought themirresolvable. Indeed, a number of commentators, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, butelsewhere, too, predicted that the euro would come crashing down.That didn’t happen – and it would have been a disaster if it had. At the same time, let’s be honest123 2 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
– the future might also hold regional or sectoral crises in store which put the euro area to thetest. The upbeat economic situation right now shouldn’t blind us to the fact that it is one outcomeof a very accommodative monetary policy.The low-interest-rate environment, then, is contributing to an air of deceptive calm which mighttempt economic and fiscal policy decision-makers to sit back and do nothing. But if a crisis doesmaterialise, the European house we live in today will need to be sufficiently strong to withstandthese headwinds. There is still much to do, if we are to make that a reality.4. Ensuring the long-term stability of monetary unionOne defining characteristic of European monetary union is that, while it has a common monetarypolicy, it also encompasses 19 largely independent national fiscal and economic policies. This,incidentally, is what makes European monetary union unlike other federal currency areas, suchas the United States or Switzerland.This particular composition does not only make European monetary union unique, it alsopotentially makes it vulnerable. As the crisis made clear, the euro area as a whole ultimately hadno option but to cushion unsound developments in individual member states in order to preventthe stability of the entire monetary union from being jeopardised.The underlying context is that, if you are not careful, membership in a monetary unionundermines the incentive to exercise fiscal prudence. This is because the consequences ofexcessive debt in one member state can, to an extent, be passed on to the rest of the group.Mr Kösters, you were not alone in flagging this incentive to run up debt inherent to monetaryunion early on. When a country in a monetary union takes on debt, the interest rate does notrise quite as sharply as it would have if that country had its own currency. Instead, however, theinterest rates in all of the other member states rise slightly.Economic theory calls this phenomenon the “common pool problem", and overfishing is oftenused as an example to explain it. A single fisherman who catches too many fish leaves fewerbehind for others and ultimately jeopardises the long-term sustainability of fish stocks.Overfishing, then, is detrimental to the fishing community. But, for an individual fisherman, it ishighly desirable to net as many fish as possible and not consider the interests of other or futuregenerations of fishermen.This is arguably one reason why historian and winner of the 2017 Charlemagne Prize TimothyGarton Ash described the story of monetary union so far as a “crisis foretold".Yet that remark is not really entirely fair to the founding fathers of monetary union, who mostcertainly did have their eye on the particular incentive to run up debt. Their idea was that acombination of market discipline and fiscal rules would keep budgetary policymaking on a soundbasis. As you know, the Maastricht Treaty contains a no-bailout clause prohibiting member states fromassuming each other’s debts. The treaty also bans monetary financing of government debt bythe Eurosystem. Together, these safeguards aim to ensure that investors themselves – and notother parties such as the taxpayer – bear the risks of investing in government bonds.In addition, the Stability and Growth Pact includes rules to restrict government debt and budgetdeficits. These aimed not only to ensure that public finances remain on a sustainable path, butalso to create the buffers needed to allow budgets to fluctuate over the economic cycle and toenable member states to take countermeasures during economic crises without being forced tocall for external aid to fend off looming overindebtedness.4 3 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
These rules form the principle of national fiscal responsibility. This is the foundation of theMaastricht framework.Walter Eucken, a founder of the Freiburg school and pioneer of the social market economy,summed up this liability principle as follows: “Whoever reaps the benefits must also bear theliability."And what goes for the economy goes for countries as well: decisions will only ever be takenresponsibly if those who decide also bear responsibility for the consequences of their actions.Thus, the Maastricht Treaty largely assigned the power to act and liability in matters of economicand fiscal policy to the member states.And yet, government debt in some euro area countries has risen significantly. One reason forthis is the repeated breaches of the budgetary rules – even by Germany, incidentally, at the verybeginning of monetary union. Capital markets, contrary to initial expectations, also did not punishthese infractions by imposing higher risk premiums. The no-bailout clause, it seemed, lackedcredibility.But another reason for the ballooning debt levels was undoubtedly the financial crisis, whichforced euro area countries to shore up their banking systems. This was another reason whydoubts emerged over the sustainability of some member states’ debt in the subsequentsovereign debt crisis. Rescue measures were swiftly rolled out to prevent the crisis fromescalating.This episode showed that it might be wise for the euro area, too, to have a lender of last resort tosupport countries facing exceptional circumstances in order to limit the negative fallout for thecurrency area as a whole.Hence the establishment of a permanent safety net in the form of the European StabilityMechanism (ESM). Its financial assistance allows distressed sovereigns to bridge temporaryliquidity bottlenecks and put government finances back on a sustainable footing. This is whycountries are required to commit to reforms so that they can put their finances back in order assoon as possible.However, not even the financial assistance programmes have made monetary union crisis-resistant for good. For all their benefits, they added further elements of mutual liability andsoftened the principle of independent accountability. At the same time, economic and fiscal policyremained a national matter. The balance between actions and liability for their consequences,then, had got out of kilter.The euro area will only ever be made crisis-proof once and for all if the balance between actionand liability is restored. There are two ways in which this can be achieved. Either through deeperintegration, ie a situation in which every member state surrenders decision-making powers infiscal and economic policy matters to the European level, or by returning to an overhauledMaastricht framework. In the latter case, euro area countries would once again bear greaterliability for their own decisions.The first solution is the road to fiscal union with centralised decision-making powers. Admittedly,fiscal union would not guarantee fiscal prudence, and permanent guide rails would need to beadded as a matter of stability policy, though it could curb the aforementioned propensity to rundeficits.This is why it was obvious to many economists, even before monetary union was launched, that,in the long term, monetary union must go hand in hand with political union. One of thoseeconomists was you, Mr Kösters. In 1994, you wrote: “It should first of all be clear that in the long5 4 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
run the EMU can only exist if accompanied by a European Political Union." German ChancellorHelmut Kohl held a similar view. Addressing the Bundestag in November 1991, he remarked that“the idea of sustaining economic and monetary union over time without political union is afallacy".True political union proved unfeasible back then, however. It seems to me that not much haschanged in this regard, not least because the necessary transfer of sovereign rights wouldrequire comprehensive changes to the EU Treaty and national constitutions.That would suggest that option number two currently stands a more realistic chance of restoringthe balance between actions and liability. It essentially means bolstering the principle ofindependent national responsibility. Only when public finances are put on a sound footing andcountries stop drifting apart economically will the Eurosystem ultimately be relieved of thepressure to constantly intervene as a firefighter. And only then will the financial markets do theirjob of taking adequate account of risks in their lending activities.But what would have to change for monetary union’s regulatory framework to function better thanit has done in the past?To paraphrase Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: “Easier said than done.” Goethe was not just apoet, but also finance minister for the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Whether or not this bonmot summed up his experiences in fiscal policy is unclear, however.In any case, his remark holds true for the fiscal rules in the euro area: established with the bestintentions, but rarely adhered to consistently. The European Union’s budgetary and debt ruleshave been reformed over and over again. But that did not make them any stricter, to put it mildly. Ihave already mentioned that not even Germany set a shining example in the early days.The latest reform of the Stability and Growth Pact originally set out to strengthen the binding forceof the rules on debt. As it turned out, that reform created considerable discretionary scope,mainly for the European Commission. We also drew attention to this in our June MonthlyReport. The Commission has already exploited this leeway on several occasions and invariablyinterpreted the rules very liberally in doing so.The Commission’s dual role as the guardian of the EU Treaty on the one hand and as a politicalinstitution on the other is undoubtedly a factor in the repeated compromises made at the expenseof budgetary discipline. After all, as a political institution, the Commission must always strive tostrike a balance between the various political interests of the member states. The outcome isthat individual euro area countries have breached the budgetary rules ever since the financialcrisis erupted.Austrian comic Werner Schneyder once accurately characterised the situation as follows:Europe, he quipped, is made up of countries that do not want to be told to do what they havedecided to do themselves.4.1 Reinforce the binding effect of fiscal rulesWhat is needed to reinforce the binding effect of the fiscal rules is a straightforward andtransparent design and implementation of the rules. An independent institution taking overresponsibility for fiscal surveillance from the Commission would be a key step towards a lesspolitical approach. That would be a clear marker where unbiased analysis ends and politicalconcessions begin. That is why one of the Bundesbank’s suggestions is to strengthen the role ofthe ESM in matters of fiscal surveillance.One thing does seem obvious to me, however. If member states retain fiscal autonomy, thesustainability of public finances cannot be safeguarded by rules alone.56 5 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
This is why it is not just the binding force of the rules that we need to strengthen; we also needthe disciplining effect of the market, just as the founding fathers had envisaged of the monetaryunion. In other words, interest rate levels have to be aligned more strongly again with the risks ingovernment budgets.That can only be achieved, however, if the credibility of the no-bail-out clause in the MaastrichtTreaty is restored. Investors need to be under no illusion that they risk losing their money if theybuy bonds from governments that have unsound public finances.This is another reason why I take a critical stance of the Eurosystem’s government bondpurchases, because they weaken the market mechanism which prices sovereign solvency risk.This ends up blurring the boundaries between monetary policy and fiscal policy. And yet a cleardivision of responsibilities is vital for a stability-oriented monetary policy in the euro area ifEurosystem central banks are not to wind up dancing to the tune of fiscal policymakers. This iswhy I called for a quick end to government bond purchases at the end of October.4.2 Automatic ESM maturity extensionAnd this is also why one of the proposals put forward by the Bundesbank envisages changing thecontractual terms for government bonds in the euro area. In future, the maturities of a country’sbonds ought to be automatically extended as soon as the country applies for financialassistance.Under the existing procedure, remember, a large part of the assistance loans go towards payingoff legacy creditors. This lets those legacy creditors, such as banks, off the hook – at theexpense of taxpayers. Extending maturities, on the other hand, would leave them on the hook,and they could be still held liable if debt is restructured down the line. In an emergency, it can bevery difficult to tell for certain whether a debtor is temporarily illiquid or actually insolvent. Anautomatic extension of maturities, however, would grant the ESM far more time to give carefulconsideration to the question of debt sustainability – and without releasing legacy creditors fromliability during this period.A maturity extension would have the added advantage of substantially reducing the need forfinancial aid under an ESM programme. This would also broaden the reach of the existing rescuemechanism. Had we already been able to automatically extend maturities by three years back in2011, say, Portugal would have only needed around €43 billion by 2014 instead of the total of €76billion it received in financial assistance.I am also convinced that when it comes to resolving future crises in the euro area, the IMF willarguably play a far less prominent role and could, at most, be involved in an advisory capacity.So this increased clout would certainly be helpful.Incidentally, the ESM stands for a substantial form of fiscal solidarity. ESM chief Klaus Reglinghas said that an ESM loan costs two-thirds less than an IMF loan because the ESM – unlike theIMF – does not charge a risk mark-up for its loans. In the case of Greece, for instance, the savingcomes to 5.6% p.a. of its GDP.This is an major transfer to governments in need of assistance. But they are not permanenttransfers and they are tied to strict conditionality in order to eliminate as much moral hazard aspossible. Permanent direct transfers are not necessary in a functioning currency area, as theUnited States demonstrates. Quite the opposite, in fact: dividing agents into transfer providersand transfer recipients risks undermining public acceptance of monetary union in individualmember countries.Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed automatic extension of maturities will only boost thedisciplinary role of capital markets if restructuring sovereign debt really is a realistic option. But 6 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
that will only ever be the case if the financial system really can absorb a haircut, because if ahaircut brought the financial system to its knees, the community of states would still have anincentive to bail out private creditors.Politicians and supervisory authorities in the euro area have, on more than one occasion, facedthe following paradoxical situation: a haircut for overindebted countries drags down the bankingsystem with it. But if banks carrying government bonds at risk of default on their books areresolved, the necessary rescue measures will plunge the country into financial distress once andfor all.This reminds me a little of the novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller, in which a “catch-22” is anintolerable situation where every apparent alternative only draws the protagonists ever closertowards their fate. In Heller’s novel, it’s the contradictory rules that put the American soldiers intoan absurd situation.In the euro area, it was primarily the lack of rules regarding this dilemma that was pivotal: therewas no rule which stated that, if the worst comes to the worst, it was mainly up to the investorsand creditors to shoulder banks’ losses, and not taxpayers.This is also precisely what makes the new European regime for bank resolution, and its rigorousapplication, so very important. Because these are the rules which stipulate that if a bank needs tobe wound up, investors and creditors will be first in line to bear the ensuing losses. Only after thatdoes a resolution fund financed by banks step in.Add to that the close-knit sovereign-bank nexus in the euro area, as evidenced by the hugestocks of government bonds which banks hold on their balance sheets. This is why it is notenough to just focus on bank resolution.4.3 Abolish preferential treatment of sovereign bondsIt would be enough to curb banks’ appetite for government bonds to force them to treat sovereignexposures on their books in exactly the same way as private ones.Because, unlike in the case of corporate bonds, banks are not required to back governmentbonds denominated in domestic currency with capital, nor do they have to comply with anyceilings or caps. This is the case irrespective of the issuing sovereign’s credit rating quality – andeven though the euro area debt crisis made it quite plain that government bonds are by nomeans risk-free.Only when banks hold sufficient capital against government bonds and limits are placed on thesize of individual exposures will banks be able to cushion a restructuring of sovereign debt. Andonly then will there probably be the political will needed to take this step.The Bundesbank has put the topic of abolishing the preferential treatment of government bondson the agendas of international committees. But the talks, particularly on the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, are not straightforward. That’s why it’s now vital that we give the issuegreater prominence on the European committees and make headway there.Ladies and gentlemen, toughening the fiscal rules, abolishing the preferential treatment affordedto government bonds, and automatically extending the maturity of sovereign debt are threeimportant reforms. They can play a part in putting monetary union on a sound long-term footing.These proposals put the shine back on the principle of individual fiscal responsibility – which isthe key feature of the Maastricht framework.At the end of the day, any proposals on the future direction of monetary union need to beassessed according to how they impact on the necessary alignment between actions and 7 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
liability.In a recent speech which garnered a great deal of attention, French President Emmanuel Macronput forward his vision for advancing the European project, suggesting that more policy areascould be communitised – that is, transferred to Brussels and thus funded jointly.Such proposals are no substitute for strengthening individual national responsibility in the euroarea. Nor, by the same token, do they have to be at odds with the principle of individualresponsibility. Indeed, it is quite possible that issues like preventing climate change, securingexternal borders and developing common communications, energy and transport networks canbe handled more efficiently at the European rather than national level.5. Monetary policyLadies and gentlemenOne policy area that we all know has long been dealt with collectively at a euro area level ismonetary policy. And, as far as monetary policy is concerned, I can kick off the last part of myspeech with some good news. The euro area is experiencing an ever more robust economicupturn which has continued unabated over 17 quarters and spread to all euro area countries.And this trend looks set to continue for a while yet. In September the ECB’s economists raisedtheir forecasts for 2017 economic growth to 2.2%. And they are anticipating growth rates ofaround 2% for the next two years as well.An updated forecast will be released in two weeks’ time, as is customary in December, and thatwill be based on detailed country projections. At the moment, there is good reason to believe thatthe economic outlook will be just as upbeat then, if not even better. At the very least, severalshort-term indicators have made for surprisingly positive reading.And the economic situation in Germany is looking exceptionally good, too. Employment levels areat their highest since reunification, business and consumer sentiment is splendid, and the Ifobusiness climate index has even hit a new record high. And, going by the latest economicindicators we have received, the difficulties Germany is experiencing in forming a governmentare showing no signs of markedly dampening the mood.The economic recovery we’re seeing in Germany and in the euro area is benefiting in part fromthe Eurosystem’s exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. This monetary policy stancewas the ECB Governing Council’s response to the subdued inflation outlook.One of the reasons behind the muted rate of price inflation is that some euro area countries arestill in the process of remedying the loss of competitiveness which played a role in triggering theeuro area crisis. But improving price competitiveness generally also means greater wagemoderation.The ECB Governing Council initially responded to the weak price pressures by cutting its policyrates. Once it had cut its rates to 0%, it then started to roll out a host of non-standard measuresin an effort to loosen up monetary policy still further.Since March 2015, these measures have included the Eurosystem’s large-scale purchases ofsovereign and corporate assets, currently at a monthly pace of €60 billion per month. FromJanuary this will fall to €30 billion a month – with purchases continuing until September 2018, ifnot longer. As you know, these purchases have been hotly debated, particularly in Germany. Andyou are no doubt also aware that I myself view these purchases with scepticism, too.The Eurosystem has now become the largest creditor of the euro area countries. This meansthat governments’ financing conditions hinge much more directly on our actions than in times of 8 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
normal monetary policy. My concern, therefore, is that the ECB Governing Council could end upfacing political pressure to keep rates low for longer than is justifiable from a strictly monetarypolicy perspective.Ladies and gentlemen, my reading of the ECB’s projections, however, is that domestic pricepressures in the euro area are gradually building and that the projected path is quite consistentwith our definition of price stability.For if there is one thing that is clear, it’s that even after net purchases have been discontinued,euro area monetary policy will remain highly accommodative.October’s monetary policy decisions even mean that our foot is still on the accelerator as far asmonetary policy is concerned, just not quite so hard as before. Given the favourable economicoutlook and the pick-up in prices, a somewhat less accommodative monetary policy stancewould also have been justifiable, in my view.6. ConclusionLadies and gentlemenI’ve spoken a lot today about how the euro area is managed – its institutional order – and aboutmonetary policy. On the subject of order, the physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg once saidthat “order leads to all virtues, but what is it that leads to order?” Today, I’ve endeavoured tomake the answer clear in the context of the euro area, with the help of various reference points.In essence, the solution lies in ensuring alignment – though since we are in a philharmonic hall,perhaps I should say harmony – between actions and liability. In debates about the future ofmonetary union I will make sure that this fundamental harmony is not forgotten.Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have a stimulating panel discussion. And to you, Mr Kösters,may I wish you all the very best for your upcoming retirement.Thank you.Badinger, Harald (2005), “Growth effects of economic integration: evidence from the EU member states",Review of World Economics 141, pp 50–78.Campos, Nauro F, Fabrizio Coricelli and Luigi Moretti (2014), “Economic growth and political integration:estimating the benefits from membership in the European Union using the synthetic counterfactuals method",IZA Discussion Paper No 8162.Boltho, Andrea and Barry Eichengreen (2008), “The economic impact of European integration", CEPRDiscussion Paper No 6820.W Kösters (1996) Stability culture as a precondition for the sustainability of the European monetary union (EMU).In Urban S (eds) Europe’s challenges.

      Innovation and the Future of Finance Remarks at the Paris EUROPLACE Financial Forum in Tokyo Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan December 4, 2017 Bank of Japan 
 1  I. Paris International Expositions in the 19th Century -- Exploring the Future through New Technologies -- It is a great honor to have the opportunity to give a speech at the Paris Europlace Financial Forum today.  Nowadays, rapid innovation in information technology is significantly changing financial services, and even the economy and society as a whole. It seems that people are thrilled to watch, with hope and a little anxiety, how such innovation will change the world landscape and affect the role of human beings.  Similarly, there was a time in the past when people had strong interest in how new technologies would change the future. Particularly in the late 19th century, with the development of heavy industry, the popularization of electricity, and mass production of new materials such as iron and glass, people wondered how such technological progress would change the economy and society. During that period, Paris hosted international expos as many as five times. These expos presented prospects of the 20th century that new technologies could open up, and brought these technologies closer to ordinary people.  Indeed, many major structures using new materials and construction methods were built at the time of these expos, namely, la tour Eiffel, la Gare d'Orsay, le Pont Alexandre III, and le Grand Palais. They continue to be symbolic landmarks of Paris today. Moreover, very interestingly, Bordeaux wine classification was also introduced at the 1855 Paris Expo, and it seems that creating such a "database" has helped French wines become the world's leading brand.  The Paris Metro was also opened during the 1900 Paris Expo. The subway has played a major role in urban transportation systems since the early 20th century. I am particularly attracted by the Art Nouveau decorations at the entrances of the Paris Metro. Art Nouveau widely adopted new materials such as iron and glass, combined with the delicate artistic sense of human beings, and created a path for the future of fine art and architecture.  
 2  II. Innovation in Information Technology and FinTech Undoubtedly, the Paris Expos in the late 19th century presented "visions" and "prospects" of how science and technology could lead to economic and social development and improve people's daily life in a wide range of fields, such as urban architecture, transportation, and fine art. They thereby contributed to the broad application of science and technology in the 20th century.   I believe we can also make use of such historical analogies for maximizing the value of on-going rapid innovation in information technologies. If many people could share the visions and prospects as to how these new technologies could contribute to making the world better and what they could bring to our daily life, the benefits would be substantial. Namely, we can intimately feel the benefits of new information technologies and cope with the associated anxiety through sharing these visions and prospects. If so, it would become easier to facilitate collaboration among various entities in applying these new technologies to improve financial services and develop the economy.   In this regard, application of new information technology toward financial innovation, called "FinTech," will present the following visions or prospects that will open up the frontiers of financial services. I would like to encourage wide-ranging stakeholders to make efforts to realize them.  First, FinTech will facilitate the delivery of financial services customized to suit individual users around the world. More specifically, in emerging and developing economies, where financial infrastructure such as bank branches and ATMs are underdeveloped, the Internet and smartphones are spreading very rapidly. In these countries, FinTech enables the provision of financial services by using the Internet and smartphones as new access tools. Therefore, emerging and developing economies are eager to promote FinTech in order to accelerate "financial inclusion." Moreover, big data and artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible to customize financial services in accordance with the needs of individual users.  Second, FinTech will contribute to increasing the efficiency of financial operations and services and raising productivity through the application of information technology. 
 3  FinTech also has the potential to create new networks between financial services and wide-ranging industries, such as the Internet of things (IoT), e-commerce, and the sharing economy. By fostering the development of new sources of growth, FinTech could contribute to boosting growth potential through enhancing productivity, which is now a common policy challenge to developed countries.  Furthermore, FinTech will improve our daily life and address various social challenges from the financial aspect. For example, as population is aging in Japan and many other developed countries, it is becoming increasingly important to make financial transactions easier and safer for the elderly and to protect them from fraud. In this regard, biometrics and AI could be effective tools. In addition, new technologies such as AI and big data analysis may enable rapid credit assessment and low-cost remittance services. They could facilitate easier access to lending and remittance services for financially vulnerable people. Moreover, robot advisers utilizing AI may provide easy-to-access asset management services with lower costs, and thereby promote "the shift from savings to investment," which is a long-standing policy challenge in Japan.  In this way, FinTech could contribute to raising growth potential and addressing social challenges, not only in emerging and developing economies but also in developed countries. On this basis, major cities such as Paris and Tokyo consider FinTech as one of the major driving forces in the efforts of promoting financial services and industries. In November 2016, the Metropolitan Government of Tokyo established the "Advisory Panel for Global Financial City Tokyo," in which a senior official of the Bank of Japan participated. In the discussion there, FinTech, as well as fostering asset management services, were considered core drivers for promoting financial activities in Tokyo.  III. Initiatives at the Bank of Japan and the Central Bank's Perspective The Bank of Japan is actively promoting FinTech from the standpoint of a central bank. In April 2016, the Bank established the FinTech Center within its Payment and Settlement Systems Department. The Bank has also built up a Bank-wide "FinTech Network" to share information and expertise related to FinTech.  
 4  Also, the Bank has held four FinTech Forums so far. In these Forums, we have focused on topics of high interest, such as information security, open innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and big data. In November 2016, the University of Tokyo and the Bank of Japan held a joint conference focusing on the future of money. Moreover, in April this year, the Bank organized a conference on AI.   Furthermore, in order to gain deep understanding on new information technologies and their impact, the Bank has been conducting various research activities, including the joint research with the European Central Bank on DLT. In parallel with these activities, senior officials of the Bank, including myself, have been delivering speeches focusing more on IT innovation and FinTech as well as their impact on finance and the economy, in order to convey the Bank's views on these issues.   When we try to examine the impact of FinTech on finance and the economy from a central bank's perspective, I think the following four points are important.  First, entities which provide financial services are becoming widespread. One of the major characteristics of FinTech is that various new players such as IT companies and start-ups, which are different from traditional financial institutions, are entering financial service businesses. It would be informative to examine how these new players could influence the structure of financial service provision, financial markets, and risk-sharing among various entities. From a central bank viewpoint, we need to closely monitor the impact of these new entrants so that new technologies will enhance the efficiency of payments, settlements, and financial services, while ensuring their safety and stability.   Second, new styles of systemic importance may emerge under the development of FinTech. Since the global financial crisis, efforts have been made to classify big banks as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, based on factors such as the size of the balance sheet. Based on these efforts, various financial regulatory measures have been taken so that their systemic importance would not threaten financial stability. Recently, however, entities that provide global IT platforms to many entities and accumulate huge volumes of big data have become increasingly powerful and influential in wide-ranging 
 5  businesses including financial services. In addition, high-speed, high-frequency transactions in financial markets are expanding, and if many market participants come to use similar algorithms in conducting such transactions, this might involve the risk of amplifying one-way market developments. Based on these changes in environment, rather than the size of balance sheets of banks, factors such as global IT platforms, the huge volumes of big data, and widely used algorithms might become more systemically important from the viewpoint of financial stability.  Third, as the utilization of big data is becoming more important in the provision of financial services, data security, privacy, and the consensus of stakeholders on data utilization will become even more critical. Thus, financial service providers and stakeholders are required to pay due attention to data protection and privacy, in order to maintain public confidence in innovative financial services utilizing new technologies.  Finally, as application of AI to financial operations is becoming widespread, ensuring governance in AI's decision-making and accountability to customers using AI-related services may also become critically important. If customers are concerned that AI's decision-making might turn into a "black box" and poses risks to them, such customers' anxieties would hinder the application of AI to create innovative financial services. In this regard, efforts to ensure the governance and accountability of AI are meaningful to "wipe out" people's concern about new technologies.   IV. Closing Remarks In promoting FinTech, France and Japan seem to have common challenges as developed countries.  In the case of emerging and developing countries, basic financial services are underdeveloped, and market growth can be expected to a certain extent, simply by introducing and promoting these basic services. On the other hand, both in France and Japan, basic financial services are already embedded in people's daily life. Thus, in order to make FinTech bloom in these countries, it is strongly needed to create innovative financial services with high added-value beyond already-available services. In addition, financial 
 6  institutions are required to take forward-looking measures to reform their own structures in order to make effective use of FinTech. Without such efforts, the countries where traditional financial services already prevail might lag behind in the field of FinTech.  In this regard, let me introduce another important aspect of the Paris Expos in the late 19th century. At that period, Japan was in the middle of a big transition phase, from the Edo period to the Meiji era. Nonetheless, Japan very actively participated in the Paris Expos. It seems to me that Japanese people, who were in the midst of a big historical turning point, were driven by their strong motivation to learn as much as possible from European countries, which were already the most industrially-advanced countries in the world. I feel that Japanese people really wanted to obtain prospects for the future and to gain clues for reform. At the same time, many ukiyo-e prints were brought to France from Japan. The interaction between Western and Oriental arts and the consequent "chemical reactions" led to the creation of new fine arts, namely, Japonisme and Impressionism, which remarkably incorporate both Western and Oriental cultural backgrounds.  These histories vividly illustrate that interactive dialogue, which is sometimes carried out across borders, and chemical reactions brought by cross-cultural exchange play critical roles in innovative creation. Needless to say, both France and Japan have their own history and culture, and are now playing leading roles in science and technology. I firmly believe that it is extremely beneficial for these two countries to strengthen dialogue also in the areas of financial innovation and FinTech.  The Bank of Japan would like to further deepen exchanges with the Banque de France on financial innovation and FinTech.  Thank you for your attention.  
1 Monetary policy: achievements and challenges Már Guðmundsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland. Monetary policy meeting of the Iceland Chamber of Commerce, held at Gamla Bíó in Reykjavík on 16 November 2017  Madame Chairman, honoured guests, Once again, we gather here at the Iceland Chamber of Commerce’s monetary policy meeting, which for years has been held after the Central Bank has published its autumn forecast and, in latter years, the Monetary Policy Committee’s interest rate decision. I would like to thank the Chamber of Commerce for continuing this tradition and for giving me the opportunity to talk to you about monetary policy.  In my speech at this same meeting last year, I noted that the Icelandic economy had seldom been stronger, as we were experiencing the combined effects of robust GDP growth, full employment, large rises in real wages, below-target inflation, a current account surplus, a strong international investment position, and lower private sector debt than had been seen in years. At that time, we had also achieved a historical milestone in bringing inflation expectations back to target by most measures. The outlook was positive as well, with the prospect of continued strong GDP growth, a current account surplus, and target-level inflation throughout the forecast horizon.  But there were concerns, too: the potential for overheating, the possible over-valuation of the króna, and the uncertainty about what would happen after the general liberalisation of the capital controls. Now, one year later, the economy is still very strong, yet some important changes have taken place – changes that in some respects have reduced the potential risks to price stability and financial stability.  First of all, the vast majority of the capital controls have been lifted, and these risks have not materialised. Short-term exchange rate volatility did indeed increase, but this was expected, and it was not pronounced enough to cause financial instability, as I will discuss further in a moment. And exchange rate volatility has subsided this autumn.  Second, the historical achievement of monetary policy, which was on the horizon last year, has now been confirmed much more convincingly. The credibility of monetary policy has increased, as can be seen perhaps most clearly in inflation expectations, which are now much more firmly anchored to 
2  the target. It is not least this that made it possible to lower the Bank’s key interest rate by a full percentage point in this one year, even though demand pressures in the economy were growing until recently and interest rates were already low in historical context in 2016, after adjusting for the business cycle position. I explained this in detail in my speech last year.   Third, GDP growth appears to be approaching its long-term trend rate more rapidly than previously anticipated, and indications that the positive output gap has already peaked have grown stronger. As a result, the likelihood of overheating has receded, although economic policy mistakes and decisions made in the labour market could certainly increase that likelihood once again.   As was the case in 2016, the economic outlook is positive, according to the Central Bank’s baseline forecast, published yesterday. GDP growth will slow over the next three years, but this is both desirable and inevitable. The current account surplus will be smaller than previous forecast, but a surplus will remain. There will be full employment, an real wages will rise more over the entire period than can be expected in the long run. Inflation will converge with the target in mid-2018 and remain close to target for the rest of the forecast horizon. This is one of the best inflation forecasts I have seen in my entire career. But it is a baseline forecast, and unforeseen external shocks, economic policy, and decisions made in the labour market could easily change the situation significantly.   Current situation and outlook  Let us now take a closer look at several aspects of the current economic situation and outlook.   Chart 1 shows how export growth has slowed this year from its 2016 peak yet remains robust. The combination of weaker export growth and increased imports explains the year-on-year slowdown in GDP growth. It also explains the narrower current account surplus, although a deterioration in terms of trade is also a factor. The current account surplus is projected at 2% of GDP by the end of the forecast horizon and could easily be eroded by a surge in demand and/or lower export revenues.              
3  Chart 1  As Chart 2 shows, both private consumption growth and rising house prices are due mainly to increased real incomes and households’ improved financial position. This differs greatly from the situation in pre-crisis Iceland, where increased household leverage played a leading role, but as can be seen in the chart on the right, lending to households has not increased in real terms since 2012.  Chart 2   The fact that inflation has been low in recent years despite steep rises in wages and house prices stems primarily from two things: on the one hand, positive supply shocks in the form of strong export growth and improved terms of trade, which have pushed the exchange rate of the króna upwards, and on the other hand, price deflation in international goods trade. Import prices have therefore fallen steeply in krónur terms, as can be seen at the left in Chart 3. What would happen when this imported deflation turned around was always a source of concern. Such a development now appears to be on the horizon, as can be seen in the chart. But fortunately, the rise in unit labour costs seems to be losing pace, as can be seen in the chart at the centre, and house prices appear to have 
4  peaked. The inflation outlook is therefore favourable, as can be seen in the chart at the right, which looks past the changes in value-added tax that could possibly be implemented in the near future.   Chart 3      “Missing” inflation  Headline inflation has been below the Central Bank’s target for nearly four years, even though the negative output gap closed and then turned positive some time ago and wages have risen well in excess of what, in an average year, would be deemed consistent with the inflation target.   This is not a unique case, however. In international circles, there is widespread discussion of “missing” inflation, which generally refers to the fact that wage rises are astoundingly small given the business cycle position in the country concerned. For example, countries as dissimilar as the US and Sweden are considered to be at full employment, yet wage increases are smaller than is consistent with the inflation target. In some countries, such as the US, this may be partly because the slack in the labour market is actually larger than conventional measurements indicate, as the labour participation rate is historically rather low. But this does not tell the whole tale, and in some countries it is not a very robust explanation. Given how widespread this phenomenon is, and given that it is in some respects independent of domestic conditions and economic policy, there are a number of indications that global factors such as increased cross-border mobility of labour and other production factors, international value chains, and the existence of a large excess labour force in some emerging market economies play an important role in it.   An underestimated slack in the labour market is hardly a factor in Iceland, as the labour participation rate is at a historical high and wage rises are substantial. Labour importation and indirect pressures from an unutilised lower-income labour force in other countries have clearly had a dampening effect on wage increases, however. Even so, inflation is low. This is true of 
5  other economies as well. But it is less of a puzzle than wage developments in industrialised countries overall: global trends have been favourable to them, as can be seen in improved terms of trade and rising exchange rates. It is well known that this can create conditions where strong GDP growth and sizeable pay rises can coincide for a time with low inflation. And one difference between Iceland and many other industrialised economies is that in other countries there have been concerns that inflation expectations would fall too steeply and become anchored below target.   In order to place Iceland in this context, let us look at Chart 4, which gives some relevant metrics for several small and medium-sized inflation-targeting countries.   Chart 4     
6  In this context, some of the discussion has centred on the extent to which low inflation is a problem if it is paired with robust GDP growth and full capacity utilisation, particularly if these are a result of positive supply shocks. In that case, perhaps the problem lies in how the inflation target is presented and understood. This will call for more flexibility and a longer horizon for the target, which was one of the proposals explored in the Central Bank’s 2010 report on monetary policy in post-capital controls Iceland.1   Monetary policy milestones  I mentioned earlier the success we have had with monetary policy – success that was visible a year ago and is even more obvious now. This past September, the Central Bank of Iceland issued a Special Publication entitled Monetary policy based on inflation targeting: experience since 2001 and post-crisis changes.2 In addition to discussing the topics in the title, the report maps out this success with monetary policy. Chart 5 shows what that entails: inflation expectations are at target, unexpected changes in inflation that strongly affected short- and long-term inflation expectations in the past no longer do so, and movements in the exchange rate of the króna function much more as shock absorbers and less as sources of shocks than they used to. In short, monetary policy with a flexible exchange rate is much more successful now than it had been before 2012, when the Bank published its report entitled Iceland’s currency and exchange rate policy options.3  Chart 5                                                    1 Special Publication no. 4, Monetary Policy in Iceland after capital controls.

7   Capital flow management tool   There have been proposals in the media recently to the effect that the special reserve requirement on foreign capital inflows for investment in the bond market and in high-yielding deposits be immediately reduced or even eliminated. In a Box in the newly published Monetary Bulletin, the Bank discusses this special reserve requirement. It does not agree with these proposals.   The special reserve requirement has functioned as intended, and monetary policy transmission along the interest rate channel has improved, as can be seen at the right in Chart 6. Without it, monetary policy transmission would have been shifted in greater measure to the exchange rate channel, leading to a stronger appreciation and increased exchange rate volatility, which would not have been terribly popular under current conditions. Although the goal is to lift the special reserve requirement, conditions do not warrant it as yet. It will probably be necessary to scale it back in increments as demand pressures in the domestic economy recede and growth in trading partner countries gathers more momentum. Current forecasts indicate that this will happen, as can be seen at the right in the chart. Long-term interest rates will reflect this, and the long-term interest rate differential will narrow.   Chart 6   Another important factor is that it is unclear what benefit the investments affected by the capital flow management measure have for Iceland at present. The Treasury’s borrowing need is limited in historical context, and strictly speaking, the Treasury does not need the funds generated by the bonds in question. If the special reserve requirement were not in effect, the Central Bank would probably have to hold larger foreign exchange reserves so as to mitigate the risk associated with carry trade-related inflows and the potential for sudden outflows. This would be quite costly, as the global market returns on the reserves are unusually low at present. At the same time, foreign investors can expect attractive returns on Icelandic Treasury bonds, and the more stable the króna, the greater the risk-adjusted interest rate differential. In order to reduce 
8  that differential, the Central Bank would therefore need to allow increased exchange rate fluctuations, which would also exacerbate the risk faced by residents. Under current conditions, it can even be argued that for the Icelandic economy, the net benefit from such inflows is negative.   Nevertheless, the aim is to lift the special reserve requirement as soon as conditions warrant it and that it will not, as a general rule, be used under normal conditions. Even so, the Central Bank has considered it important to be able to activate it if the need arises. The special reserve requirement would then be a third line of defence, to support conventional economic policy and micro- and macroprudential tools.   In order for this to be possible after the capital controls have been lifted in full, a new statutory foundation (other than the Foreign Exchange Act) must be found for the special reserve requirement, which is primarily a monetary and macroprudential policy instrument. Furthermore, the efficacy of the special reserve requirement must be ensured once speculative derivatives trading in krónur has been re-authorised, as full liberalisation implies. The Central Bank is currently reviewing the technical foundations for the special reserve requirement and preparing proposals for statutory amendments pertaining to its application.   Exchange rate fluctuations  The new issue of Monetary Bulletin contains a Box on fluctuations in the exchange rate of the króna in international context. That article presents several points that should be borne in mind in any discussion of monetary policy and possible modifications to the monetary policy framework, including exchange rate policy. They are as follows:    Short-term exchange rate volatility increased just after the capital controls were lifted, as had been expected and as the Monetary Policy Committee had pointed out in advance in its statements. This volatility has subsided in recent months (see the right side of Chart 7).   If we look beyond the aftermath of the pegged exchange rate regime, the financial crisis, and the capital controls regime, it cannot be seen that the short-term fluctuations of the Icelandic króna have been vastly larger than other Nordic krónur that have flexible exchange rates, or commodity-exporters’ currencies. These currencies also have periods of peak volatility.   Long real exchange rate cycles are a well-known phenomenon, also in countries with a fixed nominal exchange rate (Chart 8).   As has previously been noted, exchange rate movements have been more effective as shock absorbers in recent years than they were previously. Although more effective and more credible monetary policy plays a part in this, what is probably more important is that the capital controls – and now, 
9  the capital flow management measure – have mitigated volatile capital flows, which can undermine economic stability, as experience has shown.   Chart 7   Chart 8  Review of the monetary policy framework and currency and exchange rate policy options  In closing, I would like to focus on the ongoing review of Iceland’s monetary policy framework and currency and exchange rate policy options.   In the recent past, I have emphasised how important it is that this discussion should take into account what monetary policy can and cannot do. In the long run, monetary policy can deliver price stability, and in the short run it can also mitigate the effects of shocks and reduce fluctuations in output and employment. But monetary policy cannot have a long-term impact on the real exchange rate. As such, it can do little to mitigate the crowding-out effect of strong growth in a new export sector. If it tried to, the effect would be only temporary, and it would come at the expense of sacrificing the objectives with which monetary policy has been entrusted – objectives that it can achieve. Industrial and fiscal policies can have such a real impact over the long term, however, and it is to them that concerned parties should turn.  
 10   But it is possible to choose from among various options on the spectrum between a rigid peg and a free-floating exchange rate. And it is possible to adopt another currency, either unilaterally or in bilateral or multilateral cooperation.   These were the options explored in the Central Bank’s 2012 report.4 The conclusion was that a unilateral peg with unrestricted capital flows could run aground, as it did in so many economies after capital movements were liberalised further in the 1980s and 1990s. A firmer peg such as a currency board could pose risks to financial stability, and the same was considered true of unilateral adoption of another currency. It was deemed highly uncertain – and actually unlikely – that bilateral adoption of another currency would be on offer anywhere.   That left two possibilities: joining the eurozone after a negotiated agreement and continuing with a flexible exchange rate and an inflation target. The problem was that there were drawbacks to both. The financial crisis had uncovered flaws in the design of the eurozone, and it also came to light that political support for eurozone membership was lacking. Independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate had not been very successful.   Has something changed? The euro area is still putting in place the reforms deemed necessary for it to function smoothly, and it does not seem to me that political support for membership has increased significantly since the Bank’s report was issued. But various reforms have been made to monetary policy conduct in Iceland, and financial stability policy has been vastly improved. Much of what I have called inflation targeting plus has already been put in place. And in the past few years, we have seen that independent monetary policy can work effectively, also in Iceland. This is where we are now. That need not mean that we will be here for the indefinite future. There is no eternal monetary solution, and various options develop over time.                                                     4 See reference in Footnote 3. 
Bank of Italy conference on ‘How financial systems work:  evidence from financial accounts’Opening remarks: Luigi Federico Signorini,  Bank of Italy, Deputy GovernorThursday, 30 November 2017

It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Banca d’Italia for this workshop. As a former head of the Statistical Directorate I am particularly happy to see such a distinguished list of speakers and guests on this occasion. I would like to thank all those who contributed, from other institutions, from academia, and from inside the Bank. Financial accounts have a long history and we take some pride in having worked on them almost from the beginning. As many in this room will know, the first model accounts were developed by Morris A. Copeland for the US.1The picture above, which has a nice vintage feel to it, summarises his idea of the economy as a money circuit, showing the connections between the institutional sectors. In 1955 the Federal Reserve published its first version of the annual flow of funds. Italy’s first financial accounts appeared about ten years later, in the Annual Report of the Banca d’Italia for the year 1964. We were among the first countries for which financial accounts became available. Of course, the pioneering work at the Fed was an inspiration, but there had been some significant preparatory work here as well. Since the 1940s Paolo Baffi, who was to become Governor many years later (1975-79), had been working on reconstructing 1 Copeland M. (1952), A Study of Moneyflows in the United States, NBER, New York. Here we draw from De Bonis R. and A.

4the financial statements of the institutional sectors. He was influenced by Giorgio Mortara, an eminent statistician and his teacher, and by Wesley Mitchell, whose work on business cycles he had translated.2 They used to tell a story here at the Bank of Italy about how Baffi visited the Federal Reserve Board in the mid-1950s, as Head of Research, to discuss the construction of financial accounts. Proof that this was no myth was recently discovered in our historical archives in the form of several letters (one is pictured below) exchanged between William McChesney Martin, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1951 to 1970, and Donato Menichella, Governor of the Bank of Italy from 1950 to 1960. Baffi stayed at the Fed for a few months in 1956.In the 1960s other countries – the UK and Germany among them – began to publish national financial accounts on a regular basis. These accounts became part of a triad that also included non-financial national accounts and input-output tables.3Real national accounts had begun to be compiled following the Keynesian revolution, as the invention of macroeconomics and the definition of the attending concepts (income, consumption, investment, savings) prompted the development of statistical methods to produce a reasonable approximation of the real-world counterparts to those concepts. The first release of the United Nations’ Systems of National Accounts came in 1947. Once the statistical foundations for real national accounts had been laid, moving on to financial accounts seemed natural. As we were soon to learn, this was no easy task. Even more, making the two sets of macro accounts consistent, i.e. integrated – a logical and easy step in theory – was in fact very difficult in practice.The effort to understand and possibly control business cycles after the devastation of the Great Depression was itself a powerful driving force for the development of financial accounts. Financial variables such as bank loans and deposits, bonds and shares, arranged within a consistent framework, were seen as necessary to get a full picture of the cyclical factors in the economy. 2 Baffi was worried about the lack of good data: ‘At the Research Office, where we follow and analyse statistics, principally of a monetary and financial nature, we find ourselves poorly equipped to understand the movements of non-monetary aggregates, barring those associated with foreign trade and the manufacture of some products. Yet such movements are among those at the root of financial phenomema …. We are at a similar disadvantage as regards our knowledge of the problems encountered by business enterprises …’ (excerpts from a letter written in January, 1941).3 Klein L. R. (2003), ‘Some Potential Linkages for Input-Output Analysis with Flow-of-Funds’, Economic Systems Research, 15, September, 269-277.
5The availability of information on financial flows may also have been regarded in those days as instrumental to economic planning; in some Western countries this was considered a very important and effective tool of economic policy in the post-war period. With illusions of top-down planning long forgotten in many market economies, this point is easily overlooked nowadays, but it was surely another significant factor in those times. 
6There was a golden age of financial accounts between the 1960s and the early 1970s. James Tobin, among others, used them to look at the way agents allocate wealth across financial and  non-financial assets; in his Nobel Memorial Lecture in 1981, he discussed ‘Money and finance in the macro-economic process’ using flow-of-fund tables. Tobin and others had built models based on the interaction between the real and the financial sectors. This idea was taken up by central banks. For instance, the 1986 version of the Bank of Italy Quarterly Econometric Model contained a complete description of the links between saving, non-financial investments and financial flows.4 Financial accounts were also a rather popular subject for research. Surveys of the literature list around 250 works on flows of funds published in twenty years or so after Copeland’s book.5 Interest in financial accounts declined in the 1980s, only to pick up again after the crisis. Many factors were at play: a growing focus on the micro foundations of macroeconomics; an increasing concentration on inflation as a target, and on money and credit aggregates as instruments, for monetary policy; some neglect of interconnections across the financial system; and much trust (too much, one would say in retrospect) in the self-correcting mechanism of price adjustments, which implied less interest in the quantities (flows and stocks) that make up financial accounts. On the statistical front, the main effort then was directed at fuller international harmonisation of real statistics, which resulted in the 1993 System of National Accounts; at the same time, as I mentioned earlier, integrating real and financial accounts was proving elusive. 4 On these issues see Ando A. and F. Modigliani (1975), ‘Some reflections on describing structures of financial sectors’, in Fromm G. and L. R. Klein (eds.), The Brookings Model: Perspective and Recent Developments, New York, North-Holland.5 Cohen, J. (1972), ‘Copeland’s Moneyflows after Twenty-Five Years: A Survey’, Journal of Economic Literature, 1, March; Bain, A.D. (1973), ‘Surveys in Applied Economics: Flow of Funds Analysis’, The Economic Journal, December; Roe, A.R. (1973), ‘The Case for Flow of Funds and National Balance Sheet Accounts’, The Economic Journal, 330, June. 
7Financial accounts continued to be used, though to a lesser extent, by economists such as Wynne Godley and Raymond Goldsmith.6 Then the Asian crisis of the late 1990s showed the importance of sectoral financial connections and the need to study the balance sheets of banks, firms, and households.7 Since the start of monetary union, the ECB’s monetary analytical framework has included financial accounts as a tool for cross-checking its ‘first pillar’ (economic analysis) against its ‘second pillar’ (monetary analysis).8 However, it was the global financial crisis that generated renewed interest. A lesson of the crisis was that tracking sectoral imbalances was important; that an excessive level of debt may cause vulnerabilities; and that therefore the pursuit of financial stability required monitoring the level of corporate and household debt and the leverage of financial institutions. Finance was no longer a mere veil.In 2011 the European Union adopted a surveillance procedure to monitor and correct macroeconomic imbalances. Among the indicators used are three key elements of the financial accounts: the stock and the flow of private sector debt and the change in the financial sector’s liabilities.9 Finally, the importance of the interactions between the real economy and the financial sector for econometric modelling is now well-recognised and efforts are being made to integrate macro-financial relationships for key sectors such as non-financial corporations and households into large macro models.10 6 Godley constantly followed the idea that economic models should be founded on flows and stocks, and developed consistent models of the US economy and the economies of other countries (see Godley, W. and M. Lavoie, 2007, Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Money, Credit, Income, Production and Wealth, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke). Goldsmith dedicated his research programme to the building of national and sector balance sheets, exploiting the financial accounts time series. See Goldsmith R. W. (1969), Financial Structure and Development, Yale University Press; Goldsmith R. W. (1985), Comparative National Balance Sheets, A Study of Twenty Countries 1688-1978, The University of Chicago Press. 7 See Allen M., C. Rosenberg, C. Keller, B. Setzer and N.

Stark (2010), Enhancing Monetary Analysis, ECB, in particular chapter 7,  ‘Cross-checking and the flow of funds’.9 Actually, before the crisis we wrote a paper on the use of financial accounts and other statistics for the analysis of financial stability.

Stacchini (2005), ‘Financial stability: an overview of Bank of Italy statistics’, Irving Fisher Committee Bulletin, 23, October. 10 For an example see Duca, J. and J.

8Here at the Bank of Italy financial accounts have been used rather intensively in research over the years. An incomplete list of articles and books based on Italian financial accounts includes around 100 works by Bank of Italy authors alone. Research has covered, among other things, the structure of the Italian financial system, household wealth, firms’ financial structure; convergence of financial systems, and macro financial imbalances. A 2012 collection of essays on the evolution of financial systems is one example. We regularly comment on financial accounts statistics in the Annual Report, the Economic Bulletin and the Financial Stability Report. Let me now turn briefly to purely statistical issues. As I mentioned, the Bank of Italy has regularly published the country’s financial accounts (stocks and flows) since the 1960s; yearly stocks have been reconstructed for the main institutional sectors as far back as 1950. Below is the first statistical manual we published in 1969. We implemented the SEC79 standards (and showed quarterly figures for the first time) in the early 1990s, the ESA95 standards in 2002 (during my time in Statistics), and the ESA2010 standards in 2016.Over the years countless methodological improvements have been made to coverage and estimation methods. Many people here will be familiar with the multiple challenges of using diverse sources, often designed for non-statistical purposes and lacking common methodological standards, to obtain consistent statistics;11 of reconciling inconsistent classifications; of building 11 Here we draw from De Bonis R., C. Giron, L. Infante and G. Quirós (2017), ‘Financial accounts uses’, in  P. van de Ven and D. Fano (edited by, 2017), Understanding Financial Accounts, OECD.
9statistical bridges across valuation criteria (historical cost vs. market prices) and recording conventions (cash vs. accrual); and of credibly interpolating low-frequency data. Work continues on these and other fronts and there is still much to do. Tomorrow Luigi Cannari will talk to you about some of the main pieces of work in progress, including the reconciliation of micro and macro financial data; the integration of financial and non-financial assets in a consistent balance-sheet framework for each sector; and the improvement of statistics on cross-border flows and holdings.Before I leave the floor, let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of our colleague, Andrea Generale, a talented, committed researcher and then regulator, who passed away a year ago after a long illness. Besides being a highly qualified senior professional, Andrea 
10was generous and open with everyone. He had a lifetime commitment to the analysis of banks, corporations, financial institutions and financial systems. For some time Andrea coordinated the Bank’s research on financial flows and significantly contributed to our body of research based on the use of financial accounts.12 We shall remember him with affection and gratitude. This is all on my part. I see that you have a full agenda, with three keynote lectures and twelve papers packed into one and a half days. I wish you all some very fruitful and enjoyable presentations and discussions. 12 One contribution is in Bartiloro L., R. De Bonis, A. Generale and I. Longhi (2008), The financial structures of the leading industrial countries: a medium-term analysis, paper presented at the conference “Financial Accounts: History, Methods, the case of Italy and International Comparisons”, Perugia, December 2005.

Andreas Dombret: Too little, too much, or just right? Reformingbanking regulation after the financial crisisSpeech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank,at the 21st Colloquium of the Institute for Banking and Financial History (IBF) "Ways to a stablefinancial system", Frankfurt am Main, 23 November 2017.*   *   *1. Ways to a stable financial systemLadies and gentlemenYou have heard numerous speeches today on proposals for reforms and their pros and cons.Now I think it’s time to briefly revisit our actual objective. And this is “Ways to a stable financialsystem”.Scholars, politicians and regulators have been racking their brains over this problem since 2007,the year the financial crisis broke out. The question of whether a financial system can even bestable in the first place has also emerged. And yet if there is one thing we all know, it is that therewill never be a completely stable, completely crisis-proof financial system in the real world.However, we are all here today at this colloquium out of the conviction that, if nothing else, afinancial system can be made a little less vulnerable, thereby containing the fallout from crises –provided the right solutions are found.The G20 countries have travelled a long and often rocky road in order to make the financialsystem more stable. I have been following this path from my perch atthe Bundesbanksince 2010 – I started out originally responsible for financial stability and,since 2014, have been in charge of banking and financial supervision.And I, too, have been asking myself time and again: have we taken the right road? Or have wefallen short? Have we possibly gone too far in some places, or even gone entirely off track?The answer to these questions, sadly, is not that simple – and that is why it has been occupyingus to this day. Still, I would like to attempt to deliver an answer, based on three points.I initially wish to discuss the regulatory principle that was supposed to guide post-crisis reforms:if we assume that the idea of a 100 % stable financial system is utopian, then reforms should beconducted to prevent financial bubbles from being created by misvaluation and excessiveleverage while crisis-proofing banks.My second point concerns equilibrium and an assessment of these reforms. As a supervisor andregulator, I am naturally partial and convinced that we have taken the path of the golden mean: inmy assessment, financial stability and risk appetite are being treated equally. And this is why,once Basel III has been finalised, we should take a regulatory break for now.Yet – and this is my third point – reforms will have the desired effect if, and only if, the rules arealso credibly and rigorously implemented and applied.2. Prevent the build-up of bubbles and make banks crisis-proofLet us begin with the question as to the right guiding principle for regulation. As long ago as 1986,economist Hyman Minsky formulated one avenue worth exploring in his book Stabilising anunstable economy, a book which remained largely obscure for 20 years – and thus long past hisdeath in 1991. It was only the 2008 crisis which revealed the importance of his theses to all.1 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Minsky saw financial markets as having a natural inclination towards instability and crisis. Thatwas wholly out of kilter with the then-prevailing zeitgeist – and the blossoming financial marketsof the period. Nor, by the same token, did it go along with the prevailing theory in economics – theefficient markets hypothesis.From today's perspective, we know that financial markets have a tendency to exaggerate andthus experience cyclical instability. Minsky was far from along in noticing this. His decisivediscovery, however, was that this instability has its origins in stability – more precisely, in a periodof stability which encourages increasingly excessive risk taking.What do I mean by that? Long periods of growth lead to exceptionally favourable funding terms;these, in turn, encourage enterprises and households to make investments that are based to avery great extent on the principle of hope – hope that the economy will continue to grow at thesame pace. Banks prop up this optimism by easing the terms and conditions for their lendingand later even lowering their credit standards. This all adds up to burgeoning debt, which issustainable only as long as debt can be serviced.However, once it is no longer possible to service this debt, and asset values subsequently fall,what is known as a “Minsky moment” occurs. That is, debt becomes unsustainable, materialisingwhen positive expectations give way to pessimism. A subsequent cascade of financial pricecorrections and defaults causes losses to the real economy.One of the decisive things we can learn from this is that financial crises and their causes are anintegral part of the system. And, like with any system, the disrupting factors are already built intothe financial system.So what does Minsky mean in terms of banking and financial regulation? In any case, it doesn’tmean sitting around and twiddling one’s thumbs. Although Minsky explains how financial crisesoccur, the cause and effect relationship he describes is not a law of nature. Far more importantis that regulators and supervisors understand these interrelationships and use the instruments attheir disposal to reduce the likelihood of a “Minsky moment” occurring.Minsky has therefore tendered a guiding principle for discussion: if regulators develop new rules,they have to ensure that the build-up of a bubble through excessive credit growth is less likelythan it would be in a wholly unregulated financial market with an inclination towards exaggeration.However, since no regulation, however forward-looking it might be, can completely prevent crisesaltogether, banks have to be crisis-proofed.As I said, Minsky’s theory has been around for over 20 years. Yet guiding principles – as we allknow – do not automatically translate into optimal regulation. Real regulatory initiatives need alittle more actual content.This has been a matter for policymakers and supervisors in equal measure since 2008. Thesecond point I will discuss is how well they have performed.3. Reform after the financial crisis: too little, too much or just right?This morning, my colleague on the Bundesbank Executive Board, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, alreadygave an account at this colloquium of the major cornerstones of the reforms after the financialcrisis. I shall now flesh that out by naming the latest developments: in the case of the Basel IIIreform, a compromise is within reach. At the technical level, negotiations have already beenconcluded. With the completion of Basel III, the G20’s reform agenda will have essentially beenfulfilled.The question of whether this puts us on a path towards a stable financial system is not one that Iam going to answer by citing individual regulatory clauses or percentages, but with a general 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
evaluation.The objective of good regulation is and has always been to prevent economic bubbles fromforming as far as this is possible and – if a crisis is unavoidable – to limit its impact on thegeneral public and the economy. It is just that therein lies the major challenge: what is the correctmeasure? What constitutes a proportionate intervention? What regulations are appropriate andwhich are disproportionate?As I have already explained, I firmly believe that we have embarked on an effective and, at thesame time, balanced path over the past few years. The reform packages are making bankssignificantly safer: as a result of more stringent capital requirements, by the introduction of theleverage ratio, by the introduction of not one but two liquidity minimum requirements, by theintroduction of capital buffers and by further elements.More than that: we are also tackling the problem of bubble formation. Through prudentialrequirements and through stress tests, for example, institutions are being placed under anobligation to conduct a more cautious risk management at an early stage. There has also been amicroprudential upgrade, say, as a result of stricter requirements for systemically importantinstitutions and instruments designed to prevent the emergence of bubbles – think, for example,of possible cyclical capital add-ons for mortgage loans.And, not least, the creation of the banking union has very much strengthened regulation andsupervision of the financial system in the euro area.In total, the reforms have all been concerned with restoring the equilibrium of the marketeconomy. You can tell that, in particular, by an additional, quite important new instrument – theway in which bank distress is treated. During the financial crisis, there were a number of bankrescues. Mr Thiele has already referred to this “fall of the market economy”.A resolution regime has now been established in Europe. The failure of a major Spanishinstitution five months ago demonstrated that the rules work and that investors can indeed bebailed in. Other, less satisfactory cases have shown, however, that gaps still exist, and thesehave to be closed. All things considered, I nevertheless regard the reforms as importantinstruments with which the fall-out and costs of financial crises can be distributed more fairlyamong those responsible.You can see, therefore, that we are not relying on a single solitary instrument or a single solitaryapproach – rather, we have a toolbox with complementary instruments. In total, this toolbox – Ifirmly believe – makes our financial system much more stable.Other proposals presented today go even further. Their common denominator, however, is thatthe causes of the financial crisis can supposedly be eliminated only by even more radicalapproaches.I think that such a debate is very important: in my opinion, scholars have a downright duty to lookbeyond their own field, to question old approaches and develop bold new ones.For that reason, too, I shall not be going into detail about the pros and cons of these alternativeapproaches. My point is a more general one: the advantage of a far-reaching, fundamentallynovel approach may also be its inherent drawback. While offering new solutions, it also createsnew problems – problems that are mostly unidentifiable on the drawing board.Seen in that light, a comparison between an existing system and a radically new one is alwaysflawed: with the existing system, the focus is on the real problems, while the new approachdirects attention to improvements that are full of promise. Because the new approach has not yetundergone a reality check, it virtually almost always looks like the better option. But its 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
implementation in terms of actual regulations may bring serious, unintended side effects for ourfinancial system in its wake.It is also extremely important to me that we take into account the fact that regulation can, indeed,go too far ‒ that is to say when there is formed the illusion that a perfect, stable financial worldcan be created and the zeal for reform restricts economic activity to such an extent thatinnovation is choked off and economic upturns are stifled.But, sadly, unintended side effects of reforms can indeed lead to the obstruction of key functions,the unnecessary break-up of beneficial, established structures, and the unpredictable frustrationof wealth creation. Sustained economic growth needs innovation and risk taking, however: afailure to safeguard the supply of credit to economy can enfeeble economic activity.I perceive such a threat in the calls for making banking regulation even more stringent. As muchas I can understand the motivation behind them, I have immense appreciation of theaccompanying effects of turning the screws too tightly when it comes to regulation.Anyone wanting to live in a completely risk-free world would therefore also have to accept muchless dynamic economic growth.There is another point that seems important to me: regulation can create inadvertent effects onthe structure of the financial sector. Applying regulations adopted for the large banks with aninternational focus one-to-one to smaller institutions clearly places those small institutions at adisadvantage. That is why I advocate lowering the regulatory burden for the small, low-riskinstitutions that do not operate internationally.In summary, I take a positive view overall of the post-crisis reforms that will soon be completed.Taking this compromise as a starting point, we now have to look to the future – for it is wellknown that the challenges for the banking sector are considerable. With regard to regulations, wemust not give in to those who want to turn back the regulatory clock. But nor we must not go ontightening the screws of regulation ever further.I am therefore in favour of a regulatory break after the reforms have been completed. This shouldbe used to thoroughly evaluate the impact of the reforms and to amend and improve them wheregaps and errors are found. This does not include the few outstanding areas where action iscalled for, such as the regulatory treatment of government bonds.4. Paper never refused ink: reforms will be short-lived without a change in attitudeLadies and gentlemen, as you can tell, I am a realist. And that brings me to the third point I wouldlike to make – that even the best reforms will only go so far if they are not accompanied by apermanent change in attitude.Because without that change, the rules will be monitored less rigorously than intended. Evenbefore the diesel scandal broke, we knew that even the best rules don’t achieve much if nobodyis made to keep them.Ideally, the change in attitude in the financial sector should be based around an understandingthat consistently monitoring and complying with the rules is in everyone’s interests. All too often,decision-makers think that they are doing the economy a favour by saving a bank frominsolvency or calling for prudential leniency in order to prolong a riskier type of activity. Theirintention, one would imagine, is to safeguard stability and jobs – but unfortunately, it has oftenturned out to be an unrealistic one.Instead, all that such leniency has done is make two things more likely in the medium term:financial market bubbles and economic stagnation. 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
That’s because the financial crisis was the outcome not just of a handful of undisciplined banksor gaps in the rules but also of the belief that light-touch interpretation and monitoring of the ruleswas promoting economic activity. As you can see, political beliefs influence how rules areapplied – and there is now even clear, international evidence to confirm this view.And yet some people keep slipping back into the old ways of thinking. The debate aboutderegulation in the US springs to mind, for example, as does the discussion about non-performing loans – here, at times, it seems that, for some decision-makers, things can’tprogress slowly and gently enough when it comes to tackling these long-standing and seriousproblems. The debate about competitive deregulation after Brexit suggests that the old mindsetmight be making a comeback.The more important, then, to grasp that the reforms being discussed today will only actuallyprevent bubbles from forming and strengthen banks if the rules are applied consistently andeffectively.Those who go easy on or even rescue a sickly bank by interpreting the rules generously areeroding the substance of our economy. They are deactivating the market economy principle ofcompetition, enfeebling innovative potential in the banking sector and, if anything, helping to propup “zombie banks” whose days would be numbered were it not for the light-touch approach.Indulging a credit institution and its creditors ultimately comes at the cost of economic growth.Financial history repeats itself, too, so we need to rigorously implement the reforms we haveagreed upon. But what does the change in attitude I am talking about mean for prudentialdecisions on the ground?To be clear, most prudential decisions are made within the established legal framework, whichthe reforms undertaken have made far more tight-knit and robust.Decisions where the rules are not entirely clear-cut – that is, where discretion can be applied –might pose difficulties. And this is where the change in attitude comes into play. Today, we knowthat supervisors need to weigh up between reducing the likelihood of a bubble forming orpermitting low-yielding but relatively risky activity. As I see it, they must have the courage andconfidence in this situation to do what is best for financial stability – and then be bold enough toface the music – even if it later transpires that one or the other decision went overboard.Because decisions that are geared to preserving stability are generally better for the economy asa whole.To put this principle into practice, decision-makers will also have to make uncomfortabledecisions – such as winding up a bank with a bail-in of investors, imposing capital add-ons, orrestricting the distribution of dividends if an institution fails to comply with the buffer requirements.I would like to remind you again of the balancing act between preventing bubbles from forming onthe one hand, but not stunting economic growth on the other. This feat is something whichregulators and supervisors need to take very seriously at all times. For the vast majority ofdecisions, it would be very wrong for us to act like supervisory sheriffs, clamping down on usefulfinancial intermediation. We need to focus on the decisions that really count – with prudence,expertise and determination.Specifically, this means that the change in attitude, which can be seen in the post-crisis reformsand elsewhere, needs to be embraced once and for all – by supervisory authorities as well aspolitical decision-makers. Not only do supervisors need to have the tools to intervene; they alsohave to be confident enough to use them. And it would be wrong for that confidence to beundermined by incentives to shield banks. Policymakers, then, would do well to respect theprofessional independence of authorities and the objective decisions they make. Conversely, thismeans that they must refrain from applying pressure on authorities for political reasons. 2 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
5. ConclusionWe have made considerable progress since the financial crisis erupted. The banking andfinancial system is a great deal better off these days. We have created a toolkit to make futurecrises less likely and make institutions more resilient to withstand any turbulence that doesoccur. Banks have more capital, and they are managing their risks better.But there is a danger that even the best regulation will remain piecemeal if its rules are notapplied consistently. Only the rigorous and consistent supervision of credit institutions canensure that bubbles are less likely to form and that, in an emergency, there is enough capital toabsorb losses.When it comes to applying the rules in future, we should heed Minsky’s key message, which isthat, for all their undeniable merits, financial markets do always have a tendency to form bubblesand thus slip into financial crises; also, that these bubbles build up in upbeat economic spells –which is when nobody wants to talk about it.To stall the formation of bubbles and to equip banks to cope with headwinds, supervisors andpolicymakers need to evaluate the impact on society as a whole. But this will only happen if thechange in attitude takes hold among policymakers and supervisors. Let us hope that today’sconference will help make this happen.Thank you for your attention.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   It is a pleasure to join the FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) in reflecting on what’s happened in the two years since the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR).  This afternoon I would like to assess recent progress in building real markets for the good of the people and discuss the forward agenda for your important work.  Two and a half years ago, FEMR set out a series of ambitious recommendations to restore confidence in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) markets.1  The FMSB’s work is an integral part of the FEMR solution.   Your work matters because UK markets are essential for global commerce.    The City has a special responsibility to address the root causes of misconduct given its pre-eminent position in global markets.  The UK accounts for 40% of both global FX volumes and trades in OTC interest rate derivatives, and two-thirds of trading in international bonds.  More international banking activity is booked in London than anywhere else.2  Your work matters because the financial sector is an important contributor to UK prosperity.  Finance is one of the largest sectors of the UK economy.  Around 400,000 people are employed in financial services in London alone, 1.1 million across the country as whole.3  Their enterprise contributes £115 billion to our national income, £80 billion to our exports and £70 billion to the Exchequer, equivalent to two-thirds of the NHS budget.4  Your work matters because finance is not an end in itself; financial markets serve the real economy.  By financing firms that hire, invest and expand, markets drive growth.  By opening up cross border trade and investment, they create new opportunities for businesses and savers.  By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them, markets help households and businesses insure against the unexpected.                                                        1 See Fair and Effective Markets Review Final Report, HM Treasury, Bank of England and FCA (June 2015).

The Problem   Though markets are generally a force for good, markets can go wrong.  Left unattended, they are prone to instability, excess and abuse.  Following the global financial crisis, a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation undermined trust in banking, in the financial system, and to some degree, in markets themselves.    In FICC markets, misconduct was revealed on a scale that impaired their ability to function fairly and effectively.  The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks’ misconduct costs have exceeded $320 billion, capital that could otherwise have supported around $5 trillion of lending to households and businesses.5  More worrying still, an industry of the scale, importance and complexity of finance needs social capital as well as economic capital in order to operate, innovate and grow.  Repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance into question.  In a system where trust is fundamental, it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now think that banks are well run, compared to 90% in the 1980s.6  The scale of the challenge of restoring trust is thrown into sharp relief by the FMSB’s comprehensive review of misconduct over the past two centuries.  The history of financial fraud has rhymed all too frequently.  Potential Solutions  In the cycle of scandal, response, integrity, drift, and renewed scandal; potential solutions have oscillated between the extremes of Self Regulation and Total Regulation.  Recent difficulties illustrate the problems with each of these approaches.                                                       5 See FSB Chair’s letter to G20 Leaders “Building a safer, simpler and fairer financial system” ahead of the Hamburg Summit, (July 2017).

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   By undervaluing the importance of hard and soft infrastructure to the functioning of real markets, light touch regulation led directly to the financial crisis.7  Multiple factors contributed to a tide of ethical drift in FICC markets. Market standards were poorly understood, often ignored and always lacked teeth. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. Bad behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm.    Given the economic and social consequences of the ensuing disaster, it is right that regulators proscribe certain behaviours and set out their high level expectations. Yet, authorities cannot regulate for every circumstance, watch every transaction, or anticipate every market innovation. Total regulation is bound to fail because it promotes a culture of complying with the letter of the law, not its spirit, and because authorities inevitably lag developments in fast-changing markets.   But it doesn’t have to be this way.   A more comprehensive and dynamic solution combines public regulation with private standards and then buttresses them with a series of hard incentives which materially increase individual understanding and accountability.  Market standards can be effective if they:   - Articulate clearly the market’s collective view of best practice, with worked practical examples to clarify grey areas;  - Are grounded in, and are reinforced by, relevant regulatory frameworks and requirements;  - Are kept current; and  - Are given teeth by incentives that foster adoption and adherence.  An Early Assessment of the FMSB’s work  So how is the FMSB doing in establishing common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed dynamically relevant?  The FMSB is already making an important contribution.                                                       7 “Hard infrastructure” refers to the way in which markets are organised. “Soft infrastructure” refers to the standards and norms, including regulation, market standards and codes, by which markets operate. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   Drawing on the expertise of its members, the FMSB has finalised standards that codify best practice with respect to: reference price transactions, commodity binary options, and new bond issues.  A standard on risk management transactions for new bond issues is nearly final, and an earlier draft standard on FX stop-loss orders has been absorbed into the FX Global Code.  In each case, potential conflicts of interest are mapped to high-level principles designed to mitigate them.  For reference price transactions, emphasis is placed on transparency with clients on mechanics and potential conflicts, and on mitigating the risk that the wider transactions of dealers could be market moving.  The draft standard on risk management for new bond issuances sets out principles to mitigate risks around selection and formation of reference rates.  The FMSB’s Statements of Good Practice, such as for surveillance of FX markets, provide more detailed guidance and worked examples to help set expectations.  The FMSB is also scanning the horizon for future misconduct risks, including through its innovative behavioural cluster analysis. Rightly, given rapid changes in underlying market structure, this process has prioritised work on vulnerabilities arising from fast automated markets.  Will These Standards and Codes Make a Difference?   We know from history that codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows or enforces them.  Why should the FMSB’s efforts be expected to help reverse the tide of ethical drift?  Indeed, given the long history of misconduct, aren’t such efforts akin to King Canute rebuking the waves?8  I’m more optimistic that the tide will turn because the FMSB is part of a much broader effort by UK authorities and market participants.  Together, we have created a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing set of measures that strengthen the hard and soft market infrastructure.  The resulting incentives give FMSB standards moral force and practical consequence.  First, in the FMSB’s core work, the best in the market are taking responsibility for identifying and codifying best practice, in a way that complements and reinforces existing regulation. The FMSB now convenes senior participants from fifty global issuers, underwriters, asset managers, exchanges, custodians and investment banks.  The breadth and engagement of the membership gives its standards credibility and creates peer pressure within the industry to promote adherence.                                                       8 Canute, King of Denmark, England and Norway, 995-1035, reputedly set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming tide to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet "continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.'  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   Second, peer pressure within firms should reinforce standards and, more generally, the commitment to real markets.  Most banks have codes of ethics or business principles.  These are necessary but not sufficient not least because it isn’t reasonable to expect every trader to absorb their meaning or to translate them readily into live situations.  But it is reasonable to expect them to use FMSB guidance to help recognise the differences between a real market and a rigged one. And it is essential that business cultures encourage everyone to call out market abuse when it occurs.  Third, buyside pressure for proper behaviour is made easier by clear, practical standards. This is formalised in the example of the FX Global Code, where major central banks including the Bank of England, have confirmed that they intend to adhere to the principles of the Code, and that they also expect the same of their regular FX counterparties.9  Similarly, the Bank of England will adhere to the UK Money Markets Code and Precious Metals Code and will expect the same of its market counterparties.  Fourth, the combination of new arrangements for compensation, the expectations of the Senior Managers Regime (SMR), regulation and market standards are mutually reinforcing. In the UK, a significant proportion of the variable compensation of key decision-makers must now be deferred for a period of seven years to ensure it can be clawed back over the time scales it generally takes for conduct issues to come to light.  The SMR gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to develop, adopt and embed them.  By requiring identification of the most senior decision-makers of banks, insurers and major investment firms, and setting requirements on them, the SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability, strengthens individual accountability, and reinforces collective responsibility.    Senior Managers can now be held individually accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps (including training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop regulatory breaches in their areas of responsibility.  The SMR prescribes individual responsibilities – typically to the Chair and CEO respectively – for developing and embedding a firm’s culture, alongside a collective responsibility for the Board.  And under the related Certification Regime, firms must also annually assess and certify the fitness and propriety of a wide range of risk-taking employees.  To help meet all of these expectations, Senior Managers can draw on market standards in order to explain and promote good practice, assess their risk-takers, and build a strong culture.                                                       9 See the BIS Press Release on the FX Global Code , available at: https://www.bis.org/press/p170525.htm. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   There are encouraging signs that the SMR is already beginning to make a difference.  For firms, it is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making processes. Senior Managers are increasingly focusing on building cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical behaviour. In the words of one chair “responsibility for culture has moved to the top of my agenda.”10  For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and to assess the fitness and propriety of senior managers and others in positions of responsibility, and whether the firm has an appropriate culture, and is encouraging the necessary changes.  In the first instance, consistent or widespread shortcomings would have consequences for compensation.  More persistent failings could increase the capital that must be set aside for operational risks, and in the extreme, could influence our judgements regarding the fitness and propriety of senior managers.  Over time, market codes may become more firmly embedded still, something on which the FCA is currently consulting.11  The Way Forward  The mutually reinforcing relationship between the regulatory framework and market good practice should help the FMSB, and other market standard-setters, maintain their ambition and momentum even once memories of post-crisis misconduct fade.    It could sharpen collective incentives to address, more conclusively, outstanding ambiguities that act as obstacles to real markets. And it should help mitigate emerging vulnerabilities.  The Bank of England encourages the FMSB to consider where additional guidance and worked examples could buttress its existing standards, to guard against the risk that certain principles mean different things to different parties.  The City’s special responsibility, given its pre-eminent position in global markets, is why it has brought so many ideas and such energy to advance reforms to address the misconduct risk that has plagued global markets.                                                        10 See page 16, Financial Reporting Council (FRC), “Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards: Report of observations”, July 2016.   11 In light of its responsibilities for conduct and market integrity, the FCA is consulting on an approach under which it would formalise that in supervising to, and enforcing, SMR rules for unregulated markets and activities, it would consider whether firms and individuals are meeting “proper standards of market conduct” with reference to “recognised” industry codes.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   These efforts have helped set the international agenda, with many of the themes identified in FEMR are finding support more broadly, particularly in the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).   The FSB’s misconduct action plan, presented to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in July 2017, includes:  (i) Developing new global standards of conduct in fixed income, commodities and currency markets, of the sort that the FMSB has championed, as well the FX global code, in which UK-based authorities and market participants played an important role;  (ii) Direct measures to strengthen financial institution governance and compensation structures to align better risk and reward, including developing governance toolkits, which will address individual accountability, firms’ risk culture, and the risk of ‘rolling bad apples’, (all of which are in place in the UK); and  (iii) Reform of major financial benchmarks arrangements to reduce the risks of their manipulation.  I would like to say a few words about this final strand before concluding.  The goal of this work is to restore confidence in the integrity of key interest rate benchmarks globally.  Reforms to the governance of Libor – which is vital hard infrastructure in UK markets and for many borrowers in the real economy – have gone a long way to meeting this objective.  That is the good news.  The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that we cannot rely on Libor in the long term.    Libor is meant to measure banks’ short-term unsecured funding costs. But the reality is that bank funding markets have changed, and banks no longer take enough wholesale term deposits to form the basis for a robust transaction-based benchmark.  As we have pointed out in the past, the result is that Libor is overly reliant on expert judgement rather than actual transactions. That situation is neither desirable nor sustainable.  There is also a risk that panel banks might withdraw from Libor and precipitate its collapse, which raises obvious financial stability concerns.  So there is a clear need for the authorities and market participants, across every sector, to come together, and transition to alternative benchmarks.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   Under the auspices of the FSB, authorities in the UK, US, Japan and Switzerland have worked with market participants to identify alternative benchmarks.  In the UK, the market-led Working Group on Sterling Risk Free Rates recently confirmed SONIA as its preferred alternative to Sterling Libor.12  Market participants in every sector and market that uses Libor now need to come together to identify and resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks.  To support the next phase of this work, the Bank and FCA are today announcing that from January, the Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group will have a new mandate and wider representation from across the market.  Its key objective will be to pursue a broad-based transition from Libor to SONIA by 2021.  Buy side firms, issuers, infrastructure firms and trade associations will be brought into the Group alongside banks and broker-dealers.  We are under no illusions about the complexity of the task. Libor is embedded throughout the financial system in derivatives, loans, bonds and commercial contracts.13    The Bank and FCA are committed to supporting UK market participants as they prepare for the transition.  Reasserting London’s Leadership of Real Markets  To conclude, two years on from FEMR, by working together, we are making enormous progress.  We are moving from markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad to markets that are resilient.  From markets where transactions occur in chat rooms to markets that are professional and open.  From markets where few were accountable for anything to markets where everyone is responsible for their actions.  The FMSB is playing an essential role in this transformation.   When your standards are combined with more robust regulatory requirements, new compensation arrangements and the Senior Managers Regime, we are achieving what Canute could not.  The tide of misconduct is going out, revealing the real markets working for the good of the people of the United Kingdom and the world.                                                       12 To facilitate a smooth transition, the FCA has coordinated panel banks to support Libor until the end of 2021. 13 See the Record of the September FPC meeting at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/Records/fpc/2017/record1710.aspx  
 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at the Kisaragi-kai Meeting in Tokyo Bank of Japan December 7, 2017   Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak at the Kisaragi-kai meeting.  The last time I gave a speech at the Kisaragi-kai meeting was early September last year. Two weeks after that, the Bank of Japan conducted a comprehensive assessment of the developments in economic activity and prices as well as of the policy effects under quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE), and decided to introduce a new framework for strengthening monetary easing -- "QQE with Yield Curve Control." While more than a year has passed since then, highly accommodative financial conditions have been maintained in Japan under this framework, and the economy has continued to improve. Today, I would like to first explain the Bank's view on the recent economic and price developments in Japan, and then talk about its thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.  I. The Current Situation of Economic Activity and Its Outlook Overseas Economies Let me start by talking about economic developments. I will first touch on developments in overseas economies.  Overseas economies have continued to improve steadily since mid-2016. By region, the U.S. economy has continued to recover firmly, mainly in household spending, owing to improvement in the employment and income situation. The real GDP registered relatively high growth of 3 percent on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis for the last two quarters, suggesting that the major hurricanes that hit the southern United States in summer only had short-term effects. As for the European economy, although continued attention needs to be paid to negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and the European debt problem, including the financial sector, the uncertainties surrounding these factors have abated. Under such circumstances, the European economy has continued to recover steadily, and the divergence in growth rates among the euro area economies clearly has become smaller recently. Emerging and commodity-exporting economies have followed their recovery trends. Specifically, the Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole, partly due to the effects of authorities' measures to support economic activity; 
2  commodity-exporting economies such as Brazil and Russia -- which had been stagnant -- have picked up, particularly reflecting the bottoming out of commodity prices and monetary easing effects. At the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Annual Meeting this October, which I participated in, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde assessed the recent global economy as showing "the broadest-based recovery in the last 10 years."  With regard to the outlook for the global economy, both the advanced and emerging economies are projected to continue growing in a well-balanced manner. According to the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the IMF, the global economy is expected to maintain its firm growth, with the annual real GDP growth rate registering 3.2 percent in 2016, 3.6 percent in 2017, and 3.7 percent in 2018 (Chart 1).  The Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity and Its Outlook Next, I will talk about Japan's economy. It has continued to grow in a well-balanced manner, similar to the case I just mentioned for the global economy. Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. The real GDP growth rate for the July-September quarter was 1.4 percent on an annualized basis, representing positive growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This was observed for the first time in 16 years, since 2001. The output gap that shows the utilization of capital and labor exceeded the long-term average of 0 percent in the second half of 2016, and has widened further in positive territory recently (Chart 2).  This is the third time in the past 20 years that Japan's output gap turned positive. The past two cases occurred during the so-called dot-com bubble period in the early 2000s and the global credit bubble period from 2006 through 2008. Both of these recovery phases depended on external demand. By contrast, in the current recovery phase, both the external and domestic demand are strong drivers for Japan's economic growth. As for external demand, Japan's exports have increased -- mainly led by IT-related goods exported to Asia -- on the back of the growth in overseas economies. In addition, domestic demand has been on an increasing trend. Specifically, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend, while corporate profits have improved, marking record high levels (Chart 3). Private consumption has increased its resilience, supported by steady improvement in 
3  the employment and income situation as well as replacement demand for durable goods. Public investment also has been increasing due to the implementation of the government's stimulus measures formulated in fiscal 2016. As these developments show, Japan's current economy is supported by multiple factors -- namely, external demand, domestic private demand, and domestic public demand -- in a well-balanced manner. For this reason, it is possible to assess the economy as having resilience to exogenous shocks.  Another notable feature of Japan's economy recently is that the effects of its expansion have been spreading to a wide range of economic entities. The diffusion index (DI) for business conditions in the Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) has continued to be positive, not only in large enterprises and manufacturers but also in small enterprises and nonmanufacturers. This is clearly different from the recovery phases in the early and mid-2000s, which were led by external demand (Chart 4). Looking at developments by region, the DI has been positive for all regions since the December 2013 survey. Labor market conditions have tightened nationwide, as seen in the active job openings-to-applicants ratios in many regions having risen to levels comparable to those in major metropolitan areas (Chart 5).  Let me turn to the economic outlook. Going forward, Japan's economy is expected to continue expanding moderately. The Bank makes projections for Japan's economic activity and releases them quarterly in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report); in the latest Outlook Report released at end-October, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts of the real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. These figures are above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. In fiscal 2019, although the growth pace is projected to decelerate, the economy is expected to continue expanding, underpinned by the increase in exports on the back of the growth in overseas economies, and the median of the forecasts of the real GDP growth rate is 0.7 percent.  The economic activity could, of course, deviate either upward or downward from these projections. The biggest risk factor is developments in overseas economies. As I mentioned earlier, the baseline scenario is that overseas economies are expected to continue growing at 
4  a moderate pace, and it is no longer the case that risks are likely to be skewed to the downside. That being said, the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial markets warrant attention, and geopolitical risks also could exert downward pressure on economic activity. The Bank will continue to pay close attention to both upside and downside risks.  II. Price Developments and Their Outlook Price Developments Now, I will move on to price developments. Prices in Japan have been increasing gradually, mainly on the back of a rise in energy prices. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has accelerated to 0.8 percent this October, rising by more than 1 percentage point in a year from the rate of change of minus 0.4 percent registered in October last year (Chart 6). Excluding the effects of energy prices, however, the rate of change in the CPI has remained slightly positive. Thus, price developments in Japan are still relatively weak despite continuing economic expansion and the tightened labor market conditions.  Somewhat strong economic activity and relatively weak prices, which seem contrary to each other at first glance, are coexisting in Japan. This situation is also observed in other advanced economies recently. The inflation rates in the United States and the euro area have remained below the central banks' target levels despite the firm improvement in the global economy that I mentioned at the outset.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen described the recent sluggish price developments in the United States as a "mystery," while referring to the possibility that such developments are mainly due to transitory factors such as a decline in telecommunication service prices. The chair pointed out that the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources. Specifically, in addition to uncertainties regarding the supply capacity in the labor market and medium- to long-term inflation expectations, the chair mentioned the possibility that factors such as increasing competition with emerging economies, reflecting globalization, and a rapid spread of the use of online shopping backed by advances in technology could affect price developments. It may be very beneficial for Japan as well to 
5  consider these points when analyzing its price developments. However, it also should be kept in mind that the inflation rates in the United States and the euro area have been at around 1.5 percent despite being regarded as somewhat weak, and that such situation is somewhat different from that in Japan. Therefore, it is natural to think that low inflation in Japan also is attributable to factors that are unique to Japan.  The Background to Relatively Weak Price Developments and Their Outlook I will elaborate on the relationship between economic activity and prices in Japan. Taking into account that firms' wage- and price-setting stance exerts a large impact on prices, weakness in price developments in Japan can be explained by the following two steps.  The first is a moderate improvement in wages despite the tightness in labor market conditions. In particular, it is noticeable that wage increases for full-time employees are sluggish, compared to those for part-time employees (Chart 7). Since scheduled cash earnings of full-time employees account for almost 70 percent of the total employee income, their impact is not small. On this issue, some point to the fact that, since both labor and management in Japan place priority on the long-term stability of employment and wages over wage increases, the following has been observed: employment adjustment and wage reductions of full-time employees had been conducted only marginally in an economic downturn, and wages barely rise even if the economy recovers and labor market conditions tighten. It also can be said that past downward rigidity in wages has led to the present upward rigidity.  The second is that, even though wage increases have been taking place, albeit at a moderate pace, the pass-through of wage costs to sales prices has not been observed yet widely. This reflects firms' efforts to absorb increased wage costs through, for example, labor-saving investment that makes use of information technology, as evident in software investment increasing remarkably of late in industries where labor shortage is particularly acute, such as restaurants, retail, and construction (Chart 8). While these efforts are based on individual firms' reasonable business strategy with a view to raising productivity, they would reduce the upward pressure on prices in the economy as a whole.  
6  However, I believe that this situation is changing gradually.  First of all, we will see a change in wages. Given that the labor market conditions have been so tight, it is no wonder that this leads to an increase in wages for full-time employees. It also is an important fact that a base pay rise, which did not take place under deflation, has continued for four consecutive years since 2014. In order to create a virtuous cycle between a moderate rise in prices and increases in corporate profits and income, it should be widely recognized in society that wages rise continuously under a sound economy. The Bank expects that efforts by both labor and management to realize the virtuous cycle will become widespread by taking advantage of tailwinds of the current favorable economic environment.  In addition, firms' stance is likely to gradually shift toward raising prices. With hourly scheduled cash earnings of part-time employees remaining on an uptrend, the upward pressure of the rise in firms' costs on prices has been increasing, supported also by a rise in input prices due to the past depreciation of the yen. It seems that consumers are gradually accepting price rises on the back of the employment and income situation having been improving.  Although, for the time being, it is likely that some firms will decide on a price rise while others will remain hesitant, firms' bullish stance to raise prices is expected to become predominant eventually. However, it is not easy to clearly point to the timing of when this will happen beforehand, because the specific timing at which each firm's stance shifts toward raising prices is likely to vary, depending on developments in demand that each firm and industry faces, or on the cost structure. The CPI, which reflects these developments, is likely to increase moderately going forward.  III. QQE and Its Effects Basic Mechanism of Monetary Easing So far, I have explained developments in Japan's economic activity and prices. In what follows, I will talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  
7  In textbook theory, the basic mechanism of monetary policy is to stimulate or contain economic activity by driving the actual real interest rates to levels below or above the natural rate of interest, which I will explain shortly. Real interest rates are rates adjusted to exclude future price fluctuations by subtracting inflation expectations from the nominal interest rates that we usually come across. The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate at which the economy neither accelerates nor decelerates, and is likely to be close to the potential growth rate under normal conditions. The lower the actual real interest rates than the natural rate of interest, the greater the level of monetary accommodation. The economic growth will accelerate as low interest rates stimulate economic activities such as business fixed investment, leading to an improvement in the output gap. This improvement will finally bring about a rise in the inflation rate.  QQE, which the Bank introduced in April 2013, aims to substantially lower Japan's real interest rates in order to overcome deflation that lasted for the past 15 years. In September last year, the Bank introduced a new framework -- "QQE with Yield Curve Control" -- thereby further strengthening monetary easing. This framework consists of two components that aim at lowering real interest rates (Chart 9).  The first is an inflation-overshooting commitment. This is a strong commitment that the Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the actual CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. It aims to raise people's inflation expectations in a more forceful manner.  The second component is yield curve control. The Bank conducts large-scale purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) to facilitate the formation of the yield curve that is considered most appropriate for achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. Specifically, in the guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the 10-year JGB yields at around zero percent, and the observed yield curve has been formed smoothly in a manner consistent with this guideline. If the Bank maintains nominal interest rates at sufficiently low levels through yield curve control and raises people's inflation expectations 
8  through the inflation-overshooting commitment, real interest rates -- calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates -- will decline significantly.  Yield Curve Control Now, I would like to provide a little more explanation concerning the second component, yield curve control.  Before introducing this framework in September last year, the Bank set a quantitative target -- increasing the outstanding amount of JGBs held by the Bank at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen -- and was purchasing JGBs in line with the target. There are commonalities and differences between the previous approach and the current yield curve control approach. First, these two approaches are the same in terms of the basic transmission mechanism of monetary easing: lowering nominal interest rates through large-scale JGB purchases and thereby reducing real interest rates. However, under the previous approach, which fixed the purchase amount of JGBs at a certain level, the level of interest rates could decline either excessively or insufficiently, reflecting the economic and price developments as well as the conditions in the JGB market. As a result, the yield curve could deviate either upward or downward from the one that the Bank deemed appropriate. This problem does not arise in principle under the current yield curve control because it sets the short- and long-term interest rates themselves as operating targets. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the yield curve in Japan has been formed smoothly in a manner consistent with the guideline for market operations in the past one year.  There are several points to make in conducting yield curve control.  The first point is how to determine the most appropriate shape of the yield curve to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. Under conventional monetary policy, determining one optimal short-term policy interest rate -- the uncollateralized overnight call rate, for example -- was sufficient in conducting monetary policy. However, under the current framework, we naturally must extend the scope to the entire yield curve. It is necessary to analyze the status of inflation expectations and the natural rate of interest for each maturity and find the shape of the yield curve that produces the most appropriate level of monetary 
9  accommodation. Although this process involves difficult analysis in practice, the basic concept is clear. As we explained in the Comprehensive Assessment, in order to form an appropriate yield curve, the Bank makes decisions in consideration of the possible spillover effects on bank lending rates and issuance rates for corporate bonds, the impact on the economy, and the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation, among other factors. The Bank has maintained this stance ever since introducing yield curve control in September last year.  The second point is the sustainability of yield curve control. I am aware of concerns among some market participants that, as the Bank continues to purchase JGBs on such a large scale, the supply of JGBs circulating in the market may dry up sooner or later, making it difficult to control the long-term interest rate.  In this respect, the Bank's JGB purchases have been conducted in a smooth manner thus far and the Bank expects that the risk of having a problem in terms of continuing with its JGB purchases will be small for the time being.  Of course, controlling the long-term interest rate itself is a challenging initiative that is unprecedented in global terms. To keep the long-term interest rate under control, it is necessary to have a firm understanding of what factors affect the interest rate for each maturity. Analysis on this point has been conducted not only by the Bank of Japan but also by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), which have also implemented large-scale asset purchase programs. Although there are various approaches to analyzing what factor affects the long-term interest rate, the prevailing view appears to be that what has a strong impact in the long run is not the purchase amount of government bonds by a central bank in each market operation on a flow basis. Rather, the long-term interest rate is largely influenced by the amount outstanding of government bonds purchased by the central bank on a stock basis, which represents the cumulative net purchase amount of government bonds, or the ratio of the amount outstanding of the central bank's holdings of government bonds to the overall amount issued. The Bank assesses that the main reason it has been able to maintain the 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent since the introduction of yield curve control is stock effects -- or the cumulative effects of 
10  JGB purchases that have continued since before its introduction -- which have been working well.  With stock effects working firmly, if the supply-demand conditions in the JGB market tighten in the future, the impact of a unit amount of the Bank's JGB purchases on long-term yields accordingly should become more significant, with all else being equal. Put differently, the Bank can have the same degree of effect in lowering interest rates with a smaller amount of JGB purchases. Therefore, I would like to reemphasize that yield curve control is designed to be highly sustainable.  Accommodative Financial Conditions Lastly, I will discuss the actual effects of the Bank's monetary easing measures on Japan's economy. Through the introduction of QQE, the Bank has succeeded in lowering Japan's real interest rates well below the potential growth rate by conducting large-scale JGB purchases and raising inflation expectations (Chart 10). This was the first such achievement to be made in the fight against prolonged deflation since the end of the 1990s.  As a consequence, the economic activities of firms and households have been activated, leading to a steady improvement in the output gap. According to the government, the current recovery phase, which started in December 2012, is highly likely to have lasted for 58 consecutive months by September this year. The duration of the current recovery has thus surpassed that of the Izanagi Boom in the second half of the 1960s. In light of this situation, coupled with the fact that the period of the current recovery mostly overlaps the period of QQE, it appears that this policy has contributed to the long-lasting recovery, which is the second longest in the post-war era. On the price front, too, annual CPI inflation excluding fresh food and energy has been positive as a trend for about four years. Under QQE, Japan is no longer in deflation, which is generally defined as a sustained decline in prices.  It seems that the monetary easing has exerted positive effects on individual firms in the form of improvement in funding conditions. In line with the decline in JGB yields, which are the base interest rates, firms' funding costs -- namely, bank lending rates and issuance 
11  rates for CP and corporate bonds -- have declined firmly. For example, bank lending rates on new loans recently have been around historical low levels, in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. The real bank lending rates -- the nominal bank lending rates minus the inflation rates -- on new loans have declined to around 0 percent (Chart 11). In other words, the average firm can borrow new loans with hardly any interest payment if the inflation rates are taken into consideration. Also, with respect to the availability of funds, many firms have the growing sense that financial conditions have become highly accommodative. From the viewpoint of either large or small enterprises, the lending attitudes of financial institutions have become very proactive. In terms of the DI in the Bank's Tankan for lending attitudes, that for small enterprises in particular has been at a high level last seen at the end of the 1980s (Chart 12). The Bank will continue to provide maximum support for corporate activities in Japan by maintaining such accommodative financial conditions.  Conclusion Today, I have explained the recent economic and price developments and the Bank's thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy that takes account of such developments.  Although it is true that there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, it is clear from the results so far achieved that QQE has been effective in drastically improving Japan's economy. Going forward, in line with the steady improvement in the economy, firms' stance is likely to gradually shift toward raising wages and prices. Moreover, people's medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise steadily as further price rises come to be observed widely. In order to ensure that such positive developments will be long-lasting and that Japan's economy will become a well-balanced one in which economic improvement and price stability are simultaneously achieved, the Bank will continue to persistently pursue powerful monetary easing under the current framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control" with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent.  Thank you very much for your attention.

François Villeroy de Galhau: Monitoring large and complexinstitutionsWelcome address by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France andChairman of the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution (ACPR), at the ACPR AcademicConference, Paris, 11 December 2017.*   *   *Good morning,I am very pleased to welcome you to this high level academic conference jointly organised by theFinancial Stability Department of the Banque de France and the French Prudential Supervisionand Resolution Authority (ACPR). This year, the conference will focus on the challenges posedby the monitoring of large and complex banking institutions.It is true that large global banks might look complex. The 2008 Great Financial Crisis showedhow highly interconnected financial institutions that were exposed to overly complex derivativeproducts could spread and amplify domestic shocks. Since then, the “too-big-to-fail” issue hasbeen put high on the agenda of the Financial Stability Board and significant progress has beenmade in this regard. However, there is evidence that some global banks are growing bigger andperhaps becoming even more complex than before.Complexity is not in itself a drawback. After all, the globalisation of trade might require a certaindose of complexity either due to the nature of the financial products required to hedge againsttraditional or newly emerging risks, or due to the organisational structures that result from cross-border activities. Similarly, one should not preclude the diversification benefits associated withlarge global financial institutions exposed to partially correlated domestic markets. The truequestion is how to strike the right balance between the diversification benefits that arise frommultiple businesses financing the real economy and the potential weaknesses in riskmanagement caused by this increased complexity.This morning, I will start by quickly reminding you of some key features of the complexity of theglobal banking system before the financial crisis. Then, I will give a short overview of the strongregulatory and supervisory actions undertaken to reduce inefficient levels of complexity. Lastly, Iwill mention two important challenges we face today in shaping the global European bankingsystem.A – Some stylised facts from the pre-financial crisis period: organisational complexitiesand complex activitiesBefore the Great Financial Crisis, we observed a steady increase in the number of foreign banks,from 784 in 1995 to 1,301 in 2007, according to Claessens and Van Horen (2014). At the sametime, the number of domestic banks decreased and, as a result, the relative importance offoreign banks increased substantially, from a share of 19% in 1995 to 32% in 2007. This risemight be attributable to structural factors such as technological advancements, capital marketliberalisations and economic integration. It was accompanied by the growing importance ofwholesale funding markets in financing banking activities and it resulted in a high degree ofinterconnectedness between financial institutions.Beyond the potential complexity of global banking’s organisational structures, the financial crisiswas also preceded by increasing complexity in banking activities and financial products. Forexample, the gross market value of the OTC derivative markets increased from USD 2 trillion in1998 to USD 35 trillion at the end of 2008. The intensive use of complex and off-balance sheetproducts distanced the final borrower from the final investor. As underlined by a recent IMF study,12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
most of the pre-crisis financial globalisation had taken place through cross-border activities withlittle involvement from global banks in local retail activity. It ultimately led to a reduction in effortsfrom banks to monitor the creditworthiness of their borrowers and mitigate the associated defaultrisks.These two levels of complexities were exacerbated during the European sovereign debt crisis asEuropean banks were put under funding pressures by market participants concerned by theopaqueness of their portfolio composition and the lack of credibility of the previous resolutionmechanism.B – A comprehensive and strong policy response: both on the regulatory and thesupervisory sidesHowever, I just want to convince you of how strong the regulatory and supervisory responseshave been since then, in curbing the detrimental impacts that overly complex organisations oroverly complex activities might produce.First, the new regulatory framework treats global and complex banks differently. GlobalSystemically Important Banks (aka GSIBs) are subject to higher capital requirements explicitlydetermined by the importance of their cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities, their OTCderivatives, and their Level 3 assets exposure. They will range from 1% and possibly up to 3.5%of the CET1 ratio after the phase-in period (e.g. 2019).We have seen in the past that complex financial institutions relied too much on wholesale fundingthat could quickly evaporate in times of stress; the new liquidity ratios (LCR, NSFR) help topromote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks and a sustainable maturitystructure for assets and liabilities. The recently agreed finalisation of Basel III reinforces themonitoring of internal models and capital requirements on more complex activities, including theFRTB, the CVA and the CTP on market activities.Before 2008, we lacked the tools to implement an orderly restructuring of a bank that was failingor likely to fail. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive now requires banks in Europe toestablish resolution plans (also called “living wills” by the US regulators) to anticipate therestructuration needed in case of trouble. By defining ex ante the seniority of every creditor andby making it possible to bail-in some of these creditors (including some senior unsecured debt)in case of crises, we should have potentially limited the need for public funds to resolve privatebank failures.Second, not only banking regulation but also the enforcement of its supervision have positivelyreduced the detrimental effects of bank complexity. The new supervisory framework is moreconsistent and harmonised. In the SSM area, large global banks are now subject to a singlesupervisor, associating the ECB with national supervisors in JSTs, as is also the case for theirlocal foreign subsidiaries.The euro area banks have been subjected to wide-ranging and harmonised supervisoryexercises. Stress testing exercises that apply a common methodology and common qualityassurance have been performed every two years since 2011 under the aegis of the EBA. Atransparency exercise is run every year by the EBA, generating lots of data on European banks.Publicly disclosed asset quality reviews and comprehensive assessments have been performedeach time a bank is put under the direct supervision of the SSM since 2014. A large review of theinternal models used by the European banks (Targeted Review of Internal Models, or TRIM) iscurrently performed by the ECB and aims at greater reliability and comparability of risk modelsand capital.In sum, we have set up a regulatory framework in Europe that penalises unnecessarily complexbanking activities by imposing higher capital requirements, allowing for more intrusive and34 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
comprehensive supervision and fostering greater transparency. The new resolution mechanismaims at extinguishing the implicit government guarantees, which provide an incentive forexcessive risk taking and levels of complexity in order to gain “too-big-to-fail” status.C – Some challenges lie ahead: better coordination of the parties involved in theresolution process and the necessity for cross-border consolidations in EuropeBut we still face important challenges ahead. I want to stress two of them. The Single ResolutionMechanism, the second pillar of the Banking Union, has just successfully passed its first real testthis summer with the orderly resolution of Banco Popular. However, there is still room forimprovement in the coordination between the numerous institutions and authorities involved inthese procedures. It means that every participant must know and very clearly understand its rolein the process to ensure an efficient resolution.Second, Europe still suffers from overcapacity and cross-border consolidation is needed. In theUnited States, the top five banks have a market share of more than 40% while this figure is barely20% in Europe. Given the new regulatory and supervisory framework I described earlier, webelieve that the Banking Union should be considered – according to the criteria set up by theBCSB – as a single geographic area. Furthermore, we are reaching the point in Europe wherefacilitating healthy and well-designed cross-border mergers could actually improve financialstability. It would make banks better able to diversify their risks, achieve economies of scale andbecome more efficient. And as we have strengthened the single supervision and resolution ofsignificant institutions, we should not fear the “too-big-to-fail” issue. Crossborder consolidationwould foster a more efficient allocation of savings towards productive investments in Europe andit would place European banks in a better position in terms of international competition.To conclude, interactions between policy makers, researchers and practitioners are veryvaluable and I am certain that this conference will contribute to fuelling these interactions. Westrongly believe in the positive spillovers from the research function being closely intertwined withthe supervisory and financial stability divisions. In particular, empirical evaluations and theoreticalworks on policy design – and we will see some of them presented today – are absolutelynecessary in order to fine tune and reinforce the regulatory reforms that have been implementednot only in Europe but worldwide.I wish you a very fruitful conference and I will give the floor right away to Henri Fraisse, who willchair the first session.

SpeechSecurity Printing: A Central Banker's Perspective – WelcomeAddress to High Security Printing AsiaLindsay Boulton Assistant Governor (Business Services)HSP Asia Conference Melbourne – 5 December 2017IntroductionGood morning. Welcome to High Security Printing Asia 2017 and, for those who have travelled fromoverseas, welcome to Melbourne, Australia. I take this opportunity to also acknowledge thetraditional custodians of the land on which we are gathered, the people of the Kulin nation, and, onbehalf of everyone here, pay my respects to the Kulin elders past, present and emerging.I am honoured to be presenting the welcoming address this morning, especially as this is the firsttime that Australia has been the host country in the sixteen-year history of the conference.My address is also presented with considerable pride as Australia can claim a number of significantachievements in security printing. We were the first country to develop and issue polymer banknotesinto general circulation, beginning with a single-denomination commemorative note in 1988. All fivedenominations of Australian banknotes have now been printed on polymer for over twenty years,which has kept counterfeiting of our banknotes low and production costs contained. We continuedthe innovation with the introduction of a world-first top-to-bottom clear window in our new banknoteseries, which we began releasing last year. The second note in the new series – our ten dollar – wasreleased just over two months ago and a new $50 is scheduled for release in just under twelvemonths from now. Australia was also one of the first countries to embed microchips containingbiometric information into its passports, which, similar to banknotes, has helped to protect Australianpassports from counterfeiting. It has also helped the secure movement of travellers through our air﻿[*]
and sea ports.I would like to open the conference with some general observations on developments in the securityprinting industry in recent years as well some thoughts on the industry's outlook. You won't besurprised that most of my comments will focus on the banknote segment of the industry given mycentral bank background. I will, of course, also focus on the Asian region, not just because this is theAsian part of the High Security Printing conference series but because this region representsapproximately half of the global high security printing market and is around four times larger thanthe industry's next largest market region. What happens in this region is a significant representationof the industry's global performance.Let me begin with some observations on developments in the market.Current State of PlayThe Asian market for high security printing has experienced generally healthy growth over the pastdecade. Driven by good economic performance, rising incomes and infrastructure modernisationacross many parts of the region, the high security printing market, as measured by the value ofproduction, has experienced average annual growth of around 6½ per cent. That said, rates ofgrowth have been declining, albeit from a high base. From an annual increase of around 11 per centat the turn of this decade, the market grew by an estimated 5½ per cent around the middle of thedecade. Almost all segments, including payment card printing, have experienced slowing rates ofgrowth, with the cheque printing segment reporting outright falls in the value of output.Factors specific to the different market segments have, no doubt, contributed to the slower overallgrowth rates. However, the factor common to most market segments is the displacement oftraditional printing methods by emerging digital technologies. This is both reducing production costsfor existing producers through more efficient printing methods and introducing lower cost alternativesto traditionally printed high security products. The most obvious example is the growing use ofmobile payment devices and digital wallets as alternatives to using traditionally printed instrumentsfor making consumer payments.Two segments of the market in Asia have, however, appeared to have moved against the trend ofgenerally lower rates of growth in the value of production. One of these is ticket printing and isattributed to general upgrades in public transport infrastructure. That said, it is expected that growthin this segment will slow in the next few years as transport operators in Asia migrate from proprietaryticketing systems to more sophisticated arrangements, such as ‘open-loop systems’, in which valueinformation for travel purposes is contained on the chips of consumers' existing payment cards, anddigital tickets are available for use from consumers' mobile devices.Interestingly, the other segment is banknote production. Over the past decade, the value of﻿[1]
banknote production in Asia has grown from around 4 per cent per year to around 5½ per cent in2016. Although a seemingly modest increase over the period, it is significant because this segmentcomprises around 40 per cent of the high security printing market in Asia. It is also significantbecause it is occurring at the same time as the growth in production volumes of banknotes isslowing, primarily, as I mentioned, in response to the take-up of electronic and digital platforms formaking payments. In the past 12 months, the volume of banknotes produced in the Asian region hasrisen by just 2 per cent compared with the average annual growth rate of around 5 per cent since thestart of this decade.Increasing growth in the value of production at the same time that growth in production volumes isslowing means, of course, that banknote prices are rising. Put differently, central banks, aswholesalers in the banknote market, are paying proportionately higher prices for finished banknotesthan they have in previous years. Furthermore, the higher price is compensating printers and otherinput suppliers, as producers in the market, for generally slower growth in production orders.My observation is that growth in banknote prices reflects, in part, a demand by central banks forbanknotes to be printed on more durable substrates and for banknotes to have more sophisticatedsecurity features to protect against counterfeit attack. This can be seen in the increasing take-up oftechnologies to improve the durability of banknotes, such as polymer and polymer-compositesubstrates, as well as varnishes as a protective banknote overcoat. It can also be seen in theincreased use of added security features such as optically variable devices – that is, foils and featuresthat change colour and shape as the banknote is tilted. Many of these features come at premiumprices compared with traditional inputs to banknote production. This is not a development unique tothe Asian market but is also evident in other regions, most notably Europe and parts of NorthAmerica.Two strategies underlie the demand for more expensive substrates and security features, strategiesthat reinforce each other.The first is that, as the growth in production volumes declines, central banks are having theirbanknotes printed on more durable substrates in order to extend banknote life in circulation and,thereby, reduce medium- to long-term printing costs. Industry estimates suggest that banknotesprinted on polymer substrates, for example, cost twice as much to produce as paper banknotes, butlast three to four times longer. This was certainly Australia's experience in the late 1990s, the firstfew years of printing our banknotes on polymer. Recent estimates suggest that the Australian $5banknote – our lowest denomination banknote – has a median life of around 3½ years while ourlargest circulation note by volume – the $50 – has a median life of around 10 years.The second strategy is that central banks are having more sophisticated security features added toprotect banknotes partly because the technology available to counterfeiters is improving and partlybecause the banknotes are staying in circulation for longer. In other words, banknotes are being﻿[2]
printed with advanced security features to protect against current sophisticated counterfeitingtechniques as well as as-yet unspecified and unknown techniques that may become available tocounterfeiters over longer periods in which the banknotes are likely to be circulating.Future State of PlayThe obvious question arising from these observations is: will the current state of play continue? Iwould like to offer some thoughts on the future state of play, focusing, again, on the banknotesegment of the market.It almost goes without saying that the outlook for banknote printing depends on the future demandfor cash. There are different views on this topic, including the view that physical cash has only afinite future. I won't summarise the various views other than to say that we cannot ignore thepossibility that the use of physical cash in many countries may disappear at some stage. That said,the common view seems to be that the future state – certainly in the foreseeable future – is likely inmost countries to be one of relatively less cash rather than cashless. That is, cash use may decline toa level that reflects a base demand in the community for the specific characteristics that physicalbanknotes provide.Whatever the endpoint – less cash or cashless – the journey is likely to be a steady walk rather thana quick sprint. There are several reasons for this, but two, in particular, stand out.The demand for cashThe first is that, despite its declining use in transactions, the overall demand for cash in manycountries is continuing to expand. In the past few years, the median annual growth in currency incirculation across International Monetary Fund (IMF) countries was just under 9 per cent. Similarannual growth was recorded for countries participating in the Pacific Rim Banknote Conference,which includes China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia and a number of other Asian countries as wellas Canada and the United States. In most of these countries, including Australia, the ratio ofcurrency in circulation to measures of national production is around its highest for several decades.Underlying the expansion is a shift in overall demand towards holding cash for non-transactionalreasons, such as a store of wealth and as a precautionary balance. Even so, the use of cash fortransactions purposes is still growing in most countries, albeit at a slower pace. There is, in fact, onlyone country in the world – Sweden – where the transaction demand for cash is in retreat. This isbecause cash transactions, despite losing prominence to non-cash payment methods, still offerfeatures that people find desirable – they are anonymous, exchange and settlement is instantaneous,and they are made in a liability of the central bank, which gives people confidence in the value oftheir exchange. Furthermore, cash transactions can be made when non-cash payments systems areunavailable, not operating, or are relatively expensive to use compared with using cash.﻿[3]﻿[4]
The key point is that, whatever the underlying causes, there is a degree of resilience in the demandfor cash. Arguably, the resilience is strongest in the Asian region because of the region's largepopulation. In China, the world's most populous country, growth in currency in circulation hasaveraged around 5 per cent annually over the past four years even though the country has, at thesame time, experienced a dramatic shift to electronic forms of payment – more dramatic, in fact,than in most other countries. Correspondingly, China's annual demand for banknote substrate isaround 30,000 tonnes, some 30 per cent of annual global substrate demand. The picture is broadlythe same in India and Indonesia, where strong cultural factors also underpin the demand for cash.Together, China, India and Indonesia, make up an estimated 55 per cent of global consumption ofbanknote substrate.By any measure, it is reasonable to assume that the momentum behind banknote demand in thesecountries alone will take some time to reverse direction.Investment in physical cash infrastructureThe second reason to believe that the journey will take a while is that central banks are continuing toinvest in banknote infrastructure. Based on my own quick survey, there are 22 central bankscurrently upgrading their banknotes or, at least, have done so in the past few years. A slightly largernumber of central banks – 23 – are underway with or have recently completed upgrading theirprinting and/or banknote processing centres. China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and the Philippinesas well as Canada and the United States feature in the group of countries upgrading their printingand processing operations. Australia features in both groups. As I mentioned earlier, we areupgrading our banknotes with more sophisticated security features. We are also in the final stages offitting out a recently completed storage facility with automated banknote processing equipment. Thefacility – which is several kilometres north of Melbourne's CBD – will more than double our existingstorage capacity and increase our processing capacity by around 50 per cent.Expenditures on printing equipment, secure storage and processing are significant investments. It isdifficult to get precise numbers in every case but, extrapolating on a few reported figures, the totalinvestment in printing and processing across the 23 central banks I identified in my survey amountsto an estimated $4¼ billion (US$3½ billion).The key point is that all of these central banks could not have got the investment decision wrong.Even if the endpoint is that our communities will be using much less cash, investments in newprinting and automated processing equipment will serve to keep production and processing costsdown as this happens. Either way, the size of the investment decisions by central banks in banknoteinfrastructure are based on central banks being in a position to continue managing the use ofphysical cash for some time.﻿[5]
Bringing It All TogetherPulling these thoughts together, the prospect that the decline in the use of banknotes is likely to begradual, particularly in this region of the world, is good news for the high security printing industry,of course, at least as far as printing banknotes is concerned. It suggests that the demand of centralbanks in recent years for banknotes to be printed on more durable substrates and with moresophisticated security features is likely to continue.This good news, however, is not without qualification. It would be unrealistic to believe that centralbanks will keep paying increasingly higher unit prices for banknotes. Underlying the demand forlonger lasting substrates and new, automated cash processing centres is a desire to manage thecosts of the banknote lifecycle more finely over the medium to long term. They will want substratesand security features at competitive prices. They may also change strategies. It is possible, as theuse of physical cash declines and technology advances, that central banks will find it strategicallybetter to shift to making small but regular changes to banknote design and functionality rather thanlarge, decades-apart upgrades to a full banknote series. They will also want access to detailed dataabout the performance of various banknote features at various stages of the banknote life cycle,allowing them to finely manage their investment in banknote durability and security against theuncertainty of future banknote demand. This may mean that awarding contracts to design and print anew single-denomination banknote or a complete new series may become less common. It may,instead, become more common to award contracts to print a single new feature and incorporate itinto an existing banknote design.If banknotes are staying longer in the hands of the public, it seems likely, too, that central banks willrequire the notes to have security features that are more overt. That is, security that can be easilyseen by looking at the note or by easily scanning a banknote with a smart phone. Banknotespresently have a roughly balanced mix of overt and covert security features.So there are opportunities and challenges ahead for the high security printing industry. Both seemmore acute in the Asian region because of its large population and cultural connection to usingphysical cash. That is why this conference is important and timely. It is an opportunity to shareexperiences, consider new technologies and techniques, and, with the benefit of these, discuss andplan strategy for the changes that are likely to occur over the next decade. I encourage you to makethe most of this opportunity over the next few days and I look forward to talking with you andsharing ideas and thoughts. I would also encourage you to take in the Melbourne atmosphere. Thecity has a well-earned reputation for creativity. As always, creativity will be important in order takethe opportunities ahead in the high security printing industry.Once again, welcome.

1     “Economic and Financial Regulation in the Era of Big Data” Paris, 24 November 2017  Closing remarks by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France  I am very pleased to close this Conference on “Economic and Financial Regulation in the Era of Big Data”. I was in London this morning and I therefore regret having missed your discussions on an issue which I consider of paramount importance. Let me thank warmly all speakers, in particular  Benoit Coeuré, member of the Board of the ECB, who opened this Conference and Philip-Hans Franses, Professor at Eramus School of Economics, who I am told gave an outstanding lecture.   Big Data indeed deserves a global view, from a number of angles. It was the objective of this Conference and I am grateful to all of you, presenters and participants, to have made this possible.     In closing this Conference, I will not come back to the specificities of Big Data and its numerous usages. All presentations have given a fresh look on Big Data and I am sure that on such an excellent basis, discussions will continue beyond this one day Conference on issues which are of key importance for all of us. I would rather like to focus on the consequences of Big Data for the economy in general and for central banks in particular. I will develop this into three parts: 
2  I. Big Data will have significant economic effects. It will in particular change the relationships between the members of the financial community and between this community and the non-financial world  II. Regarding Big Data, central banks will have to switch from an observer status to a user or player position, which implies significant changes in performing part of their activities  III. Big Data raise regulatory issues that cannot be solved within a national context but require a global reflection from public authorities.    I. Big data will have significant economic effects. Entry costs for carrying out financial transactions have already been reduced and will be lowered further in the future. Customer knowledge, in particular regarding the conditions applied by financial institutions, will be enhanced and more generally information asymmetries between clients and providers of financial services will narrow. Big Data can be a powerful card to play by GAFAs or other native non-financial firms to develop new activities. The financial industry has therefore to adapt rapidly to face the data revolution and compete with the new entrants, while protecting privacy against increasing cyber risks in particular. All in all, competition will increase, which is beneficial to the economy. The flip side can be enhanced risks for financial stability, implying a new form of vigilance for central bankers in particular. I will elaborate a bit more on this later on.   II. Terabytes of data are available and more will be coming soon. Central banks will collect more and more granular data. This is a clear opportunity for better forecasting and even nowcasting. But to reap all the benefits, central banks have to be up to the technological challenge, which is huge. They have also to face a much larger competition in the new data Era, with a view to maintaining trust in public information. They have therefore to become Big Data players and not only observers. This requires significant efforts. Let me illustrate this in five avenues to adapt to the digital evolution.  a) The Big Data era implies large changes in the IT infrastructure and a strong determination to address novel technical challenges and to build a forward-looking data management and analysis scheme. At the Banque de France, we are building a Data Lake that covers all the new data functionalities, from data collection to machine learning.   
3  b) Central banks should also organise themselves to answer the legitimate request from academics to have access to a wide range of granular data, in a modern and researcher-friendly way.  At the Banque de France, we opened just one year ago a Data Room which gives access to 600 million of anonymized series, and it has already attracted more than 30 research teams. Harvesting Big Data capacities is only beginning and central banks should be in the race.    c) Data quality should be maintained at the same time. There should not be with central banks input/output process any ‘garbage in, garbage out’. Managing huge volumes of data, carrying out machine or deep learning requires investing in human and automatic data technology, in training and hiring data analysts and scientists. Indeed, Big Data requires novel and significant human resources, and this has to be anticipated and properly managed.      d) The appetite for real time intelligence, the “short-termism” that can be inflated by the Big Data Revolution, entails risks that “bad data chase good ones”, thereby impeding the understanding of economic and financial developments by the general public and the media. We must do our best to kill fake news, and there is also economic fake news. But, in a society of communication more than of information, delivering data of good quality, which will always be a trademark of central banks, can hardly be the only answer. Central banks need to make their publications clearer, more readable, and more visible. In particular, if we want sound data to be shared and used, we should speak to each and every one and not just to experts. We should be more “B to C” and not only “B to B”: this is a cultural shift beyond mere technology change.  e) Central banks and I would say public authorities in general can no more work in silos. Data sharing is a must. In France, we have an excellent cooperation with the national statistical institute and we do share on a day-to day basis many data between supervisors and central bankers but the issue is deeper and wider.  Which brings me to my last point.    III. Big data raise issues that cannot be solved in a national context but require a public global reflection. Very large worldwide corporates are hugely leveraging on Big Data. Public authorities have to forge answers to concerns that may arise on an international level. Which themes should be addressed? I would like to propose a few leads. 
4  1) Data sharing has to be developed on a worldwide basis, as rightly underlined by the IMF in the ‘Data Gaps Initiative’ that has been launched by the G20. In Europe, existing legal provisions that authorize data sharing between supervisors and central bankers could become more prescriptive and be more largely implemented in practice in all countries concerned. Data sharing between tax authorities and other public administrations should be facilitated, subject to the respect of individual privacy of course.      2) Private innovation is fostering growth and is increasing economic efficiency. It should therefore not be discouraged by disenabling regulations. At the same time, it would be beneficial to the economy in the long run, and to financial stability more specifically, that the global actors that handle enormous volumes of data on physical persons as well as on private entities, comply with 3 core principles:  security, transparency, accountability. In a fully interconnected world, it cannot be effectively addressed at the country level.  I therefore believe that it would be useful for the International Organizations to carry out a reflection and issue recommendations in this regard.   Let me thank you for your attention and wish you a pleasant weekend and for those who are not Parisians a pleasant journey back home... today or I hope for some of you on Sunday!         
Janet L Yellen: The current economic outlook and monetary policy Testimony by Ms Janet L Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Joint Economic Committee, US Congress, Washington DC,  29 November 2017.*   *   *Chairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Heinrich, and members of the Committee, I appreciate theopportunity to testify before you today. I will discuss the current economic outlook and monetarypolicy.The economic outlookThe U.S. economy has strengthened further this year. Smoothing through the volatility caused bythe recent hurricanes, job gains averaged about 170,000 per month from January throughOctober, a somewhat slower pace than last year but still above the range that we estimate willbe consistent with absorbing new entrants to the labor force in coming years. With the job gainsthis year, 17 million more Americans are employed now than eight years ago. Meanwhile, theunemployment rate, which stood at 4.1 percent in October, has fallen 0.6 percentage point sincethe turn of the year and is nearly 6 percentage points below its peak in 2010. In addition, the laborforce participation rate has changed little, on net, in recent years, which is another indication ofimproving conditions in the labor market, given the downward pressure on the participation rateassociated with an aging population. However, despite these labor market gains, wage growthhas remained relatively modest. Unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics,which tend to be more sensitive to overall economic conditions than those for whites, havemoved down, on net, over the past year and are now near levels last seen before the recession.That said, it remains the case that unemployment rates for these minority groups are noticeablyhigher than for the nation overall.Meanwhile, economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in theyear. After having risen at an annual rate of just 1-1/4 percent in the first quarter, U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have increased at a 3 percentpace in both the second and third quarters despite the disruptions to economic activity in the thirdquarter caused by the recent hurricanes. Moreover, the economic expansion is increasinglybroad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy. I expect that, withgradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand andthe job market will strengthen somewhat further, supporting faster growth in wages and incomes.Although asset valuations are high by historical standards, overall vulnerabilities in the financialsector appear moderate, as the banking system is well capitalized and broad measures ofleverage and credit growth remain contained.Even with a step-up in growth of economic activity and a stronger labor market, inflation hascontinued to run below the 2 percent rate that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)judges most consistent with our congressional mandate to foster both maximum employmentand price stability. Increases in gasoline prices in the aftermath of the hurricanes temporarilypushed up measures of overall consumer price inflation, but inflation for items other than foodand energy has remained surprisingly subdued. The total price index for personal consumptionexpenditures increased 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the coreprice index, which excludes energy and food prices, rose just 1.3 percent over the same period,about 1/2 percentage point slower than a year earlier. In my view, the recent lower readings oninflation likely reflect transitory factors. As these transitory factors fade, I anticipate that inflationwill stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. However, it is also possible that this year’slow inflation could reflect something more persistent. Indeed, inflation has been below theCommittee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years. Against this backdrop, the1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
FOMC has indicated that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward ourinflation goal.Although the economy and the jobs market are generally quite strong, real GDP growth has beendisappointingly slow during this expansion relative to earlier decades. One key reason for thisslowdown has been the retirement of the older members of the baby-boom generation andhence the slower growth of the labor force. Another key reason has been the unusually sluggishpace of productivity growth in recent years. To generate a sustained boost in economic growthwithout causing inflation that is too high, we will need to address these underlying causes. In thisregard, the Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment and capitalformation, improve the nation’s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational system, andsupport innovation and the adoption of new technologies.Monetary policyI will turn now to the implications of recent economic developments and the outlook for monetarypolicy. With ongoing strengthening in labor market conditions and an outlook for inflation to returnto 2 percent over the next couple of years, the FOMC has continued to gradually reduce policyaccommodation. The Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4percentage point at both our March and June meetings, with the range now standing at 1 to 1-1/4percent. And, in October, the Committee began its balance sheet normalization program, whichwill gradually and predictably reduce our securities holdings. The Committee set limits on thepace of balance sheet reduction; those limits should guard against outsized moves in interestrates and other potential market strains. Indeed, there has been little, if any, market effectassociated with the balance sheet runoff to date. We do not foresee a need to alter the balancesheet program, but, as we said in June, we would be prepared to resume reinvestments if amaterial deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federalfunds rate.Changes to the target range for the federal funds rate will continue to be the Committee’s primarymeans of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. At our meeting earlier this month, we decidedto maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. We continue to expect that gradualincreases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate to sustain a healthy labor market andstabilize inflation around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. That expectation is based on the viewthat the current level of the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level—that is,the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on aneven keel. The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, implying thatthe federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance. If theneutral level rises somewhat over time, as most FOMC participants expect, additional gradualrate hikes would likely be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.Of course, policy is not on a preset course; the appropriate path for the federal funds rate willdepend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee has noted that itwill carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflationgoal. More generally, in determining the timing and size of future interest rate adjustments, theCommittee will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor marketconditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financialand international developments.Thank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   Introduction Resolution has come a long way since G20 Leaders put together the post-crisis financial reform agenda in summits in London and Pittsburgh in 2009.1 In some ways, it represented the most notable gap, and significant change in the pre-crisis regulatory architecture. Nearly ten years on, huge progress has been made in establishing effective resolution arrangements and the commitment to ending too-big-to-fail (TBTF) is undimmed. The immediate priority in this effort was to put in place the necessary legal frameworks. Agreement in 2011 of Financial Stability Board (FSB) Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes provided the international standards to ensure a consistent approach to the design of resolution regimes across G20 jurisdictions.2 The UK now has in place a comprehensive bank resolution regime that is compliant with international standards and will remain so after Brexit. Similarly, for all advanced economies, there are now resolution regimes that are largely compliant with the Key Attributes in all the jurisdictions that are home to global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).  But the Key Attributes were about effective resolution regimes rather than resolvable firms – they defined a tool-kit but not how to use it; and a process for resolution planning for G-SIBs but not what would make a firm resolvable. Powers without resolvability leaves resolution authorities vulnerable. Indeed, the moral for me of recent failures and near-failures is not that resolution is misguided and will not work, but that it will not work if firms are not regulated and supervised in a way that makes them resolvable. This is the story of the last five years. We have focussed on organising firms in such a way that authorities’ resolution powers can be used without significant adverse consequences for the rest of the financial system or the wider economy. This moves us progressively to where we want to be against risk appetite. And though we are not yet where we finally need to be, what has been done has already yielded significant benefits. For example rating agencies have largely removed government support uplifts to bank’ credit ratings.3 Where UK firms have come under stress, our resolution arrangements have been one factor that has helped secure recovery. Today I want to review where we are on the journey: what has been done and what is left to do. I want to focus in particular on three topics:                                                        1 See FSB ‘Declaration on Strengthening the Financial System – London Summit’  (2009)  http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/london_summit_declaration_on_str_financial_system.pdf and FSB ‘ Leaders’ Statement the Pittsburgh Summit’ (2009) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/g20_leaders_declaration_pittsburgh_2009.pdf 2 See FSB ‘Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions’ (2014) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141015.pdf.  3 See S&P Global ‘An Illustrative Rating Path for a Systemic Bank In A Bail-In Resolution’ (2017) http://images.ratingsinfo.standardandpoors.com/Web/StandardPoorsRatings/Illustrative%20Rating%20Path.pdf.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   (i) internal total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) or minimum requirements for eligible liabilities and own funds (MREL) and the underpinning it provides for cross-border co-operation; (ii) bail-in mechanics – having required banks to maintain TLAC or MREL, we need, as resolution authorities, to be clear how we would use it; and (iii) disclosure – resolution needs to be credible as well as feasible. With credibility comes market discipline ex ante and less disruption in a resolution (lower probability of default and loss given default in other words). All three areas build on the core work of resolvability that has already been done, illustrating the point that the process is incremental and resolvability is not binary but progressive. Resolvability of firms Let me start then by reviewing what has already been done. I will focus on the standards and guidance coming from the FSB. It is true that they have been drawn up for application to G-SIBs in Crisis Management Groups (CMGs). But in our view, they are equally applicable to domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) or other firms where bail-in is the preferred resolution strategy, especially where firms operate cross-border. The convergence at international level on bail-in as the appropriate strategy for large banks is itself significant. This transcends whether firms are single point of entry or multiple point of entry. And whether the bail-in is effected by use of a bail-in tool in an operating bank or by application of a bridge bank tool at holding company level. It represents the realisations that if we are to end TBTF we must have bail-ins instead of bail-outs so losses can fall on investors not on taxpayers. And that the bail-in must enable continuity in a firm’s operations to avoid interruption to critical functions and to buy time for an orderly reorganisation of the firm to the extent necessary to deal with the problem that first caused the failure. This shared understanding at FSB, and the desire to meet the goal set by G20 Leaders to end TBTF and the risk of taxpayer bail-outs as soon as possible, has driven a focus on seeking changes at firms so that they can be stabilised and enter resolution safely without disruption to critical functions. Hence the focus on two dimensions: - Loss absorbency: firms need TLAC in the right amount (enough not only to absorb losses but to provide for recapitalisation so firms can continue to meet requirements for authorisation); in the right form (debt with residual maturity of a year and subordinated to operating liabilities to avoid breaches of the ‘no creditor worse off than insolvency’ (NCWO) safeguard or other challenges to the bail-in and at the same time to provide clarity to depositors that they are not likely to be bailed in); and in the right location (ensuring that resources are positioned within a group so that the key operating companies containing a firm’s critical functions can be recapitalised 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   immediately in resolution).As such, international agreement of the FSB’s TLAC standard in 2015 represented a major milestone in moving towards ending TBTF.4 - Continuity of critical functions: the second main dimension of stabilisation is to ensure continuity in a firm’s operations in resolution. Part of this is legal – changing contractual arrangements so that entry into resolution does not result in widespread, disorderly termination, close-out or acceleration in financial contracts, provision of services or access to financial market infrastructures (FMIs). It is true that under the Key Attributes, resolution regimes include statutory powers to stay. But statutory stays may not be effective cross-border. And, anyway, repapering contracts helps to convey to counterparties that there will be continuity in resolution and so reduce incentives to break for the exit. FSB has published guidance in this space for operational continuity in resolution and continuity of access to FMIs.5 Perhaps the most notable effort has been FSB’s work with industry to agree a protocol to International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and other master netting agreements that addresses close-out risk in over-the-counter (OTC), derivative and repo transactions.6 Agreement in 2014 of the universal protocol amongst G-SIBs, and subsequently of jurisdictional modular protocols for individual jurisdictions to bring in buy-side and non-G-SIB counterparties, is another major landmark in ensuring big international firms are resolvable.7 The protocol is built around the premise that entry into resolution should not be classed as an event of default as long as a firm continues to perform. This underscores the importance of funding to making resolution credible. FSB set out principles on funding in resolution in 2016 and just last week published for consultation guidance for use in CMGs on the liquid resources and liquidity management capabilities firms require to be adequately resolvable and how liquidity in firms might be bolstered in adverse cases by public backstops.8 CMGs will use the guidance to draw up resolution funding plans setting out how, in order to achieve resolvability, liquidity and collateral should be held in a group across legal entities, currencies and locations. We have made good progress in regulating these various FSB standards in the UK, either through Bank of England Policy statements or Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) rules. UK banks have been given indicative MREL requirement to meet by 2020; they will have operational continuity arrangements in place in 2019 (alongside the implementation of ring-fencing); and they are already trading on protocol terms with                                                        4 See FSB ‘Principles on Loss-Absorbing and Recapitalisation Capacity of G-SIBs in Resolution’ (2015) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/TLAC-Principles-and-Term-Sheet-for-publication-final.pdf.  5 See FSB ‘Guidance on Arrangements to Support Operational Continuity in Resolution’ (2015)  http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/Guidance-on-Arrangements-to-Support-Operational-Continuity-in-Resolution.pdf and  FSB ‘Guidance on Continuity of Access to Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) for a Firm in Resolution’ (2016) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/Continuity-of-Access-to-FMIs-Consultation-Document-FINAL.pdf.  6 See FSB ‘Cross-Border Recognition of Resolution Action’ (2014) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/c_140929.pdf.  7 See ISDA ‘2014 Resolution Stay Protocol’ (2014) http://assets.isda.org/media/f253b540-25/958e4aed-pdf/, ISDA ‘ 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol’ (2015) http://assets.isda.org/media/ac6b533f-3/5a7c32f8-pdf/ and ISDA ‘ Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular Protocol UK (PRA RULE) Jurisdictional Module’ (2016) http://assets.isda.org/media/f253b540-94/cd991d70-pdf/.  8 See FSB ‘Guiding Principles on the Temporary Funding Needed to Support the Orderly Resolution of a Global Systemically Important Bank (“G-SIB”)’ (2016)  http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/Guiding-principles-on-the-temporary-funding-needed-to-support-the-orderly-resolution-of-a-global-systemically-important-bank-“G-SIB”.pdf and FSB ‘ Funding Strategy Elements of an Implementable Resolution Plan’ (2017) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/301117-2.pdf.

To the point that resolvability is progressive, the major UK banks on average now have total loss absorbency of 23% measured against risk-weighted assets (RWAs) compared to  an average end-state requirement of 28% (including buffers).9 As described, there is more to do in some of these areas. But increasingly the emphasis is on implementation and, with it, assurance – how we supervise firms against these regulatory requirements and hold them to account that identified barriers to resolvability are removed and stay removed. In describing the progress towards end-state resolvability, I want to pick out three areas that will be a focus in the period ahead.  (a) Internal MREL The first is internal MREL. One lesson that the crisis brought home is that the distribution of resources within groups matters. While in life, firms might want to run themselves by business lines on a consolidated basis, failure and resolution occurs at legal entity level.  It is understandable then that since the crisis that there has been a discernible tendency for host authorities to hold onto more resources, capital and liquidity, or to force activity in branches into subsidiaries. The aim at FSB level with TLAC was to lean against this tendency towards fragmentation of international groups by providing comfort to authorities cross-border, not only that groups would have sufficient external TLAC to be resolvable but also that resources would be prepositioned as internal TLAC in material subsidiaries in host jurisdictions. Previous international regulation of financial resources in groups has, like the Basel Accord, typically focussed more on the consolidated level. Now applying TLAC regulation at legal entity level has brought with it challenges. One is timing: it is hard to roll out internal TLAC for a group until TLAC requirements are in place in all the jurisdictions relevant for the material subsidiaries. The Bank is in the middle of consulting on its internal MREL policy10 but many other jurisdictions – notably the Banking Union, Switzerland and Japan – have still not set policy. Another challenge is arithmetic: to the extent that there are financial dependencies between legal entities within a group the sum of solo RWAs is likely to be greater than consolidated RWAs. If a full TLAC requirement were applied to each subsidiary then the sum of the internal TLAC would exceed the consolidated TLAC requirement for the group as a whole.                                                       9 The Bank of England published loss-absorbing capacity requirements for major UK banks in 2016 shortly after responding to the Treasury Committee’s inquiry into capital. See http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/capital-and-resolution/written/69208.pdf.  10 The Bank of England published a consultation paper on its approach to setting a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) within groups on 2 October 2017. See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/resolution/internal-mrel-consultation-october-2017.pdf?la=en&hash=33594C3FB3C7F1D129033AFE4E3A2BF20A4F9AA8 . 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   This was addressed in the TLAC term sheet in two ways:  - by limiting internal TLAC only to subgroups and subsidiaries that are material to the group, accounting for more than 5% of RWAs or income. The logic there was that at that level failure of the material entity might trigger resolution of the group as a whole; problems for smaller entities, even those that might house functions that are critical to the host jurisdiction, should be more of a recovery matter. - by including a provision that internal MREL for subgroups should be scaled in single point of entry (SPE) groups to 75-90% of the requirement that would apply to the subgroup on a standalone basis. The logic was that given the interdependence in the business models of SPE firms, prepositioning in this range would be sufficient to secure cooperation and deter hosts from ring-fencing, and home authorities from cutting off, foreign subsidiaries. Prepositioning of resources in this way will provide concrete underpinning for cooperation that goes beyond the paper commitments to cooperate in Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs), honoured in the breach in previous cross-border failures. Even with these restrictions there may still be a sum of the parts problem in which the sum of TLAC requirements at solo level pushes up external requirements. If internal TLAC requirements are high they are also likely to stand in the way of holding a surplus at the top of the group that could provide flexibility in covering losses if they are concentrated in a particular part of a group. Thus in our internal MREL policy our intention is first to consider setting internal MREL generally for the firm at the bottom of the 75-90% range.11 But to set a higher requirement if we have doubts about: the home resolution strategy, the availability of a surplus at the top of the group or a lack of reciprocity in MREL-setting in other jurisdictions (that is others all set at the 90% end of the range). We expect to say more about surplus MREL and the form it should be held in to be readily available when we come to finalise our internal MREL policy next year. Another important objective for us in setting policy on internal MREL is to avoid any distortion in the sequence of loss absorption between operating companies (OpCo) and the group holding company (HoldCo). We require UK banks to issue external MREL out of their HoldCos, structurally subordinated to liabilities at the OpCo. The issuance proceeds are then onlent to the OpCo as internal MREL broadly mirroring their external form, for example: Tier 2 could be onlent as Tier 2, AT1 as AT1 and senior debt out of HoldCo would be downstreamed as an internal debt instrument sitting senior to capital instruments but junior to operating liabilities in the OpCo. We need to be sure that as losses are incurred in the operating company they are absorbed in an order that follows the OpCo creditor hierarchy and does not bypass certain instruments. The aim with a single point of                                                       11 Our starting point for calibrating internal MREL for ring-fenced bank sub-groups would be 90%, with the possibility that this could be scaled down if there are sufficient readily deployable resources. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   entry bail-in strategy, as the name suggests, is only to put one entity at the top of the group into resolution, preferably a holding company which is only used for issuing capital instruments to the market and otherwise has no or limited operating liabilities. Write down or conversion of internal MREL instruments via contractual triggers will then allow operating companies lower down the group to be recapitalised automatically without putting them into resolution. But legacy non-equity capital instruments in OpCos without the requisite contractual triggers could cut across this. We do not want these to be spared bearing losses for want of a trigger. And so, we are clear that such instruments should not count as MREL beyond 31 December 2021 and if not matured by then we will work with firms to remove them if they represent a barrier to the resolution strategy. This is part of a larger effort to add to the credibility of resolution by being clear to debt investors and other stakeholders how a bail-in will work in practice. We want debt investors to be able to price risk effectively by being clear about where they rank in the creditor hierarchy and to give them confidence that we can stick to the hierarchy in applying losses and that we will not be picking winners and losers within a class. Counting as MREL senior debt issued out of operating companies without subordination looks like a recipe for undermining that confidence. (b) Bail-in execution We also want to be clear as a resolution authority how we will conduct the resolution in a way that preserves value and distributes it fairly, ensuring no creditor worse off protections are met. To that end, we have thought hard about the valuation capabilities we need firms to have so that we can value losses and recapitalisation needs in an effective and timely way. We have just consulted on a set of principle level requirements and expect to finalise policy in this space in the next few months.12 We believe that the bail-in valuation for a large cross-border firm is not something that can be fixed over a weekend. Valuation on that timetable will inevitably tend to overshoot on the estimation of losses, not least because a significant driver of the valuation will be the reorganisation that follows the bail-in and the restructuring costs and disposal valuations associated with that. Rather, it is our intention to take several months for the bail-in valuation to ensure that through an independent valuation process, losses as far as possible are bottomed out and tie back to the reorganisation plan for the surviving business. It will be critical to determine the net asset value that had been generated in the bail-in and the liability holders it should go to as compensation. You may ask, what happens in the intervening period? From the perspective of the debt investor, our intention on entry to resolution is to take control of the shares in issue and immobilise all the other external                                                       12 The Bank of England published a consultation paper on valuation capabilities to support resolvability on 17 August 2017. See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/resolution/boes-proposed-policy-on-valuation-capabilities-to-support-resolvability.pdf?la=en&hash=4044F91DF1DDE7A131EA3186F66F304380553306 .

We will at the same time issue onto the bondholders accounts at the ICSDs a tradeable certificate of entitlement secured by the shares in issue. There will be as many classes of certificate as there are classes of claim. Once the valuation is complete and we have announced the terms of exchange, holders will present the certificates in exchange for whatever equity they are entitled to as compensation. The resulting shareholders will then vote in a new board and the firm will return to private sector control. Issuing certificates of entitlement in this way will provide a mechanism for debtholders that do not want to, or due to their mandates, are not able to hold equity to trade out of their positions. And this will have an ancillary benefit for us of providing some sort of shadow market valuation of the firm. But what about other liability holders – depositors, market counterparties, trade creditors etc. – during this interval? Our aim with the announcement of the resolution is to send a strong signal to them that their claims are safe and that the operating companies they are transacting with will continue to perform. Full conversion of internal MREL in the key operating companies around the group and a strong sense that the firm will have access to liquidity will contribute to that. To this end, the Bank has established new arrangements to clarify, first, that a firm in resolution would continue to have access to the ordinary central bank facilities in the Sterling Monetary Framework, subject to meeting the necessary eligibility criteria. And second, those arrangements will be supplemented where necessary by a flexible Resolution Liquidity Framework, designed to provide liquidity, in sterling or foreign currency, in the necessary scale, for a sufficient period of time, and secured against a wide range of collateral to allow the firm to make the transition to market-based funding.13 Sending a strong message in this way at the outset of the resolution will maximise the chances of stabilising the firm and if liability holders know their claims will be refinanced, reduce the risk of a further run. This need for clarity is understood at international level. FSB has just published a consultation paper on  bail-in execution addressing a number of issues I have described including valuation and exchange mechanics.14 Not least there are important home-host dependencies that need to be addressed. After all, in a UK G-SIB resolution we will need to bail-in debt on both sides of the Atlantic, in the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) as well as Clearstream and Euroclear. This includes working through with market regulators the securities law issues that will arise through a bail-in, ensuring that disclosure and listing requirements continue to be satisfied.                                                         13 See Box 2 – the Bank’s approach to providing liquidity in resolution in https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/resolution/boes-approach-to-resolution.pdf?la=en&hash=8213BE00D67C4CADB948D51FEBD164E136A70BE6  14 See FSB ‘ Principles on Bail-In Execution’ (2017) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P301117-1.pdf

A recurrent theme of my remarks has been the importance of ex ante disclosure to making resolution credible and to realising the benefits of increased market discipline. We want debt investors to have the information they need to price risk and so support the proposals in the TLAC term sheet and Basel’s Pillar 3 Framework that require banks to disclose the rank ordering of their liability structure at legal entity level. As I have described, we want debtholders and other stakeholders to understand how we will use out resolution powers and so have published a document setting out our approach to resolution – otherwise known as the Purple Book.15 The latest edition in October indicates how far we have come since we first published the Purple Book in 2014. But we have further to go. It is our intention – which we indicated to the Treasury Select Committee in March – to publish summaries of the resolution plans for the major UK banks and our assessment of their resolvability. We will do this after the start of 2019 when ring-fencing, the first level of TLAC requirements and operational continuity in resolution arrangements are in place. As an institution we want to be open and accountable. As a resolution authority we need to be for it to work. There is a famous Chinese proverb that notes a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. On the resolution journey there have been a lot of steps – in fact we could all be forgiven for feeling footsore – but the thousand mile marker is coming into view.                                                       15 See the Bank of England’s approach to resolution https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/resolution/boes-approach-to-resolution.pdf?la=en&hash=8213BE00D67C4CADB948D51FEBD164E136A70BE6 . 
Jerome H Powell: Confirmation hearingTestimony by Mr Jerome H Powell, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, WashingtonDC, 28 November 2017.*   *   *Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the Committee, thank you forexpeditiously scheduling this hearing and providing me the opportunity to appear before youtoday. I would also like to express my gratitude to President Trump for the confidence he hasshown by nominating me to serve as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System. The Federal Reserve has had a productive relationship with this Committeeover the years, and, if you and your colleagues see fit to confirm me, I look forward to workingclosely with you in the years ahead.Before I continue, I would like to introduce my wife, Elissa, who is sitting behind me. I would notbe here today without her unstinting love, support, and wise counsel.As you know, I have served as a member of the Board of Governors and the Federal OpenMarket Committee (FOMC) for more than five years, contributing in a variety of capacities,including most recently as chairman of the Board’s Committee on Supervision and Regulation.My views on a wide range of monetary policy and regulatory issues are on the public record inspeeches and testimonies during my service at the Fed. The Congress established the FederalReserve more than a century ago to provide a safer and more flexible monetary and financialsystem. And, almost exactly 40 years ago, it assigned us monetary policy goals: maximumemployment, meaning people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairlyquickly; and price stability,meaning inflation is low and stable enough that it need not figure intohouseholds’ and businesses’ economic decisions.I have had the great privilege of serving under Chairman Bernanke and Chair Yellen, and, likethem, I will do everything in my power to achieve those goals while preserving the FederalReserve’s independent and nonpartisan status that is so vital to their pursuit. In our democracy,transparency and accountability must accompany that independence. We are transparent andaccountable in many ways. Among them, we affirm our numerical inflation objective annually andpublish our economic and interest rate projections quarterly. And, since 2011, the Chairman hasconducted regular news conferences to explain the FOMC’s thinking. Additionally, we areaccountable to the people’s representatives through twice-a-year reports, testimony, oversight,and audited financial statements. I am strongly committed to that framework of transparency andaccountability and to continuing to look for ways to enhance it. In our federated system, membersof the Washington-based Board of Governors participate in FOMC deliberations with thepresidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, which are deeply rooted in their localcommunities. I am a strong supporter of this institutional structure, which helps ensure adiversity of perspectives on monetary policy and helps sustain the public’s support for theFederal Reserve as an institution.If confirmed, I would strive, along with my colleagues, to support the economy’s continuedprogress toward full recovery. Our aim is to sustain a strong jobs market with inflation movinggradually up toward our target. We expect interest rates to rise somewhat further and the size ofour balance sheet to gradually shrink. However, while we endeavor to make the path of policy aspredictable as possible, the future cannot be known with certainty. So we must retain theflexibility to adjust our policies in response to economic developments. Above all, even as wedraw on the lessons of the past, we must be prepared to respond decisively and with appropriateforce to new and unexpected threats to our nation’s financial stability and economic prosperity—the original motivation for the Federal Reserve’s founding.1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
As a regulator and supervisor of banking institutions, in collaboration with other federal and stateagencies, we must help ensure that our financial system remains both stable and efficient. Ourfinancial system is without doubt far stronger and more resilient than it was a decade ago. Ourbanks have much higher levels of capital and liquid assets, are more aware of the risks they run,and are better able to manage those risks. Even as we have worked to implementimprovements, we also have sought to tailor regulation and supervision to the size and riskprofile of banks, particularly community institutions. We will continue to consider appropriateways to ease regulatory burdens while preserving core reforms—strong levels of capital andliquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning—so that banks can provide the credit to familiesand businesses necessary to sustain a prosperous economy. In doing so, we must be clear andtransparent about the principles that are driving our decisions and about the expectations wehave for the institutions we regulate.To conclude, inside the Federal Reserve, we understand that our decisions in all these areasmatter for American families and communities. I am committed to making decisions objectivelyand based on the best available evidence. In doing so, I would be guided solely by our mandatefrom the Congress and the long-run interests of the American public.Thank you. I would be happy to respond to your questions. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
1  Central Bank of Chile’s Twenty-first Annual Conference “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: Transmission Mechanisms and Policy Implications” Opening remarks by Governor Mario Marcel  Good morning and welcome to the Twenty-first Annual Conference of the Central Bank of Chile. It is a pleasure to host this event that every year gives us an opportunity to reflect and discuss about issues that have direct implications on our work as central bankers from a broader perspective. I am looking forward to active discussions through the rest of the week on this year’s conference theme: monetary policy and financial stability. Ten years have passed since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis and we are still dealing with its economic consequences. But we have learnt a lot, and a decade of hindsight about the causes and long-lasting effects has led us to rethink the way we conduct monetary policy, how to ensure financial stability, and how these two elements are, or should be, interconnected. One of the most important policy lessons from the crisis concerns the relevance of actively seeking financial stability in a context of ever-increasing financial complexity. And central banks worldwide have been increasingly involved in assuring this, since it has become clear that financial stability is a pre-condition for price stability. Although financial stability has long been a key concern for policymakers, particularly in emerging countries where financial vulnerabilities are, or were, more evident and where risks to stability often come from abroad, nowadays the key concern is how to act in a preemptive way with actions that are costly, to ensure financial stability into the future.  How should macroeconomic policy pursue the goal of financial stability in normal times, when the benefits are uncertain but the costs are noticeable?  As many of you well know, this concern came with the observation that the buildup of risks in the United States before the crisis occurred during a period of stable prices and output, the so called “Great Moderation” period, where low nominal interest rates that were consistent with the Central Bank’s commitment with CPI inflation stability may have led to excessive risk-taking by financial intermediaries, and to a rise in asset prices, while good economic conditions masked the developing of financial imbalances. In the aftermath of the crisis, policy rates were drastically reduced and diverse policy measures were implemented as the zero-lower bound became an active constraint. But the increasing concern about financial conditions and the consequent reassessment of the macroeconomic policy framework was most evident with the adoption of macroprudential 
2  policies. But the question remains about the role of monetary policy. Should monetary policy frameworks explicitly incorporate risks to financial stability? This, the so-called Leaning Against the Wind debate, has become one of the most hotly debated issues in macroeconomics, in policy as well as academic circles, and will be one of the main topics we will be discussing and learning about during these couple of days.  Let me contribute to this debate with the perspective of a policymaker in a small-open economy like Chile. In our case, financial vulnerabilities have been often related to large and volatile capital flows, with their consequent effects on asset prices and credit spreads. In this context, raising the interest rate in normal times due to financial stability concerns as the LAW strategy would prescribe, may be counterproductive as it would attract more capital flows, would tend to appreciate the domestic currency and would encourage foreign-currency borrowing. These mechanisms, of course, have been at the core of monetary policy in developing countries for many years. In the case of Chile, they were more evident during the 90s when capital controls were in place to try to give more autonomy to monetary policy in a context of persistent and large capital inflows. However, these mechanisms are relevant as well when debating about the role of monetary policy in actively pursuing an objective of financial stability.   A second issue I would like to point out is related to the credibility of the Central Bank, which is also a very important concern for emerging economies like Chile, where credibility was gained over several decades of responsible policymaking, and losing it would mean a costly institutional setback. A strong advantage of having monetary policy focusing exclusively on price stability is that it simplifies communication and enhances accountability, with the resulting positive effects on credibility. Adding a different objective would hinder transparency, endangering the anchoring of inflation expectations.   However, independently of the convenience of following a LAW strategy or keeping the pre-crisis consensus with monetary policy focusing primarily on price stability, I am convinced that the main lesson from the Crisis is that regulatory frameworks aimed at specific sectors and markets are a key element of a defense against financial disruptions. Macroprudential policies, and in particular monetary policy, are not substitutes for an efficient regulatory framework. Microeconomic policies can be targeted much closer to the source of market imperfections, mitigating their effects while at the same time avoiding the economy-wide costs of contractionary macroeconomic policies.  We cannot forget that inefficiencies in the regulatory framework were at the heart of the buildup of risks in the run-up to the crisis. The fact that fragilities in the financial system, namely inadequate levels of capitalization and liquidity, were not properly and timely identified, may primarily reflect inadequacies in regulation and supervision.  
3  Our best response is to continue strengthening regulation and supervision regimes aimed at avoiding future crises. And central banks have a crucial role to play because there are clear complementarities between financial and monetary stability, which, as is the case of Chile, are often formally recognized in central banks’ official mandates. Before referring to what we have done on this matter in Chile, let me briefly describe our experience with the Global Financial Crisis and our macroeconomic policy response to it. While we were still enjoying the commodity boom of the 2000s, we were hit by the spillover effects of the crisis and its aftermath, namely the tightening of domestic lending conditions, capital outflows, a reduction of the external demand for our exports and a decrease in the price of copper, which is still the main source of external income for the Chilean economy, and in particular an important source of revenues for the Treasury. The price of this critical commodity fell more than 60 percent in just five months. Exports fell almost 20 percent in two years, a strong shock for an economy where exports accounted for more than 40 percent of GDP. A similar drop experienced public revenues, with those coming from copper production falling 23 percent in 2008 and 50 percent the following year. Despite the severity of the shocks, economic performance and the resilience of the financial system have been better than in comparable situations in the past. Behind this favorable response of the Chilean economy lies a macroeconomic policy framework able to pursue an effective reaction, and a regulatory scheme supporting the high resilience of the domestic financial system.  In Chile the monetary policy framework consists of a flexible inflation-targeting regime with a floating exchange rate. This framework has allowed us to respond efficiently to external shocks keeping inflation expectations anchored. Before the Asian Crisis of 1998, we had a managed exchange rate and we had capital controls in place to allow monetary policy independence to manage inflation in a context of abundant capital inflows. Indeed, we experienced a costly adjustment to that episode, and this was fueled in part by financial stability concerns that called against an exchange rate adjustment. But once the harder times had passed, the exchange rate was allowed to float freely, facilitating not only the external adjustment against shocks but also improving the incentives for private agents to properly hedge their foreign currency operations.  The deep-rooted credibility of our Central Bank has also facilitated the conduct of monetary policy with a floating exchange rate system. The fact that the market understands that the Central Bank pursues a goal for inflation at a 24-month horizon means that the exchange rate pass-through to inflation is relatively low, indeed the lowest in the region. This can be illustrated with the reluctance of the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy in 2015 despite a 49 percent devaluation in 2014-2016, and without affecting 24-months-ahead inflation expectations, which remained anchored at the target level. 
4  As the 2007 financial crisis unfolded and its effects spread-out, this framework helped us to avoid large costs and evade financial problems despite our strong ties with the global economy. In the aftermath of the crisis the local currency depreciated around 45 percent in seven months, while the monetary policy rate was reduced from a relatively high level of 8.25 percent in December 2008 to a point five percent in July 2009, remaining there for about a year. Together with lowering the interest rate, the Central Bank implemented a program of liquidity provision that significantly reduced the market interest rates to a level much closer to the monetary policy rate. Additionally, in the middle of 2009 it established a term liquidity facility for banking institutions, granting 90- and 180-day liquidity at the prevailing monetary policy rate, signaling a more expansionary path for the monetary policy rate than the market expected.  The active monetary policy response, together with an expansionary fiscal policy, favored by a healthy fiscal position that was achieved thanks to a fiscal rule where expenditures are determined as a function of long-run copper prices and economic growth, facilitated a rapid adjustment. After only one period of negative annual growth in 2009, the economy was able to sustain growth rates above 4 percent in the years that followed. The inflation rate fell well below the target range for about a year, but inflation expectations remained well anchored at our target of 3 percent in the two-year horizon. Undoubtedly this is the strongest countercyclical macroeconomic policy response we have ever implemented to a shock of this magnitude, and it was possible thanks to a sound corporate sector, a well-capitalized and resilient financial sector, and a solid position in terms of international liquidity.  Importantly for the discussion ahead, this was the result of careful regulation and supervision of individual financial institutions. This scheme hails back to the banking crisis of the 1980s, and it has been constantly adapted and improved since then.  In Chile, financial services are regulated and supervised by different institutions according to the type of service; securities and insurance, the pension system and unemployment insurance, and banks. In the case of banks, the Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions and the Central Bank are in charge.  Different schemes have been designed to facilitate coordination between institutions. This effort has led recently to the creation of the Financial Market Commission, which will be headed by an autonomous board of directors and will transform the financial supervision and regulation scheme to an integrated one, with a systemic view of the stability and risks facing the financial sector and more flexibility to deal with critical situations. The Central Bank of Chile enjoys a special independent status under the Bank‘s Constitutional Organic Law. Besides specific regulatory tasks with regard to the banking sector, the Central Bank oversees the foreign exchange regulations and monitors closely and 
5  constantly all the industries making up the financial sector. A central task performed by the Central Bank aimed at financial stability is the publication of the Financial Stability Report, twice a year.  The banking regulation has evolved gradually and steadily, adopting proven international standards and best practices. A new General Banking Law will provide for a gradual convergence to the Basel III framework, which will raise the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base; strengthen risk hedging; introduce leverage limits; promote a countercyclical capital framework; and introduce a global liquidity standard. These requirements will be implemented gradually through 2019. They will provide higher stability and sustainability and contribute to Chile’s reputation and access to international markets.  Chile largely complies with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure established by the BIS.  An assessment made by the World Bank and the IMF last year identified a high level of compliance with the principles on the part of the entities assessed, as well as the authorities. The main conclusion was that Chile has sound and robust financial market infrastructures, in line with international standards and best practices on risk management, the finality and irrevocability of settlement, efficiency and transparency. The Chilean financial market is, in general, deeper than those of other Latin American countries, with larger institutional investors and greater maturity. Banks' capital adequacy indicators are similar to those of other economies in the region, but lower than in OECD countries, while their exposure to credit risk is low relative to both OECD and emerging economies. The World Economic Forum Banking Strength index shows that the Chilean banking sector is very strong, as it ranks in the 11th place in the world.  Let me finish by pointing out the relevance that the exchange rate derivatives market has had in favoring both financial stability and the conduct of the flexible inflation targeting scheme in Chile. This market is not as deep as it is in developed countries, but it has experienced significant growth of more than 10-fold since 1998, fueled in part, as I already mentioned, by the floating exchange rate regime. The role of pension funds has been significant as well, as they maintain a large positive foreign financial position, and keep hedging against exchange rate risk even above the regulatory requirements, especially in the aftermath of the last crisis.  Thanks to these factors and a favorable regulation, Chile shows a high level of penetration of financial derivatives compared to other emerging economies and countries in the region. All this has contributed to a limited exchange rate mismatch of corporations. Today the share of firms with a mismatch over 10 percent of their assets is below 10 percent, down from around 20 percent before the Crisis. Hence monetary policy can be conducted in a countercyclical manner, without the need to manage the exchange rate.  However, as the recent experience in developed countries has revealed, the rapid development of derivatives 
6  markets also poses challenges to regulators due to their complexity and potential concentration of risks in a few entities. An additional strength of the Chilean economy in the context of emerging countries, which I think is very important for the topic to be discussed during these days, is the relevance of institutional investors, particularly pension funds. Their role in financial stability has gone well beyond the development of derivatives markets. They have contributed to the deepening of capital markets, portfolio diversification, and the development of new financial products, among other features. Moreover, with their peso-denominated liabilities and large foreign position, which is around 35 percent of GDP in the case of pension funds, they have facilitated the conduct of monetary policy being an important source of liquidity in foreign currency when needed.  Acknowledging this, the financial regulation has gradually expanded the scope of possible investments for institutional investors, including raising the limits for investments abroad.  Let me finish by thanking the distinguished group of economists that have joined us to present and discuss issues concerning monetary policy and financial stability. I would like to thank also Alvaro Aguirre, Markus Brunnermeier, Diego Saravia and Catalina Larraín for putting together the program, and Paloma Navarro and Carola Besa for helping with the organization.    
Gent Sejko: Banking developments and financial marketinfrastructure. The role of structure, size and market infrastructurein risk mitigation and financial intermediationWelcome address by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Annual Conference2017 of the Bank of Albania, Tirana, 9 November 2017.*   *   *Your Excellency Mr President,Honourable Mr Minister,Dear Prof. Anastasakis,Honourable Governors,Your excellencies Ambassadors, dear guests and participants,I would like to warmly welcome you to the Annual Conference of the Bank of Albania. For almosttwo decades, the Conference has become a prevalent event in the research and professionalactivity of the Bank. Our analyses and conclusions, over the years, have endeavoured to respondto many challenges and dilemmas for our national economy and beyond. Thanks to thecooperation with the University of Oxford, more specifically with St. Anthony’s College, thisConference has aimed, and I believe it has succeeded in doing so, at exploring and providinganswers for a number of issues, which, given their nature, effect and interlinking, are presentacross the region of the South East Europe.The theme of this year focuses on similar issues. During the day, national and internationalexperts of the economy and finance as well as academics will analyse the latest trends anddevelopments in the financial sector in the region, focusing on potential implications on themacroeconomic equilibrium and financial stability of each economy. The theme of theConference is relevant to both the current and the future developments. From the internationalperspective, it seems that the overall situation is increasingly more supportive. Advancedeconomies, together with large emerging economies are in a phase of full recovery, underpinnedmainly by the boost in aggregate demand. Interestingly, the euro area, which includes most ofour trading partners, is experiencing an overall positive momentum concerning economic growth,and forecasts are optimistic.There is a broad consensus that the economies of the South East Europe region, in the first halfof 2017, registered a satisfactory performance in terms of recovery; in the meantime, accordingto key indicators, such performance is expected to strengthen further in the third quarter of thisyear. Albania is no exception to the regional context.In the previous quarter, the economic and financial situation in Albania was set on a path ofconstant improvement. Growth and employment indicators followed an upward curve andexpectations for 2018 remain positive. Consumption and foreign investments have contributedpositively to economic activity and are expected to generate further increase in productivity andcompetitiveness. At the same time, income from the export of goods, and especially of servicescontributed to the reduction of the current deficit and the strengthening of the external position ofthe economy. The effects of the monetary policy have maintained the stimulating trend, aiming atclosing the negative gaps of prices and output.Financial stability is also characterised by a positive situation. The notable decline in non-performing loans in the balance sheet of the banking system is the most prominent achievement 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
in this aspect. The measures taken in mid-2016 have produced a substantial effect, materialisedin the reduction of non-performing loans by around 10 percentage points, below the maximumlevel registered in 2015. It is always a pleasure to note that credit growth has been positive. Inparticular, the lek credit has grown rapidly, compared to the foreign currency credit, which makesthe banking system and the private sector healthier, and enhances the effectiveness of Bank ofAlbania’s monetary policy. Positive developments in the banking sector and the economy havesupported the further improvement of capitalisation, liquidity and profitability indicators. Twomonths from the end of the year, in our assessment, the banking industry in Albania enjoys fullfinancial soundness, against the backdrop of an optimal liquidity and capitalisation situation, a keyprerequisite for financially supporting the economic developments of the country.We have also paid particular attention to legal, institutional, regulatory and supervisorydevelopments, notably the drafting and implementation of the resolution law.Dear participants,This year marked 25 years from the establishment of a two-tier system in Albania, whichstipulates the banking system as the provider of financial and banking services in the economy,and the central bank as the administrator of the monetary policy and regulator and supervisor ofthe banking system. This first step was followed by other steps related to other segments of thefinancial market, such as the securities and capital markets, including the establishment of therelevant supervisory and regulatory institutions.Initiatives in these aspects have promoted a constant expansion of the financial market, in termsof both diverse institutions and number of financial products and trading volumes. Yet, despitethese developments, the financial system remains dominated by the banking system andrelevant developments in it. The last financial stability report of the Bank of Albania states thatbanks account for around 90% of total financial system assets, equivalent to 92% of the GDP,whereas the rest of the financial sector shares only 10% of the financial system total assets.Assessments and studies of the Bank of Albania, as well as comparative studies by third parties,particularly by the International Monetary Fund, show that the financial distribution and expansionin the Albanian financial market is close to the equilibrium, dictated by the Albanian economy andconsumers. Moreover, financial intermediation indicators, as a percentage of the GrossDomestic Product, are at similar levels to those in other countries of the region.The dominance of the banking segment has naturally led to a higher level of concentration offinancial products and services in its favour. More than 80% of resident investments in thefinancial system are in the form of deposits and current accounts in banks. Only little more than12% are in the form of government securities, whereas the rest, around 6.5%, are invested ininvestment or private pension funds, accounting for only 0.1% of total financial system assets.Statistics show that only a small number of companies operate in other segments of the financialsector, and their activity in terms of the Domestic Product or of the financial market remainsinsignificant.Regarding the above, we may logically conclude that the financial market architecture may not beconsidered complete yet. Financial instruments with long-term maturities are rare, whereas theshort-term ones outside the banking system are apathetic and fragmented, in terms of bothproducts and markets. An outcome of such a financial architecture is a kind of added pressureon the banking system, depriving the economy of other financing alternatives, beyond what thebanks offer.This vacuum may not be filled with strained efforts by the banking system. It has been broadlyaccepted that each segment of the financial market plays a complementary rather thansubstituting role. I could mention a number of examples to illustrate my point, but for the momentI would rather not, as in the next panels these issues will be discussed in greater detail by other 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
colleagues and academics during the day.Overall, the above elaboration regards investment-related financial institutions and financialinstruments. However, it must be noted that similar problems characterise the other extreme ofthe financial market, the corporate – or enterprises sector – as we call it in Albania. Bank ofAlbania surveys show that micro units face shortage of financial resources and have limitedaccess to credit. Thus, more than 1/3 of respondent enterprises consider the low level of accessto finance and the cost related to it as the main cause for not expanding the activity. These microunits, which are basically family-run businesses, have a greater need to cooperate with non-bankfinancial institutions, due to difficulties they have in fulfilling the requirements for collateral ordetailed financial documentation, criteria that banks require. This is another argument that leadsto the logical conclusion that, in addition to own capital and bank credit, these enterprises wouldbenefit greatly from other segments of the financial market.The low level of financial inclusion of the population is another element that prevents thedeepening and expansion of the financial market in Albania. Latest data from the WorldDevelopment Indicators show that only 38% of adults have an account with a financial institution,while only 6% and 22% of adults have a credit card and a debit card, respectively. Financialinclusion may not be increased only through the banking system. The financial system,especially the capital market and the corporate securities market should play a significant role inincreasing financial inclusion.I take this opportunity to emphasise that, in addition to the need for expanding and deepening thefinancial market, it is necessary to increasingly pay attention to the management of risk thataccompanies any financial investment. We are witnesses of a rapid technological evolution,which has practically eliminated physical boundaries, has eased access to electronic investmentplatforms, and has rendered very difficult the supervision and regulation of many innovativefinancial instruments that are traded in these platforms. The phenomenon of informality coupledwith the speed of innovation in the field of financial instruments are a real risk for every investorthat is naively driven by profit and does not stop to analyse the magnitude and nature of risk towhich he is exposed. Anyhow, inclusion should take place carefully, relying on specialisedfinancial intermediaries and auxiliaries, whose activity is regulated and supervised by a legitimateauthority in Albania or abroad.Dear participants,The depth and expansion of the financial markets determines the set of financial instrumentseligible for trading, in a broad spectrum from the maturity perspective. These instruments arenothing more than consecutive steps in the monetary policy decisions pass-through mechanism.The whole process of instrument trading serves to determine the value of assets, the price ofrisk and savings, and, eventually, the propensity toward consumption, savings or investments. Inthis sense, the existence, completeness, and effectiveness of the financial market play asignificant role in the monetary policy pass-through. This is the reason why the central bankplaces its focus on these markets and on their proper functioning.Based on these specific reasons, the Bank of Albania has initiated, time ago, a series of actionsfor creating a more dynamic financial market. The macro-prudential measures taken with regardto liquidity and capitalisation; limitations placed on positions with non-resident banks, provisionsand collateral; and the package of measures for reducing non-performing loans are steps toremedy problems related to the shallowness and narrowness of the market, the low financialinclusion, and the inadequate financial education.Studies and analyses of the Bank of Albania support the logical conclusion that the developmentof the financial market is an important factor for boosting economic activity and enhancingwelfare in general. At the Bank of Albania, we believe that the current structure of the bankingmarket promotes competition in relation to banking products and services. However, the further 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
expansion and deepening of the market is a present challenge for all the relevant actors involved.The banking industry, the Bank of Albania, other segments of the financial market as both asactors and as regulators, the government, the academia and experts of the field, should be allinvolved in this effort. Our ambitions should aim at having a dynamic and liquid financial market,with upward trading volumes, and a widening spectrum of instruments, including a prolongationof maturity horizons and prudent risk management. This framework should be accompanied byadded transparency in all the phases of trading, with financial education assuming a specialplace. Only in this way would we be able to deepen and expand, in real terms, the financialmarket, and through it a higher efficiency in implementing economic and financial policies, inmobilising and using national savings, in financial inclusion, in economic activity growth, and inenhancing the welfare of the population in the long run.In the hope that the proceedings of this conference will be characterised by a fruitful exchange ofideas and views by the participants in this room,Thank you for your attention! 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: The outlook for reform - cementing growth anddelivering sustainable employmentSpeech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Ludwig Erhard Lecture, organised by the Lisbon Council, Brussels, 30 November 2017.*   *   *Accompanying slidesThe solid and broad-based economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. We have nowseen 18 quarters of positive growth and the short-term economic indicators all point to acontinued economic upswing with above-trend growth.The breadth of the expansion is notable. The dispersion of growth rates across both countriesand sectors is at its lowest level for two decades, reflecting a convergence of growth ratesaround higher levels. This is reassuring for the growth outlook because recoveries tend to befirmer and more robust when they are broad-based.Progress in the euro area recovery has been mostly home-grown, with a virtuous cycleincreasingly taking hold between rising income and spending in both the corporate and thehousehold sector. An important driver behind the good performance of domestic demand is thevery favourable financing conditions for firms and households, which are heavily contingent onour policy measures.However, the positive developments also reflect the pay-off from years of balance sheet repair,institution-building – at both national and Union level – and structural reforms.In the banking sector, enhanced regulation and supervision have steered the sector towardssafer business models and stronger capital profiles. Euro area banks have shored up theircapital positions with average Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) having increased from 7% in2007 to 14.1% at present. Banks have also disposed of non-core assets, reduced their exposureto market risk and generally refocused their activities on more traditional business models.These measures imply that banks are today in a much better position to intermediate betweenthose who save and those who want to invest, thereby supporting the recovery.Banking sector repair has also been helped by structural reforms. A number of euro areacountries have, for instance, enhanced the effectiveness of their insolvency regimes. Incorporate debt restructuring, experience to date shows that an effective insolvency regime iscritical to facilitate the early rescue of viable firms and the speedy exit of non-viable ones. InternalECB analysis has confirmed that EU countries with better insolvency frameworks deleveragefaster and are able to adjust their non-performing loans more rapidly than countries with weakerregimes. In turn, this has been shown to lead to easier financing conditions for companies, tostronger entrepreneurship and to higher productivity.Reforms have generally been stepped up in the euro area. The OECD’s Going for Growth –which identifies and reviews progress on five key priorities in areas including labour, productmarkets, and tax and transfer systems as well as on financial sector reform for all OECDcountries – shows an increase in the reform momentum in most euro area countries since thestart of the crisis. Results from the European Commission’s labour market reforms database(LABREF) show a similar trend. In addition, the Commission has assessed that at least “someprogress” has been made on around two-thirds of the country-specific recommendations issuedbetween 2011 and 2016.Even more important, an increasing number of empirical studies confirm the positive economic1231 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
impact of these reforms. For instance, in Italy the introduction of a new permanent contract in2015 led to a 5% increase in new gross hires. Along similar lines, the Spanish labour marketreform is found to have increased the likelihood of exiting from unemployment to employment,while the direct transition from temporary to permanent positions is also eased by thereform. Meanwhile, evidence based on micro-data for Portuguese firms shows that theliberalisation of product markets has lifted the productivity of downstream industries, even in theshort run. And research has shown that even smaller-scale reforms and in particular those thatcan reduce the fixed costs of firms, such as measures to reduce red tape, can have significantpositive effects.These positive developments should not mask the long-term challenges that the euro area is stillfacing. Our estimate of potential growth has declined substantially over the past two decades – inpart due to the decline in multifactor productivity growth. The public sector debt ratio remainselevated, while our population is ageing. Overall, structural indicators still reveal substantial gaps,both between euro area countries and relative to best performers.This matters not just for welfare and social cohesion within individual countries. It also mattersfor the functioning of Monetary Union. If countries have very different economic structures, theirbusiness cycles will diverge when faced with common shocks: some will return quickly to trendgrowth and full employment, while others will require a longer period of recession for prices andquantities to fully adjust. By contrast, better, mutually compatible economic structures amongcountries support growth on a sustainable basis and produce less dispersion when recessionshit. Reforms which improve economic structures make countries more resilient and the singlemonetary policy more effective.The current economic expansion offers a unique window of opportunity to make further progressin Europe’s reform agenda. During good times, countries can better afford the adjustment costsof reforms and may have more fiscal space available to compensate losers (see OECD, 2012).As Christine Lagarde recently reminded us: “the time to repair the roof is when the sun isshining”.History, alas, suggests that this rarely happens. In good times, reforms tend to face strongopposition, which only breaks down during times of economic demise, either following a longperiod of economic decline or in the wake of a severe crisis. Evidence of crisis-led reforms isplentiful: for instance, not just the Latin American trade reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, but alsothe most recent experience in the euro area goes in this direction.So how can we do things better in future? Structural reforms are nothing new in Europe’s policydebate. They have been discussed since the 1970s, when European growth and employmentstarted to fall behind that of the United States. The substantial step-up in reform momentumduring the crisis has revived this debate along three dimensions: the trade-off between short-term costs and long-run benefits, the distributional incidence of structural reforms, and finally thescope of the reform agenda.First, the trade-off between short-term costs and long-run benefits. The long-run benefits ofreforms are largely undisputed, but the potential short-term costs have increasingly beenhighlighted. Such undesirable effects can materialise through a number of channels. Reformsthat enhance competition can displace workers and capital in the short run. In bad economictimes, there is a risk that these factors of production will not be absorbed by new entrants,thereby aggravating the recession. Reforms that lower wages can depress consumer demand inthe short term if not rapidly offset by employment gains and the prospect of future productivity-related income gains that would materialise in normal times.To ensure that the expansionary effect of reforms dominates in the short run, both thesequencing of reforms and the policy mix matter. As regards sequencing, research has shown45678910 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
that outcomes may be better if product market reforms precede labour market reforms and ifproduct market reforms focus on reducing entry barriers in service sectors with large pent-updemand. As regards the policy mix, if there is fiscal space, IMF research has underscoredthe beneficial effects of carefully designed fiscal packages which can overcompensate for theshort-run cost of reforms.Second, the distributional effects of reforms. That growth is not necessarily distribution-neutralalready drew some attention towards the end of the 1960s. The macroeconomic disruption thatfollowed the oil crisis of the mid-1970s, however, completely overshadowed distributional issues,as research priorities shifted towards macroeconomic stabilisation and structural adjustment ofinefficient economies.Recent experience and research have however shown that growth is actually more difficult toachieve without equity. Moreover, highlighting the benefits of reforms in terms ofmacroeconomic growth is not enough to make them socially acceptable. The distributionalcosts of reforms have triggered heated debates and in some quarters the term “structuralreforms” is even perceived as “toxic”.The feeling that growth in recent years has become less inclusive is borne out by the data.Income inequality in OECD countries stands at a historical high and household disposableincomes across most euro area countries remain below pre-crisis levels, especially for thepoorest members of society. Social transfers continue to play an important role in dampening theeffects of inequality, although they have become less effective since the mid-1990s.In such an environment, we must ensure that the distributional impacts of reforms are notignored. One way to do this in practice is to focus on reforms that entail a double dividend:increasing equity while lifting growth. Examples include measures that facilitate the accumulationof human capital, reduce labour market dualism or abolish product market regulations that stiflecompetition. Back in 2006, the Lisbon Council think tank already flagged the importance ofraising and enhancing human capital in its policy brief “Innovation at Work: The EuropeanHuman Capital Index”. In particular with “routine-biased technological change” increasinglypermeating and transforming the world of work, high-quality education and training systems arevital to ensure that workers can withstand the disruption caused by this change and benefit fromit. Another way to account for the distributional impacts of reforms is – for those reforms thathave unavoidable negative distributional costs – to work out “smart redistribution” packages.Smart redistribution does not necessarily take the form of a fiscal transfer. What laid-off workersmost want is to have a new job. Hence public policies could focus on helping people back intowork, and into jobs where they can develop and refine their skills.Finally, the third dimension relates to the scope of the reform agenda. Structural reforms shouldnot be limited to product and labour market reforms. Strong institutions and a well-functioningfinancial sector at national and euro area level are necessary conditions to ensure that theimpact of other reforms actually materialises. Our reform agenda should be sufficiently broadand tackle the binding constraints in the economy. This requires country-specific and country-tailored solutions which allow each Member State to find and exploit their comparativeadvantages in the Single Market. But it does not mean that countries can reform independentlyof each other.Indeed, to ensure convergence, countries do not necessarily need to have the same economicstructures, but they do need to ensure that their economic structures foster resilience andcontribute to a more homogeneous transmission of common shocks. For example, if one set ofcountries focuses mainly on reforms to make wages adjust more quickly in response to shocks,and another on reforms to produce adjustment through employment, the first group will recovermore quickly than the second. Research has shown that countries will only converge in their101112131415161718192021 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
response to shocks if they have a broadly similar mix of labour market institutions – or to put itanother way, broadly similar Phillips curves. Encouragingly, this research finds that changes inlabour market institutions since the creation of the single currency have actually contributed to amore homogeneous transmission of common shocks. However, the dispersion could still beconsiderably reduced.From a euro area perspective, it is thus vital to ensure sufficient resilience and convergenceamong countries so that all can benefit from Monetary Union, but not so much as to interfere withnational social choices.So this brings me to the question: what role can European institutions play in ensuring resilienceand convergence among euro area countries? While the responsibility for structural reform hasso far primarily been at national level, European institutions have a strong coordinating role toplay.However, relying merely on rules and coordination to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes maynot always be sufficient. In some areas, such as banking sector policy, moving from a system ofrules and guidelines for national economic policymaking to a system of further sovereignty-sharing within common institutions has been highly beneficial for the Union and its MemberStates.Over recent years a quantum leap forward has been taken by moving from decentralised bankingsupervision and resolution to the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single ResolutionMechanism, based on the single rulebook. These steps have created the conditions for deep anddurable financial integration. It remains essential to complete the banking union in all itsdimensions. To underpin confidence in a durable way in the area-wide financial system, bothsupervisory responsibility and the fiscal backstop need to be at European level. Just asnecessary is the establishment of a European Deposit Insurance System.Strengthening Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will, over time, require us to make progressin all policy areas. In a monetary union, no policy area can be seen in isolation. Each interactswith and affects the others. After years of reform efforts, there is an increasing risk that fatigue issetting in: both “reform fatigue” and “integration fatigue” may increasingly reduce the willingnessto fix the flaws in the design of EMU. This reluctance may be further intensified by the currentgood economic times, which reduce the sense of urgency. This is why it is so important toresolutely pursue the debate on completing our Economic and Monetary Union.To conclude, the euro area is currently in a broad-based and solid expansion. While monetarypolicy still plays an important role in sustaining the recovery, it is not “the only game in town”.Years of balance sheet repair, institution-building – at both national and supranational level – andstructural reforms are all supporting the recovery. However, let us not yet declare victory and“bask in the warmth of the recovery”: more needs to be done to lift growth on a sustained basisand to reduce the euro area’s vulnerability to shocks. Looking ahead, well-crafted reforms thatcombine growth with equity and take account of the macroeconomic backdrop will be pivotal,both at national and European level.

All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 Good afternoon.  Welcome to the Bank of England’s Future Forum to everyone here in beautiful St George’s Hall, and to those viewing on our webcast.   My colleagues and I are delighted to be here in Merseyside.  It’s been three decades since I first visited. Back then, I discovered my favourite band the Lightning Seeds, who would later pen England’s football anthem.   We’ll learn next year whether the Three Lions can end what’s become fifty years of hurt. 1987 was the Life of Riley for local football.  Everton and Liverpool were top of the tables, with the Toffees beating the Reds to win the Championship – sadly their most recent of their 9 titles.   How things change.  It’s not pure and simple all the time. Just like footballing fortunes, economic conditions in Liverpool have waxed and waned.  The  de-industrialisation of the 1970s and 80s affected the region particularly badly, with unemployment ultimately rising to above 20%.  With the 1990s came revival and regeneration, with particular emphasis on the city’s rich cultural and economic history – a heritage rightly celebrated when city centre riverfront was designated a World Heritage Site in 2004 and when Liverpool became European Capital for Culture in 2008.   In the decade that followed that honour, the UK has been through a searing financial crisis and a recovery that has been even slower than that following the Great Depression.  Once the financial system was fixed, however, the UK became, until recently, the fastest growing economy in the G7.  Unemployment nationwide has fallen from 8.5% to 4.3%, a 42-year low.  In Liverpool, the unemployment rate has declined steadily to 4.7% today, around 2 percentage points below its pre-crisis rate.  The recovery here is being aided by further regeneration, both economic and physical – building the infrastructure that will enable businesses and households to flourish.  These efforts are building on past successes, with Liverpool now home to many award-winning museums including the Museum of Liverpool, the International Slavery Museum, and Tate Liverpool.   Liverpool Council is working in partnership with businesses and other organisations to exploit the best of what each can bring.  For example, Liverpool Council, Liverpool FC and Your Housing Group are working together to bring new vibrancy to the Anfield area.  I personally heard last night about some of the great work that Everton in the Community are doing to tackle problems like homelessness and boost educational attainment.  And the club of course has ambitious plans for a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock.  Liverpool’s Science Park provides office space alongside commercial labs, right at the heart of the city’s Knowledge Quarter. 
All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 We’re here today to discuss with you what causes changes in the economy, how they affect people and businesses in Merseyside and across the country and the Bank of England’s role in supporting jobs and growth. The economy matters for everyone and people want to understand it better.  Three quarters think there should be better education about the economy and half want a better understanding themselves but virtually no-one – just 1 in 10 – think public figures talk about economics in an accessible way. Today, we are trying to bridge that gap.  We are helping to make discussions of the economy more accessible and are launching practical tools that can be used to help educate students, and indeed everyone, about the economy. This is all part of a wider effort to improve our communications.  We are doing this to make the Bank more open and accountable.  Quite simply, people need to understand our actions and their effects in order to hold us to account.  Doing so will also make our policies more effective.   Let me give you an example.  Our mission was originally set out in 1694 in the Bank’s founding charter. That was to ‘promote the publick Good’ – although that sentiment was contained within a 700 word sentence, hardly clear and transparent communication.  And in practice at the time what it meant was raising money to carry on a war against France.   Today, our mission is still to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom, but now we do that by maintaining monetary and financial stability.  Let me explain what that means. Maintaining monetary stability means two things.  First, providing banknotes that you can use and trust.  We have over 3 billion notes currently in use, and they are used in 44% of all transactions.  Second, it means maintaining low and stable inflation.   Maintaining financial stability means three things.  First, making sure that when you put your money in a bank it is safe.  Second, it means that if a bank fails, the costs fall on the bank’s investors and senior management, not ordinary people with deposits in banks.  And finally it means making sure that if you take out an insurance contract, it will pay out if whatever you are insuring against happens.  The work that the Bank does in all of these areas can ultimately be summed up very simply:  we maintain confidence in money.  This confidence is not, though an end in itself;  it is a means to an end.  Confidence in money provides the foundations for prosperity.  Without it, companies would struggle to provide the goods and services we all use every day;  you would face difficulties in knowing how to invest for your futures, be it financing studies or buying a house.  Maintaining this confidence is the best contribution the Bank of England can make to the good of the people of the United Kingdom. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   Building public understanding of what the Bank does – by engaging with people directly– is essential to our work.   That’s because our policies work better if our objectives are clear and the British people have confidence that we will do the right thing whatever happens. Improving understanding of the Bank’s role is also part of being accountable to the people we serve.  The Bank is at the heart of the UK economy.  The responsibilities Parliament has given us are wide-ranging and the decisions we take affect everyone in the country.  People deserve the information and tools to judge how well we are doing our job and to know that we are listening to your views. Today’s event is also part of a wider effort by the Bank to move beyond traditional modes of communication to speak more directly to the people we serve.  While three hundred thousand people read the Financial Times, there are 30 million Facebook users in the UK.  And while everyone knows it is good to talk, the Bank is learning how it can also be good to Tweet – our Twitter account has 227,000 followers, though that still leaves us a little behind Wayne Rooney’s 16.7 million.   We are revamping our publications to make them more accessible, using icons and graphics to convey our messages on webpages designed for mobiles and tablets, rather than relying only on pages of words on paper.  You can take a look at our first example of this – the November Inflation Report –online, at www.inflationreport.co.uk. This afternoon’s event will showcase a selection of the materials we are planning to run alongside these changes in our communications to help explain to people about the Bank’s work. To bring that to life, the first session will kick off with three of my colleagues – Ben, Sam and Jon –explaining to you what the Bank is doing on some topical issues, things that are influencing the Bank’s policies and the role we play in the economy right now.  The questions they will answer are:  Why did the Bank change interest rates earlier this month?  What we are doing to keep banks safe?;  and   What are we doing in response to the vote to leave the EU to ensure the Brexit process is as smooth as possible? Through our dialogue with you today, we will enrich our understanding of how we can meet our objective more effectively, and we hope you will gain a better understanding of what the Bank does and how it is going about it.

   1         “From 1 to 17?” Lecture Frank Elderson at UNEP Finance Initiative (FI) Positive Impact Finance Amsterdam, 23 November 2017   If you would take a closer look at all the things done, perhaps we can be a bit more critical. So far, most of our climate-risk related work is focused on climate-related risks. We’ve looked at how the energy transition could impact the economy, we’ve looked at how the financial sector is at risk from climate change and the energy transition. But being critical, from our supervisory mandate we’re mostly just focusing on climate risks. But isn’t climate just one of the SDGs? Aren’t there 16 other SDGs? And couldn’t each of these SDGs have physical or transition risks for our economy and therefore for our financial sector?   The Principles and the Manifesto pose serious questions for serious times. Questions that we also ask ourselves and that we struggle to answer.   ----   Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to DNB.  It’s a pleasure for us to host UNEP Finance Initiative (FI) today and its work on Positive Impact Finance. As many of you know, DNB has been quite active on the topic of sustainable finance. Hosting a third party event however is not something we very often do. The main reason is that Positive Impact Finance is unambiguously ambitious and we recognize some of that trait in our own character.  Challenges… Our societies are facing tremendous challenges, and are facing a lot of them at the same time. In terms of our climate; our world is now already more than one degree warmer than it was before the industrial era. For one thing, this has caused the amount and the severity of storms and floods to increase, worldwide often with deadly result, as we have seen far too often this year.   But climate is just one challenge: Nearly 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water. 700 million people are living under the poverty line of almost 2 dollars a day. And in Sub-Saharan Africa, four in five people are undernourished and 45% of children die before they are 5 years old because of malnutrition.   The good news is that we have international agreements targeting these issues. We have the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreements. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if just like a multinational, the world would have a clear strategy?   Well, not only does the world have such a strategy, we, increasingly, see many governments, business and investors taking steps to pursue it and to tackle these challenges.   
   2  But we also need to be realistic: we are a long way from achieving the goals. Let’s take a look at China for example. Sure, it’s the green energy and green finance power house of today. It’s the world’s leading producer of solar and wind power, and it’s the largest green bond market in the world.  But it also uses and produces 50% of all the coal burnt globally. It’s responsible for 25% percent of all daily energy consumption. And CO2 emissions are rising worldwide again, mostly because of China. So the challenges remain.  Funding the transition And what’s more all of these challenges have a financing element. For climate for example, it is estimated that an additional 1.5 trillion dollars are needed annually to finance the required investments. And for all of the SDGs combined, an estimated 5-7 trillion dollars are needed annually until 2030.   As the UNEP FI Manifesto rightly states, all of the current initiatives together, however impressive, will most likely not be enough to finance the SDG investment gap. And so, what is needed, according to the Manifesto, is a financial sector that jointly considers the three pillars of sustainable development: economic, environmental and social.   And that any investment should deliver a positive contribution to one of these pillars, once any potential negative impacts to the other pillars have been identified and mitigated.   Eric Usher – and we are very proud to welcome him here on our premises - will explain the thinking behind UNEP FI’s conclusion that in their assessment a transition to a new finance paradigm is required. That’s right, ladies and gentleman, a new paradigm no less! Talking about ambition…   Getting to a financial sector that bases itself on an appraisal of both positive and negative impacts will not be easy, I’m afraid. In fact, it´ll be hard. And if it were to be done, it would require courage, practice and perseverance. And there will probably be moments where you might simply think: this is in fact impossible; there is simply no way to achieve this, so why am I even hurting my brain over this?   Dutch initiatives Well, should that be the case, please allow me to share two considerations with you that might make your struggle more bearable.   One: I’d dare to say, somewhat chauvinistically, that The Netherlands is among the frontrunners in the world in terms of incorporating sustainability considerations in finance.   Many of our financial institutions assess ESG factors in their investment decisions. Based on a survey we recently conducted, 17 out 28 surveyed financial institutions measure the carbon footprint of at least a part of their balance sheet. And 9 of those have even committed to lowering that carbon footprint. Furthermore, our banks have collectively issued a climate statement, an SDG-dialogue document, and an international covenant on human rights in project finance. They are key players in the Equator Principles, in carbon disclosure and divestment initiatives. Many of our insurers and pension funds, bring up ESG-issues in investor calls, and have ESG-engagement strategies. And three out of the top 10 of most sustainable companies worldwide according to the Canadian Investment advisor Corporate Knights are Dutch.   In short, the Dutch are rather active indeed on this issue and we’ve already in fact come quite far. And we’re probably a lot further than where people thought we would be 5 or 10 years ago.  So, whenever you feel the challenge is insurmountable, just think back to where we stood 10 or, if you go through a moment of particular pessimism, 20 years ago, and where we stand today. Hopefully the realization of how far we’ve progressed already, will give you enough energy to keep going.        
   3  DNB initiatives The second consideration - because I promised you two - is that you are not alone in facing this challenge. Of course, there are all the signatories to the principles of this manifesto. But actually, your central bank and supervisor faces a similar challenge.   You see, DNB, as I’m sure many of you know, has been quite active on the topic of climate risks: both on physical risks stemming from climate change, as well as on transition risks, stemming from legislation or market developments.   About 2 years ago, we issued a report called Time for Transition. In this report we investigated the potential impact of the energy transition on the Dutch economy, and we noted that the upcoming transition is in fact one of the biggest medium to long term challenges to our economy and therefore for our financial sector.   And a few weeks ago we published a report called Waterproof?, in which we took a closer look at climate risks in the Dutch financial sector. In this report, we concluded that in both a 1.5 degrees and 3.5 degrees scenario, climate-related damages are expected to go up due to an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. This means that insurance premiums may have to go up and that insurers may need to hold more capital, as they hold capital for severe events. We also found that models currently being used by insurers to predict damages do not adequately take climate change trends into account.   In terms of the energy transition, we warned of risks stemming from new sustainability legislation for offices. The Dutch government requires office buildings to have a minimum energy label of C as of 2023. This means that all office buildings that don’t meet this requirement now, have five years to reach the required level, or their cash flows will dry up. Our financial sector finances large chunks of the real estate sector. When cash flows dry up, that will jeopardize the value of these loans.  So how big is the problem? We found that on average 46% of bank loans to commercial real estate parties, has an energy label of less than C, representing some 6 bn euros. These loans run serious risks the coming years, and banks need to manage this risk. In doing so, by the way, they will discover, indeed they of course already have, that there are also ample and sound business opportunities to help their clients meet these legislative deadlines, thus creating a win win situation for business and climate.  But that’s not all. As a follow up to this work, we are right now developing both physical and transition related stress tests. And we hope to present the results of the physical stress test in the coming few months.   We’ve also done some work on the broader question of sustainable finance. About a year ago we published a report on responsible investing in the pension sector. This was based on a requirement in Dutch law for pension funds to be transparent as to whether and how pension funds take ESG factors into account. We assessed whether indeed all pension funds included their ESG investment policy in their annual report, and we shared the good practices that we saw.   Last but not least, using our convening power, we’ve founded a national Platform for Sustainable Finance, which brings together our government, supervisors and industry representatives from the entire financial sector. The aim of this platform is to promote and encourage a dialogue on sustainable finance in the financial sector. In addition, the Platform also allows for financial institutions to form cross-sectoral working groups to tackle existing problems. One of these working groups, called the Platform Carbon Accounting Financials, or PCAF, has developed a methodology on how to measure the carbon footprint of six different asset classes. They will launch this report soon.   Another working group has worked on SDG Impact Measurement. It developed, and recently launched its report, and I’m very proud that they’re here.  So we’ve been quite active as you can see. And as a central bank and prudential supervisor, we’re actually rather proud of all the work we’ve done. And we’d even dare to say that we are among the frontrunners in Europe and perhaps even worldwide.    
   4  A critical look at all initiatives… But if you take a closer look at the things we’ve done, perhaps we can also be a bit more critical. So far, most of our work is focused on climate-related risks. We’ve looked at how the energy transition could impact the economy, we’ve looked at how the financial sector is at risk from climate change and the energy transition.   So if we’re a bit critical, from our supervisory mandate we’re mostly just focusing on climate risks. But isn’t climate just one of the SDGs? Aren’t there 16 other SDGs? And couldn’t each of these SDGs have physical or transition risks for our economy and therefore for our financial sector?   Let’s take a look for example at SDG #15, Life on Land. Every year we gain 3.5 billion hectares of desert. And every year we lose 13 million hectares of forest. Biodiversity is also declining at an alarming pace. A recent study done in Germany showed that the average insect population has declines with 75% in the last 30 years.   If governments don’t take action to stop the loss of biodiversity, this might for example one day lead to crop failures. And this might not happen slowly, but could perhaps be caused when we reach certain tipping points. If that were to happen, obviously, one of our basic human needs would be jeopardized. But from a financial point of view, agricultural companies might face difficulties, and that might impact banks financing the agriculture sector. And so it might not be too far reaching a thought that is would seem important for such a bank to be aware of potential risks from biodiversity loss.   Or what about SDG #12, sustainable consumption and production? About making sure that we use all natural resources in a sustainable way? What if governments introduce legislation to ensure sustainable use of resources? Unsustainable companies would be relatively hard hit, and their profitability could be at risk. And thus, the financial sector that invested in them through stocks, bonds and loans.    Move from 1 to 17? In short shouldn’t we move our work on sustainability from 1 to 17 SDGs? Couldn’t there be more risks than just climate? Need these risks not be managed? Should the prudential supervisor not broaden its focus?  And what about impact? Couldn’t we do research into access to finance? Into potential bottlenecks for financing the SDGs? Couldn’t DNB have anything to say about striving for impact towards achieving the SDGs? Would that bring us to the fringes of our mandate? Or possibly beyond? The answer is not yet clear.  Fortunately, this is exactly what we will look into in 2018. How do the SDGs fit in our mandate? It won’t be easy for us. We don’t have an exact answer. It’s pioneering. It’s challenging. It’s a struggle. But it’s one we’re happy to undertake.   Even doing this, however, we’ll probably still fall short of the new paradigm advocated in the Manifesto. Because we would most likely be looking at each of the SDGs separately and assess to what extent they pose risks for the financial sector (both in terms of “physical” and in terms of “transition” risks). To the extent they do, we would squarely be within our mandate. But I know Eric will call for a more far reaching approach. Moving from risk to impact, and looking to all SDG’s holistically.    So we have a lot of work to do. A lot of thinking to do, a lot of pioneering to do.   The Principles and the Manifesto pose serious questions for serious times. Questions that we also ask ourselves and that we struggle to answer. So whenever you’re feeling like the task ahead of you is insurmountable, perhaps you will find comfort from the fact that your supervisor is struggling just as much as you are.   But we’re all struggling in the right direction.  
Page 1 of 10      LEVERAGING BETTER OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC SUCCESS  ADDRESS BY DR MARIO VELLA GOVERNOR, CENTRAL BANK OF MALTA DELIVERED DURING THE IFS MALTA ANNUAL DINNER  01 DECEMBER 2017  Dear President and Members of the Committee of the Institute of Financial Services (IFS) Malta, distinguished guests, personally and on behalf of the Board of the Central Bank of Malta, I thank you for this annual traditional opportunity to address this distinguished audience and, through it, all stakeholders.  Also my personal and institutional welcome to the representatives of overseas professional bodies who are with us tonight, the London Institute of Banking and Finance, the Global Association of Risk Professionals, and the European Banking and Financial Services Training Association.  You evidently hold IFS Malta in high esteem.  So do we. Mr President, we are pleased to hear about the many initiatives being undertaken in the area of financial services education and commend the Institute for its ongoing commitment to the professional development and up-skilling of financial services practitioners.  This is definitely a positive contribution to the sustainability of our dynamic sector, and one we commit ourselves to support effectively.  The Central Bank of Malta is a long-standing partner of the Institute.  Rest assured that we will continue to offer our support wherever possible. Tonight’s event has become an important date in the calendar of key stakeholders in our country’s economy, particularly but not only in the financial services sector.  This dinner, in fact, provides us with an opportunity to meet together and discuss what went well, and 
Page 2 of 10 what went less well, in our economy in a less formal environment than that usually associated with discussions on economic and financial developments. Traditionally, the Central Bank avails itself, through its Governor, of the opportunity of this occasion to give an extensive panoramic review of Malta’s economic performance, of what in our view drove these results, outline the challenges ahead and conclude with policy recommendations.  This year we will depart from this tradition. While we will start with an overview of this year’s developments and discuss briefly the outlook for 2018, we will use this as a basis for a broader, more thematic, discussion.  In recent years, definitely since the European sovereign debt crisis, we have increasingly come to realise that whilst we are a very open economy dependent on foreign trade and investment, our economy has shown a degree of resilience and adaptability that has defied expectations, surprised foreign institutions and, indeed, ourselves too.  All forecasters including the International Monetary Fund, European Commission, European Central Bank and the credit rating agencies, as well as the Central Bank of Malta, were proven to have been conservative.  One could argue that the comment on GDP projections is a bit unfair in as much as the December 2015 projections would have been based on the information available at that time.  Since those projections were made, historical data would have been revised.  The forecasters would not have known about these subsequent revisions.  Nevertheless the results were certainly better than expected.  Let me give you a couple of examples.  In December 2015 the Central Bank projected real GDP growth for 2017 at 3.2%.  Two years after, we believe economic growth has reached 6%, or nearly double what we had originally projected.  Back in December 2015 we had anticipated 2017’s unemployment rate as 5.4%.  Now we know it will be closer to 4%, or a quarter less. More striking is the divergence in fiscal projections.  Back in December 2015 we thought Government would close 2017 with a deficit of 1.1% of GDP.  Today we believe there will be a surplus of 0.9%.  Two years ago we thought our national debt-to-GDP ratio would be 64% of GDP in 2017. Now we think it will be nearly ten percentage points less than that.   
Page 3 of 10 Malta’s current economic performance  Two weeks ago, in the concluding statement following their annual official staff visit to Malta, the IMF said that “Malta’s economic growth remains one of the strongest in Europe” and projected that this robust performance will continue on the back of rising incomes and historically-low unemployment, complemented by buoyant services exports.  They also concluded that Malta will remain a surplus economy, both in terms of government finances and external transactions. This is, broadly speaking, the same assessment as that made by the European Commission in their Autumn 2017 forecasts.  In fact, the Commission’s experts are forecasting that this year and over the next two, Malta will have the highest current account surplus as a percentage of GDP of all euro area countries, “beating” countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.  Whereas, going forward, growth is expected to moderate somewhat, Malta will continue to out-perform significantly the euro area.  The Commission’s Autumn 2017 Forecasts put us at the head of the league table both in terms of real GDP growth and employment increases.  Though there are downside risks stemming from more inward-looking policies abroad and an uncertain external environment, including the impact of Brexit on the continent’s economy, domestic demand in Malta should continue to grow at a fast rate, particularly as wage growth will boost disposable income while investment is expected to remain sustained.  In last year’s speech I described what we believe are the conditions leading to this performance.  Part of our success is attributable to cyclical factors, such as the effects of the ECB’s monetary policy actions to stimulate the euro area economy.  Accommodative monetary policy is boosting aggregate demand, locally and in our trading partners, and lowering the external value of the euro, which helps our exporters.  We also noted how strong government investment, partly financed by EU funds, is helping the Maltese economy.  However in last year’s speech we emphasised that most of our current economic growth is attributable to structural changes, which have contributed to more than double our potential growth rate since the global financial crisis.  On the one hand, this was due to a significant improvement in our labour supply, both in terms of quantity and quality.  Part of this is related to inflows of foreign workers, but our success in raising female participation 
Page 4 of 10 and improving financial incentives to work has played a key role.  On the other, we have also radically transformed our energy sector, through the linking of our system with the European grid bolstered by investment in new power plants.  The divergence between our growth and that observed in the rest of the euro area is also due to the different performance of our respective financial sectors.  Malta’s financial system has proven to be more stable than that of neighbouring countries.  Our core domestic banks have remained sound with strong capital ratios, high liquidity and healthy profits.  Asset quality has continued to improve, while banks remained prudent, boosting provisions.  We believe that besides being a testament to the prudence of our local banking community, these results are also due to the actions of regulatory authorities.   How to address some of the challenges of our economic success Rapid economic growth, such as that which Malta is currently experiencing, brings about its own challenges.  Opinion surveys confirm how the Maltese have shifted from worrying about the cost of living and economic uncertainty to being concerned about the environment and traffic congestion.  This shift is also evident at the level of policymakers.  In fact policy documents, such as the 2018 Pre-Budget Document and the Budget for 2018, have stressed the need to upgrade infrastructure and enhance environmental protection.  Similarly, international institutions have emphasised the need to shift attention towards sustaining growth and making it more inclusive.  Going back to the latest IMF Article IV mission, their recommendations focus on addressing housing market pressures, closing the infrastructure gap, upskilling and reskilling the labour force and strengthening innovation. We would like to discuss some of these challenges, before outlining how we think that our financial sector can play a role in helping to tackle them.  The housing market In last year’s speech, we touched upon the need to avoid the formation of asset price bubbles.  We quoted Central Bank research indicating that house prices were still below their equilibrium fundamental value, but warned that price trends would nevertheless continue to be closely monitored.  House prices, as you know, have continued to rise. 
Page 5 of 10 National statistics data suggest an increase of 5.3% during the first half of this year, as against 6.1% in the same period of 2016 and 3.2% in 2015.  That said, housing supply is responding to the high demand that is contributing towards house price inflation. In the first seven months of 2017 building permits were 62% higher than they were in the same period of 2016 and 153% higher than in 2015.  This increased supply, unless there is a further acceleration in demand, should result in housing price inflation moderating. This should also help to reduce pressure on the rental market, where there is evidence that from being at the lower end of cross-country rent-to-wage ratios, we have moved relatively quickly to being close to ratios found in the most expensive European cities. Besides the impact that this rise could have on our capacity to attract foreign workers, we need to consider its impact on Maltese tenants, which in turn will impact on the broader costs of doing business and, consequently, competitiveness. We believe that, going forward, if we continue to grow at the rates observed in recent years, we will need to have a much more dynamic housing market.  But before discussing private provision, let us discuss social housing. Recent developments have reinforced the case for replenishing our social housing stock.  However, this expansion needs to be accompanied by a change in approach.  In recent years, most of Malta’s benefit system has been changed so as to create clear incentives to shift from benefit dependence to participation in the formal labour market.  The only area where this is not happening yet is social housing, where the tendency remains that, once allocated, social housing tends to become a lifetime entitlement.  We need to change this so that social housing schemes act to activate individuals and empower them rather than encourage passivity.  Such a transition could itself be helpful in financing the expansion of social housing. Instead of seeing social housing as a passive benefit, we can eventually develop projects which become to an extent self-financing, through a combination of social housing provision and programmes to enhance the employability of individuals, enabling them to eventually pay market rents.  The financial sector could play a role here.  We have already seen how some banks have partnered with government to offer social loans, which are beginning to decrease reliance on the social housing stock.  Going forward, we can see the possibility of other innovative initiatives where the Housing Authority partners with financial institutions to develop social housing projects. 
Page 6 of 10 At this point, I take this opportunity to inform you that the Central Bank of Malta has set up a lean but highly competent and proactive Social Research Unit to study amongst other issues, access to credit by the lower income groups. Another area where we need to register progress is home equity release.  We have a situation where many elderly persons are asset rich but cash poor.  They live on relatively modest pensions, while residing in large and relatively expensive homes.  This creates issues for financing long-term care, as many find it difficult to sell their homes outright in order to go into a private home.  If, over the coming years, we manage to come up with ways of releasing part of the equity in homes, this could raise the supply of available housing, reduce the pressure on state long-term care institutions and hospitals while guaranteeing better living standards for our elderly.  This, of course, needs to be done carefully, sensitively and in a well-regulated environment.  Once again, we believe that financial institutions can have a key role to play here.  The rental market is another area where we believe we need to act, with due consideration of the trade-offs involved.  Any measures that are too restrictive could take us back to a previous situation where the rental market was utterly dysfunctional.  On the other hand, we should not shy away from reforms that facilitate a better functioning of the market.  We need more legal clarity about the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.  We also need to have this market operate in the formal economy, with rent contracts duly registered. Stabilising this sector will be beneficial to our economy’s competitiveness, whilst also helping to address social inequalities.  Although loan-to-value (LTVs) ratios range from 60% to 90% (and lately we have observed a shift to the upper bound) the banks have largely kept to their cautious approach when extending credit for buy-to-let purposes.  We think that their prudence bears witness to the maturity of our financial institutions, though more caution in mortgage credit for secondary residences is called for.  The need for long-term investment Let’s now shift to a more critical gear.  At present, financial institutions deposit with the Central Bank close to four times the average of the previous ten years. In essence, all the growth this year in deposits from Maltese residents has ended up being deposited with us 
Page 7 of 10 at the Central Bank.  Loans to the private sector have essentially remained flat.  Taking a longer term perspective, bank lending to nonfinancial corporations has fallen from 62% of GDP in 2009 to 31% in the first half of this year.  From a situation where credit to the nonfinancial sector amounted to more than half of all bank loans, the share has fallen to slightly more than a third.  Now, the usual explanation is that banks welcome any feasible projects that comes forward, and that the decline is therefore demand and not supply driven.  Moreover, stricter regulation on bank capital and liquidity has made life tougher for bankers, and this, it is argued, has warrants a higher level of caution regarding which projects are financed.  Permit me, however, to submit some other facts for your consideration.  The recent IMF mission concluded that the cost of bank borrowing for corporates in Malta is among the highest in the euro area, and the spread has been widening in recent years.  In their forthcoming report in January 2018 they will furthermore show that credit supply constraints impact SMEs disproportionately.  While surveys do not suggest that access to finance is the private sector’s main concern, this is probably due to the fact that firms have been able to finance projects through their own funds.  Over the last decade, companies shifted to intragroup loans and intercompany lending instead of bank loans as a main source of financing.  One, of course, needs to distinguish between intragroup loans (parent to subsidiaries or subsidiaries to other subsidiaries) which we think make up the bulk of “intercompany” lending and other intercompany lending undertaken through factoring, trade credit and loan funds. Also bear in mind that the Financial Institutions Act related companies (within a group) do not need a licence to lend to each other.  To give loans outside the group (intercompany) one does need a licence. While it is beneficial to see a diversification of firms’ financing sources, this change raises some issues. Let us start with something we discussed last year.  We need to be careful that in the current low interest environment, investors’ search for yield does not stimulate excessive risk-taking.  Therefore, we need to complement the rise in corporate bond issuance with a significant effort in improving investors’ education and compel corporates 
Page 8 of 10 borrowing from the domestic capital market to provide more information to investors about their creditworthiness.  Secondly, even if we believe that the recent disintermediation process was a matter of choice, reflecting firms’ current liquidity, this nevertheless begs the question as to what would happen when the economy slows down and internal funds diminish.  We believe that if the disintermediation process goes too far, our resilience to future shocks could be hampered.  Whenever activity slows down, firms will tend to cut back on investment and innovation.  Moreover as a Central Bank, we have to be concerned that in such an environment, the transmission of monetary policy, which mainly occurs through the banking channel, could be impaired.  This would make it harder for policymakers to react to economic needs. The current situation, with a lot of savings lying unutilised at the Central Bank, seems to me to be a wasted opportunity to leverage our current success in order to build a better future.  At a time when everybody agrees that we need to invest strongly in infrastructure and to upgrade the competences of our workforce – both of which are long-term investments –, it is painful to note that we opt instead to pile our savings in what is essentially the most short-term of investments: deposits with the Central Bank.  The fact that, despite overall excess liquidity, some smaller banks continue to borrow from us through regular monetary operations, is an indication that the domestic interbank market still faces some structural inefficiencies.  A more efficient financial system would facilitate the allocation of capital to its most productive uses.  This would boost capital stock and total factor productivity and, hence, sustainable economic growth going forward. I believe that the setting up of the Malta Development Bank should help increase the availability of finance to the real economy, while also supporting long-term investment projects.  This bank is going to fill in an institutional gap in our financial sector, which recent developments have made ever more evident.  In a banking sector, which remains relatively well profitable, compared to their European peers, despite the decline in lending to nonfinancial corporations, we need an institution that can help create an environment where banks feel comfortable to extend credit to innovative firms, namely firms that may 
Page 9 of 10 not be able to provide adequate collateral due to the nature of their business, but which are still good business opportunities.  Besides the Development Bank, there are other policy measures that should help facilitate the flow of credit.  At the Central Bank we will continue to evolve our credit register to provide more information to banks and help reduce credit risk.  More broadly we will continue supporting government in its attempts to reduce excessive bureaucracy and further improve the insolvency process.  We will also continue to take macroprudential measures to ensure timely policy interventions to safeguard the stability of the financial system.  The struggle against bureaucracy is a key element in the broader effort to improve the ease of doing business in this country. We are pleased to note that the World Bank Ease of Doing Business team is finally making serious efforts to understand our national specificities.  The Central Bank urges and supports Government’s ongoing efforts to take the Ease of Doing Business conditions to a new level.  Of course, it would be unforgivable of me not to seize this opportunity to urge the consultancy community to ensure that the information we provide to international competitiveness ranking agencies is up to date and factually correct. I also take this opportunity to observe that in 2018, Malta will undergo a comprehensive and detailed analysis of its financial sector through a Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) conducted by the International Monetary Fund.  At the same time, Malta will be evaluated against international standards on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) by MONEYVAL as part of the Council of Europe’s peer review process.  We are eagerly looking forward to both. Our economy has managed to outperform because we managed to evolve and diversify rapidly.  I believe that our financial services and banking sector needs to mirror this, to continuously evolve and adapt to the changing economy. After the success of recent years, we are now in an excellent position to solidify our gains.  This requires us all to focus our glance further into the future, and to devote a greater share of current economic prosperity towards financing more long-term projects.

It is a pleasure to be giving it in the newest part of King’s College London and in my position as a visiting professor here at King’s. And I’m delighted it’s the 25th Strand Group event, showing how this flagship series of policy relevant events has already become well established.   One of the key differences between my old and my new role is the level of accountability. As Chief Economic Advisor to HM Treasury for the past 10 years, as would be expected under the civil service code, I was generally responsible for giving evidence-based advice to ministers who were ultimately accountable for their decisions to parliament and the public. That is very different in my new role in which I am directly accountable to parliament and public for decisions taken as a member of the MPC, Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC). I also have a direct set of prescribed responsibilities under the Bank’s application to itself of the Senior Managers Regime – a framework developed to improve accountability at the top of financial services firms.   As a key part of that accountability, over the coming years I look forward to giving many talks and speeches such as this one to set out the thinking behind decisions and their delivery across the full range of my and the Bank’s responsibilities. The Bank has quite rightly placed emphasis on the role of communication as a policy tool in its Vision 2020 strategy; describing our work to as diverse a range of people as possible.  Of course I start this new role at an interesting point in time. It is nearly 17 months since the UK voted to leave the EU, and just over 16 months until that decision takes effect in March 2019. In the period since the referendum we have learned that while Brexit was at one level a binary decision, there are many potential outcomes, and paths to those outcomes. Perhaps reflecting this multidimensionality, uncertainty about Brexit seems to be increasing rather than diminishing over time (Slide 1). In the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel Survey (which is run jointly with Nottingham University), the share of firms who placed Brexit among the top sources of uncertainty rose from 35% in a survey taken in September 2016 to 40% in August this year. While those who say it is not an important source of uncertainty fell from 23% to 13% over the same period.  Brexit has an important bearing on the Bank’s pursuit of monetary and financial stability, and it is taking steps to help ensure the necessary adjustment is as smooth as it can be. The Prudential Regulation Authority is engaging proactively and intensively with banks and insurers to ensure their plans are robust to the full range of potential outcomes. The FPC is focussed on its statutory responsibility of identifying and monitoring and taking action to reduce risks. The MPC’s focus has been on balancing the trade-off, as required by its remit, between the speed at which inflation returns to target, and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity during the adjustment process. In the Markets and Banking areas of the Bank, for which I have direct responsibility, we are undertaking a series of initiatives which, although not directly related to Brexit, 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   will help ensure stability, improve effectiveness and enable innovation in key parts of the UK’s financial system through this period of challenges and opportunities.   It is the work of the MPC and of the Markets and Banking areas that I would like to focus on today. In particular the role they play in ‘end to end’ monetary policy, which for the purposes of this lecture I will split into three phases: Define, Decide, and Deliver. Respectively, they refer to the clear specification of the objectives of monetary stability; the setting of policy appropriately to meet those objectives; and the implementation of monetary policy through the Bank’s operations in financial markets.   Define  Let me start with Define. The Bank’s responsibility for monetary stability dates back to at least the Bank Charter Act of 1844 when it was given a monopoly on issuing notes in England and Wales. In the intervening period the Bank’s monetary policy objective has taken many different forms that have varied in their degree of formality, clarity and success – including the gold standard, membership of Bretton Woods, monetary targets and the Exchange Rate Mechanism.   For much of that period, the Bank’s monetary stability aims lacked definition. As the Governor has recently noted1, this changed with the Bank of England Act of 1998 which clarified – for the first time in three centuries – the Bank’s responsibilities. The ‘end’ for monetary policy was defined as maintaining price stability (specified in subsequent Remits as the pursuit of a symmetric 2% CPI inflation target) and, subject to that, supporting the economic policy of the government including its objectives for growth and employment. The means for getting there is the independent setting of monetary policy by the MPC. This represented a major step forward for the clarity, accountability and efficiency of monetary policy, as assessed by the 2013 review of the monetary policy framework by the Treasury.  By de-politicising the short run trade-off between inflation and activity, this arrangement has provided the grounds for the most successful monetary policy regime for the UK thus far. The MPC’s flexible inflation-targeting framework was further strengthened by the 2013 Treasury Review and the following Remit update which effectively ‘completed the contract’ by further specifying the relationship between the MPC’s primary objective for price stability, and its secondary objective to support jobs and growth. Though, having overseen the 2013 Review, I must declare an interest in judging its contribution.  Since then, the Remit has explicitly acknowledged that, in exceptional circumstances shocks to the economy may be particularly large or the effects of shocks may persist over an extended period. In such a period the                                                       1 Carney M (2017), remarks given at a conference to mark 20 years of the MPC’s operational independence, notes that Governor Eddie George once remarked that in the half century that followed the Bank’s nationalisation in 1946 it “operated under legislation which, remarkably did not attempt to define our objectives or functions.” 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   MPC must balance the trade-off between the speed with which inflation is brought back to the target and the consideration that should be placed on the variability of jobs and economic activity.   Of course we didn’t have Brexit in mind when updating the Remit in 2013, nevertheless the Bank headed into the EU referendum last year with arguably the most clearly defined objective for monetary policy in its 323 year history. And it has been the foundation of the framework the MPC has used to set monetary policy since the referendum result. Although I only joined the Committee in September, the analytical approach in the framework is one that I fully sign up to. So I would like to spend a minute setting it out.    Fundamental to the way in which the MPC has reacted to Brexit is that monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary adjustment – such as that implied by the movement of the exchange rate - as the UK moves towards its new international trading arrangements, or the weaker income growth that is likely to accompany it. These are real phenomena likely to play out over many years – exactly the kind of thing that monetary policy cannot affect, no matter how often it is asked by some commentators to do so.   What the MPC can do is support the economy during the adjustment process. But even in doing that the Committee has faced a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other. I would note this is something the Committee was able to anticipate before the referendum, the minutes of the MPC’s May 2016 meeting stating that “[t]he implications for the direction of monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects.” And my colleague Ben Broadbent has recently set out in more detail what this means in the particular context of Brexit.  True to this statement, the MPC has set monetary policy since the referendum on the basis of its assessment of how those effects are interacting. This is made difficult by the large, uncertain and sometimes offsetting implications of the decision to leave the EU. So it is not surprising that even though all Committee members sign up to the framework I have laid out, their individual assessment of the economic outlook has differed along the way.   Decide  Which brings me to the second phase of ‘end to end’ monetary policy: Decide. In the MPC’s meeting at the start of this month, a majority of its members thought that the evolution of supply and demand was such that the margin of slack in the economy now seemed fairly limited, and that underlying inflationary pressures had shown some signs of picking up. As a result, they judged that this reduced the degree to which it was appropriate for the MPC to tolerate an extended period of above-target inflation, and that a small reduction in stimulus was warranted. Notwithstanding this 25bp increase, Bank Rate remains close to its lowest rate its 323 year history (Slide 2).  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   I wasn’t in that majority. That was not because I disagree with the overall framework for setting monetary policy in this exceptional period, but rather because I have a somewhat different assessment of the economy.   By way of framing my own decision, let me give a few comparisons to how things might have turned out in the absence of Brexit, for which I will use the MPC’s May 2016 forecast as a proxy (Slide 3). GDP growth in the year to 2017 Q2 (the latest quarter for which we have a full set of both expenditure and labour market data and the latest data available at the time of the November MPC decision) was 0.8pp weaker than the MPC’s May 2016 forecast, within which business investment growth was a full 5.2pp lower. Despite the weakness in output, employment and hours have actually been stronger than expected, meaning productivity growth per hour was been 2.2pp weaker in the year to 2017Q2. Nominal wage growth was 1.5pp weaker than in the pre-Brexit forecast, which, coupled with the effects of the depreciation on inflation, meant real wage growth was 2.6pp weaker.   So, how does this nexus of data fit into my assessment of the economy? Let me start with demand, which is arguably the most straightforward to explain. Although the economy confounded the initial expectations embodied in usually-reliable surveys taken immediately after the referendum – which implied that growth was headed for negative territory - there is no doubt that demand has now slowed.   This can primarily be accounted for by a sharp slowdown in consumption growth, from 3.1% as recently as the middle of 2016 to 1.5% in the year to 2017Q2, the weakest four quarter growth since 2012. The primary driver of this weakness has been the weakness in real income, itself reflecting the 18% depreciation of sterling from its pre-referendum peak as financial market participants have reacted to the prospect of Brexit.  Working in the opposite direction, we have witnessed a rotation toward other components of demand. While this is a positive development, it hasn’t been enough to offset an overall slowing in GDP growth.    Business investment has picked up a little to grow at 2.5% in the last year, though this is weaker than the 3.9% growth on average across our G7 counterparts, and the strength of future investment implied by capital goods orders in the US and euro area (Slide 4). In addition to the Decision Maker Panel survey and findings of the the Bank’s own Agents, a range of survey results suggest that Brexit related uncertainty is an important factor weighing on investment in the UK despite otherwise favourable conditions for capital expenditure (Slide 5).    Relative to other components of demand, exports have benefited from sterling’s depreciation and stronger than expected global demand. At the same time and not withstanding their role in increasingly integrated global value chains, growth in imports has been sluggish, meaning that net trade has provided support to GDP growth.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   Taking all of these together leads me to conclude that, although the resilience of growth in the wake of the referendum has been welcome, the broad channels through which we would have expected demand to adjust to a vote to leave the EU are now operating. As a result, GDP growth has slowed from average quarterly rates of 0.7% in 2014 and 2015 to 0.4% more recently. For those of you who, like me, have had to assess and categorise past UK slowdowns as either U- or V-shaped, I consider what we are witnessing as more of a saucer-shaped slowdown and pretty unusual for that (Slide 6). Given the long horizon over which the effects of Brexit could play out, we are likely to be on the flat part of the saucer for some time – as embodied in the MPC’s forecast for GDP growth which remains at 0.4% per quarter over the 3-year forecast horizon, conditional on households and companies basing their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to new trading arrangements.  If realised, that will leave the economy about 2% smaller by 2020 than the May 2016 MPC forecast would have implied. And that growth shortfall is in spite of the fact that global growth has strengthened more than expected in the May 2016 MPC forecast.  The biggest risk I see to that outlook for demand is around the resolution of the current uncertainty about our eventual trading arrangements and the path that will be followed to reach them. Were that uncertainty to be lifted, I can see a case for why UK whole economy demand could grow more strongly, more in line with, for example, recent manufacturing indicators. Equally, were uncertainty to persist at current levels or even increase further, I could see a case for demand growth, and in particular investment growth, being weaker.   The reaction of the supply side of the economy since the referendum is more open to interpretation and given the uncertainties is something informed people can have divergent views on. The combination of weak investment, strong growth in employment, weak wage growth and low productivity growth (Slide 7) lends itself to two potential explanations – and they are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive. In either case the sign of the response of key variables is the same, making it difficult to pick between them, but the implications for the outlook for spare capacity and inflation differ.  The first is that since the referendum there has already been a material hit to the supply side of the economy in the form of a reduction in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), which is the efficiency with which companies put their labour and capital inputs to use. This would reduce output per worker, and hence real wages. It would also reduce future profitability, thus deterring investment. A reduction in TFP would have a lasting effect on productivity and hence the supply side of the economy, reducing the rate at which it can grow without generating above-target inflation.   Like most economists I expect Brexit to have a negative impact on TFP for a variety of reasons, including the need to reallocate resources toward supplying new customers or new products, and the general effect of 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   reduced openness2. But these are effects that, like the effects of capital deepening on productivity, will tend to either build over the long run or only really take hold after our trading arrangements have changed. So, while they can be expected to have a material impact on productivity by the end of the MPC’s forecast horizon, I’m not convinced they can fully account for the additional weakness in productivity we have already seen. It shrank by 0.2% in the year following the referendum compared to growth of 0.5% on average in the preceding seven years.   A second potential explanation for how the supply side data have evolved is that since the referendum workers have responded to uncertainties about the outlook by showing even more flexibility in their wage demands. People’s willingness to accept lower real wages would encourage firms to hoard labour, and shift away from capital expenditure toward more labour input for a given unit of output. Such a further increase in labour market flexibility would imply that part of the recent renewed weakness in productivity growth is cyclical, meaning there is a bit more room for the economy to grow without generating above-target inflation in the medium term.  I attach some weight to the idea that workers have responded to the changing outlook by showing greater flexibility in their wage demands. This would be consistent with a trend I have observed throughout my career and in successive cycles in which peaks and troughs in unemployment have been lower in each cycle since the 1980s. Since the crisis, real wage flexibility has been particularly notable, and it may have intensified further since the referendum as the unemployment rate has fallen further to 4.3%. As supporting evidence I would point to the fact that the weakness in private sector real wage growth relative to the MPC’s May 2016 forecast has been greater than would be required just to match the weakness in productivity growth3, and that is in spite of the additional pressure on real income growth from higher import prices over the same period4. This may also be working alongside the level of uncertainty to encourage firms to meet output growth using labour rather than undertaking capital expenditure projects.  At the margin, the idea that workers are responding to Brexit by showing increased flexibility could mean that there is more room than headline measures of slack suggest for the economy to grow without generating above-target inflation in the medium term (Slide 8). Certainly, it would help explain why, despite unemployment being at its lowest level in 42 years, measures of domestically generated inflationary pressure generally remain below levels that would be consistent with inflation being at target in the medium term. That includes a wide range of measures, including unit wage costs, those derived from the Consumer Price Index, and those based on national accounts measures of value added.  In turn, the subdued nature of domestically generated inflation is evidence that the current elevated level of headline inflation is attributable to pressure arising from the pass through of the depreciation of sterling. In                                                       2 See Broadbent (2017) for a full discussion of these issues 3 Private sector real wage growth, calculated by deflating nominal wage growth by output prices, was 1.8pp weaker in the year to 2017Q2 than expected at the time of the May 2016 forecast, while growth in productivity per head was 0.7pp weaker.  4 For a full discussion of wage growth, see Cunliffe (2017) 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   judging the appropriate balance to be struck when faced with a trade-off between returning inflation sustainably to target and supporting jobs and activity, one must pay close attention to any sign that above target inflation is feeding through to ‘second round’ effects in domestic costs. So far that doesn’t seem to be the case.  In summary, it is difficult to determine precisely why the supply side of the economy has behaved as it has in the period since the referendum. The weakness in real wage growth, and the subdued nature of domestically generated inflation mean I am not yet ready to discount the idea that labour market flexibility is continuing to intensify. If true it would mean there is a little more room than headline measures of slack suggest for the economy to grow without generating above-target inflation in the medium term. For that reason, in our November meeting I was willing to wait for more evidence on the evolution of wage and domestic cost growth before beginning to withdraw some monetary stimulus. So I voted for no change in Bank Rate.   Deliver  Once the decision is made, attention turns to the final phase of ‘end to end’ monetary policy: Deliver. A key part of being Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking is responsibility for delivering much of the Bank’s monetary, and indeed financial stability, operations. That includes: implementing decisions; monitoring market developments; identifying and, where appropriate, addressing risks to resilience and effectiveness.  In many ways the November MPC decision was a historic change in policy – the first increase in Bank Rate in over a decade (Slide 9). I remember the previous increase in Bank Rate well as the July 2007 MPC meeting was the first I attended as the Treasury’s representative. A lot else has happened in the intervening 10 years, but from an operational perspective it was a relatively straightforward change for the Markets area of the Bank to implement. Bank Rate, which is the rate paid on reserve accounts held at the Bank by 183 financial institutions, was changed immediately after the MPC’s decision and used as the basis for calculating interest due for that day.   Because reserves held at the central bank are the ultimate liquid and risk-free asset in any currency, the rate paid on them serves as the reference point for all other overnight interest rates in the money market. As a result a range of key overnight market rates increased on the day of the MPC’s decision including the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA, a key benchmark for unsecured overnight borrowing and lending) and the Repurchase Overnight Index Average (RONIA, a key benchmark for overnight borrowing and lending secured against gilt collateral). In the period since the change in Bank Rate, both SONIA and RONIA have been on average 25bps higher than in the month preceding the decision (Slide 10).  But effective delivery extends well beyond mechanically changing parameters within our systems. The Bank’s operations in money, gilt, corporate bond and foreign exchange markets, its operation of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)  system, all supported by its comprehensive financial and operational risk 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   management framework, afford it a unique insight into the workings of the financial system. Markets and Banking staff are thus able to advise members of the MPC, FPC and PRC about key developments in monetary and financial conditions.   Our operations also leave us well placed to assess the resilience and effectiveness of markets and the infrastructure that underpin them. The Bank has always stood ready to use its convening powers or, where necessary, intervene directly in order to help ensure the smooth functioning of core sterling markets. But this has been given new impetus in recent years as initiatives such as the Open Forum and the Fair and Effective Markets Review made clear that the Bank considers scanning the horizon for emerging vulnerabilities as important as stepping in when risks have crystallised.   Working to monitor and improve resilience and effectiveness is something I consider to be a core part of delivering not only monetary, but also financial stability. And I believe the Bank’s work in this area will play an important role in ensuring the UK has a resilient, effective and innovative financial system as it leaves the EU. There are two ongoing initiatives to enhance financial infrastructure that I would like to draw attention to today. Both demonstrate the Bank’s willingness to define ourselves in terms of best practice of governance and transparency, and our ongoing commitment to working closely with end users of this infrastructure.   The first is the reform of the SONIA overnight interest rate benchmark. In April next year the Bank will take on end-to-end administration of this key market benchmark, which is also a critical input to the MPC and FPC’s assessment of conditions in sterling money markets. The key outcome of the reforms will be to improve the sustainability and representativeness of this piece of infrastructure by using a broader dataset covering both brokered and bilateral  transactions, collected as part of the Bank’s Sterling Money Market data collection.   Following the implementation of SONIA reforms the Bank will publish an assessment of its compliance with IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, alongside an external assurance report. Consistent with those principles, a SONIA Oversight Committee comprising of a mix of Bank and independent members will provide scrutiny on all aspects of the benchmark.  A more robust SONIA provides markets with a credible alternative to sterling Libor as a key reference rate and benchmark. Indeed SONIA has recently been confirmed as the market’s preferred alternative rate by the Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group. That is a necessary step in ending the current over-reliance on Libor.  Developing alternatives to Libor and similar benchmarks and encouraging their use has been a key priority of the international financial community since the Financial Stability Board, chaired by the Governor, published its report on interest rate benchmark reform in 2014. But the importance of this work has grown as it has become apparent that transactions underlying Libor are at best scarce. Resulting concerns about the 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   medium-term sustainability of Libor, set out in a speech by Andrew Bailey in the summer, highlight the need for a transition away from Libor to alternative benchmarks.5   As we move to the next phase of benchmark reform work – a broad-based transition to SONIA – it is clear that active engagement will be needed from participants across all relevant sectors and markets. As a result, the Bank and FCA are currently finalising plans to broaden the mandate and membership of the Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group.  The second ongoing initiative I would like to draw attention to is the renewal of RTGS - which is the means by which central bank reserves are transferred between banks big and small, and settles around £600bn of transactions per day. The world of payments is one which has undergone many changes in its long history – from the idea in the 1770s that a single central location (the Five Bells Tavern once of Lombard Street) should be nominated as a meeting point at which at which to settle obligations to the launch in 1996 of real time gross settlement in the UK. We are currently living through another period of innovation, as FinTech has enabled payments to be decoupled from traditional banking services.   The aim of the RTGS renewal programme is to deliver a more resilient, flexible and innovative sterling settlement system, and by doing so we will help ensure the UK remains a world-leader in payment systems. As well as providing a strong underpinning for monetary stability, RTGS will promote competition and strengthen financial stability. The programme will run over a period of years, but some key features have already been delivered including the opening up of access to RTGS to non-bank payment providers, who have been able to apply for accounts RTGS since July.   One particularly noteworthy milestone was reached last Monday, when the Bank began to provide the direct delivery of the High Value Payment System, CHAPS, the workings of which are shown in this Vision 2020 style graphic (Slide 11). This brought to an end the split of responsibilities between CHAPS Co, the private sector administrator of the scheme, and the Bank, which provides the underlying infrastructure in the form of the overall RTGS system. Although this split had its merits historically, the changing scale, nature and sophistication of cyber and other threats to the stability of payment systems mean there is a compelling financial stability case for being able to provide end-to-end risk management within one organisation.   In recent months the Bank has worked closely with the shareholders, users, management and staff of CHAPS Co to bring about a smooth and orderly transition and avoid any disruption to the service provided. On Monday last week, former CHAPS Co staff took their new seats in the Bank of England, and by 7am more than 22,000 transactions had been completed on the Bank’s infrastructure with a value of £11bn. In the first week, approximately 862,000 transactions were completed, with a value of £1.5trn, including wholesale                                                       5 Bailey (2017)

In short, it was business as usual for banks and their customers.  Like our administration of SONIA the combined RTGS and CHAPS service will benefit from best practice governance arrangements, including a new Board which will meet for the first time in December, chaired by me and with four independent members recruited through a competitive process. We will also continue to benefit from the voice of CHAPS users, through the establishment of a new Strategic Advisory Forum for senior industry representatives.   Conclusion  Let me recap on how I see end to end monetary policy. The well-defined objectives of monetary policy have provided a strong foundation on which the MPC can base its decisions over the course of the crucial period up to and beyond the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.  But to be successful, monetary, and indeed financial stability, policy must be effectively delivered. That requires the efficient implementation of decisions. And it requires stable and effective core sterling markets and payments infrastructure.   The Bank has a long history of outstanding execution of decisions, of scanning the horizon for emerging vulnerabilities in markets, and of using its position to address them. In keeping with this history, these are things I will prioritise in my term as Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking.  Beyond Define, Decide, Deliver, there is of course ‘Describe’. Improving our communications internally and externally is a key priority of the Bank’s Vision 2020 strategy, because better communication will support our mission to deliver monetary and financial stability. A new focus of our communications is on schools. We started last week in Merseyside and over the next year Bank staff are visiting 200 schools covering 9% of the pupil population. But engaging with traditional stakeholders remains important, on which note let me take some of your questions.

Andreas Dombret: To count or not to count – the future of internalmodels in banking regulationSpeech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank,at the EBA Policy Research Workshop &quot;The future role of quantitative models in financialregulation&quot;, London, 28 November 2017.*   *   *1. IntroductionLadies and gentlemenDear Andrea EnriaThank you for the invitation and your kind introduction. After I accepted to give the keynote at thisrisk modelling conference, a colleague shared with me an unflattering comparison of financialrisk modellers with weather forecasters. He asked: Why do you think weather forecasters likefinancial risk modellers so much? His answer: Because the only kind of storm less well predictedthan hurricanes and tornadoes are financial storms.In my keynote today, I will frame this conference in a more positive tone, as I see a lot of merit infinancial risk modelling – and in weather forecasting, too, for that matter.Yet during and after the financial crisis we witnessed severe instances of risk model failure –where internal calculations of many banks grossly underestimated actual risks. Remember forexample the systematic underestimation of a market freeze or a price bubble before the sub-prime crisis broke. The many unexpected lawsuits pointed to further blind spots – all of whichsuddenly led to capital cushions melting away.However, focusing on these failures alone misses the fact that, overall, financial risk modellinghas improved risk measurement substantially. It has inspired us to reconsider the role and theliberties of internal modelling.And this is partly why you are at today’s EBA workshop – to improve internal models. Youragenda includes challenging topics. My aim is far more modest. In my statement this morning Iwill take stock of risk modelling and the “lessons learned” from the financial crisis. I will highlightboth the limitations and the strengths of internal modelling. Second, I will present generalprinciples that should guide future work. And, third, I will outline my take on where current andfuture EU projects on internal models should be heading.2. Financial crisis, regulatory reform and internal modelsBut first, let’s take a step back. Fifteen years ago, internal risk models were considered the goldstandard for optimising capital allocation. What made them so successful was the efficient useof capital and their high risk sensitivity – which was made possible by granting banks substantialfreedom in using their internal models for regulatory capital calculation. Even though Basel IIlimited the freedom of banks by setting several parameters for the internal ratings-based (IRB)approaches, IRB banks had substantial room for manoeuvre when calculating their capital ratios.This made internal risk models prone to abuse. But those who pointed to these shortcomings, orjust to their unrealistic assumptions, have frequently been called unscientific and opposed toinnovation.Then the financial crisis erupted, changing almost everything in finance. Models played their partin contributing to the turmoil. Risk modelling moved from panacea to placebo or even steroid. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Individual calculations of many banks were not crisis-proof, as their assumptions were way toooptimistic. In fact, some models even fostered herding behaviour.In 2010, the Basel Committee decided to take a closer look at the root problems of internalmodels. The core question was whether differences in capital ratios of banks were due todifferences in portfolios or due to illegitimate differences in modelling practices. In three studieswe assessed the risk-weighting of banking and trading book assets. Material variances inregulatory capital ratios were found. Only a part of these could be explained by differences of riskprofiles. But another substantial part of the variation arose not from differences in the riskiness ofbank portfolios, but instead from other factors that are due to modelling problems – for example,some banks gamed model weaknesses, and some of the terms specified by supervisors provedto be problematic.One of the main reasons for these unwarranted differences is that models were even applied toportfolios where the statistical presumptions are violated. For example, in low default portfoliosyou simply do not have enough historical cases of default to calculate a reliable credit defaultfigure. Another prominent example is that extreme events, meaning crises, occur more often inreal life than the distribution of most models assumes.But there is an even bigger threat when applying modelling techniques. The big mistake is tobelieve that financial risk models can ever be fully accurate or even close to it. The point isfundamental, yet simple: risk models have fundamental limits that can never be fully remedied –which is why strong regulatory boundaries and supervisory controls are indispensable.To make my point, I have to get a bit philosophical. There are two types of limits, and let us turnto a great economist to define their nature. In 1921, Frank Knight differentiated between risk anduncertainty.Uncertainty describes the unexpected events. The first limit of models is that they cannot captureuncertainty. Uncertainty is fundamental, because we do not know what the future will bring – it ishardly manageable. It is quite substantial when it comes to financial risk modelling. That’sbecause financial risk modelling is a social science. The models can only provide a simplifiedheuristic of real social interaction, but it is impossible to fully grasp the complexity.The second limit of models concerns how Knight defined risk. Risk is what we can somehowmanage, thanks to the law of large numbers, with a margin of error. Risk is what we can model.Yet, even in this comfort zone of risk models some limitations exist: real events can only beforecasted, like weather, but cannot be predicted – data as well as methods face naturallimitations.All in all, this means: Modelling is probably as scientific as it can get in banking regulation.However, models can never get a calculation fully right. To limit mis-measurement, we have todeal with risk and uncertainty:First, close gaps in the regulation of risk measurement. This includes data limitations: wecan only model where sufficient data are available. Defaults in sovereign bonds, for example,clearly do not fulfil this condition.Second, work is needed on methodological shortcomings: we have to insist on robustnesschecks and need to limit the degrees of freedom for financial institutions, for example withregard to assumptions about distributions.Third, one has to accept Knightian uncertainty and protect regulation against it – humanbehaviour changes, irrational exuberance prevails, extreme events like herding behaviourrepeat themselves, and market actors will always test the limits of models. We cannotmodel these challenges away. That’s why we need backstops. Models need checks andbalances, since a sole focus on model-based capital minimisation would be dangerous for1 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
financial stability.3. Benefits of internal modelsSo, internal risk modelling for regulatory purposes clearly has its weaknesses. Nevertheless, Iam convinced that the benefits very much outweigh the drawbacks.The first advantage of risk models doesn’t sound very encouraging, but it is nevertheless quiteimportant. Their strength is that they get it less false than any other approach we have. For aslong as we work on the approach of risk-based regulation, we have to somehow quantify risks;and there is no way we can do without educated guessing. Any minimum capital requirement weimpose on institutions requires more or less uncertain assumptions about the riskiness involved.This holds true not only for internal models, but also for standardised approaches to risks. Eventhe rather conservative regulatory risk weights of standardised approaches may result in over-optimistic capital charges – just look at sovereign bonds. Moreover, institutions usingstandardised approaches can engage in “risk shifting” – that is the search for the most profitable,but also the most risky assets among equal risk weights.Thus, even if we banned models entirely from regulation, we would still end up with a vulnerableway to measure risk. Risk models are the better imperfect options.The second strength of models actually is their variation. For not all of the variability of internalmodels is necessarily undesired. There may be good reasons for divergent capital requirementsbased on similar credit portfolios, for instance because of dissimilar effectiveness of riskmanagement in banks or given a different legal environment in which banks are operating. Also,model variability reduces the risk of herding behaviour, which would arise if every bank were touse the same standardised approach.The third – and in my view most important – strength of risk models is their high degree of risksensitivity. For each type and each category, capital requirements calculated by an institution’sown models is typically a lot more in line with historically observed risk. And this, in turn, haspositive consequences. For example, it incentivises risk-adequate behaviour in financialinstitutions in general. From a supervisory point of view, we are especially interested in theadditional incentives it offers to banks to develop and maintain a thorough risk assessmentapproach – which also supports and strengthens the internal risk management.4. To count or not to count: internal models after regulatory reformSo far I have reminded us why internal model-based capital calculation – despite its weaknesses– remains a worthwhile regulatory tool. Accordingly, the post-crisis regulatory agenda still buildson the principle of risk-based regulation and still encourages the use of internal modellingtechniques. The Basel Committee has decided to remove only one internal approach in itsentirety – the Advanced Measurement Approach for operational risk, AMA for short. Apart fromthat, models still play an important role in the Basel III finalisation package. And as I havementioned, there are good reasons for that.  Yet, moving forward, we need to incorporate the “lessons learned” into regulation and intosupervisory processes.We have done this by installing additional constraints and backstops to close gaps that internalmodels cannot close – most prominently the leverage ratio and the output floor. Furthersafeguards are implemented by more rigorous methods, data rules and input floors. This meansthat regulation has become multi-polar – supervisors rely on various, complementaryrequirements. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
But at the same time there is also a need to support the benefits of internal models. On the BaselCommittee, the German representatives resolutely argued in favour of maintaining risk sensitivityin regulation, because this is the best way to capture the actual risks of a financial institution andto set the right incentives, thereby discouraging excessive risk-taking. This especially concernsthe subject of calibrating the output floor, which is – as most of you know – a limit to internalmodel calculations based on the standardised approaches. With the advantages of internalmodelling in mind, this topic is understandable. And for me, the current state of negotiations – anoutput floor of 72.5 per cent – is too high; but it is still enough for models to remain an attractivetool. While risk sensitivity will be diminished by setting the output floor at this level, it stillrepresents a far better outcome than the originally envisioned output floor of 80 per cent.Basel III is better than its critics claim: While some countries may gold-plate their nationalregulations through a ban of internal models – the new standard also enables the Basel countriesto continue the use of internal models. And this is an important outcome.5. You can count on that: better models for the futureNow we have to look ahead. We should take the Basel III reforms and implement them in amanner that improves risk models further.Banks have to build better models, models that not only focus on the efficient use of capital butalso ensure that a bank can weather future storms. Both goals must weigh equally, meaning thatthe storm-forecasting part has to be given much more attention.Authorities like the SSM and EBA on the other hand will have to roll up their sleeves and build aregulatory and supervisory framework for the future of risk measurement.This will be challenging not only for the sheer technical complexity, but also because we have tostrike two balances at once:The first balance is to maintain the incentives for fine-tuned risk measurement andmanagement on the one hand, while improving the checks and balances on risk models onthe other.When pursuing this balance, we obviously have to do this on EU level. In that context, weneed to strike the second balance: in order to guarantee the same high standards in theentire SSM, we have to achieve EU- and SSM-wide harmonisation on the one hand; on theother hand, however, we should not go too far, meaning that we cannot achieve anexhaustive list for each and any model decision. While we need harmonisation of definitionsand supervisory procedures – in order to close relevant gaps – supervisory agencies shouldnot be condemned to taking a box-ticking approach. Since every model is different, the box-ticking approach would only undermine a critical review of a bank’s model.I believe it to be important that we keep these balances in mind when we come to design newrules or redesign old ones.Let me now outline the priorities for future work on improving internal models in the EU from theBundesbank’s point of view.With regard to credit risk and the boundaries for the IRB approaches, it’s important that weimplement the Basel III compromise in a rigorous way. This means that input and output floorswill prevent the internal calculations of regulatory capital requirements from going too low. But atthe same time, it maintains the internal modelling approach and, with that, substantial freedomsfor banks to calculate regulatory capital.Another important point concerns credit risks, but also other risk type models. The targetedreview of internal models, the TRIM project, by the SSM should be conducted in a responsible 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
and considered manner – it needs to strike the two balances that I highlighted. This meansspecifically:The biotope of risk modelling approaches must be kept diverse. A right understanding ofharmonisation means not only treating equal things equally, but also treating unequal thingsunequally. TRIM must ensure, that the playing field for banks is levelled, but not create amonoculture of models driven by supervisory rules.Furthermore, it means that we have to balance conservativism and precision. Supervisorswill always be tempted to make risk estimates more conservative – which is, of course,prudent. Being too conservative, however will make risk models less attractive for banks touse it not only as a regulatory instrument but also as an effective internal risk managementtool.Finally, changes that we will introduce through the TRIM project must be implemented in areasonable manner. Banks need a transitional period to adopt the new standards.Let me close these policy guidelines with a clear statement: Throughout all regulatory andsupervisory projects to finalise the reform agenda for internal modelling, the Bundesbank willadvocate the retention of risk sensitivity.6. ConclusionLadies and gentlemenYou have a full agenda of challenges in risk modelling ahead of you. Moreover, during the comingyears you hopefully will help to make financial risk models better. My key take-aways for theseone and a half days and your future work are:First, internal models have rightfully lost their sacrosanct status, as they revealed bigweaknesses during the last financial crisis. Models will never be perfect. We always have tobe aware of the underlying assumptions and their shortcomings.Second: after regulatory reform, internal models rightly continue to play a big role, but now acomplementary one. Limits have been set. But we shouldn’t overreact. It is also important tomaintain incentives for banks with regard to a risk-sensitive framework. This is why, on theBasel Committee, German authorities have resolutely argued in favour of sufficientincentives for internal models.Third: on the basis of the limits set by the Basel III reforms, we have to look forward now,and NCAs, EBA and SSM have to set about improving internal models further so that theycan contribute to efficient and stable financial markets – at the service of the real economy.Again, many thanks for inviting me – I wish all of you a fruitful workshop. Thank you for your kindattention.Knight, F. H. (1921) Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. Boston, MA: Hart, Schaffner & Marx; Houghton Mifflin Company.1 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
1  REMARKS BY MR. JAVIER GUZMÁN CALAFELL, DEPUTY GOVERNOR AT THE BANCO DE MÉXICO, AT THE POLICY PANEL ON “REFORMULATING MONETARY POLICY IN EMERGING MARKETS AND THE NEED FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICY COORDINATION”. CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND POLICY CHALLENGES IN EMERGING MARKETS ORGANIZED BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. Antalya, Turkey, December 2, 2017.1 Largely as a result of the difficulties faced following the outburst of the Global Financial Crisis, macroeconomic policy coordination has gained increasing relevance in recent years. This has two dimensions. Domestically, a context characterized by stubbornly low rates of inflation and deflationary risks, anemic economic growth or outright contraction, as well as monetary policies constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates, particularly in the advanced economies, underline the need to jointly activate different policy levers in order to effectively overcome such a situation.2 In a second dimension, the growing and increasingly complex interlinkages in the world economy brought about by the ongoing process of economic and financial globalization have increased the potential for spillovers and boomerang effects of domestic policy measures in the major economies, thus highlighting the importance of coordinating actions at the international level under certain circumstances, for instance, in the presence of global shocks                                                             1 The opinions and views expressed in this document are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily represent the institutional position of the Banco de México or of its Board of Governors as a whole. 2 See Jazbec, Boštjan and Biswajit Banerjee (2017): “Rethinking Monetary-Fiscal Policy Coordination”, Proceedings of a Seminar Jointly Organised by the Bank of Slovenia and the International Monetary Fund. 
2  While the above arguments apply fundamentally to advanced economies, clearly, the importance of an adequate coordination of macroeconomic policies is nowadays more pressing for emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In fact, the challenges resulting from globalization can be even more acute for these countries. It is also worth noting that the policy response in advanced economies to the Global Financial Crisis has sharply increased the volatility of capital flows to EMEs, with episodes of large inflows alternating with bouts of outflows. Simultaneously, the crisis has reduced the global growth potential, fostered anti-globalization sentiment and, in general, substantially increased uncertainty. In light of the above, the following remarks will focus on the domestic dimension of policy coordination in EMEs, including measures beyond the strictly macroeconomic realm. The advantages of a coordinated and balanced approach to policy rest on a number of merits. Among these, it is worth noting the potential to exploit the synergies of multiple policies acting simultaneously.3 In addition, reliance on a multi-pronged strategy reduces the likelihood of an over-burden of policy instruments when these are used in isolation,4 while the possibly adverse effects on the overall performance of the economy arising from the implementation of some policies may be compensated by action in other fronts.                                                              3 See Gaspar, Vitor, Maurice Obstfeld and Ratna Sahay (2016): “Macroeconomic Management When Policy Space Is Constrained: A Comprehensive, Consistent, and Coordinated Approach to Economic Policy”, IMF Staff Discussion Note No. 16/09, September. 4 See Davig, Troy and Refet S. Gürkaynak (2015): “Is Optimal Monetary Policy Always Optimal?”, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Research Working Paper No. 15-05, July. 
3  Seen from the perspective of monetary policy, which are the key areas for coordination that deserve to be underlined? A first one is exchange rate policy. In theory, flexible rate regimes allow countries the implementation of a fully autonomous monetary policy. In addition, they are widely regarded as an efficient mechanism for the adjustment of the economy to external shocks. Nonetheless, as volatile flows of capital across borders have led to acute swings in exchange rates, doubts have emerged as to the degree to which such frameworks isolate economies from developments abroad. In particular, sharp fluctuations of the exchange rate can have significant effects on the real economy, domestic prices and the financial sector, especially in EMEs. Of course, this does not imply that floating rates should be discarded in favor of alternative regimes. Instead, the issue is how to increase the efficiency of floating exchange rates during episodes of disruptive volatility. A frequently noted option is the temporary use of complementary intervention mechanisms to support the adequate functioning of currency markets.5 Fiscal policy is a second crucial area of coordination for monetary policy. The erosion of space following the Global Financial Crisis, in combination with the end of the commodities boom that preceded it, has to a large extent constrained the role of fiscal policy in many emerging market economies. In light of the extant evidence, both theoretical and empirical, suggesting the pernicious effects that weak fiscal positions can have on the overall performance of the economy, for instance through an adverse impact on                                                             5 See Blanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell'Ariccia and Paolo Mauro (2013): “Rethinking Macro Policy II: Getting Granular”, IMF Staff Discussion Note No. 13/03, April. 
4  expected inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate,6 it should not come as a surprise that the typical policy response in these countries has sought to favor the rebuilding of fiscal strength even under conditions of weakness in economic activity.7 In fact, the potentially compensating effects on the latter deriving from the strengthened credibility of the macroeconomic policy framework and the lessened upward pressure on current and expected interest rates further justify this as a sensible course of action. However, the usefulness of fiscal policy measures to counter negative shocks to our economies should not be disregarded, particularly in a context of solidly anchored fiscal accounts. The active implementation of measures directly oriented to the financial sector represent a third fundamental component of a coordinated policy package. In particular, as the experience of the recent and previous episodes demonstrates, a healthy financial system is of paramount importance for the efficient transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy. In fact, failure to set in motion the measures needed to reestablish the well-functioning of the financial sector in case of disruptions would imply a heavy burden on monetary policy. Furthermore, the margins of maneuver for the latter, e.g. the possibility to increase interest rates in the face of inflationary pressures, may be constrained under situations of fragility in the former.                                                              6 See, for instance, Sargent, Thomas, Noah Williams and Tao Zha (2009): “The Conquest of South American Inflation”, Journal of Political Economy Vol. 117(2):211-256, April; Bianchi, Franceso and Cosmin Ilut (2017): “Monetary/Fiscal Policy Mix and Agents’ Beliefs”, Review of Economic Dynamics Vol. 26:113-139, October; and Woodford, Michael (2001): “Fiscal Requirements for Price Stability”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking Vol. 33(3):669-728, August. 7 See Végh, Carlos, Luis Morano, Diego Friedheim and Diego Rojas (2017): “Between a Rock and a Hard Place: The Monetary Policy Dilemma in Latin America and the Caribbean”, World Bank LAC Semiannual Report, October. 
5  On the other hand, the build-up of financial imbalances and vulnerabilities that might ensue following a relaxation of the monetary policy stance, especially if sustained over a prolonged period of time, can effectively be countered by targeted micro- and macroprudential measures. Conversely, situations that require a tighter monetary policy stance, but for which a more nuanced effect on the real economy is desired, may call for a simultaneous relaxation of prudential measures that perk up economic activity via easier lending conditions, provided the health and stability of the financial system remain within safe margins.8 Lastly, although generally operating over a longer-term horizon, structural reform should also be a strategic part of policy coordination in emerging market economies. By providing incentives to improve the overall functioning of domestic input and product markets, increasing their competitiveness and strengthening the institutions within which they operate, policies that overhaul structural aspects of the economy foster efficiency gains that increase its productive potential.  Thus, a successful implementation of structural reform can ultimately result in strengthened buffers in other areas of policy as, for instance, an expanding productive capacity may offset the potentially adverse impact of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies on economic activity; increased competition and efficiency resulting from structural reform alleviate inflationary pressures; and possibly higher fiscal revenues in a context of faster economic growth, both                                                             8 See García-Cicco, Javier, Markus Kirchner, Julio Carrillo, Diego Rodríguez, Fernando Pérez, Rocío Gondo, Carlos Montoro and Roberto Chang (2017): “Financial and Real Shocks and the Effectiveness of Monetary and Macroprudential Policies in Latin American Countries”, BIS Working Paper No. 668, October. 
6  actual and potential, reduce the level of public debt relative to the economy’s GDP. Naturally, the implementation of structural adjustment policies faces a number of challenges and some resistance is likely to arise, mostly as a result of the redistributive effects, both across time and across sectors, inherently imbedded in them. Thus, it will frequently be important to place actions in this realm within the context of a broader-ranging plan that contemplates countering, and coordinated, measures in other fronts. For instance, fiscal and monetary easing may reduce the short-term output costs associated to the economy’s process of adjustment in the aftermath of structural reform, while the enhancement of the social safety net and the enactment of other targeted programs may alleviate the costs of transition.  Let me turn now to Mexico’s experience regarding the role of policy efforts in the above-mentioned areas in overcoming the macroeconomic challenges faced in recent years. Inflationary pressures in Mexico have increased significantly since early 2017, owing to a sharp depreciation of the peso and a number of supply shocks. Thus, the rate of growth of the headline consumer price index rose from 3.36 percent in December 2016 to 6.59 percent in the first half of November of this year. The Banco de México’s response to these developments has been aggressive, as the reference rate has risen by 400 basis points over the course of the two years since December 2015, to a level of 7.0 percent at present.  While the task is not finished yet, the results thus far can be deemed as satisfactory, since inflation is expected to decline sharply in 2018 and long-
7  term inflation expectations have remained stable. Furthermore, macroeconomic stability has been preserved, in the context of a sharp decline in oil prices, stints of uncertainty in international financial markets, the increase in interest rates in the United States, and the results of last year’s electoral process in that country. At the same time, economic activity has shown resilience to shocks thus allowing a moderate rate of growth.  However, it is important to note that the above developments have also benefitted from a balanced recourse to monetary and other policy instruments. In particular: 1. Given the high volatility of the exchange rate, a number of measures have been implemented to ensure adequate conditions of operation in the foreign exchange market. In particular, the Foreign Exchange Commission has introduced a mechanism for the hedging of foreign exchange risks of up to US$20 billion, that does not imply the use of international reserves. This strategy is consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime that plays a key role as a shock absorber, allows market forces to determine the equilibrium real rate, and rests on the premise that the value of the currency is supported mainly by economic fundamentals. 2. Challenges for the implementation of monetary policy in Mexico were compounded, particularly in 2014 and 2015, by concern regarding the country’s fiscal position, in view of the marked increase in public sector’s debt. However, the fiscal authorities have embarked on a consolidation strategy, a policy shift that is yielding a primary surplus and a drop in public sector indebtedness relative to the economy’s output this year 
8  for the first time in a decade. This indicator is, according to the latest projections, expected to continue trending downwards in the foreseeable future. However, it is also true that public finances still face significant challenges over the long term that will need to be addressed in due course. 3. Thanks in large part to the continued efforts undertaken over several decades, which have gathered momentum since the Global Financial Crisis, Mexico’s financial system is profitable, liquid and well-capitalized, and supported by moderate levels of private sector debt, including households, and the absence of evident risks of a systemic nature. Far from representing an obstacle to its implementation, the health of our financial system has proven to be a most valuable asset for Mexico’s monetary policy, as it has allowed an efficient operation of transmission mechanisms, and a sharp increase in interest rates without significant adverse side effects on banks or other financial institutions. 4. Structural reform policies spanning through a wide array of sectors have made important strides over the last few years. Although it may still be too early to draw conclusive assessments of the efforts undertaken, as most of these changes are still in their implementation phase, a number of positive results are already evident. Of particular importance for monetary policy are the beneficial effects that increased competition across a number of key markets, and especially in telecommunications, has had on the evolution of domestic prices, both directly and indirectly. The structural reform of the Mexican economy is a long-term endeavor that will take several years to fully materialize, whose potential is 
9  conditional on its correct implementation, and which needs to be complemented by efforts in other areas. But it is certainly reassuring that the process has, to a significant extent, lived up to the expectations it has generated. All in all, a policy approach encompassing multiple instruments has undoubtedly ameliorated the magnitude of the challenges for monetary policy in Mexico. However, as is natural to expect, it has not fully eradicated them. At the current juncture, the Mexican economy is facing a deceleration of economic activity, a rapid although expected to decline rate of price growth, and a situation of higher-than-usual uncertainty deriving from a number of factors, of both domestic and external origins, with the normalization of monetary policy in the United States, the renegotiation of NAFTA and presidential elections in 2018, among them. In virtue of the potentially opposing implications that the realization of alternative scenarios may have for the conduct of monetary policy, it will be essential to adhere to an approach emphasizing prudence and timely action, and the continued support of policy measures in other areas. 
Digital transformation of the retail payments ecosystem Welcome address by Ignazio Visco Governor of the Bank of Italy at the ECB and Banca d’Italia joint conference, Rome 30 November 2017 I am pleased to welcome all the speakers and participants to this conference on the ongoing digital transformations in the retail payments ecosystem. The programme is remarkable: many key issues for central banks and the private sector will be discussed in these two days. Let me take this opportunity to thank the organizers at both the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank for putting together such a broad and relevant array of topics. The fast evolution of digital technologies promises to deliver benefits but it also creates new challenges for the payment system and its stakeholders. Today’s conference is an opportunity to take stock of recent advances, to evaluate possible future landscapes in retail payments and to discuss the challenges and opportunities they pose to central banks and the population at large. I am sure that maintaining a continuous dialogue among central bankers, private sector representatives and academics on the subjects that will be discussed in this conference will contribute to the efficiency and safety of our payment systems. The diffusion of digital technologies is having pervasive effects on our society. Today, around eighty per cent of the European population has a smartphone, personal computer or tablet to navigate the internet. We use the internet to perform many fundamental activities that influence our behaviour and productivity, such as communicating and searching for information. The rise of e-commerce is also having substantial, and at times disruptive, effects in many industries. Digital innovations, such as big data and artificial intelligence, are used for medical diagnoses, in the transportation sector and to select the news that is reported on social media. The explosive growth of electronic devices controlled through the internet suggests that the “internet-of-things” will play an important role in our daily lives. 
As the youngest, tech-savvy generations approach adulthood, the effects of these phenomena are bound to become even more significant than they are today. The digital transformation of our society has also changed the type of payment instruments we use. Indeed, the more we use digital distribution channels in our consumer expenditures, the more we need digital forms of money to pay for these transactions. But there is also a cultural change behind this process. Credit and debit cards are increasingly used in brick-and-mortar stores, and in some countries banknotes are no longer the most common means of payment. The highly dynamic landscape of payment systems is ever evolving. While new technologies, such as those used for instant payments, are rapidly approaching, newer ones are right behind. Last year we held a conference here at the Bank of Italy on the applications of blockchain technology in the financial markets. What last year still seemed to be a technology in its infancy is now increasingly put to work in use cases. As with all new technologies, it is expected to deliver efficiency gains: according to its proponents, some of these gains will come from easier diffusion of information and have the potential of altering the payment systems landscape. However, the extent of its impact is still uncertain, as many aspects of its practical implementation are yet unknown.  Nevertheless, blockchain technology is getting a great deal of attention from practitioners and the financial markets. Not long ago the stock price of a British company more than tripled after newspapers reported the company’s plan to add the word “blockchain” to its name! So large was the gain that the company felt compelled to publicly clarify that its development of blockchain products was still at an early stage of research and development. Thus, the digital revolution is posing new challenges to central banks, both as regulators of payment systems and as providers of money and payment infrastructures. Many of them are already being tackled, but many still lie ahead. Through significant investments in technology in the payments industry, both central banks and market operators increased the supply of efficient payment services and ensured their security and reliability to foster public confidence in (new) electronic means of  2
payment. In Europe, the establishment of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was a milestone achievement in this context. With widespread access to the internet, consumers are now continuously connected and have come to expect commercial and financial services to be available at their fingertips in real time. All over the world we are seeing a rapid increase in the level of interest in payment solutions that allow money to be sent from person to person through instant payment applications.  On 21 November, the pan-European instant credit transfer scheme established by the European Payments Council (EPC) went live thanks to the efforts undertaken by the payment service providers (PSP) and automated clearing houses (ACH). Now, nearly 600 payment service providers from eight European countries (including Italy) may choose to offer instant payment solutions based on the new scheme whose scope will progressively span to include thirty-four European countries. To further facilitate the integration of the euro area and to complement the services of ACHs, last June the Eurosystem decided to develop an instant payments settlement system in central bank money, the Target Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS). Bank of Italy will be deeply involved in its development. Dramatic technological advances in the financial system are creating new opportunities for payment users. However, they also pose new challenges for traditional intermediaries who are now exposed to heightened competition from digital platforms that also offer payment services. Banks no longer compete (only) with each other but also with non-banks and must deal with the challenges that stem from the developments in financial technology (Fintech).  In the European context, technology driven transformations in the payment system are also supported by regulatory interventions that increase competition and innovation. In 2007, the Payment Service Directive (PSD) introduced a new category of payment service providers, the “Payment Institution”. The new directive (PSD2), which will take effect in January 2018, paves a stable path towards further innovation by regulating the activity of “third parties providers” (TPP). These are Fintech firms that offer payment initiation and account information services by exploiting the new business opportunities provided by 3
technological innovation, positioning themselves between payment service providers and final customers.  The PSD2, while requiring banks to share customer information with TPPs, provides that the activity of the latter be authorized and monitored by the supervisory authorities. Thus, by fostering innovation and competition, the directive aims at ensuring a level playing field in the payment services sector and protecting consumers. Moreover, it focuses on the security of payment services, with the objective of achieving a high level of harmonization through a common regulatory approach within the European Banking Authority (EBA): under the PSD2, the EBA has been tasked with developing standards and guidelines that enhance cooperation among all national competent authorities. The Bank of Italy actively participated in the adoption of the new directive, supporting the Government since the start of the Italian EU presidency in the second half of 2014 when the text of the PSD2 took shape. We are now fully cooperating at European level, where we also chair the European Banking Authority’s Standing Committee on Payment Services, and will continue to share our experience, both as regulator and supervisor, to help ensure an appropriate balance between the public interest, security, innovation and competition. The ongoing digital transformation in the payment ecosystem and the new regulatory approach are posing new challenges. Oversight of the new payments systems will have to be carried out while new technologies and business models are introduced. The risks associated with these innovations will have to be faced, such as those stemming from vulnerabilities in the assessment, processing and storage of information, as well as those that threaten cyber security, which may impair the public’s confidence in the payment system.  It is possible that all these challenges will push us towards a new paradigm in implementing policy and supervising the payment system in the new technological era. In this context, a continuous dialogue between regulators and the industry facilitates the introduction of innovations that have the potential of generating broad-based benefits. At the same time, risks and unintended consequences will have to be carefully evaluated and countered. Most of the issues we are facing today are covered by the topics that will be  4
discussed during this two-day conference. I am confident that it will not only provide food for thought but also new insights on how to reap the benefits and counter the risks associated with the digital transformation of payment systems. *  *  * Let me conclude with some open questions, the answers of which could outline the future landscape of the retail payments ecosystem. In the economy, digital means of payments are increasingly common. Today we do not know whether they will ever completely replace physical means of payment or when this might be. It will depend on the preferences of consumers and firms. As providers of currency, central banks need to make sure that they are at the technological frontier in their production and, as regulators, that people will continue to trust the system, be it physical or digital in nature. So, how should central banks promote trust in the payments system in this age of digitalization? What new legal and regulatory issues will be raised by the introduction of the new payment instruments? How will the necessary coordination of the different actors in the payments system be achieved in a deeply evolving set-up? And how will the necessary stability of the financial system be maintained? I am looking forward to learning some of the answers and to listening to the presentations, the panel discussions and the keynote speeches that promise to make this conference particularly interesting. To close my welcome remarks I would like to mention that thirty years ago, under the strong encouragement of Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a major project was finalized in the Bank of Italy with the drafting of our White Paper on the Payment System. In a companion article (published in Moneta e Credito in 1988), my late friend and colleague Curzio Giannini, who was one of the main contributors to that project, observed that the payments system is a “complex apparatus [of rules, intermediaries and instruments] that serves a simple purpose: allowing the execution of payments in money associated with the circulation of goods and services”. As regulators and providers of means of payment, we have to ensure that the digital transformation of retail payments will encourage the exchange of goods and services among households and firms, helping them to reap the benefits of the new technologies and to share them widely.  5
Page 1  DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF  THE RETAIL PAYMENTS ECOSYSTEM   CYBER SECURITY – THE BALANCE BETWEEN COOPERATION AND REGULATION KEYNOTE SPEECH BY FABIO PANETTA, DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF BANCA D’ITALIA At the joint ECB and Banca d’Italia conference Rome, 1 December 2017  Information and communication technologies play a fundamental role for people, businesses and the public sector. Digital transformation is modifying the economic system and the whole of society at unprecedented speed.  Innovation is having a powerful effect on the financial sector. The value chain is becoming more complex, and the participation of non-financial providers is increasing. The tech giants as well as the new fintech start-ups are expanding the supply of innovative services to a broad and diverse customer base through new business models.  As a result, confidence in the financial sector is no longer based on bilateral trust between customers and service providers but is dependent on the governance of digitalization and especially on the reliability and safety of the products offered. Emerging risks in the digital ecosystem The increasing role of digital platforms is creating enormous benefits for users. At the same time it is offering ill-timed advantages for new groups of hostile agents, such as hacktivists, fraudsters and criminal and terrorist organizations. By exploiting the vulnerabilities within cyberspace, these agents may endanger the provision of digital services or disrupt critical infrastructures. The new risks are exacerbated by the complex network of interconnections that forms the digital ecosystem: the ‘Internet of Things’ is exploding and the number of interconnected devices is expected to grow at an unprecedented  
 Page 2 pace, to more than 200 billion in 2020.1 The area at risk is expanding enormously. Any weakness in security controls, any vulnerability in technology may offer an entry point for cyber attacks.  In the financial sector, cyber attacks can create disruptions that propagate instantly and globally with effects that are hard to predict. Recent cyber attacks, like the one against the Central Bank of Bangladesh, exemplify the vulnerabilities – of both process and technology – that affect interbank payments and core financial infrastructures, which were once considered less exposed to cyber risks. As the Financial Stability Board has emphasized, certain cyber attacks2 show that the vulnerability of financial institutions is a systemic issue, although it is unlikely as yet to represent a real threat to global financial stability.   These attacks were a wake-up call for regulators and financial authorities, emphasizing that the safety of cyberspace is not just a prerequisite for the reliability of financial services but also an essential element of financial stability. Cyber risks threaten the core functions of the financial sector, including banking operations, payments and securities settlement. Central banks and, more generally, public authorities may themselves be on the radar screen of cyber attackers; cyber security is no longer a matter for specialists but a policy priority.   The pillars of an effective cyber security strategy  In today’s world, central banks, regulators and supervisors face the formidable challenge of ensuring that the technological revolution does not undermine trust and confidence in the financial system. This is no easy task: like acrobats walking a tightrope, the authorities must strike the right balance between potentially diverging forces such as innovation, complexity and the safety of the system.  This entails enhancing and complementing the traditional regulatory and supervisory approaches with the adoption of an effective toolkit tailored to address cyber risks.  1  From 2 billion in 2006.

 Page 3 In 2016 the G7 published a set of widely applicable recommendations encapsulating cyber security best practices for public and private financial entities. They were followed last October by the ‘fundamental elements for effective assessment of cyber security for the financial sector’.  Having in mind these G7 principles, I would like to focus the rest of my speech on the main pillars on which – from a central bank’s view – an effective strategy should be based: regulation, cooperation and risk awareness.  The first pillar: regulation Regulation is a crucial component of an effective strategy to ensure sustainable innovation and preserve cyber security. A number of European laws have recently introduced requirements and obligations for both private companies and public bodies in order to increase cyber security in critical sectors of the economy.  A general framework is given by the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS-D), which establishes security-related obligations for critical service providers, including credit institutions, stock exchanges and financial infrastructures. To guarantee data protection and the privacy of personal information, the General Data Protection Regulation also imposes strict security requirements for private and public entities, including financial firms.   Specifically focusing on the financial field, the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) has introduced security requirements throughout the payment cycle: from payer authentication to communication between service providers, security risk management by financial firms and the reporting of major incidents to the authorities. The European Banking Authority (EBA) was delegated to issue secondary regulation.  The Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures was published by CPMI-IOSCO in 2016. To ensure its harmonized implementation within the euro area, the Eurosystem has delivered a cyber resilience strategy that national supervisors must adopt to enhance the cyber resilience framework of financial institutions.   However, regulation alone is not sufficient to protect the financial system from cyber risks. Indeed, excessive reliance on regulation may even have undesirable side effects owing to the complex interactions between different regulatory levels, such as domestic versus international legislation or 
 Page 4 economy-wide versus sector-specific rules. Hence, other forms of intervention are necessary, such as cooperation.    The second pillar: cooperation  Owing to the existence of externalities, individual intermediaries may lack sufficient incentive to contribute to the supply of a common good – cyber security – that would generate benefits for their direct competitors as well. They may be tempted, therefore, to free ride on the action of other companies and to under-invest in security-enhancing projects. In this situation, central banks, as third parties entrusted with preserving financial stability, may act as a catalyst to stimulate cooperation, centralized cyber threat intelligence and information sharing initiatives.3  At European level, the recent establishment of the European Cyber Resilience Board (ECRB) under the Eurosystem cyber resilience strategy is a valuable example of virtuous cooperation among public authorities, financial market infrastructures and critical service providers to enhance the cyber resilience of the European financial ecosystem.  Financial authorities may also leverage such cooperative initiatives to promote effective practices and tools for cyber risk assessment, including simulations and tests, which are difficult for individual firms to implement in isolation. This is a new paradigm, in which authorities and regulated entities work closely together, complementing compliance with a collaborative approach. This allows the authorities to gain a deep understanding of the level of cyber resilience achieved and of any additional initiatives required.  The third pillar: promoting risk awareness The third pillar of action focuses on the human factor, as in cyber security people are still the weakest link. For example, the spread of cyber extortion (ransomware) – which is becoming one of the major threats to digital businesses – can be attributed to several factors. Some are technical,4 but the 3  Threat intelligence may support financial institutions in taking the right decisions to prevent cyber attacks, effectively protect their critical assets and respond appropriately in the event of a successful cyber attack. Information sharing about cyber events through trusted channels facilitates a sector-wide response to large-scale cyber incidents (CPMI-IOSCO, Cyber guidance, 2016). 4  We refer to the growth of ransomware-as-a-service, easily and cheaply accessed on the dark-web by cyber criminals, or the availability of crypto-currencies as a ransom payment tool.  Today, cyber attacks can easily be organized, even by purchasing as-a-service packages and simple downloads for installation on rogue servers. In 2016, 638 million ransomware attacks were recorded, 167                                                            
 Page 5 most significant ones are totally human related: the growing habit of working remotely on personal devices, combined with users’ lack of attention to cyber risks, can easily open the door for attacks on corporate critical information assets. Employees, consumers and public officials need to be educated about the risks that can arise from new technologies. The financial authorities are in the best position to promote long-term education initiatives and cyber awareness campaigns.  The role of the authorities: the experience of the Banca d’Italia  For central banks, translating all these principles into concrete action means first of all strengthening internal governance and cyber security capabilities. Let me talk about the Banca d’Italia’s experience in this area.  To ensure a comprehensive strategic vision and the alignment of internal and institutional policies, a cyber security steering committee has recently been set up at Board level.  Under this governance, the Banca d’Italia’s three-year strategic plan envisages two specific initiatives: one focuses on protecting the Bank’s critical assets by reorganizing security functions inside the IT Department; the other focuses on enhancing the cyber resilience of Italy’s financial sector by adapting the Eurosystem cyber strategy in line with the Italian National Cyber Security Framework and keeping an open dialogue with the competent national bodies. On the cooperation front, the Banca d’Italia and the Italian Banking Association have sponsored the establishment of the Italian Financial Cyber Security Unit (called CERTFin), which coordinates information sharing and cyber threat intelligence among the participating financial companies, allowing them to share critical information and enhance the awareness of cyber risk beyond what would be possible within the perimeter of their own organization.  Since January 2017, CERTFin has examined more than 800 cyber events, sharing with its members any lessons drawn and circulating more than 150 warnings on potential compromises to individual financial firms. It cooperates with similar national and international cyber security bodies. Furthermore, CERTFin cooperates closely with government cyber security agencies, contributing to national cyber security. times more than 2015 (source: SonicWall, 2017 annual report - www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/02/07/2016-saw-an-insane-rise-in-the-number-of-ransomware-attacks/#3d5df45558dc).                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Page 6 Conclusions   Digital innovation and cyber security are two faces of the same coin and so cannot be addressed separately. Hostile agents and criminals have always existed. However, compared with other threats or other types of crime, cyber attacks are rapidly evolving and, given the central role of cyberspace in modern economies, represent a concrete global risk.  In the final communiqué of the G7 meeting held in Bari in 2017 under the Italian Presidency, finance ministers and central bank governors stated that they ‘recognise that cyber incidents represent a growing threat for our economies and that appropriate economy-wide policy responses are needed. No point of cyberspace can be absolutely secure as long as cyber threats persist in the surrounding environment’.  Transposing this principle into concrete action is challenging and requires us to recognize that cyberspace is a global public good. Ensuring its security, openness, reliability and interoperability falls under the joint responsibility of governments, public institutions, private industry and researchers. How should we tackle this challenge?  One answer lies in the words of the Roman philosopher Seneca:  Longum iter est per praecepta, breve et efficax per exempla.5  After two thousand years, this sentence is more than ever pertinent in describing an effective approach to innovation. In the field of cyber security, regulatory or supervisory tools may become less effective unless accompanied by other concrete action: as our experience has shown, the authorities may support joint initiatives with the private sector on information sharing and the promotion of best practices, playing a role as trust-builder to foster the broad and open participation of all stakeholders. This approach may help us respond appropriately to digitalization by reconciling innovation, security and competitiveness.  Thank you for your attention.  5  ‘The way is long if one follows precepts, short and effective if one follows examples’.                                                            
Yutaka Harada Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Fukushima Bank of Japan November 30, 2017 (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
 1  Introduction Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with you and for having taken the time to be here despite your busy schedules. It is indeed a great honor to be here today. Please allow me to express my gratitude for your great cooperation with the business operations of the Bank of Japan, particularly of the Fukushima Branch.  The Bank has implemented quantitative and qualitative monetary easing -- or QQE for short -- since April 2013 and introduced various additional measures such as the negative interest rate policy and yield curve control, all with the aim of achieving the inflation target of 2 percent.  As a result of these measures, Japan's economy has been improving. Of course, I know that many people argue that, although the economy is said to be improving, they are not feeling the effects of this improvement because the real economic growth rate has been just a little over 1 percent on average recently. However, this is the first time in 16 years that the economy has registered positive growth for seven consecutive quarters, from the January-March quarter of 2016 through the July-September quarter of 2017.  Today, I would like to explain monetary policy measures conducted by the Bank and what they have achieved, and then discuss what to make of arguments circulating with respect to the purported dangers of bold monetary policy.  I. Monetary Easing Measures and Economic Activity The Bank has implemented QQE since 2013, with the aim of achieving the inflation target of 2 percent. As a result, the money stock and lending have been growing at a faster pace. Moreover, due to the decline in nominal interest rates and the rise in inflation expectations, real interest rates -- nominal interest rates minus expected inflation rates -- have declined considerably.  What sorts of results has this had for economic activity? Chart 1 shows developments in major economic indicators. The chart shows that production, exports, consumption, and aggregate supply of capital goods (a proxy variable for business fixed investment) all 
 2  started to recover when QQE was introduced, or even slightly before then. However, consumption and production became sluggish following the consumption tax hike in 2014. This sluggishness appears to have become pronounced on the whole particularly since the end of 2014, when exports decreased with the slowdown in world trade. Nevertheless, economic indicators as a whole in Japan have been recovering in line with the recovery in world trade that began around mid-2016.   These economic indicators experienced ups and downs after the introduction of QQE, but one indicator that has continued improving almost constantly is employment. Chart 2 shows developments in the number of employees and the unemployment rate. It has been said that, although the number of employees increased, this was limited to non-regular employees. However, the share of non-regular employees among all employees has leveled off. 9095100105110115120125└2012└2013└2014└2015└2016└2017Industrial productionReal consumption activity indexWorld trade volumeAggregate supply of capital goodsReal exportss.a.,CY 2010 = 100Sources:Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, "Indices of Industrial Production," "Indices of Industrial Domestic Shipments and Imports"; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic PolicyAnalysis, "CPB World Trade Monitor"; Bank of Japan, "Real Exports and Real Imports," "Consumption Activity Index."Inauguration of the second Abe Cabinet                 Dec. 2012IntroductionofQQEApr. 2013Consumptiontax hike Apr. 2014Expansionof QQEOct. 2014Introductionof QQE with Yield Curve ControlSep. 2016Introductionof QQE with a Negative  Interest RateJan. 2016Chart 1  Achievements of Bold Monetary Easing
 3  Looking at the shares of non-regular and part-time employees among all employees in the Labour Force Survey released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the Monthly Labour Survey released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, we see that both peaked out after the turn of 2017.    Productivity Also Has Risen Since the introduction of QQE, there has been heated debate over the importance of growth strategy; this is because, even though employment has increased, productivity has not risen, and economic growth will not continue without a rise in productivity.1 In fact, however, productivity has risen, as indicated in Chart 3. Productivity shown in the chart is estimated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and represents real purchasing power parity GDP per hour worked.

Japan's average for the 10 years prior to this was 0.8 percent; therefore, Japan's productivity rose even after the introduction of QQE. Moreover, the capital-labor ratio per worker has declined.2 This means that productivity would have risen even further if there had been sufficient investment.   When growth accounting methodology was developed several decades ago, the growth rate of an economy's output was decomposed into capital inputs, labor inputs, and technological progress (total factor productivity). The results obtained through this methodology showed that the contribution of technological progress to the economic growth rate was 80 to 90 percent. I am reminded of the heated argument prevailing at the time that, despite such results, unless new capital investment is made, new technology cannot be adopted, and thus                                                  2 See Cabinet Office, Annual Report on the Japanese Economy and Public Finance 2017, July 2017, figure 16.

 5  technological progress should include capital inputs -- namely, capital-embodied technological progress. This argument has not received much attention in recent years; however, it is true that, if demand does not grow, then new investments cannot be made, and if new investments cannot be made, then equipment featuring advanced technologies cannot be used. It is wrong to view supply and demand as being separate, and to consider that Japan's economic problems are rooted in the supply side of the economy.3  I would like to note that monetary easing measures and growth strategy are not in opposition to one another, but actually complement each other. What is more, deregulation as part of growth strategy includes measures aimed at improving the efficiency of existing industries, thereby reducing employment. On such occasions, monetary policy measures will make it easier to carry out deregulation by improving the economy and producing labor shortages.  The Economy Has Improved, despite Claims That People Are Not Actually Experiencing Such Improvement It is often claimed that, although the government says that the economy has improved, the public is not actually experiencing this improvement in their daily lives. However, how should we measure the public's perceptions regarding their daily lives in the first place? Public opinion polls offer clues in this regard. Chart 4 shows answers to the following question in a public opinion poll: "How would you describe the lifestyle of your household compared to this time last year?"                                                   3 For growth accounting and capital-embodied technological progress, see, for example, David N. Weil, Keizai seichō [Economic Growth], 2nd ed., trans. Hayami Hiroshi and Hayami Hitoshi (Tokyo: Pearson Kirihara K.K., 2010), 183-86, 216-17. It seems that recent macroeconomics textbooks do not emphasize the concept of capital-embodied technological progress. 
 6   The chart shows that only a very small number of respondents answered that their household circumstances or lifestyles have become better off or improved compared with one year ago. While the proportion of such respondents is currently slightly over 5 percent, even during the period of high economic growth between the mid-1950s and the early 1970s, when real GDP grew by around 10 percent every year, the only period when more than 10 percent of people replied that their circumstances or lifestyles had become better off or improved was from 1959 to 1963.4 The results indicate that people do not feel the effects                                                  4 In the time-series data of the Public Opinion Survey on the Life of the People conducted by the Cabinet Office, the share of respondents answering that their household's lifestyle "improved" exceeded 30 percent during the high economic growth period. This figure, however, requires attention because of the following. The surveys conducted between 1965 and 1991 and in 1994 first asked "What aspects of your household's lifestyle have improved compared with around this time -70-60-50-40-30-20-10010010203040506070809010019541955195919601961196219631964196519661967196819691970197119721973Jan. 1974Nov. 1974May 1975Nov. 1975May 1976Nov. 1976197719781979198019811982198319841985198619871988198919901991199219931994199519961997199920012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017I do not knowDeterioratedRemained the sameImproved"Improved" minus "deteriorated" (right scale)%% pointsNote:  This graph was made by the Bank's staff based on the Public Opinion Survey on the Life of the Peopleconducted by the Cabinet Office.The surveys conducted in 1954 and 1955 asked the respondents "Have your household circumstances of lateimproved, deteriorated, or remained the same compared with around this time last year?," while those conducted between 1959 and 1991 asked "How would you describe your household circumstances comparedto this time last year? Have they become better off, worse off, or remained the same?" The surveys conductedfrom 1992 ask "How would you describe the lifestyle of your household compared to this time last year? Has it improved, deteriorated, or remained the same?"

From the 1999 survey, the share of "I do not know" has been calculated by subtracting the shares of all the response options from the total.Sources: Cabinet Office, Public Opinion Survey on the Life of the People; Bank of Japan.CYChart 4  Sense of Improvement in Lifestyle Compared to Last Year 
 7  of improvement in the economy. Nevertheless, looking at an indicator derived by deducting the share of respondents who answered that their household circumstances or lifestyles have "deteriorated" from the share of those who answered that these have "improved," it appears to be moving very closely in line with economic developments. After rising in 2013, the indicator fell due to the consumption tax hike, and since then it has been rising again together with the steady improvement in the economy.  II. Arguments against QQE As I mentioned so far, Japan's economy has been improving due to QQE, which began in April 2013. However, there are always those who are against QQE. I consider that these opposing views can be divided into three arguments. The first states that there is no relationship between QQE and the current improvement in the economy, and that the economy would have improved even without QQE. The second argument states that QQE has produced positive effects for some people, but that it also has produced negative effects for a number of others. The third argument is that, although QQE may be bringing about positive results at the moment, it most certainly will give rise to extremely serious problems in the future.                                                                                                                                                 last year? Choose from among the following" (the choices were as follows: food; clothing; durable consumer goods such as electrical appliances, furniture, and automobiles; housing; leisure; other; and nothing has improved). The survey then asked "When viewed on the whole, do you think that your household's lifestyle has improved, deteriorated, or remained the same compared to last year?" (the question is phrased somewhat differently depending on the survey year). Since the question was posed in such a specific manner, many people were likely to have answered that their household's lifestyle has "improved," recalling, for example, electrical appliances that they newly purchased or family trips taken that year as opposed to not taking any the previous year. For this reason, for surveys conducted between 1965 and 1991 and in 1994, Chart 4 shows responses to "Have your household circumstances of late improved, deteriorated, or remained the same compared with around this time last year?" -- a question that did not ask about specific aspects that improved in their lifestyle. The only difference in the questions is the phrase "lifestyle" and "household circumstances." Moreover, a possible reason why only a small number of people responded with "improved" over the years is that this question does not offer "somewhat improved" in the response options. 
 8  The First Argument: There Is No Relationship between QQE and Economic Improvement Let me start with the first argument. As I have explained so far, improvements have been seen in a number of indicators since the introduction of QQE; thus, I can hardly believe the claim that Japan's economy would have improved even without QQE. Nevertheless, it is difficult to technically prove my view that QQE has brought about improvements in Japan's economy, because it is impossible to compare the situation of the economy from 2013 up to the present between cases where QQE has been implemented and where QQE has not been implemented. What I can compare is merely the situation before the implementation of QQE -- that is, until 2012 -- and after the implementation -- from 2013. Because the economic situation differs between these periods, the effects of QQE cannot be technically proven by this comparison.  Given this, it is necessary to terminate QQE now in order to make my argument more convincing. If QQE is terminated and the economy deteriorates, many people would believe that the economic upturn had been driven by QQE. Nevertheless, this experiment will not be persuasive enough because of the differing economic situations between the period through 2012 and from 2013.  Should this experiment be carried out, interest rates will soar, the yen will jump, stock prices will crash, and the economy will plunge into recession. Such a dangerous test must not be carried out. In addition, it is possible without such a reckless experiment to make an assessment that compares Japan's economy through 2012 and from 2013 up to the present by adjusting the situation of the economy in each period to be as similar as possible. The results obtained from this assessment show that QQE has exerted its intended effects. For example, Professor Ryuzo Miyao at the University of Tokyo -- a former Policy Board member of the Bank -- presented an analysis based on a vector autoregression (VAR) model that the impact of an expansion of the monetary base raised production and the inflation rate.5                                                   5 Miyao Ryuzo, "Hi dentōteki kin'yū seisaku no kōka wa aru no ka 2," chap. 3 in Hi dentōteki kin'yū seisaku [Unconventional Monetary Policies] (Tokyo: Yuhikaku Publishing Co., Ltd., 2016). 
 9  Moreover, making comparisons of the economic situation in Japan with those in various other countries that adopted monetary easing during different phases will support my argument. For example, during the Great Depression, the U.S. economy recovered steadily when it abolished the gold standard and shifted to monetary easing in April 1933, but it fell back into recession when the level of monetary easing was reduced from 1936 to 1937.6  Chart 5 shows developments in real GNP, the money stock (M2), and prices in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s. It is evident that real GNP and prices dropped significantly in line with the decline in M2, and recovered steadily with the increase in M2. Then, in 1937, real GNP and prices declined again as M2 decreased, showing that it was a failure to exit from monetary easing too early. However, as monetary easing was resumed, real GNP started to recover from 1938 with the increase in M2.                                                    6 Adachi Seiji, "Ryōteki kanwa no deguchi wa nihon keizai ni totte kiken ka," chap. 8 in Abenomikusu wa shinkasuru: Kin'yu ganseki riron o tou, ed.

 10  As I mentioned earlier, it is actually difficult to totally refute the argument that Japan's economy would have become better even without QQE. However, by referring to a number of cases in the past, I believe that it is now understood that it was monetary easing that brought about the recovery in Japan's economy.  The Second Argument: The Effects of QQE Have Not Become Widespread The second argument is that QQE has produced positive effects for some people but also has produced negative effects for a number of others. For example, labor shortage is certainly a favorable condition for job seekers, but it is a potential disadvantage from the standpoint of employers. Nevertheless, I feel that it is better to suffer from a lack of people who engage in selling, manufacturing, and transportation for a marketable product than from the problem of a product that is not selling. If a product that is not selling comes to pose a management crisis, it will become necessary to cut employment, which is a hard task for managers. After the 2008 financial crisis, I heard from numerous corporate managers that they were forced to cut their workforce and had never before had such a painful experience. I cannot imagine that there are any managers in Japan who would find it easy to cut their workforce. This is why I feel that it is much better to have too few people than too many.  Some argue that only a limited number of people receive the benefits from the economic recovery and that benefits do not reach them. This argument goes that, although income has risen on the whole, many people do not experience much increase in income and income disparities have expanded. Let us take a look at how income distribution changed after the introduction of QQE.  According to the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions 2016 released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the child poverty rate (the share of children aged 17 or under living in households with equivalent disposable income at or below 50 percent of the 
 11  median) fell from 16.3 percent in 2012 to 13.9 percent in 2015.7 In this same survey, the overall poverty rate fell from 16.1 percent to 15.6 percent over this period.  There is another argument that QQE has put the banking industry in a difficult situation, saying that low interest rates are squeezing bank profits. But one of the major reasons for such a situation is that banks are suffering from a lack of borrowers. In Japan, private nonfinancial corporations as a whole have been experiencing excess net savings, and their currency and deposits accumulated to as much as 254 trillion yen as of end-June 2017.8 Of course, it is natural that bank profits are squeezed if long-term interest rates decline, because banks generally raise short-term funds and invest them in long-term assets. However, if we simply compare long-term interest rates and bank profits, it does not seem appropriate to say that low interest rates always reduce bank profits.  Chart 6 shows developments in banks' operating profits from core business and long-term interest rates (10-year Japanese government bond [JGB] yields). Operating profits from core business represent stable earnings of banks, such as profits earned from fund management in the form of lending and securities investment, for example. Interest rates have fallen in a mostly consistent manner since 1990, yet I do not believe that this is correlated with banks' operating profits from core business. For example, even though interest rates fell in the first half of the 1990s, operating profits recovered. In 1999, when the zero interest rate policy was introduced, operating profits rose along with interest rates. In 2001, the quantitative easing policy was introduced, yet operating profits rose thereafter. Both operating profits and interest rates fell following the termination of quantitative easing, but this is largely due to the 2008 financial crisis. After the introduction of QQE in 2013, due to the improvements in the economy, the financial situation of borrowing firms                                                  7 Equivalent disposable income is calculated by dividing household disposable income by the square root of the number of people in the household. It is believed to represent the standard of living per member of the family. The reason for using the square root instead of the number of people itself in the calculation is that there are costs of living shared among the members of the household, which tend to become lower per person as the number of people in the household grows larger. Equivalent disposable income is thought to make it possible to compare per capita disposable income between households with different numbers of people in the household. 8 Bank of Japan, Flow of Funds Accounts (2nd Quarter 2017; Preliminary), September 2017. 
 12  improved, credit costs decreased, and banks' net income increased.9 In other words, bank profits are affected by the situation of the economy as a whole, in addition to developments in interest rates. Although operating profits from core business fell in fiscal 2015 and 2016, I think that this is partly due to the sluggishness of the economy that followed the consumption tax hike. It is true that banks' net profits have been declining since fiscal 2016, but I would like to emphasize that they had been improving prior to that.                                                    9 Net income is calculated by deducting credit costs, such as loan-loss provisions, from the sum of operating profits from core business and the profits and losses on sales of securities. Other items such as extraordinary gains/losses are also added/deducted.

 13  Furthermore, if bank profits depend on a rise in nominal interest rates, QQE is a policy that will lead to an increase in interest rates in the end. This is because interest rates also rise when prices rise. If interest rates are raised even though prices are not rising, then the economy will deteriorate, prices will fall, and interest rates will have to be reduced further. I believe that such policy measures continued from the 1990s until the introduction of QQE.10 Looking ahead, I believe that prices will rise, and that we can expect to see interest rates rise along with them.  The Third Argument: QQE Will Cause Serious Problems in the Future Lastly, let me turn to the argument that QQE may be bringing about positive effects at the moment, but most certainly will give rise to extremely serious problems in the future. The argument goes that, at some point, monetary easing will suddenly give rise to hyperinflation, a collapse of the yen, a surge in interest rates, a plunge in bond prices, and so forth.11 However, such fears are not at all likely to happen. Given this, the argument seems to have converged on the discussion that the Bank will face significant problems of making large losses for a protracted period when it heads toward an exit from monetary easing -- that is, when it reduces the level of monetary easing. Regarding this argument, it is of course possible that the Bank may register losses.  Those who support this argument claim that, when the public merely acknowledges the possibility that the Bank may register losses -- even if such a thing does not actually happen -- the yen will collapse and Japan's economy will experience hyperinflation.12 However, if this argument is valid, why is the collapse of the yen or hyperinflation not happening now? I often ask this question, but have never received an answer.                                                  10 For the relationship among nominal interest rates, financial institutions' profits, and monetary policy, see Harada Yutaka, "Naze nihon no kin'ri wa hikui no ka," Keiki to saikuru, no. 62, Japan Association of Business Cycle Studies, November 2016. 11 In Harada, Kataoka, and Yoshimatsu, Abenomikusu wa shinkasuru, this sort of theory is criticized by referring to it as the "big rock theory." 12 In "The Role of Capital for Central Banks" (the outline of a speech given at the Fall Meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics on October 25, 2003), Kazuo Ueda provided the general opinion that, when a central bank falls into capital deficiency, a loss of credibility in the central bank causes a depreciation of the currency, a high rate of inflation, a functional decline in payment systems, and other problems (note that Mr. Ueda is not necessarily stating this as his own opinion). 
 14  I consider that the Bank may register losses on its statement of income at the exit from monetary easing, but believe that nothing negative will happen to the economy. I will explain the reason behind my view.  Let us first look back in history. Since 1980, as far as I can confirm, there have been about 20 cases in which central banks recorded losses or fell into capital deficiency.13 Although details are not available for all cases, countries that suffered from economic turmoil such as inflation were Jamaica, the Philippines, and Venezuela in the 1980s and 1990s. On the other hand, inflation rates did not rise in West Germany in the 1970s, the Czech Republic in the 1990s-2010s, Chile from the 1990s up to the present, or in Switzerland in the 2000s and 2010s. The reason why economic turmoil did not happen in these countries is clear. Most of the assets of central banks in these countries are foreign assets. If inflation occurs, the value of their countries' currencies depreciates, whereas the value of foreign assets denominated in their home currencies appreciates. In other words, there is a mechanism in which, if impairment of central banks' assets brings inflation, inflation itself recovers the value of these assets. Therefore, it is impossible that serious problems will occur because of central bank losses.  Why, then, could sharp inflation not be restrained in Jamaica and other countries? In these countries, central banks increased money to assume government debt and issued high-interest-bearing bonds to absorb the increased money. As a result, these central banks made losses due to increased interest payment.14 It is a matter of course that, if central banks issue banknotes to assume government debt, they inevitably will suffer from inflation regardless of their financial situation. In the case of Japan, however, as I have explained on                                                  13 Reza Vaez-Zadeh, "Implications and Remedies of Central Bank Losses," in The Evolving Role of Central Banks, ed.

 15  various occasions, the fiscal deficit has been decreasing after the introduction of QQE.15 The ratio of the general government deficit to GDP has declined significantly from 8 percent in 2012 -- the level before the introduction of QQE -- to 2 percent in 2016. Of the 6 percentage point decrease, 1.5 percentage points, or 8 trillion yen, is due to the consumption tax hike in 2014, and the remaining 4.5 percentage points is due to the economic recovery brought about by economic stimulus measures such as QQE.16  In addition, the Bank of Japan employs a price stability target of 2 percent. This means that, when the timing of achieving the 2 percent price stability target is in sight, the Bank will taper monetary easing or tighten monetary policy. This situation totally differs from that in Jamaica or other countries that experienced sharp inflation.  Why Does the Exit Pose a Problem? As I explained earlier, in the 1980s and 1990s, the situations in Jamaica, the Philippines, and Venezuela were completely different from that in Japan, and as for countries such as Switzerland, central bank assets consist of foreign assets. Given this, I believe that there are doubts over what will happen in countries where the majority of assets consist of government bonds denominated in their own currencies, such as Japan.  "Exit" here refers to the Bank's termination of monetary easing followed by an increase in interest rates and a reduction of the monetary base because achieving 2 percent inflation is in sight as a result of monetary easing. At the exit, the Bank will have to raise interest rates. By way of example, possible ways to do so are as follows: by abandoning the negative interest rate policy currently carried out by the Bank and raising the interest rate applied to excess reserves, or by selling JGBs held by the Bank.  At this point in time, the Bank has not reached any decisions on an exit policy. It is easier to understand the topic by thinking in terms of hiking the interest rate applied to excess reserves, and so I would like to explain it in this way. Those who contend that the exit will                                                  15 See, for example, Harada Yutaka, "Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan: Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Gifu," Bank of Japan, June 2017.

 16  be dangerous make the claim that, even if the Bank raises the interest rate on excess reserves, the interest rates on JGBs that it purchased in the past will remain low, and therefore the Bank will suffer enormous losses. It is certainly possible that the Bank could suffer losses because it will receive a low yield despite paying out a high yield. Such proponents explain that, if the Bank suffered losses, then confidence in the currency would be undermined, and this would lead to hyperinflation, the collapse of the yen, and a surge in interest rates.  However, while yields on even JGBs at present are around 0 percent, they were 3 percent until about the middle of the 1990s. The reason is that, at that time, the real economic growth rate was high and prices were rising. If prices rise, interest rates will also rise eventually. This means that it will be possible to purchase higher yielding JGBs. Of course, until that time, the Bank will have to hold low yielding JGBs while paying high yields to banks in order to prevent an overheating of the economy. However, in the end, the central bank will always make a profit in the long run, since it buys high yielding JGBs using cash and current account deposits that carry almost no costs. Thus, the Bank will not make a loss in the long run that could pose a danger.  In the first place, over the course of monetary easing in Japan, the economy improved and the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio also improved, backed by an increase in tax revenues; thus, focusing on the Bank's deficits that will temporarily occur at the time of the exit is an argument that fails to see the forest for the trees.  Some are of the opinion that, because central banks in the United States and Europe are heading for the exit, Japan should follow suit. However, it makes perfect sense to me that Japan's exit should come later than theirs. To begin with, although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are below 2 percent, they are hovering at around 1.5 percent. This differs from the situation in Japan, where the rates do not reach even 1 percent. Furthermore, Japan introduced the quantitative easing policy -- which was large in terms of scale -- in 2013, whereas the United States and Europe started theirs in 2008. Because of the difference in the timing of starting such policy, it is no surprise that the timing of the exit differs as well. 
 17  III. Path toward Achieving the 2 Percent Price Stability Target As I mentioned earlier, QQE has produced significant effects so far. There is no basis to the claims regarding the dangers or side effects of QQE. The only problem is that prices have not risen. In relation to this, it is often questioned why wages and prices have not risen despite labor shortages.17 My answer is simply that labor shortages have been insufficient. When wages increase, so do prices. This is because, although a rise in wages increases costs, these costs are easily passed on to prices due to increased demand caused by a rise in income. Since my time here is limited, I would like to focus on prices.  Chart 7 shows the Phillips curve representing the relationship between the inflation rate and the output gap in Japan. The regression lines shown here indicate this relationship for each of the following periods: from the January-March quarter of 1983 to the January-March quarter of 2013, from the January-March quarter of 1983 to the October-December quarter of 1995, from the January-March quarter of 1996 to the January-March quarter of 2013, and from the April-June quarter of 2013 to the July-September quarter of 2017. All of these regression lines show that, unless the output gap exceeds about 2.5 percent, the inflation rate does not reach 2 percent. Looking at the regression line for the period from the January-March quarter of 1983 to the October-December quarter of 1995, it is evident that the output gap necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation is about 2.5 percent, and the observed inflation rate at the time was 1.5 percent. It can be concluded that, if inflation rates continue to rise at about 1.5 percent and the output gap rises to about 2.5 percent, then 2 percent inflation will be achieved. Since the current output gap is in the range of 1.0-1.5 percent, in order to achieve 2 percent inflation, the positive output gap needs to further widen to about 2.5 percent, and at the same time, the inflation rate must continue to rise at about 1.5 percent.                                                   17 Genda Yuji, ed., Hitode busoku na noni naze chingin ga agaranai no ka (Tokyo: Keio University Press, 2017).

 19  Why Is 2 Percent Inflation Necessary? I would like to explain why 2 percent inflation is necessary by referring to the Bank's official view and adding my personal views.  My interpretation of the Bank's official view on this matter can be summarized as follows. First, aiming at achieving 0 percent inflation entails the risk of actually aiming for deflation, given the upward bias of the consumer price index (CPI). Second, the equilibrium interest rates -- which are achieved in the long run -- tend to be lower on a nominal basis when the aim is 0 percent inflation. That being the case, there will be virtually no room for lowering interest rates should the economy fall into recession. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to provide a so-called buffer for nominal interest rates by raising the inflation rate. What is more, inflation can be dealt with by raising interest rates, and thus inflation can be considered to be easier to deal with than deflation. Third is the global standard. Given that other major countries aim at achieving 2 percent inflation, if Japan were the only country with a lower target, this would result in an appreciation of the yen, which would create turmoil in firms' investment plans. If Japan maintains the same inflation rate as other countries, I feel that this will serve to stabilize foreign exchange over the long term.  Of these theories, I would like to add explanations for why I support the second and third points. The buffer theory of interest rates in the second point is completely different from the one advocated by the Bank in the past. The previous theory aimed at raising interest rates preemptively even when the economic recovery was insufficient, because if interest rates were too low, it would be difficult to implement stimulus measures during recessions. Such monetary policy resulted in a complete failure.18                                                   18 The transcript of the February 2007 Monetary Policy Meeting, at which an interest rate hike was decided, was released on July 31, 2017. In relation to this, in an interview by Jiji Press, Kazumasa Iwata -- who was deputy governor in 2007 -- said that it was a failure to raise interest rates. In the same interview, Atsushi Mizuno -- who was a Policy Board member in 2007-- said that he thought it was better to raise interest rates by a certain degree in order to secure a buffer for monetary easing when the economy deteriorated (reported by Jiji Press at 8:52 a.m. on July 31, 2017). Mizuno's view explains the Bank's past thinking on the buffer. 
 20  The correct theory regarding the buffer should be raising interest rates after confirming that price increases have gained enough momentum. I would like to emphasize that the Bank's current thinking on the buffer theory is totally different from the previous incorrect one.  As for the third point, I believe that the stability in foreign exchange rates led by the global standard theory holds true to a certain degree. The yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since the introduction of QQE with the 2 percent inflation target has moved in the range of 100-120 yen, and appears to be roughly stable at around 110 yen. I think that this situation can be described as stable, taking into account that the yen rose from 120 yen to 80 yen against the dollar around the time of the 2008 financial crisis.  Moreover, there is another reason for the Bank's committing to the 2 percent inflation target; namely, we cannot fully grasp the actual degree of the current economic recovery. Specifically, we do not actually know the exact structural unemployment rate, the bottom line that will lead to inflation if lowered any further. If the Bank had terminated monetary easing based on estimates that the structural unemployment rate was about 3.5 percent, the current unemployment rate of 2.8 percent would not have been achieved.19 I think that we probably will be able to achieve an even lower unemployment rate. The reason why the lower unemployment rate was achieved and a bubble has not occurred is because the inflation rate is set as the direct target for monetary policy. Moreover, given the rise in                                                  19 The following publications showed that the structural unemployment rate was in the range of about 3.0-3.5 percent using unemployment-vacancy analysis. Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Analysis of the Labour Economy 2015, September 2015. Cabinet Office, Annual Report on the Japanese Economy and Public Finance 2015, August 2015. Bank of Japan, "The Bank's View" in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, October 2014. The Bank, from the April 2015 report, deleted the description regarding the structural unemployment rate from the main text of "The Bank's View" and added the following in a footnote to "The Bank's View": "This rate [the structural unemployment rate] is calculated to be around 3.5 percent or lower recently under a specific methodology." Then, from the April 2016 report, this description was deleted from that footnote and instead moved to a footnote to "The Background." From the July 2016 report, the actual level of the structural unemployment rate referred to in that footnote was replaced by the following expression: "the structural unemployment rate defined here differs from the concept of Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), and does not show a direct relationship with prices or wages." On the other hand, developments in the structural unemployment rate have been provided in a chart in the report that shows that the rate is currently approximately 3 percent. 
 21  wages, nonmanufacturing firms are making efforts toward streamlining business processes and making labor-saving investment.  Concluding Remarks Now, let me wrap up my remarks. The Bank's QQE has resulted in expanding the money stock, lending, and so forth. Both nominal and real interest rates have fallen. This in turn has resulted in increases in production, exports, consumption, and business fixed investment.  There are always those who argue against QQE, but as I have already explained, there is no basis to any of these arguments.  The only problem is that prices have not risen. In relation to this, it is often questioned why wages and prices have not risen despite labor shortages. My answer is simply that labor shortages have been insufficient. If the current monetary policy is maintained, labor shortages will intensify further as the economy improves, and there will be a phase in which both wages and prices increase. If their momentum is strong enough, the Bank will start reducing the level of monetary easing.  Some argue that there will be dangers associated with an exit from monetary easing as the Bank heads toward reducing the level of monetary easing, but as I have explained, there are no such dangers.  Thank you for your attention.    
Yves Mersch: Digital transformation of the retail paymentsecosystemIntroductory speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the Joint ECB and Bank of Italy conference, Rome, 30 November 2017.*   *   *Efficient and safe retail payments systems are a precondition for the functioning of any moderneconomy. They allow for everyday transactions to take place, thus providing the foundation forcommerce and trade.Central banks through cash and banks have traditionally offered these services. And they weresuccessful in creating a secure and trusted payment ecosystem for consumers.However over time the banking ecosystem has developed inefficiencies. It has lost someability to innovate and adapt to the changing needs of the end-user.In Europe technological disruptions, competition from non-banks and regulatory pressure hasforced banks to re-examine how they provide retail payment services.The ability to provide real-time services will be essential if banks want to retain and gaincustomers. The strategic importance of instant payments cannot be overstated.The move towards a real-time world with the provision of real-time services cannot happenwithout pan-European instant payments. They will provide a new framework for innovativeand efficient retail payments in Europe.My talk today will focus on instant payments but I will also briefly discuss the alleged innovationbrought by private virtual currency schemes without an identifiable issuer.The foundations of instant payments and ensuring stakeholder involvementThe Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was the origin of today’s digital landscape for retailpayments in Europe. It is a key ingredient of Europe’s single currency and was necessary tobring the full benefits of the euro closer to all citizens. This integration of electronic retailpayments in Europe was full of challenges and was only completed 12 years after theintroduction of euro notes and coins. One of the most prominent issues that faced SEPA was thelack of full stakeholder involvement.Initially, SEPA was considered an “IT” project to be implemented by banks. It was not seen in theoverall context of a project that could transform payments in Europe. The project did not engageenough with Europe’s consumers and businesses.Support from all stakeholders is thus crucial to the success of any such undertaking. To facilitatesuch support, the ECB established the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB). The ERPBbrings together both sides of the market, the supply and the demand side, the banks and the endusers in order to further the development of an integrated, innovative and competitive market foreuro retail payments in the EU. This co-operation has led to new synergies. It gave a voice tothose who felt excluded from the process of innovation in retail payments.Recently we have gone further to enhance European cooperation and have established, inconjunction with the European Commission, the European Forum for Innovation in Payments(EFIP). This body brings together the national payments committees with the ERPB to fosterintegration and innovation for retail payments in Europe. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
The ERPB was instrumental in bringing the vision of real-time payments to Europe with theinception of instant payments. The European Payments Council, acting on guidance from theERPB, created the SEPA credit transfer instant scheme. I am pleased that this scheme wassuccessfully launched last week and let me congratulate the following eight countries who signedup as of today to the service. The tech savvy nations are: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Latvia,Lithuania, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. Now, European end-users whose banks havealready joined and implemented the scheme can send and receive instant payments acrossEurope in less than 10 seconds.A positive end-user experience will ultimately determine the success of instant payments. TheERPB is supporting the work of the industry and other stakeholders to facilitate the initiation of aninstant payment using the recipient’s mobile telephone number as a proxy for their IBAN, nomatter where they are located in the EU. The ERPB expects that a pan-European mobile proxylookup service will be ready by the end of 2018 at the latest and I urge all stakeholders to ensurethat this deadline is met.However, to facilitate the full roll-out of instant payments we have to enable reachability of allbanks in Europe. To enable full reachability the Eurosystem has decided to launch an instantpayments settlement system in central bank money, the Target Instant Payment Settlement(TIPS) Service. TIPS is scheduled to go live in November 2018.Appropriate regulatory frameworkSEPA and instant payments did not happen in isolation. An appropriate legislative framework thatsupports digitisation, innovation and competition is also needed. In Europe we realise thisimportance. The revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) will provide the necessary legislativeframework to allow for innovation. It will enhance payment account access for regulated andauthorised third party providers. It will facilitate the participation of new actors in the paymentsmarket. These actors will provide new innovative services, reduce costs and give consumersmore choice.However this can only happen if standardised access to the payment account is provided. Iwould therefore call upon stakeholders such as banks, standard setting organisations and, thirdparty providers to work together to ensure a single standard is developed for paymentaccount access.The competition introduced by the revised Payment Service Directive can also provide anopportunity for incumbent banks but only if they act urgently to implement instant payments. Itis crucial that banks invest to upgrade their legacy batch systems to enable real-time processingand offer end-user solutions for instant payments. These solutions can provide them with astrong tool to face the upcoming competition.The recent experience with contactless payments shows that banks, in cooperation with otherstakeholders, are well capable to roll out payment innovations that can quickly take off andimprove end-users’ payment experience.Virtual currenciesIt is my view that future innovations in retail payments will be based on instants payments incombination with account access provided by the PSD2. I would like stress this point especiallyin view of the ongoing public debate around the alleged innovation brought by private virtualcurrency schemes or tokens.While we have seen a substantial increase, albeit from low levels, in the value of some of thevirtual currencies lately, we should not forget that their usage as a settlement asset is marginal 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
and the overall user acceptance as a means of payment is negligible.In fact, retail payment traffic in Europe alone is orders of magnitude higher than the globaltransaction volume of virtual currencies. In view of the speculative market environment for virtualcurrencies and for other types of virtual financial assets, one should bear in mind that these areby definition virtual: they do not constitute a claim on an issuer and do not formally qualify ascurrency.Their purchasing power fluctuates wildly and depends solely on the market activity ofspeculators. It remains to be seen whether these virtual currencies can be considered as apayment alternative for consumers – except in extreme case like in failed states- and to whatextent they can compete with the solutions market players will be able to develop in the saferand more efficient European retail payments market.The ECB continues to monitor these developments, not only from a market infrastructureperspective, but also as regards monetary policy, financial stability, and prudential supervision.And while we continue to fully meet the increasing demand for safe and efficient banknotes weshall also experiment with cash on different digital technologies. Other adventurous applicationsof a more disruptive nature are simply not robust enough from a legal, operational, governancepoint of view to name but a few shortcomings which make these assets unfit for recognition fromthe point of view of our mandate of efficient payments systems.ConclusionTo conclude, the benefits of digital transformation and innovation for citizens can only beachieved by means of full stakeholder cooperation and an appropriate regulatory framework thatfosters innovation.Banks need to implement instant payments as soon as possible and provide an alternatenarrative to the ongoing public debate on the alleged innovation brought by virtual currencyschemes.Instant payments in conjunction with the building blocks provided by the PSD2 can offer newbusiness opportunities for banks and third party providers and provide citizens with a real-timesafe payment experience.Thank you for your attention. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
