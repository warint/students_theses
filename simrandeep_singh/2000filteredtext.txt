mentioned. with regard labour market andinflation initially strike development inflation germany last decade hasbeen fairly similar unite states. however, certain time lag germany.in early 1990s, german inflation rate still around 5% owe tight capacity utilisation.since fall continuously. since 1995 inflation rate well 2%. it thuswithin range consistent price stability accord ecb’s definition.in contrast inflation, labour market trend germany 1990s fundamentallydifferent unite states. whereas u unemployment rate continue todecline, unemployment rate germany rise significantly long time since thecyclical slump 1992-93. and accompany continue decline employmentdespite active labour market policy creation early retirement schemes. the germanlabour market is, like, classic element “old economy”. it recently dent ingrowth cause asian crisis overcome, improvement detect thelabour market.the cause german labour market problem primarily structural. this also see bythe comparatively large number long-term unemployed. wage formation mainly gear theinterests “insiders” already job “outsiders” would prefer moderatewage settlements. the accelerate adjustment east german wage west german standard isone example insufficient wage differentiation. it precisely low wage group wouldbe important structure wage substitute incentive-friendly way.from current perspective remain open question whether establishment europeanmonetary union ultimately also lead reduction labour market rigidities. however, i shouldadd witness gradual erosion industry-wide pay bargain least easterngermany. and also observe work hour become flexible. however, step willhave follow wage policy line market requirement help stimulateemployment friendly growth.furthermore, non-accelerating rate unemployment, nairu, could also fall germany. inthe unite state sign indicate nairu decline significantly long boom.according bundesbank’s calculations, may like calculation regard somedegree uncertainty, nairu rise germany almost throughout entire period since endof seventies. in western germany, likely 8% towards end 1990s.when i come second area comments, “growth productivity”, i totell u economy’s success story 1990s. it well-known you. in short: outputand productivity growth buoyant especially since mid-1990s - advancedphase upturn. the scale time productivity increase scarcely explainedin term normal cyclical pattern. i wonder whether schumpeter would already interpretedthe available evidence long wave.in germany, gdp growth rate 1990s almost 1½ percentage point thecorresponding u figure. currently, difference trend growth likely slightly morethan one percentage point.3 when consider individual component demand, differentmomentum capital spend particularly striking. whereas real investment machinery andequipment unite state grow annual average almost 10% since 1993, is3a precise quantification difference easily possible, since forecast future

restrict stateregulations. in germany, sleep giant still wait unchained. but let turn tofiscal policy.although fiscal policy actual centre new economy controversy, i think veryimportant player macroeconomic setting.in unite states, fiscal policy past decade characterise mark course ofconsolidation. for example, initially quite high government budget deficit almost 6% gdpin 1992 reduce

andaround dm 50 billion 2003 correspond effective save level.nevertheless, public sector’s recourse gdp likely fall.moreover, plan reduce public sector deficit ratio ½% 2003. at first glance, thismay seem particularly ambitious. one might also doubt whether european stabilityand growth pact target achieve budget close balance surplus medium term bemet full. however, forget consolidation course accompany 5bis review 25/2000tax reduction quite impressive scale. hence, plan reduction public spend from48.5% gdp 1999 45% 2003 much strong low budget deficit ratio.the twin-track approach tax cut

enough prevent aquestionable development. above all, need restriction pension growth rate. thiswould create room supplementary privately fund pensions. this would also benefit capitalmarkets. and mention capital market i arrive last topic presentation.undoubtedly, “new economy” closely connect development financial markets.for example, sharp growth supply venture capital unite state suggest themomentum real economy underpin flexible, innovative form finance thecapital market.the german financial system traditionally characterise dominant role banks.such “bank-based” structure mean equate

development e-commerce atthe point payment make good service trade via internet, orwhere people deposit money internet accounts. but i also broad interest relate theoverall stablity integrity

movement money particular direction.this vast subject, i need narrow focus today. i want discus issueswhich business individual member public may face relation electronic money theinternet. and i want discus point central bank address monetarypolicy context confront electronic money.in fact two type electronic money: hold internet isheld stored-value cards. multi-purpose stored-value card scheme slow becomeestablished, despite quite lengthy pilot project number countries. hong kong neverthelessone first place introduce regulation govern issuance cards. meanwhile,limited-purpose card prove successful; particular example hong kong withthe octopus card, use pay public transport, hugely popular. today, however, i want todevote limit time available talk electronic money within internet itself, i shallnot discuss card-based money further.many people speak arrival internet era revolution business practice. from theparticular viewpoint make payments, i prefer regard step along evolutionary pathrather something revolutionary. our distant forefather sceptical introduction ofbanknotes place metallic token coins; recent forefather worry thereliability cheque substitute cash first appeared. even span myown work life i recall initial resistance credit card debit card suspicionsabout security arrangements, well opposition autopay direct debit scheme forfear grant third party general authority debit one’s bank account.but innovation has, event, assimilate take place range ofaccepted payment instruments. i would expect e-banking follow suit, another step along theevolutionary path. but perhaps worth pause consider whether anything intrinsicallydifferent e-banking demand special attention central bank. bi review 28/20002let begin examine question central bank’s stance guardian integrity ofthe payment system bank supervisor. i believe perhaps two characteristic ofe-banking may deserve vigilance here.the first technical security access messaging. this matter accuracy, safety andsecrecy. if use internet move money, hold money, expect message arriveat destination without error interception; expect system safe fraudulent orunauthorised access; expect enjoy degree customer confidentiality withconventional bank arrangements. we want assure execution process isreliable secure, also adequate control “read only” access facilities.how obtain assurances? perhaps mirror feel personalinadequacy matter electronic technology. inevitably dependent experts. they havedevised sophisticate method electronic signatures, encryption, certification, firewall like.one way another, obtain appropriate professional advice, apply rigorous standard ofcompliance computer audit, on, within organisation able deliver thenecessary assurance customers, regulatory supervisory authority need satisfythemselves dependability assurances. the financial authority within countries, andon collective basis internationally, may also role play develop recognise commonstandards arena technology security.the second characteristic deserve special attention nature person company whichis offer u bank payment service internet. if merely use electronic servicesprovided usual bank, know sound supervise acknowledgedregulator know jurisdiction, danger lose money wewould bank bank conventional manner, provide course thebank regulator keep pace requirement internet banking, respect ofthe security aspect discuss already.but quite different story tempt part money organisationmasquerading bank, actually bank register jurisdiction lowersupervisory standard accustomed. in hong kong, order protect thepublic already legislation govern usage word “bank”, govern advertisingfor deposit within boundary anyone authorise take deposit hong kong. but wecannot protect people possible consequence click onto website far-off placewhich lure part money. the message clear: make sure know andtrust banker.in hong kong talk new bank establish sole purpose ofconducting internet banking. in decide whether authorise bank, monetary authoritywould expect apply much criterion conventional bank, would need payparticular attention business plan order ensure reflect realistic assumption andprudent bank principles. we intend near future issue guideline applications.already, supervisory body exist banks, monetary authority need take account ofany particular risk pertain internet bank sure bank conduct suchbusiness properly appreciate allow risks. i would mention particular thestrategic risk, venture new business arena may always assure success; theoperational risk, dependence it networks, associate security consideration ihave already referred; additional bank risk may arise internet transaction aredeemed potentially volatile unpredictable, customer le reliable, normalbanking business.the need confident intermediary deal also relevantwhen examine scheme so-called digital cash cyberpurse. there falsestarts business failure field, potentially durable system emergingin number countries, albeit still mostly embryonic form. the concept storagelocation - account - somewhere cyberspace, transfer fund bankaccount credit card, would draw cash bank store wallet. the 3bis review 28/2000schemes design essentially retail shopper, make payment pursefor item purchase internet: purse operator respond instruction transferringfunds purse account seller.you may wonder advantage scheme suppose be. why simply pay eachtransaction electronic instruction bank or, typically case retailinternet purchases, credit card? the answer digital cash purport offer three advantages.first, may cheap mean series relatively low value retail transactions.second, use cannot credit card - instance teenagers. third,it offer degree anonymity perhaps strong feel security, comparison use abank account credit card, since account-related personal data need pass individualsellers good services.however, people exercise caution utilise cyberpurse facilities. regardlessof system may presented, purse operator effect act much bank, inparticular hold money sort deposit. even initially acquire digital cash orcredit free (through loyalty bonus point scheme, example), accumulate “savings”represent value would doubtless wish protect. customer want assure themoney credit point safe hands. regulators, too, may desire verify bank activityis take place unlawful, although first need ascertain location virtualoperation (a task almost contradiction terms) identify applicablejurisdiction. although scheme maximum sum anyone may hold pursemay, moment, quite modest, scale potential loss limited, need establishthe foundation prudent behaviour regulation preparation time sum may bemuch larger.thus far i look phenomenon e-banking e-payments largely theregulatory point view. i would like turn examine whether noteworthyimplications key central bank responsibility monetary policy.i want first consider possible implication physical currency. central bank theirgovernment shareholder enjoy steady stream profit issue currency form ofnotes coin - so-called seignorage. it noteworthy public’s demand currency hasbeen much le affect year one might expect emergence successivenew form non-cash payment cheque cards. and personally i would doubt whether thedevelopment cyberpurses, cybercash cyberpayments would much impact cash incirculation, rate near term. but suppose i wrong. suppose completerevolution cybercash, include electronic stored-value cards, substantially displacesphysical currency within years. how central bank react?in circumstances, central bank would lose important source income would findways replace it. perhaps central bank would lose financial independence becomedependent - hitherto - subvention government budget. but broadersense welcome development would evidence economy awhole enjoy efficient le expensive mean money hold transmission.with regard operational aspect monetary policy pursuit general macroeconomicobjective stability value currency, advent new mean payment would, itcaught significant extent, impact public’s allocation money hold asbetween physical currency, various form deposit and, now, electronic forms. this turn mightaffect monetary statistic interpretation. however, change would occurgradually. besides, nowadays scarcely central bank rely single-mindedly andexclusively upon measure money supply guide monetary policy decisions. therefore i donot believe anything much worry front.next, suggest internet bank various manifestation could introduceadditional unpredictable volatility world financial market enable million people toswitch fund investment currency click mouse. in general i amsceptical worries. global financial market already exploit it age bi review 28/20004immediacy information electronic deal years. capital already hugely mobile inboth scale speed. i doubt whether inclusion new player retail level would muchof additional impact.in particular case monetary policy support capital controls, however, internet bankingmay make enforcement control difficult, since would operationally easy thosewishing evade regulation maintain offshore bank accounts. of course, every bank reputablejurisdictions place rigorous procedure combat money-laundering, procedure donot normally result customer turn away merely try escape capital controlsor tax regime home countries.similar consideration lead observer enquire whether internet might encouragesubstitution national currency, result dollarisation also perhaps weaken thecentral bank’s influence domestic monetary conditions. if internet facility enable encouragepeople either economise usage money (for example net payment due among twoor party practise barter) reduce frequency movement money (forexample leave export receipt internet account order pay imports, rather thanrepatriating first), may prospect general reduction transaction traffic allcurrencies. the usage may fall others. i not, however, see anything particularlysinister developments, except extent internet might facilitate avoidance ruleson remittances. the survival national currency acceptability public continue todepend central bank carry responsible monetary policy protect value thecurrency. discharge duty materially affect impede technologicaldevelopments payment methods. the central bank’s ability influence interest rate theexchange rate market operation diminished.i conclude that, all, concern central bank monetary policy role thatarise development e-commerce; impact likely gradual andcentral bank able adapt readily structural change thefinancial sector years. for reason discuss earlier, however, challenge bankingregulatory side central bank likely rather greater.

what objectives? how thoseobjectives best pursued? let say first quick-fix single answer. the21st century financial marketplace dynamic, complex, supervisor must work within thepolitical reality respective nations. instead, i envision flexible, multi-faceted strategythat emphasize prudence prevention, compatibility market, foster close andcooperative partnership private public sector.with priority mind, i believe three essential element modern supervisionframework:• effective bank-level management;• market discipline; and• official supervision.let discus turn, note reinforce others effectivelypromote safe sound financial system.effective bank-level managementprimary responsibility safe sound operation bank institution lie board ofdirectors senior management. the purpose board

theimportance good corporate governance, basic element include:• independent competent outside directors;• capable experience management;• coherent corporate strategy business plan; and• clear line responsibility accountability.together, element contribute overall operate process conducive long-term health andprosperity. a tightly run ship discipline crew lead experience competent cadre ofofficers far good able survive long journey inevitably confront sudden storms.closely relate good corporate governance critical bank institution’s well-being arigorous internal control apparatus. of course, effective internal control system always beencentrally important sound banking. this point become clear consider moment theirbasic purposes:• provide reasonable assurance bank’s customers’

willincreasingly case activity bank financial institution become morecomplex global.market disciplineafter effective management bank level, second line defense financial instability ismarket discipline. a financial institution activity become complex, diversify andglobal, market discipline become even important ally official supervisor.of course, effective market discipline possible without meaningful public disclosure. whilesignificant progress make recent years, unfortunately remain case disclosurepractices keep pace rapid change banks’ business activity risk exposures,and exposure measure managed. for situation fully remedied,notions proprietary information public domain need change.knowing company’s appetite risk approach to, methodology for, manage risk isessential understand risk shareholder, creditor counterparty. i stronglyencourage financial market participant approach issue disclosure user financialstatements rather issuers. what need know comfortable andsecure make credit decision drive debate, rather concern proprietaryinformation.there little question urgency achieve dramatic progress area. clearly, fullappreciation risk cannot achieve without

anoverall strategy promote preserve financial stability, neither substitute critical bi review 27/20006role play official supervision. while bank perform function indispensable thesuccess market

supervisor play problem cases, public enforcement andthrough le visible means, cannot overstated.changes financial service industry present new challenge official supervision becarried effectively. it clear fundamental approach, scope methodology ofofficial supervision must evolve line way financial institution manage activities,which increasingly along business line rather legal entities.with

revise 1988 accord. a know, capitalhas played, continue play, important role supervisory tool kit. adequate capital helpsensure shareholder monitor risk financial institutions, management put placeand maintain appropriate oversight mechanism help prevent problem surface firstplace. should institution experience difficulties, capital serf buff absorb loss andreduce risk spillover problem institution financial institutions.the primary tool capital regulation currently set minimum ratio devise 1988by basel committee bank supervision. they set forth agreement know thebasel accord, adopted, among reasons, address slide international capitallevels occur previous decade. the accord clearly milestone achievement -for first time, supervisor g10 country able use common yardstick assessingbanks’ capital adequacy.but accord number serious shortcomings. for example, adequatelydifferentiate among degree credit risk and, result, bank incentive take high bi review 27/20008risk exposure within broad risk categories. bank also tend engage transaction thatlower capital requirement without reduce economic risk.in addition, prove difficult incorporate accord’s simple risk-weighting scheme theinnovations last decade way bank manage mitigate risk. a market risk managementtechniques developed, able incorporate state-of-the-art, value-at-risk approach 1996market risk amendment. still, credit risk management technique advanced, theimportance operational risk management increasingly recognized, become apparentthat long run relevance efficacy basel ratio indicator capital adequacy beeneroded.supervisors long know analyze simple capital ratio isolation lead incorrectconclusions relative strength institutions. thus, also rely review banks’capital plan market discipline ass capital adequacy. in june last year, baselcommittee formalize link element release consultative paper layingout vision new, refine capital adequacy framework.in addition establish minimum capital requirements, propose framework place increasedemphasis supervisory review capital adequacy role market discipline. we refer tothese element - minimum standards, supervisory review market discipline - “three pillars”.together pillar mutually reinforce safety soundness align capital relative risk andby encourage prudent risk management. this evolution committee’s think capitaladequacy follow much recent work risk management survey haveconducted banks’ disclosure practices. it also consistent broad notion supervisioni’ve discuss today.we encourage comment committee’s proposal supervisor industryparticipants 31 march 2000 - next week - plan publish, hopefully early nextyear, comprehensive set proposal responsive comment input havereceived.let highlight briefly three pillar provide perspective key challengesthat committee face relation each. the first pillar minimum capital requirements. toaddress shortcoming 1988 accord, basel committee propose two primaryapproaches:• enhance standardize approach tie risk weight external credit assessmentssuch credit ratings; and• internal ratings-based approach would begin map internal risk rat intostandardized risk weightings, might eventually evolve something close fulluse credit risk models.each approach treat trade-off simplicity accuracy somewhat differently thus oneor likely relevant bank different level sophistication. most importantly,both propose approach attempt introduce great risk sensitivity minimum capitalstandards address unfortunate incentive problem evolve 1988 accord.some observer - including, perhaps, room - note effort incorporategreater risk-sensitivity framework inevitably introduce procyclicality standards. thatis, capital requirement loan trouble borrower tend increase point whensuch trouble become apparent. this important point, one committee areworking address. it view global financial system need move toward addressingpotential credit problem preemptively - problem time grow minordisturbances major disruptions. to best accomplish objective, supplement regulatorycapital incremental graduated, rather sudden ratchet could potentiallyreinforce cyclical downturn.the second pillar propose new capital adequacy framework supervisoryreview capital - critical complement minimum capital requirements. the consultative paper 9bis review 27/2000proposes supervisor ensure bank sound internal process place assessthe adequacy capital base thorough evaluation risks. in evaluate strength andweaknesses bank’s internal allocation process, supervisor would draw on, among things,their knowledge best practice across institutions.i want stress propose approach way intend replace judgment expertise ofbank management, shift responsibility capital adequacy supervisors. on contrary, iswell understand bank manager complete understand risk theirinstitutions face, bank’s director primary responsibility overseeingthose risks. the task supervisor framework evaluate well bank assessingtheir capital need relative risks, include whether bank appropriately address therelationship different type risks. most importantly, propose second pillar thebasel committee intend foster active dialogue bank supervisors.the third element propose new capital adequacy framework market discipline. a idiscussed earlier, extensive disclosure great dependence market disciplinecomplements improvement bank-level management, official supervision minimum capitalstandards. some area federal reserve believe good candidate greaterdisclosure would include component regulatory capital, risk concentration transactionsinvolving recourse, securitizations.to extent bank develop discipline internal approach evaluate capital adequacy, andgreater disclosure enhance market discipline, supervisor able place great reliance allthree pillar reduce regulatory inconsistencies. the common interest keep basel standardsas floor sufficient ensure financial soundness, bank choose tooperate.conclusionin conclusion, clearly ambitious agenda perfect refine supervisoryframework twenty-first century. in implement agenda, always keep mindthe fundamental objective - preserve financial stability bank broad financialsystem effectively perform critical function market economy. there question thatthe effectively bank financial system operates, likely economy toflourish citizen society prosper.this particularly true many emerge market economy relative scarcity save inrelation large-scale investment needs. the bank sector emerge market economy alsotends concentrate represent large share domestic financial system,suggesting that, problem occur, likely amplify effect real economy andon fiscal cost associate bank rescue resolution costs.in pursue objective financial stability, must also acknowledge public andprivate sector critical role play. while perspective market participant officialsupervisors may differ time time, objective - maintain strong vibrantfinancial system long term. indeed, clearly evident me, former commercial bankerand supervisor, work together, meet responsibility andreinforcing other, able successfully manage supervise rapidly evolving,ever-more complex financial service industry. 1bis review 17/2000mr roth remark euro swiss franc: two sister currencies?speech mr jean-pierre roth, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank,at swiss business association annual general meeting, singapore, 24 february 2000.* * *for year now, euro reality. it crown decade long process ofmonetary integration europe. the introduction common currency eleven closely related, butindependent country unique experiment. it still early ass far-reachingimplications monetary revolution. therefore, think remark i go expresstoday intermediate provisional.1.consequences euro swiss economyswitzerland part monetary union. it nonetheless deeply integrate europeanenvironment geographic situation strong historical, cultural economic link

national currency definitively locked. that mean foreign trade lessdiversified currency early fluctuation sf/euro exchange rate evenstronger impact swiss economy former sf/dm sf/ff exchange rates. at sametime, common monetary policy europe likely lead - time - strongersynchronization business activity emu member states. this, turn, mean impact ofthe european business cycle swiss economy become even thus also stronger.more ever, switzerland’s economic destiny link europe.today, switzerland benefit already technical simplification induce substitution often different currency single one. monetary unification bring advantage internationallyoriented firm simplify foreign currency management account procedures.from year 2002 onward, euro exist form cash, single currency willmake thing

accord tothe market destination products. in long run, transparency promote efficiency foreu-members non-members. the almost daily news merger acquisition europe isan expression ongoing fight favorable position unify european market.2.extraordinary stability swiss franc/euro exchange rate past ...after remark general consequence euro switzerland, let u turn themore specific, nonetheless central, question exchange rate swiss franc bi review 17/20002euro. a already mentioned, exchange rate swiss franc euro crucialimportance swiss economy. so far, relation two currency remarkablystable. since introduction single currency, swiss franc/euro exchange rate fluctuatedin extremely narrow band 2%. thus, exchange rate volatility even lowerthan 8% volatility observable swiss franc deutsche mark threeyears precede monetary unification.the extreme stability exchange rate surprise many observers, include swiss nationalbank itself. it lead notion “sister currencies”, euro big sister swissfranc follow everywhere like shadow. but swiss franc really euro’s little sister? letme discus question detail.if one examine reason extraordinary stability exchange rate, one quickly find thatconvergence fundamental play central role. both europe switzerland sufferedfrom slow growth 1990s deflation fear aftermath international financialcrisis 1998. rise unemployment weak economic activity lead ecb snb adoptan expansive monetary stance cut interest rates. broad similitude business cycle andmonetary stance create condition lead almost fix exchange rate euro andthe swiss franc. at time, converge fundamental explain currency beenequally weak u dollar: american business cycle well advance europeanand swiss business cycles, require different policy response fed.while fundamental play key role explain long run exchange rate developments, politicalfactors also importance short run. by political factor i mean, example,elections, government crises, political conflict new legislation, also relation thegovernment central bank, credibility both. in 1999, widely define politicalfactors may play role relation euro u dollar. the conflictbetween former german finance minister lafontaine european central bank, europeanundecidedness face kosovo conflict, plan harmonization tax interestpayments, example, may contribute weakness euro dollar. inaddition, always clear communication strategy european central bank concern itsviews exchange rate euro may also create uncertainty.however, puzzle see relation swiss franc euro beendisturbed factors. it may market perceive switzerland strongly integratedin europe almost forget swiss franc independent currency. or, believedthat swiss national bank, declare early uncertain day introduction theeuro, would tolerate sharp appreciation swiss franc. expectation snb reactioncertainly play role.in view, factor may explain great stability swiss franc vis-à-vis europeancurrencies. one cannot exclude emergence large market euro structuralimpact demand swiss francs. today, currency diversification international portfoliosoccurs block (dollars, euros, yen sterling). give size traditional low volatilityvis-à-vis dm, market swiss franc denominate asset offer attractive way tocounterbalance risk bear large hold key currencies. our currency thus le demandedas reserve currency le involve speculative capital movements. this basically good newsfor swiss economy.3.... future?what conclusion draw past? will swiss franc remain stable vis-à-vis euro, orwill see independent development currency? again, answer question willdepend crucially economic fundamental switzerland euro-zone. in areas, theeconomy recover recession, follow steady upward path. the expect growthrates year amount 2.2% switzerland 2.9% euro-zone. the central question 3bis review 17/2000for exchange market extent economic upturn could endanger price stability, whatkind central bank’s reaction expected.3.1uncertainty last convergence european swiss fundamentalswhile europe grow faster, still suffer unemployment rate roughly 10%. atfirst sight, one might think big labor reservoir would allow economy grow withouttensions labor market without large wage adjustments. inflation would remain subdued, andthere would need restrictive monetary policy. this, however, “firstsight” scenario. european unemployment largely structural, mean although ademand labor part firms, demand necessarily match supply thelabor market. under circumstances, labor market could constitute bottleneck growthand lead inflationary pressure. to prevent inflation rising, european central bank wouldhave increase interest rates. clearly, structural adjustment essence europe. inthe absence flexibility, unemployment rate cannot low significantly doubt existabout actual room maneuver monetary authorities.expected growth switzerland, hand, look quite moderate international standards.thus, one might think little danger inflation swiss national bank shouldfurther support seemingly fragile economic upturn. a look labor market, however, showsanother picture. unemployment fall steadily since summer 1997 low rate 2.3%only. it recent increase 2.6% due seasonal factors. moreover, already clear sign ashortage labor market. strong growth could thus fuel well-known wage-price spiral.under circumstances, tighten monetary policy realistic hypothesis.to make thing even difficult, high degree uncertainty concern developmentof labor productivity europe switzerland. the rise labor productivity usually see asthe main factor behind spectacular performance u economy, characterize high growthand low inflation. will productivity also start rise switzerland europe? where risemore? in switzerland, labor market flexible structural reform moreadvanced, europe, large common market single currency expect breakup old structures?we good reason believe potential non-inflationary economic growth inswitzerland. investment strong 1998 first part 1999, deregulation andcompetition make spectacular progress, large-scale adjustment take place variouseconomic sector flexibility accept labor market. some adjustment theinterest rate make order restore neutral monetary stance. in one word, thedegree competitiveness economy strong today 5 10 year ago, productioncapacities fully exhaust monetary condition adjusted. switzerland willthus benefit recovery europe without major risk inflationary pressures.indeed, assessment future stability exchange rate swiss franc eurodepends crucially happen switzerland surround countries. if theconvergence fundamental go on, exchange rate remain relatively stable; otherwisesome adjustment needed. i convinced, however, exchange market behaveirrationally. follow pattern dm/sf relationship past, depart substantiallyfrom fundamental would suggest.3.2political uncertaintieswhat political factor influence exchange rate? i would like mention two majorthemes could possibly affect relation swiss franc euro.the first factor uncertainty switzerland’s future policy towards europe. a mayknow, swiss people reject switzerland’s membership european economic area (eea) indecember 1992. this vote regard anti-eu signal government, since thenshelved plan adhesion eu. a alternative, switzerland negotiate bilateral bi review 17/20004agreements eu order gain free access eu internal market good services.the agreement need pas popular vote next may. the prospect adoption theagreements good. sooner later, however, question switzerland’s accession eu willbe consider again. should swiss people still favor switzerland outside eu, roomfor monetary independence remain.the second political factor uncertainty eu enlargement. there long list easterneuropean mediterranean country push eu. of course, eu enlargement aprogressive step-by-step process. nevertheless, uncertain today enlargement changethe eu’s face future. how country integrated? how decision-makingprocess inside eu affected? and finally, eu enlargement financed? all theseopen question constitute potential risk factor euro.4. conclusionslooking back first 14 month euro swiss perspective, strikingobservation extraordinary stability swiss franc/euro exchange rate. a detail analysisshows stability due high degree convergence economic fundamental themonetary reaction two central banks. thus, solid economic reason behind thisstability artificial strategy currency peg implement secret snb. in thefuture, exchange rate evolve depend development fundamental - inswitzerland euro-zone - answer important political questions. exchangerate stability, scale experience far, guarantee last forever. however,the risk erratic movement seem limit presence large currency block loweredthe attractiveness swiss franc reserve currency.nevertheless, i would hesitate today qualify euro swiss franc “sister currencies”. ifyou sister, remain sister life case common interests. we shouldrather consider two currency travel companions: share objective - soundmacroeconomic development - follow road towards price stability. it theirrelative fitness see whether continue hand hand. 1bis review 16/2000mr meyer answer question “how surplus affect theformulation conduct monetary policy?”speech mr laurence h meyer, member board governor u federal reservesystem, 16th annual policy conference, national association business economics,washington, d.c. 23 february 2000.* * *this conference fiscal policy, specifically allocate potential future surplusesamong debt reduction, tax cuts, spend increases. the question i might ask rightnow is: monetary policymaker here? you know, course, i always enjoy visitingwith fellow nabe members. but contribution i make important topic?my assignment answer question: how prevail surplus and, especially, decisionsabout allocation future potential surplus affect formulation conduct monetarypolicy? the best way understand issue involved, view, concept thepolicy mix. use concept allow u focus implication alternative combinationsof monetary fiscal policy - yield level aggregate demand - real interestrate, composition output, current account balance. and also help u understandthe key source interdependence monetary fiscal policy decisions.in plan remark today, i intend first discus analytics politics policymix illustrate power analysis use explain importantfeatures current experience. for example, swing structural budget balance clearlyhelps explain increase national save rate high level investment relative togdp expansion. however, important feature recent macroeconomic experience -specifically absence large decline real interest rate significant deterioration thecurrent account balance - appear least superficially inconsistent prediction thestandard analytics.one problem, i believe, assumption recent dramatic swing structural budgetbalance drive exclusively policy. perhaps even important developmentsthat affect real interest rate current account balance period. i could sumup problem note “ceteris” aren’t always “paribus”.i conclude discuss implication monetary policy option allocation the“potential” surplus. because option involve alternative policies, standard framework shouldprovide appropriate guidance project outcome - ceteris paribus, course. i focus twoways fiscal policy choice could affect monetary policy. first, fiscal policy choice willaffect interest rate consistent full employment price stability. second, gradual reductionand ultimate retirement federal government debt would require change way monetarypolicy implemented.the analytics policy mixthe policy mix useful device understand interaction monetary fiscalpolicies. there infinite combination monetary fiscal policy yield level ofaggregate demand. the different combination

monetary policy (point a compare point b figure 1(6 kb)) imply low interest rate, high share investment (and, general, interest-sensitivecomponents spending) gdp, low value dollar, high level net export andhence current account surplus. therefore, select particular policy mix, policymakers canaffect amount capital formation current account balance. 3bis review 16/2000the simple version is-lm

modelswould also show explicitly increase exchange rate associate decline currentaccount balance response policy mix result high real interest rates. finally, moresophisticated model could also take account second dimension fiscal policy changes. notonly change tax rate spend affect aggregate demand, also affect aggregatesupply, example, alter after-tax wage rate after-tax rate return save andinvestment. the effect change policy mix also affect supply-side incentivesincorporated fiscal part mix.the politics policy mix: monetary policy respond fiscal policy?how choice policy mix get made? an interest question! no, ajoint committee policy mix consider benefit alternative mix reach ajudgment. the policy mix determine sequential decisionmaking, subject understand ofthe structure economy likely response policymakers one’s policyactions.in view, process work follows. the administration congress together makedecisions determine fiscal part policy mix. over last 20 years, decisionsgenerally base consideration long-run objective aspromotion high longer-term growth, short-run stabilization. make decisionstakes considerable time dynamic annual budget process legislativeprocess. the current year’s decision incorporate follow years’ decision areanticipated fiscal policy assumption underlie federal reserve’s forecast, extend ayear two. the federal reserve

fiscal policymakers make fundamental decision policy mix. monetarypolicymakers smooth transition new equilibrium, minimize effect output relativeto full employment prices. because monetary policy adjust continuously change theeconomy, include result fiscal policy, make sense think fiscal policydecisions make first monetary policy decision conditional fiscal decisions.so mean monetary policy

exchange rates, demand u export due change growth prospect abroad. eachand development affect macroeconomic development forecast driveadjustments monetary policy pursuit full employment price

adirect approach). however, look reduce form equation endogenous monetarypolicy instrument, shall, sure, find - lurk right-hand side - exogenouscomponents fiscal policy decision - level discretionary

thefiscal year 1994 budget adopted. such dramatic swing budget balance might beenexpected yield particularly dramatic confirmation prediction analytic model, theform sharp decline real interest rate significant improvement current accountbalance.in fact, period dramatic swing budget balance, real interest rate notdeclined, current account balance significantly deteriorated. if hadn’t alreadysuspected, find real world always complex, much moreinteresting, simple models. two explanation conflict theoretical predictionand recent experience possible. first, precede analysis fundamentally flawed. second, isat least incomplete. i take second route argue problem ceteris notparibus episode.ceteris paribus, course, mean “all thing equal”. in models, way ofexamining effect one shock, hold constant shock could effect variable inquestion. in class model simulations, always impose ceteris paribus. indeed, ceterisparibus implicitly assume way section analytics. in real world, donot option. in addition, analytics, hold output fix potential, abstractedfrom effect cyclical influence budget balance, interest rates, currentaccount.the key get right answer analysis identify correctly multiple shock thatinduced swing ratio deficit gdp affect real interest rate currentaccount, well take account effect cyclical developments. i assume theanalytics policy mix non-cyclical change deficit due change policy -some combination increase tax rate cutback government spending. indeed, specificfiscal policy action make characterization appear qualitatively correct. but explain real-world outcome also allow role influences, specifically structural change.a portion swing budget balance course due cyclical upswing. in ouranalytics, able control hold level output constant

current account deficit.once again, appear increase economy’s trend rate productivity growth play astarring role explanation recent macroeconomic developments.in discuss interaction swing federal budget increase theproductivity trend, i focus latter may offset tendency former tolower real interest rates. but, course, interaction work directions. the increase theequilibrium real interest rate, expect result increase productivity trend, also aceteris paribus result. it depend critically assume fiscal policy rule. for example, tax ratesare constant government spend remain constant share gdp, high productivitytrend will, general, yield high equilibrium real interest rate. however, real (or nominal)government spend hold constant, surplus rise time share gdp, puttingdownward pressure

especially nature supply-sideincentives spend tax changes. ceteris paribus, monetary policy - run sensiblereaction function - end validate high equilibrium real interest rate, keep price

policyspeech give mr masaru hayami, governor bank japan, research institute ofjapan, tokyo, 21 march 2000.* * *i honor invite meet give opportunity address distinguishedguests.more year pass since bank japan launch zero interest rate policy february1999. during time, japan’s economy show significant improvement thank aggressivemonetary easing, fiscal stimulus measures, restoration financial system stability. underlyingconditions recovery private demand business fix investment householdconsumption also continue improve. nevertheless, still need carefully monitor theeffects improvement spend behavior household firms, particularly since theeconomy face various structural problems. and, view fact japan’s budget deficitis large among major industrial countries, note stimulus fiscalpolicy side easy option.under circumstances, voice call additional measure monetary policy front havetended become louder. and, begin argue tolerate little bite inflation. in fact,we receive increase number question ask view “inflation policy” andinflation targeting. though single definition inflation policy, include policieswhich somehow artificially create inflation inflationary expectations. before respond thequestions, first need review significance price stability. in regard, bank japanhas recently announce conduct comprehensive study price stability, today’sspeech regard prelude study.1.why price stability important?significance price stabilitythe new bank japan law come effect april 1998 stipulate objective ofmonetary policy “contribute sound development national economy thepursuit price stability”. when emphasize importance price stability, sometimescriticized bank japan concern inflation regardless current economicconditions. let start explain criticism point.price stability important provide foundation kind economic activity andthe people’s livelihood.the market economy structure within firm household make decision regardingconsumption investment base price individual good services. and, general pricelevel concept consolidate individual price various good service trade country.in words, level individual price evaluate general price level ayardstick. in framework, price stability mean yardstick reliable. if so, change inconsumer preference progress technological innovation efficiently translate intochanges individual prices. thus, firm able use change relative price signal fortheir future business strategy. from macroeconomic viewpoint, economic environment iscontinuously changing, stable price facilitate smooth reallocation resource labor andcapital also technological innovation response to, example, consumer trends, therebyensuring sound economic growth long run. bi review 26/20002if price fluctuate considerably yardstick become unreliable, signal function ofindividual price greatly weakened. in case, labor capital easily transferredto growth industries, inefficient allocation resource ensue. in addition, economywith unstable price likely experience unstable business cycles. this, turn, make difficultfor firm household formulate prospect regard profit income, obstruct soundinvestment activity. thus, price stability impaired, long-term growth rate decline.furthermore, price fluctuation distort income distribution. for example, inflation occurs, withfinancial asset fix nominal terms, bank deposits, see fall realvalue. conversely, financial liability benefit reduction real value. a aresult, inequality asset liability arise. in contrast, deflationoccurs, reverse inequality follow.policy objective bank japanas such, price stability lay foundation sound economic development viewpoint ofboth efficiency fairness.the bank japan aim price stability neither deflationary inflationary. it amistake think bank concern inflationary risks.this understand conduct monetary policy recent period. in february 1999,the bank embark drastic monetary easing, namely zero interest rate policy. and april, itmade clear firm intent maintain policy deflationary concern dispelled.in view current economic condition price developments, japan’s economy judge bein middle deflation. what frighten deflation induce vicious circle call adeflationary spiral whereby price decline reduce corporate profit wage which, turn, lead aslowdown business activity price declines. these call “pernicious pricedeclines”. in fact, high risk japan’s economy fall deflationary spiral upuntil around spring 1999, concern risk materialize greatly subside thepast year. both cpi wpi almost level. corporate profit increase andeconomic activity gradually pick up. though true price number product havebeen declining, backdrop various revolutionary change include so-called itrevolution, is, progress technological innovation information telecommunications, aswell revolution distribution network represent emergence so-called “categorykillers”. such phenomenon cannot necessarily regard pernicious price declines.nevertheless, bank continue extremely accommodative policy symbolize thezero interest rate policy. this because, judgment, might face risk perniciousprice decline time confident japan’s economy achieve recoveryunderpinned private demand.as such, bank japan conduct monetary policy pay due consideration onlyto inflation also deflation.2.problems inflation policytwo view inflation targetingrecently various discussion set specific numerical target inflation ratein order achieve price stability, namely inflation targeting.at outset, note two different view discuss japan titleof inflation targeting. originally, inflation target policy framework enhance transparencyregarding conduct monetary policy strengthen credibility commitment pricestability. however, advocate so-called inflation target vein inflation policy. 3bis review 26/2000thus, discuss inflation target original concept, let say word theproblems involve inflation policy.inflation policy well-defined concept. most typically, professor krugman mitadvocates, policy aim somewhat high inflation rate 4 5% mobilize allpossible measure achieve target. professor krugman appear assert ratherextreme policy prescription base pessimistic view japan’s economy. a matter fact,however, japan’s economy start improve. and, judgment that, economicconditions, never adopt policy contrary price stability.there variation inflation policy say moderate inflation rate 2 3% tolerable itmay vitalize economic activity. however, give current situation japan price almostlevel, proposal tantamount artificially create inflation. furthermore, implement aproposal, many suggest bank japan increase outright purchase ofgovernment bond underwrite them. some even advocate bank japan purchasestocks real estate. thus, start proposal aim moderate inflation rate 2 3%under disguise inflation target price stability end inflationpolicy inflation artificially create cost.inflation solution economic problemsregarding inflation policy, first foremost, i would like point inflation solution toeconomic problems. inflation policy assume moderate inflation revitalize economic activity,alleviate debt burden firm well financial institutions, relieve fiscal deficitproblem. apparently advocate inflation policy argue, take due account itsnegative effects, intend positive effect would great negative effect thecurrent situation. but, look closely, intend positive effect would notlikely achieved.needless say, financial market today sufficiently develop major industrial countries,including japan, integrate global scale. and thus prospect economy price injapan considerable interest investor worldwide. here, let u assume bank japanannounces target inflation rate market participant home abroad believe theannounced target achieved. a well-developed financial market would immediately discountthis announcement long-term interest rate yield government bond would rise evenbefore actually observe inflation. in theory, nominal interest rate define sum thereal interest rate expect rate inflation. therefore, announcement, nominalinterest rate would push degree rise expect rate inflation,leaving real interest rate, influence economic activity, unchanged.furthermore, since uncertainty regard future normally increase inflation rises, wouldbe great possibility long-term interest rate might rise amount correspond tothe increase expect rate inflation risk premium accompany higheruncertainty. if happened, debt burden firm fiscal deficit would likely increaserather decrease real terms. the increase long-term interest rate would also adverseimpact economic activity business fix investment. therefore, policy create inflationwould likely turn counterproductive objective initially intend achieve.those propose solve economic problem way inflation often refer experiencesof history develop countries. but, compare experiences, japan today place atotally different situation term development financial market globalization.indeed, would face problem i mention whether target inflation rate 4 5% or2 3%. in regard, emphasize japan need increase realeconomic growth, rise inflation. bi review 26/20004difficulty control inflationthe second point inflation likely uncontrollable triggered. once inflationaryexpectations take firm hold society, tend proliferate. worker would demand high wageincreases would otherwise case. if wage cost rise, firm would try pas toproduct prices. such economy built-in risk increase inflationary pressure.some argue since bank japan independent central bank, raise inflation rateto 2 3% contain around level even exist upward pressure. however,if try contain inflation gain momentum, would need strong monetarytightening, might result substantial deterioration economic activity steep climb inunemployment. while true bank japan power contain inflation, also truethat enormous cost would impose society suppress inflation triggered.in fact, prevail think major industrial country 1970s hold economy would bebetter little inflation tolerated. partly lax monetary policy, worldeconomy experience high inflation 1970s first half 1980s. and containsuch inflation, many country experience hardship high unemployment. because ofsuch bitter historical experience, major industrial country discard idea little bitof inflation improve economic activity. mainstream think say price stability shouldbe maintain policy prevent inflation arise first place.problems monetary easingthe third point concern measure create inflation. in japan, already exhaust orthodoxmonetary ease measures. even want create modest inflation, would resortto unorthodox measure increase purchase government bond evenunderwriting them. but note risk negative side effect mightbe quite large bank implement unorthodox measures. the severity japan’s fiscalsituation attract attention world. thus, bank japan start purchasinggovernment bond large quantities, credibility would likely impaired. long-terminterest rate would rise high risk premium occasion deterioration thecreditworthiness japanese government. adoption drastic policy would run highrisk erode fiscal discipline smooth function financial market also thecredibility japan itself.effects zero interest rate policyhaving say this, ask whether anything term ofmonetary policy. a matter fact, zero interest rate policy extremely powerful policy toolfor monetary easing. under framework zero interest rate policy maintain untildeflationary concern dispelled, uncertainty economic outlook increases, time oflifting zero interest rate policy automatically delayed. by take account automaticprolongation current monetary policy, long-term interest rate promptly decline. thus, zerointerest rate policy powerful posse flexibility automatically absorbing, certainextent, effect negative shock economy.currently, japan’s economy start improve. industrial production continue rise, theincrease corporate profit confirmed. though remain uncertainty regard thefuture, observe quite number new development area information andtelecommunications. at juncture, i believe important promote structural reform andcreate environment conducive revitalize corporate sector economy underpinnedby fiscal monetary policy. 5bis review 26/20003.inflation targetingoriginal inflation targetingnext, let talk original concept inflation targeting. basically, policy frameworkthat emphasize strong commitment central bank maintain price stability enhancesthe transparency regard conduct monetary policy.inflation target adopt country unite kingdom, new zealand, andsweden since around 1990. for example, unite kingdom, target inflation rate set at2.5% price index roughly equivalent cpi. at monthly monetary policy committeemeetings, bank england discus outlook inflation determine necessarychange interest rate take due account time lag effect monetary policy tomaterialize bring inflation around 2.5% span two years. once every quarter thebank england release inflation report explain conduct monetary policy anddescribes prospect economy price course follow two years.while implementation inflation target differ country country, fundamental commonfactors (a) set target inflation rate, (b) conduct monetary policy aim achievingthe target medium term, (c) make available substantial amount informationincluding economic outlook basis policy judgment. it note thecentral bank require achieve target inflation rate short run. the aim inflationtargeting contain inflationary expectation enhance accountability regard monetary policyby make numerical target medium-term objective.this original concept inflation target may merits. in fact, discuss thesubject number time monetary policy meetings. however, moment, i think adoptionof framework japan present many difficult problems.price development japanas far price concerned, stable japan.inflation target originally adopt policy framework gear toward price stability thosecountries suffer high inflation. for example, unite kingdom, averagerate inflation 5% 1980s, reach 7 8% 1990 1991. andin 1992 inflation target introduced. in case unite kingdom, set target inflationrate 2.5% equivalent announce strong commitment contain inflation maintainingprice stability.in contrast, since early 1980s effect second oil shock wan japan, theaverage rate cpi increase low around 1%, 3% peak thebubble period economy overheated. in case japan, price extremelystable nearly twenty years. thus, put situation set anyinflation target maintain price stability even solve difficult problem asdefining measure price stability.new price revolutionthe problem define measure price stability whether set appropriate numericaltarget inflation base specific price index.in addition rather difficult problem, need consider possibility major industrialcountries, include japan, enter “new price revolution era”. such development bornof rapid expansion economic activity relate information telecommunications, otherwords “it revolution”. this characterize extremely rapid technological innovation whichinduces price decline improvement productivity development new products.since mid-1990s unite state witness stable low inflation extremely low bi review 26/20006unemployment, partly economic expansion support it revolution. thisphenomenon contradict past experience.in addition worldwide it revolution, japan experience dramatic change itsdistribution service industry see revolution distribution networks.the progress technological innovation revolution distribution network raise two bigquestions analyze prices. the first whether price new product price developmentsunder new distribution network appropriately reflect price indexes. this theoft-discussed issue bias price indexes. in view large number new product anddistribution network available, issue might become serious previously envisaged.the second question ass price decline due revolutionary changes. if itand distribution network revolution continue current situation zero inflation, cannotrule possibility economy could recover inflation rate negative term ofthe exist price indexes, even though may sufficiently incorporate revolutionarychanges. and, case cost reduction continue thank technological innovation, even ifthe inflation rate statistically negative would appropriate judge economy beingdeflationary long recover steadily.when environment surround price likely experience dramatic changes, tocarefully examine whether possible set appropriate target inflation base existingprice indexes.desirable rate inflationwhether optimal inflation rate exactly zero percent small positive number isanother argument worth noting. follow reason optimal inflation ratecould small positive number. first, i mentioned, appear easy exist pricestatistics fully incorporate actual price decline due factor revolution distributionnetworks. this problem relate upward bias price indexes. second, since nominalwages hardly ever decline, so-called downward rigidity nominal wages,economic adjustment would proceed smoothly positive rate inflation. third zeroboundary problem interest rates. since nominal interest rates, control thecentral bank, never fall zero, room monetary ease would limit conditionsworsened. in regard, argument good positive rate inflation acushion central bank maintain room maneuver policy response needed.indeed, argument may relate fact country adopt inflation target set, inprinciple, positive target inflation, include unite kingdom 2.5% inflation atarget.however, careful examination seem warrant whether discussion example offoreign country could directly apply japan. in view fact bonus fallensubstantially labor cost reduce utilize part-time worker temporaryemployment agency past one two years, downward rigidity nominal wage injapan’s labor market may strong argued. the idea tolerate certain positiverate inflation ensure cushion monetary policy seem something like put cartbefore horse. a may know, japan average inflation rate slightly onepercent nearly twenty years. thus, would need good reason accept inflation rate of2 3%. at juncture, carefully examine content price stability bestcontributes sound development national economy take due account featuresand structure japan’s economy.toward enhance transparency monetary policyas i described, seem exist number difficult problem apply inflationtargeting japan way adopt foreign countries. a matter fact, thebank japan also federal reserve board european central bank cautious 7bis review 26/2000adopting framework. nevertheless, true bank japan keenly aware thetransparency monetary policy enhanced.since impossible foresee economic outlook certainty, neither predetermine thetiming future policy change set mechanical criterion decide policy changes. in fact,even country adopt inflation targeting, rule whereby central bank automaticallytightens monetary condition inflation hit certain target rate. in country, monetary policy isbased central bank’s judgment future price developments, influence variousfactors demand home abroad, wages, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, andtechnological innovation. in conduct monetary policy, central bank need make overalljudgment examine effect factor prices. in sense, overall judgment ofthe central bank important regardless whether framework like inflation target adopt ornot. in words, adoption inflation target mean people able know inadvance much policy interest rate changed.the transparency monetary policy is, all, nothing clarify monetary policy isaiming at, disclosing, extent possible, overall judgment central bank respectto current future economic financial conditions. with respect former, new bank ofjapan law clearly stipulate price stability objective monetary policy. with respect thelatter, bank try explain overall judgment clearly possible monthlyreport recent economic financial development minute monetary policy meetings.such disclosure stipulate new bank japan law. we thus believe transparency ofmonetary policy considerably enhance compare situation old law.at time, well aware behind heat discussion inflation targeting,market participant public call transparency respect monetary policy.truly, great transparency also important central bank viewpoint smoothtransmission policy effects. furthermore, recognize important mandate bankof japan plainly explain think conduct monetary policy price stability.bearing recognition mind, bank decide conduct comprehensive study theconcept price stability issue report around summer. the issue study include:(a) basic think regard price stability;(b) measurement prices, namely, issue regard price indexes;(c) evaluation recent price development japan; and(d) issue relate numerical quantification price stability.since i often ask relationship comprehensive study pricestability lift zero interest rate policy, let say word issue.the comprehensive study undertake intend review basic think regardingprice stability view enhance transparency monetary policy long run. and itshould understand independent current conduct monetary policy. hence, isnot directly relate issue time lift zero interest rate policy conditionswhich must fulfil lift policy. in words, imply zero

dispelled. bi review 26/200084.concluding remarks: deflationary concern dispelledi would like conclude remark today address question might decide theeconomy reach stage deflationary concern dispelled.what central concern conduct monetary policy avoid deflationary spiral, isa vicious circle price decline recession. however, difficult define spiral suchsimple figure certain percentage decline cpi. to reiterate, cannot necessarily conclude thata situation deflationary solely negative inflation rate it distribution networkrevolutions full swing. to contrary, even inflation level statistically, stagnant demandwould indicate future decline price corporate profits, mean deflationary concernshave yet dispelled. thus, price development must assess together underlie factors.furthermore, important point judge whether deflationary concern dispel toanalyze whether exist pressure pernicious price decline stem shrink demandor widen output gap.in words, become confident economic recovery sustain output gapcontinues narrow, say deflationary concern almost dispel andjapan’s economy could leave intensive care unit. in regard, need clear indicationthat economy self-sustained recovery path lead private demand, policy andexternal factors.private demand basically consist household consumption business fix investment. whileboth necessary sustainable growth, business fix investment believe play, manycases, important role give impetus virtuous circle self-sustained recovery.recently, environment surround private demand gradually improve evidence byhigher corporate profit improve sentiment firm consumers. it crucial whether suchimprovement lead increase spending. the bank japan carefully monitor economywith focus strength private demand center business

capability american sharein prosperity generated.when historian look back latter half 1990s decade two hence, i suspect willconclude live pivotal period american economic history. newtechnologies evolve cumulative innovation past half-century begin tobring dramatic change way good service produce way aredistributed final users.how arrive fascinate and, some, unsettle point history? while

consider viable candidate debt financing. equity act asa buff vagary marketplace, is, accordingly, sign creditworthiness ofa business enterprise commitment owner. this especially true lower-incomecommunities, weight expansive debt obligation small firm severely impedegrowth prospect readily lead business failures.overall, evolve economic financial system highly successful promotinggrowth high standard live majority citizens. but need reach toengage able participate. one way education train ofour workforce - is, enhance stock “human capital,” necessary complement toour ever-changing physical capital. a major consequence fast-paced technological change ofrecent year growth conceptual emphasis nation’s output increase thedemand skilled workers. in today’s economy, skill take much broad mean ithad decade two ago. today’s worker must prepare along many dimension - onlywith technical know-how also ability create, analyze, transform information andwith capacity interact effectively others. moreover, must recognize that, newtechnologies come rapidly line, skill develop today likely last lifetime.traditionally, broad human capital skill associate high education, andaccordingly demand college-trained worker increase rapidly. the result beenthat, past several decades, economic return worker college train onaverage outstrip worker stop formal school high-school diplomaor less. in past years, real wage gain college-educated worker continue rapid,but owe dynamic economic growth tighten labor markets, increase workers, onaverage, keep pace. nonetheless, wide gap wage college-educated worker andthose high-school-trained worker remains. 3bis review 26/2000another consequence rapid economic technological change need address ahigher level worker insecurity, result, i suspect, fear potential job skillobsolescence. despite tight labor market generation, worker currently report thatthey fearful lose job similar survey find 1991 bottom lastrecession. the mark move capital fail technology cut edge hasquickened pace job skill become obsolete. the completion high school equippedthe average worker sufficient skill last lifetime. that

however, long run action would slow innovation impede therise live standards. they could alter eventual shift production owe enormouschanges relative price across economy. protectionism might enable

explore way develop creative linkage betweenbusinesses educational institution good prepare student rise demand theworkplace help workers, must keep change demand must copewith consequence global competition, renew upgrade skills.as i indicate earlier, one notable aspect remarkable performance economy recentyears substantial, relatively broadly based, rise real income. during pastseveral

highlyleveraged institution (hlis). the issue improve stability function financialmarkets market participants. a extensive international discussion thisregard, i shall briefly recapitulate key development challenge ahead. 3bis review 24/2000the asian financial crisis show highly competitive globalise financial world hascreated individual market participant huge enough mobilise, often help ofleverage, financial resource large gdp small economies. they build dominatingpositions market small economy influence short-term market movement eithersingly act concert. combine lack information otc market, thehighly leverage institution develop potentially excessive destabilise marketconcentrations, whether consciously unconsciously.under circumstances, two type scenario hlis could pose concern theirinteraction financial markets. the first scenario situation hlis take excessivelylarge position overwhelm market forces. rapid deleveraging position marketsassociated default hli size ltcm could systemic impact even largeand mature markets, thereby threaten global financial system. it say repeat ofthe like ltcm debacle unlikely occur, give downsize hedge funds. icertainly hope case i also notice recovery investor sentiment seenmore money institutional investor well high net worth individual flow hedgefunds.the second scenario, commonly know “elephants pond” problem, situationwhereby hlis take large concentrate position small financial market adoptaggressive trade practice could destabilise markets. it encourage the“elephants pond” problem recognise quite extensively real issue tackled.what do enough?different approach float tackle problem arise two scenario i justdescribed. the prevail approach improve counterparty risk management. this doneindirectly ask bank financial institution prudent grant creditlines hlis, directly encourage hlis enhance risk managementstandards. this eminently logical sensible, since cautious bank lend enhancedrisk management within hli sector, hard hlis build excessiveleverage concentration major financial markets.this measure pursue earnest public private sector. the basel committeeon bank supervision, iosco issue respective guideline sound practice forinteractions hlis bank security firms. the late discussion focus kind ofsupervisory incentive compliance risk management standards. the basel committee onbanking supervision put forward two proposal revision capital accord, whichwould help address concern hlis. one abolish maximum 50% risk weight fornon-bank otc derivative exposures; encourage counterparties impose initialmargin repo transactions.from private sector, counterparty risk management policy group form twelve leadinginternational financial institution produce report june 1999. five major hedge fund alsoproduced industry group report february 2000 improve counterparty risk management andinternal control.while agree enhance risk management hlis counterparties useful first line ofdefence, two major concern remain. first, return competitive pressure may lead relaxationor even breakdown risk management standard future. there anecdotal evidencethat large hlis become le will supply information counterparties asmemories ltcm saga fading. it thus important regulator continue promote theintroduction suitable supervisory incentive would encourage continue compliance soundrisk management practice financial institutions.secondly, proposal may sufficient resolve problem face small openmarkets. even reduce overall leverage, hlis could still build large foreign exchange positionsrelative markets. it might also possible hlis build potentially destabilise bi review 24/20004positions small market remain inside internal limit leverage and/or liquidity risk.enhanced risk management cannot therefore rely upon, isolation, alleviate problem.a second proposal enhance market stability improve transparency disclosure makemarkets work better. there two major international initiative respect, one firmlevel one market level. at firm level, multidisciplinary work group onenhanced disclosure, chair peter fisher federal reserve bank new york, hasdeveloped disclosure template individual firm voluntarily disclose risk exposures. thisinitiative break new ground, first time private sector would provide moreinformation risk exposures. however, usefulness disclosure depend muchon level breakdown risk disclosure.furthermore, u president’s work group financial market recommend (a) reportingframework large hedge fund disclose meaningful frequent market risk information tothe public, (b) requirement public company disclose information materialfinancial exposure hlis. a challenge authority take similar step requiresuch standard disclosure, would help avoid possibility regulatory arbitrage.at market level, work group set g10, lead jean-pierre patat banque defrance, study feasibility collect disseminate aggregate position data foreignexchange market. i believe initiative, implemented, could help small open marketsin good understand currency market accumulation highly concentrate positions.however, november 1999, g10 governor decide proceed work thisarea. in make determination, g10 find number practical limitation tothe proposal, include difficulty obtain compliance, unfeasibility produce datain timely manner, substantial cost involved. the demise initiative leave vacuum inthe area transparency market concentration. this unfortunate international communityshould explore alternative bridge information gap.i mention two approaches, enhance counterparty risk management improvedtransparency disclosure, hopefully help address concern excessive leverageand opaqueness hlis. there remain issue aggressive trade practices, takingextreme measure manipulate price precipitate herd panic sell marketparticipants. such practice undermine market stability. i therefore call upon private sector marketparticipants review matter devise code conduct improve standard marketbehaviour practices. for code effective, i believe need market specific andapplicable market participant market.conclusionladies gentlemen, often say history, especially financial crisis, tend repeatitself. in last ten year alone, erm crisis 1992, mexican peso crisis in1994/95 late asian crisis 1997/98. notwithstanding disturbingly

approximately 1.4%,while average since 1994 1.9%. it admittedly true economy anupward phase since summer 1993, hardly surprise productivity growth thetrend; comparison correspond upward phase 1980s lead sameconclusion: rate increase labour productivity appear approximately half percentagepoint high before. this accordingly mean swedish economy’s potential annual growthrate 2 2.5%. it may asked, however, whether one simply project productivity’shistorical path.this discussion know new economy come in. productivity growth inthe unite state rise appreciably recent years. the investment boom 1990s beenone factor here; corporate investment almost double since 1990 large share goneinto new information technology. this lead economic jargon refer capitaldeepening, amount high capital input

development unemployment. agrowing part play supply-side factor form occupational geographicalmobility.so conclude near future swedish economy’s growth rate may becapable top potential level - i indicate - 2 2.5%, apply foras long supply labour appropriate train occupational experience thepossibility geographically available.according recent national accounts, publish christmas, gdp growth

private consumption, example. a continuationof strong development suggested, moreover, lead indicator household confidence,a high increase money supply rapidly rise asset prices.this imply sooner later, nothing done, rapid growth present would lead tooverheating acceleration inflation. one factor behind current trend monetarypolicy’s stimulatory direction ever since repo rate cut initiate 1998. this illustratesthat complete business cycle, repo rate 2.90% apply last november toolow. gdp growth current rate 3.5-4% imply expansion demand clearly exceedsthe rate 2-2.5% economy cope long

take rather long time shift theeconomy onto new course - necessary make adjustment neutral monetarystance. thus, gdp growth continue high rate time come then, perhapsone two years, successively slacken towards economy’s long-term potential.the task riksbank endeavour perform achieve economic transition fairlynormal upward phase growth trend sustainable. this task, simple,follows implicitly statutory function “maintaining price stability”. a i mention earlier,a low stable rate inflation normally mean economy continue expand inaccordance long-term potential.one cannot certain, however, repo rate hike since november suffice bring aboutsuch adjustment path economic growth. the impact demand monetary policy isprobably still stimulatory. but repo rate represent neutral monetary policy

thesustainability growth also take account.i cite case unite state imply riksbank already decide makefurther rapid interest rate increase near future. that work. those followwhat know foundation

different cpi inflation, furtherremoved ordinary operation monetary policy, nevertheless classic case ofthe type imbalance occur latter stage expansion lead abruptand painful ending.there several type

demand strong expect bythose put investment place. part severity recent asian recession, andparticularly japanese one, due early period over-investment. some effect alsooccurred australia late-1970s/early-1980s so-called “resources boom”.looking back post-war years, particularly fix exchange rate period, theimbalance often play decisive role current account balance payments. if

short-sighted - essence, boil view bestway manage expansion keep interest rate low point long possible, onlyraise thing go off-track. we think this, would look back fewyears’ time regret it, even though might popular short run.we also think approach fail recognise expansionary stance monetarypolicy 1999. in either nominal real terms, interest rate face borrower low, aswas show eagerness

reasonable monetary policy would also change. we havetried encapsulate two change take together return “neutrality” position wasclearly expansionary. of course, always considerable measurement

simple rather optimal rule examine policymakers shouldadjust parameter simple rule light uncertainty measurement outputgap. it find policymakers attenuate response change output gap and,indeed, move cautiously confidence sure measure beconstructed low. in contrast conclusion base signal extraction models, simulationsresults use simple rule generally find increase uncertainty output gap may call forattenuation response gap variable inflation.in cases, certainty equivalence continue hold, even noisy observations. in swanson’swork, example, optimal policy still display certainty equivalence policy relate theunobservable excess demand. in paper svensson woodford present tomorrow, wherethe model relate inflation directly observe unemployment gap, certainty equivalence holdsprovided estimate gap update basis available data true model.this structure result also present work orphanides.so question is: how general special attenuation result? this question appear particularlyrelevant uncertainty monetary policymakers wrestle today, i sure wewill lot discussion conclusion tomorrow. i suspect result general one forthe follow reasons. first, i believe part challenge today find proxy theunobservable excess demand, especially give divergent movement unemployment andcapacity utilization rates. therefore, view, swanson’s conclusion certainty equivalenceholds policy express term unobservable “excess demand” dominate hisconclusion attenuation hold policy make term observables. put simply, policyauthorities mortal hence unable observe unobservables. second, give don’tknow true model, policymakers might look simple rule rather try derive optimal rulesfor guidance. this lead question practical significance certainty equivalence, whichrequires policymakers know true model, use optimal rule, update optimal estimateof nairu base true model.i draw follow conclusion research. first, policymakers continuously updatetheir estimate nairu output gap, use available information, particularly therealizations unemployment, output, inflation. such update entirely erase problemsassociated noisy observations, mitigate them. in view, policymakers today updatetheir estimate output gap nairu systematically frequently theyonce did. this view suggest caution derive degree attenuation historicalevidence revision nairu potential output.second, policymakers adjust aggressiveness response gap actualand target variable light uncertainty measurement. specifically, policymakersshould attenuate response movement unemployment output gap. there animportant complication apply principle. simulation result suggest optimal responseto output gap absence uncertainty might considerably aggressive theparameter taylor rule. the attenuation might therefore result response parameter close toor low taylor rule value.third, literature le clear whether policymakers offset attenuation theresponse output gap aggressive response movement realize inflation. myinstinct tell that, policy become le preemptive, become aggressively reactive.taking second third conclusion together, relative weight gap variable inflationshould vary, depend degree uncertainty output gap. the high coefficient onthe inflation rate might justify fact inflation become good indicator excess bi review 21/20004demand compare output gap heighten uncertainty measurement ofthe output gap.the focus literature uncertainty unemployment output gap, shiftin trend productivity growth also result uncertainty equilibrium real interest rate. in thiscase, taylor-type rule also incorporate mechanism update estimate rate.a nonlinear taylor rule uncertainty key parametersthe literature noisy observation focus adjustment parameter lineartaylor-type rules. but i believe nonlinear rule may dominate linear specification case. ihave suggest nonlinear rule would attenuate response unemployment rate regionaround best estimate nairu would cause gradual return aggressivemarginal response appropriate certainty equivalence unemployment rate movedsufficiently best estimate nairu.such nonlinear rule could justify either nonlinearities economy non-normaldistribution policymakers’ prior belief nairu. it certainly easy believe thereare nonlinearities economy general respect phillips curve particular. forexample, extent effect inflation become disproportionately large theunemployment output gap increases, policy response become aggressive eachincremental increase gap. however, i’m persuade strong case nonlinearphillips curve. so i incline emphasize possibility non-normal distribution priorbeliefs nairu basis nonlinear policy rule.an example non-normal probability distribution nairu would justify nonlinearpolicy response i suggest one uniform probability distribution around bestestimate nairu. for example, policymakers might prior 5% nairu, auniform probability distribution range 4½% 5½% unemployment rate.because policymakers uncertain nairu within interval, might verywilling revise estimate nairu line observation unemploymentrate within it. a result, movement unemployment rate within range would littleeffect estimate unemployment gap and, therefore, target interest rate. however, ifthe unemployment rate move outside range, policymakers might assign increasingly smallerfraction increment unemployment rate nairu unemployment rate movedstill policymakers’ best estimate nairu. in case, policy response isattenuated around best estimate nairu, gradually become larger, ultimatelyconverging marginal response certainty equivalence.monetary policy’s adjustment uncertainty key parametersis recent monetary policy response consistent lesson i draw literature onuncertainty associate noisy observations? the follow discussion draw evolution ofmy thinking, well policy actions, include announce tilt policy textof announcement accompany policy actions.i pick episode middle 1996, i join board. it seem initiallymonetary policy consistent backward-looking taylor rule (although sometimesdifficult distinguish forward-looking taylor rule). we face two surprises:faster-than-expected growth (resulting higher-than-expected estimate output gap) andlower-than-expected inflation. these offset effect nominal fund rate, yield nearlyunchanged policy fall 1998 policy closely track taylor rule prescription, atleast allow update estimate unemployment output gap along way. alternatively,this policy could view allow passive rise real rate turn wellcalibrated rise output gap. 5bis review 21/2000as episode progressed, question raise - inside outside federal reserve -about value nairu trend growth. the staff continually adjust estimate theseparameters response incoming data.in fall 1998, monetary policy respond financial market distress abruptchange forecast growth (and hence utilization rates) unite states. i put weighton forecast le recent observation context taylor rule, stance i think wasjustified abrupt change forecast unusually sharp contrast forecastand still-strong incoming data.once become apparent u economy maintain momentum despite weak foreigngrowth financial market return toward normal, grow uncertainty theoutput gap - reflect continue contradiction decline inflation rise output gap -made monetary policymakers cautious aggressively reverse policy actions. but throughearly 1999 remain somewhat concern degree recovery financial marketsand foreign economies. the net result nominal fund rate remain constant thisphase, instead tighten line taylor rule prescription. in effect, policymakers could beinterpreted attenuate response unemployment output gap line thetheoretical model empirical result i talk about.beginning mid-1999, estimate output gap increase growth shift astill-higher gear, policymakers become concern possibility overheat and,hence, risk high inflation. the tighten 1999 could interpret unwind theearlier easings, factor motivate ease reversed. of course, everypolicy action need defend term contribution future achieve objectivesof monetary policy. in spirit, i interpret tighten move preemptive attempt limitinflation risks.why policymakers tolerate increase output gap, theysubsequently become concern inflation risk increase outputgap? i think change rationalize term discussion case nonlinear policyresponse uncertainty. a unemployment rate fell farther best estimate thenairu risk overheat increased, policymakers become le tolerant continuedabove-trend growth.monetary policy strategy light uncertainty associate structural changelooking backward, i think find least hint attenuation response change theunemployment rate and, recently, hint nonlinear policy response. what suggestabout monetary policy strategy go forward? the current strategy can, i believe, view atwo-step process. the first step is, preemptively, slow growth trend. if successful, step wouldlimit, though necessarily remove, threat overheating, output already advance beyondpotential. the second step respond reactively high inflation, prevail output gapprove inconsistent stable inflation.the first step continuation strategy underlie recent policy tightenings. in myjudgment, unemployment rate already decline sufficiently low level relative myestimate nairu long attenuate marginal policy response furtherdeclines. but current policy is, view, also aggressive version strategy itis nonlinear response decline unemployment rate, forward-looking attemptto prevent tighten labor market. i think one subtlety policy issometimes content respond incrementally incoming data sometimes becomingmore aggressive respond forecasts. it best policymakers transparent suchshifts relative weight forecast policy decisions.once growth slow trend output gap stabilizes, monetary policy may become morereactive, give continue uncertainty level nairu output gap. that is,policymakers might prepare slow economy trend growth avoid risk high bi review 21/20006inflation associate still-lower unemployment rate high output gaps, might reluctantto reduce perceive output gap without evidence realize inflation prevail gap isunsustainable.under policy, response inflation should, view, aggressive wouldotherwise be, example, taylor rule certainty. this example offset theattenuation response output gap aggressive response inflation realizations.in effect, policy set trend growth prevail level output gap presume tobe consistent stable inflation. an increase inflation (specifically core inflation) would beevidence output gap fact sustainable. a result, increase interest rate shouldbe combine response slight increase estimate nairu increase theinflation rate unchanged estimate nairu.a final component strategy, view, policy tighten - andbeyond presume necessary slow economy trend - extent effort tostabilize output gap fall short. for example, let u assume growth ultimately move trendbut, interim, continue above-trend growth increase output gap still further. in response,policy tighten incrementally, encourage trend-growth hence unwind furtherincrease output gap.the strategy i describe would reduce prospect policy respond noise estimate ofkey real-side variable economy would increase prospect allow economy torealize full benefit recent improvement aggregate supply. however, riskallowing excess demand build show inflation may ultimately require moreaggressive response interest rates, range attenuation fact correspond declinein nairu.conclusionstructural change complicate task monetary policy. of course, difficult put withthis additional burden structural change take form decline nairu anincrease trend productivity growth. it would easy monetary policy turn goodfortune poor macroeconomic performance. but uncertainty nature degree ofstructural change confront policymakers task strive realize benefit decline inthe nairu increase trend growth try avoid inflationary consequence ofovertaxing new limits.

january.who don brash, unelected bureaucrat whose name appear ballot paper lastelection, think is, make important decisions?why don brash refuse engage publicly medium issue?why new zealand oecd country “persists intervention fuel another self-inducedrecession” (this auckland chamber commerce itself, use word ourincrease official cash rate january, increase last week)?wouldn’t life much good simply away intervention, allow pure marketforces determine interest rates?hasn’t reserve bank, way run monetary policy reserve bankact 1989, cause new zealand’s huge balance payment deficit, won’t

growfaster without inflation?these question pour forth – despite fact january’s modest increase of25 basis point already fully price financial market (as indeed last week’s adjustmentto ocr also)!some question base misunderstandingi welcome opportunity respond question morning. some raise importantissues, though i think fair say also others simply reflect misunderstandings.for example, contrary view express former prime minister david lange, isno sense don brash huge unfettered power. parliament make clear thereserve bank must use ability influence monetary condition maintain price stability.parliament make clear price stability mean subject formalagreement government bank’s governor. and course, agreement currentlyrequires keep cpi inflation rate 0 3 per cent (with qualifications). thegovernment make clear i deliver, reserve bank act bi review 25/20002government right change target, unilaterally wish so, provide anychange make public.so decision don brash make tightly constrained, base best informationwhich colleague gather, make achieve objective parliament laiddown. in sense i unconstrained bureaucrat.the suggestion i reluctant engage debate medium arose, i suspect, injanuary issue press statement announce explain increase official cash ratebut decline answer medium questions. it always difficult judgement howfrequently bank comment monetary condition “on record”. on occasion, i feltthat i give interview one journalist i would give interview quite number,and i reluctant run risk send multiplicity message might confusedmore enlightened. in general, however, accessible medium othercentral bank i know of, central bank transparent rationale itsdecisions.and central bank oecd country adjust monetary policy tighteningdirection recent times? hardly. in last six months, central bank australia, canada,sweden, switzerland, unite kingdom, unite state european monetary union haveall tighten monetary policy several occasions. that make sensible u totighten policy, course, least make clear typical ofwhat happen many part world.but let “pure market forces” determine interest rates? a somebody great deal ofconfidence market forces, feel bite strange disagree advocate lettingmarket force sole determinant interest rates. of course, market force determine interestrates large degree. central bank really strong influence short-term interestrates. but need central bank all? this place give comprehensive answerto question.1 but might worth note that, best knowledge, country theworld currently operate without service central bank. in words, country i amaware central bank, effectively use service another country’s central bank(through use country’s currency, tie currency othercountry). and central bank intervene, do, influence short-term interest rates.what balance payments? surely, reserve bank obsession price stabilityhave major contributor large current account deficit new zealand experiencedover last decade? well, actually no. new zealand current account deficit every yearsince 1974, range monetary policy regimes. indeed, large deficit experience overthat 25 year period, relative gdp, mid-seventies, another large deficit themid-eighties.i absolutely persuade that, even reserve bank act amend make bankresponsible reduce balance payment deficit, monetary policy ability produceany sustainable reduction deficit. indeed, i even know whether reduce currentaccount deficit would involve tighten monetary policy (which would push exchange rate butslow domestic spending) ease monetary policy (which would tend push theexchange rate accelerate domestic spending).but surely daft reserve bank tighten policy new zealand economy wasemerging recession? well, might daft done, ofcourse not. new zealand experience brief, mild, recession first half 1998, insignificant part impact asian crisis severe drought. but economy1but see “monetary policy free-market economy”, address auckland manufacturers’

isin line estimate. (we know economy grow 3.1 per cent first threequarters year, monetary policy statement publish last week suggest decemberquarter gdp grow 1 per cent. many commentator already suggest 1 percent estimate prove low.) it also seem clear result growth smallamount excess productive capacity exist economy much 1998 1999has largely, perhaps completely, use up. a tighten monetary policy lastfour month entirely appropriate.so question comment pretty easy deal.more fundamental questionsbut fundamental question must take seriously, question therelationship inflation growth go heart monetary policy decision-making.how fast new zealand economy grow without generate inflation? what 1999 tell usabout answer question? let try answer questions, acknowledge insome area answers. before that, may helpful explainsomething way look issue.this best illustrate graph. bi review 25/20004the straight line a/b represent gradual growth economy’s capacity deliver good andservices without inflation. if demand exceed line a/b, price tendency rise. ifdemand fall short line, price tendency fall. (i say “have tendency rise”and “have tendency fall” course many thing influenceon prices, include change international prices, change government charge policy, changesin tariff policies, similar factors.)the slope line, word trend rate growth economy’s capacity supply, islargely drive factor like growth labour force, quality education system, thequality management decision-making, openness economy, quality judicialsystem, quality industrial relation framework, on. monetary policy help bydelivering price stability, help people interpret relative price change easily thanthey presence high variable inflation, avoid distortion theinteraction inflation tax system often creates. but main factor affect trend growthare one i mentioned. monetary policy help margin keep price stable.in practice, course, a/b straight line – vary response whole raft factors,including thing like change net migration.like capacity supply, demand also tend fluctuate – response change internationalconditions, response change public confidence, response change government policy,in response introduction new inventions, response change wealth, response awhole host thing – yes, response change monetary policy.the key point note demand fall short economy’s capacity, point c e,it possible economy grow rapidly time inflation low falling.conversely, demand exceed economy’s capacity, d, perfectly possible theeconomy grow slowly, indeed even shrink somewhat, time inflation isrising. it seem that, conceptually least, point c represent state new zealandeconomy early ninety (with rapid growth low inflation despite big fall theexchange rate); d represent state economy 1996 1997 (with growth slow butinflation push beyond top 0 2 per cent target range); e representswhere last couple year (with economy first contract briefly, thengrowing quite strongly, inflation low falling).seen light, perhaps surprise little inflation thesecond half 1999, despite fact growth half year probably run annualisedrate 6 per cent; inflation year whole 1.3 per cent, despite growth inthe whole year least 4 per cent. a already mentioned, factor influence inflation rate inthe short-term course – thing like international oil prices, change government price policies,and – trend inflation proper focus monetary policy basically functionof relationship demand economy’s capacity supply.but course tell u nothing fast new zealand economy grow withoutgenerating inflation. what “sustainable growth rate”? what, words, slope theline a/b? nobody, certainly reserve bank, know answer question withcertainty. but answer question fundamental decision monetarypolicy, avoid make estimate sustainable growth rate. we force reach ajudgement matter.at present time, estimate sustainable growth rate new zealand economy isaround 3 per cent per annum. of course, economy grow fast time startsfrom situation excess capacity, case early ninety case mid-1998.but excess capacity use up, economy need slow sustainable growthrate risk inflation begin pick up.some people worry reserve bank considerable damage economy assumingtoo low sustainable growth rate, assuming, say, 3 per cent growth rate reality theeconomy could grow 4 5 per cent bank would allow demand expand rapidly. 5bis review 25/2000but economy really capable grow 5 per cent bank run monetary policy onthe assumption capable grow 3 per cent, quite quickly demand fallbelow capacity supply, strong tendency price fall, inflation rate getspushed towards bottom 0 3 per cent target range. and since take goingthrough bottom target seriously take go top, force toease monetary policy let demand expand. in words, can’t avoid make judgement aboutsustainable growth, can’t get wrong long force adjust estimate.indeed, rather high estimate sustainable growth rate economy themid-nineties revise find inflation consistently push towards, brieflybeyond, top target range. whenever new piece data come inflation orgdp, look whether current estimate sustainable growth still reasonable.what “new paradigm”? a discuss monetary policy statement last week, arethose believe recent u experience, rapid growth low inflation, point towardssome new ability modern economy operate late technology competition withproducers world grow rapidly previously believe without inflation.local optimist argue new zealand could see rapid growth low inflation thereserve bank cautious.others suggest that, even us, conjunction low inflation rapid growth reflect inlarge part disinflationary impact one-off factors, recent weakness worldcommodity prices, recent strength u dollar. they note yet strongevidence new zealand suggest significant increase trend rate ofproductivity growth sort might require justify belief “new paradigm” innew zealand.as statement last week noted, yet persuade evidence fundamentalchange relationship growth inflation new zealand. but open-minded onthe issue, continue examine data evidence change. indeed, whole sectionof statement devote acknowledge that, doubt need reducethe stimulus monetary policy provide economy recent times, muchless certainty far monetary policy need tighten beyond next months.conclusionand main message today. all evidence suggest that, brief recessiontwo year ago growth 3 4 per cent per annum since middle 1998, excess productivecapacity economy largely gone. (in words, refer back graph, passedpoint e demand line close indeed supply line.) it appropriate monetaryconditions stimulatory demand fell well short capacity. if right demand andsupply close balance, however – large body official statistic andunofficial anecdote support view – high time stimulus removed. and ofcourse seek increase official cash rate innovember, january, march. we project need continue reduction instimulus, ease back accelerator, next months.but need step brakes, so, hard? the answer, often economicmatters, “it depends”. our statement project need monetary policy become restrictive,to apply brakes, next year two. but stage seem likely involve rathermilder tighten monetary condition case historically.one reason belief new zealander carry lot debt, relative theirincomes, decade ago. we assume relatively moderate rate growth inhousehold sector expenditure next year result. in particular, assume therate new debt take slow compare nineties, increase ininterest rate big impact consumption expenditure even new house-buildingthan nineties. bi review 25/20006of course, could wrong assumption, either direction. there much evidence yetthat increase debt level encourage slow-down rate consumption growing,so possible demand arise household sector strong project,requiring firm monetary condition project.conversely, debt level may even small increase interest rate induce slow-down inconsumption spend house-building, require monetary condition rather easy thannow projected.another important area uncertainty exchange rate. at present time, new zealanddollar close low level ever, trade-weighted basis. there many reason this. newzealand short-term interest rate low several english-speakingcountries, provide little inducement foreigner invest new zealand dollar assets. thecommodity price great relevance new zealand seem recover rather slowly thando commodity prices. there nervousness political environment,among investor abroad. new zealand large current account deficit, lookslikely improve slowly.to extent exchange rate weak low commodity prices, know offsettingthe stimulus low exchange rate disinflationary effect weak export prices. this wouldsuggest need monetary policy react.on hand, extent exchange rate weakness simply reflect factors, thecurrent account deficit nervousness political environment, bank may well need toadjust monetary policy avoid total demand pressure new zealand economy exceedingthe country’s capacity supply. in event, course, interest rate may need rise thanprojected statement last week, i note time.but one thing absolutely certain. the reserve bank absolutely slightestinterest choke recovery. all evidence suggest economy growingwith increase vigour last couple years, commentator expect continuegrowing 3 4 per cent per annum least next couple years. all evidencesuggests that, circumstances, high time ease accelerator ponder whether totouch brakes.as ian macfarlane, governor reserve

sustainable pace.2speech mr ian macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, ceda annual general meet dinner,melbourne, 28 november 1996. 1bis review 28/2000mr noyer: monetary policymaking euro areaspeech deliver mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, paretofonds’ 2000 economic forum, oslo, 23 march 2000.* * *ladies gentlemen,it pleasure honour speak pareto fonds’ 2000 economic forum inoslo. the economic conference organise pareto fonds outstanding reputation forpresenting unique opportunity investors, economist policymakers conduct in-depthexchange view current issue monetary policy.in january 1999 euro successfully launch single currency 11 countriescomprising euro area. for year, eurosystem, include european centralbank (ecb) 11 national central bank (ncbs) country introduce theeuro, charge single monetary policy euro area. of course, much earlyto make detail assessment achievement single monetary policy. nevertheless, thefirst 15 month euro encourage good reason look futurewith optimism. owe careful technical conceptual preparations, monetarypolicymaking process implementation monetary policy decision functionedefficiently outset. at time, doubt room furtherimprovement important challenge still lie ahead.in remark today, i shall describe main feature monetary policymaking euro area,focusing particular monetary policy objective eurosystem, stability-orientedmonetary policy strategy communication issue raise strategy. moreover, ishall briefly highlight current economic outlook euro area.price stability primary objective single monetary policy eurosystemthe treaty establish european community clearly state primary objective singlemonetary policy shall maintain price stability. furthermore, treaty require that, withoutprejudice objective price stability, eurosystem shall support general economic policiesin european community view contribute objective community. the latterinclude, inter alia, sustainable non-inflationary growth high level employment.the treaty therefore establish clear sequence objective monetary policy theeurosystem, price stability unambiguously sine qua non. such assignment task toa central bank nothing extraordinary. on contrary, reflect consensus emergedover last two decade effect maintain price stability best contribution monetarypolicy make sustainable non-inflationary output growth employment perspectives.the belief monetary policy gear towards price stability firmly root economictheory clearly demonstrate cost inflation, term allocative inefficiency andarbitrary redistribution effects. at time, argument suggest maintain pricestability contribute high growth employment. several empirical study haveconcluded that, across large number countries, average low inflation whichappear grow rapidly.while widespread agreement benefit price stability, le clear exactly whatprice stability means. in context stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, governingcouncil ecb define price stability “a year-on-year increase harmonise index ofconsumer price (hicp) euro area 2%”. accord definition, price stability“is maintain medium term”. bi review 28/20002the phrase “below 2%” clearly delineate upper bind rate measure inflation thehicp, consistent price stability. at time, use word “increase” thedefinition clearly signal deflation, i.e. prolong decline level hicp, would bedeemed consistent price stability.the main reason aim measure inflation rate zero know the“measurement bias”, exist consumer price indices. these bias arise mainly fromchanging spend pattern quality improvement good service includedin basket use define specific price index. such bias cannot always fully correct theconstruction price indices. the measurement bias typically cause consumer price index (cpis) tooverstate slightly “true” rate inflation. while measurement bias hicp likely belower observe national cpi country comprise euro area, cannotcompletely neglect it. nevertheless, yet conclusive study size themeasurement bias hicp euro area. this main reason govern councilof ecb announce explicit low bind definition price stability.in literature also economic argument favour slightly positive rate ofinflation. first, argue existence downward nominal rigidity wage impliesthat inflation require ensure downward flexibility real wages, thereby allow resource tobe allocate efficiently across different economic sector response change technology andconsumer preferences. second, put forward modestly positive rate inflation isrequired ensure monetary policy always engineer negative real interest rates, berequired. there good well-known reason overstate arguments. at time,the definition price stability choose govern council allow moderately positiveinflation 2%.the govern council underline fact price stability maintain mediumterm. in short term, inflation rate influence one-off factor outside control thecentral bank, change indirect tax movement commodity prices. moreover,monetary policy impulse exert influence overall price level considerabletime-lags. hence, monetary policy cannot avoid short-term deviation inflation rate consistentwith price stability.the two pillar monetary policy strategy eurosystemthe intrinsic challenge central bank need look ahead. be monetary policy toreact inflationary pressure already visible, would always late, interest ratechanges show full impact price around six eight quarters. moreover, wouldhave react much strongly event timely action. the past experience withstop-go policies, widespread 1960s 1970s, clearly illustrate negative side effect interms high volatility inflation output.a forward-looking monetary policy require structure approach order interpret synthesiseall information relevant assessment outlook price developments; words, itrequires well-founded monetary policy strategy. the strategy eurosystem base twopillars, first prominent role money second broadly base assessment theoutlook price developments.to give money prominent role monetary policy analysis quite natural thing centralbank gear towards price stability do, inflation ultimately monetary phenomenon. theimportant role assign money reflect announcement reference value 4½% theannual growth broad monetary aggregate m3. current m3 growth analyse interpret inrelation reference value. under normal conditions, substantial prolong deviation ofmonetary growth reference value would signal risk price stability medium term.for euro area, relationship empirically well-founded. the available econometric evidencesuggests existence stable relationship m3, euro area price level small 3bis review 28/2000number area-wide macroeconomic variables. moreover, good evidence regard toleading indicator property m3 future price developments.while doubt relevance monetary growth inflation medium term,short-term change stock money may influence factor unrelated future spendingand future inflation. thus, eurosystem react mechanically short-term deviation ofmonetary growth reference value. instead, monetary development analyse verycarefully order extract information content future inflation. if analysis clearly wereto suggest monetary development indicate threat future price stability, monetary policywould respond manner appropriate counter risk.although monetary data contain information vital inform monetary policymaking, theirown normally constitute complete summary economic information require toset appropriate monetary policy maintenance price stability. thus, parallel theanalysis monetary growth relation reference value, broadly base assessment theoutlook price development risk price stability euro area play major role theeurosystem’s strategy. this assessment make basis wide range variable haveleading indicator property future price developments, including, inter alia, wages, unit labourcosts, bond prices, yield curve, fiscal policy indicators, various measure real activity, price andcost indices.let take opportunity stress govern council ecb consider euroexchange rate important indicator within second pillar eurosystem’s strategy. it closelymonitored influence monetary policy decisions, implication outlook forprice stability euro area. change exchange rate influence outlook pricedevelopments directly, impact import prices, indirectly, effectson trade. against background, prolong depreciation exchange rate euro sincethe begin 1999 indeed cause concern carefully take account ourdiscussion appropriate monetary policy stance.another element second pillar macroeconomic forecasts. give forward-looking nature ofthe stability-oriented strategy, eurosystem follow closely forecast prepare internationalorganisations, market participant others. in addition, also produce forecasts. forecastsare indispensable tool efficient information processing. they help summarise synthesisea large quantity information may otherwise become unwieldy form sensible basis forpolicy discussion. at time, however, recognise role forecast theeurosystem’s monetary strategy clearly limited. it certainly cannot compare play inthe context inflation targeting. an inflation forecast never sufficient statistical summary ofall information policymakers require order take appropriate monetary policy decisions.to give one example, extremely hard integrate information relate monetarydevelopments meaningful way macroeconomic forecasts. furthermore, often crucial tounderstand nature factor affect future price development order ass risksto price stability medium term. thus, one certainly expect eurosystem react toinflation forecast mechanical way.one criticism frequently raise external observer refer complexity strategyjust described. i agree strategy complex honestly reflect complexity themonetary policy environment eurosystem. while forward-looking monetary policy bydefinition complicated, complexity reinforce fact govern council ecbhas ass monetary policy situation large diverse single currency area consist of11 different countries. moreover, owe impact introduction euro behaviourof economic agent evolution institutional environment, face arelatively high degree uncertainty regard economic relationship relevant formonetary policy. finally, database area-wide statistic still relatively narrow comparisonwith central bank accustom to, least industrialise world. against thisbackground, two-pillar strategy eurosystem advantage relatively resilient tothese different form uncertainty. bi review 28/20004issues communication policyit widely acknowledge today communication policy belong core task centralbank. for year now, transparency one catchword central banking. this isclosely relate fact that, central bank become independent, issue ofaccountability gain equal importance. accountability turn facilitate high degree oftransparency. not institution central bank formally accountable, alsomarket participant public large make assessment situation easily acentral bank pursue primary objective appropriate way. hence, high degree transparencyalso facilitate creation credibility and, via impact expectation-forming process,increases efficiency monetary policy.against background, govern council ecb commit open,transparent accountable decision performance vis-à-vis european public theeuropean parliament, public’s elect representative. we well aware fact that, becauseof complexity eurosystem’s monetary policy plurality audience - whichare accustom different communication form - addressed, extraordinary effort arerequired explain monetary policy consideration govern council regular basis inthe transparent way possible. while try hard, certainly yet overcome theteething problem regard. all us, however, determine continue strive forimprovement i convince make progress speak one voice.often, however, critic eurosystem’s communication policy refer concretesituations, claim eurosystem’s general approach communication inherently lack intransparency. in context i impression whole discussion regard thetransparency monetary policy become rather narrowly focused, associate transparency onlywith specific communication tools, namely publication minute inflation forecasts.it sometimes forget central bank various instrument disposal informingthe public honest, clear understandable way consideration motivationsunderlying monetary policy decisions.one major tool communication policy eurosystem press conference thepresident ecb i hold regularly follow first govern council meet eachmonth. on occasions, president make introductory statement, explain thedecisions govern council basis assessment late information onmonetary, financial market economic developments. in view, introductory statementis similar central bank call summary minutes. this statement follow aquestions answer session, give journalist opportunity question president myselfon issue. this press conference provide forum present policy decision promptly aspossible. the fact academic also recommend procedure central bank cancertainly regard positive assessment approach.another key instrument communication policy ecb monthly bulletin. the monthlybulletin intend provide public thorough assessment economic situation wellas article cover topical issue important single monetary policy. moreover, speechessuch one today public appearance member executive board, exampleat hear european parliament, important channel communication public.the ecb also participate actively academic debate. finally, lot information accessible onthe ecb’s website.all all, information supply ecb go beyond requirement treatyestablishing european community. against background, clear additionalrelevant information academic financial market participant hope obtain publicationsof minute vote records. on contrary, non-negligible risk focus muchon individual word deeds, i.e. vote behaviour, likely obscure clarity coherenceof council’s policy signals. moreover, publication vote record could lead pressurebeing bring bear governor ncbs national politician interest groups. this, 5bis review 28/2000in turn, could endanger euro area focus member govern council committedthemselves right outset, well open productive character discussions.with regard call publication inflation forecasts, i like stress that, order tobe helpful communication tool, publication forecast require extremely careful preparation.not must guarantee forecast sufficient quality, public also beeducated read forecast. a misunderstand fundamental assumption underlie aforecast misinterpretation role forecast context overall strategy caneasily lead situation interpretation govern council’s monetary policydecisions facilitated, complicated. this eurosystem decide beginpublishing forecast begin stage three.monetary economic development euro arealet turn monetary economic development euro area. exactly one week ago,on 16 march 2000, govern council decide raise ecb interest rate 25 basis points.this decision address upside risk price stability signal pillar monetarypolicy strategy. last week’s increase ecb interest rate follow interest rate decision take on4 november 1999 3 february 2000 continue policy counter emerge upsiderisks price stability timely manner. thereby, contribute maintain favourableoutlook euro area economy.the follow factor contribute late interest rate decision. with regard first pillar, thethree-month average annual growth rate m3 exceed reference value of4½% throughout 1999 january 2000. the prolong deviation m3 growth referencevalue signal existence ample liquidity euro area. this especially true see inconjunction continue strong growth credit grant private sector, annual rateof around 10%.with regard second pillar, indicator forecast point increase upward pressureson consumer price inflation medium term. the strong rise oil price downwardmovement exchange rate euro past put upward pressure import cost andproducer prices. in context strong cyclical upswing, development could, viasecond-round effects, last effect consumer price inflation.as expected, consumer price inflation saw increase first two month year, withannual hicp inflation reach 2.0% february, 1.9% january 1.7% december 1999.the rise year largely account increase oil price effect energyprices hicp. it reinforce base effect decline oil price turn year1998/99. oil price increase early march, continue place upwardpressure consumer price short term.the past movement exchange rate euro increasingly become cause concern forprice stability effect import price producer prices. in first half march, thenominal effective exchange rate 12.2% level record first quarter 1999.overall, upward pressure consumer price inflation regard become great andmore protract previously foreseen. against background, interest rate step take beunderstood pre-emptive measure aim maintain price stability medium term.currently, prospect strong economic growth favourable. the strengthen ofeconomic activity euro area second half 1999 confirm first estimate euroarea real gdp growth fourth quarter 1999. real gdp estimate increase by0.9%

collateralprograms mitigate credit risk, also introduce operational, liquidity, legal risks. to realize thebenefits collateral program, back office system must robust. that is, counterpartiesmust able value portfolios, track collateral posted, call deficiencies, verify timelyreceipt collateral. various study note firm rely collateral program mustestablish rigorous control devote sufficient resource them. additional liquidity legal risksalso arise collateral programs. counterparties enter collateral agreement must ensure thatthey deliver collateral timely fashion, extensive legal document relate tothe program must enforceable relevant jurisdictions.clearing. a device use mitigate credit risk among group participant many financial marketsis clearinghouse. a clearinghouse typically substitute central counterparty alltransactions member agree submit clearing. the creditworthiness clearinghouse isthus substitute members. the clearinghouse assume responsibility managingcredit risk financial safeguard membership standards, capital requirements, andcollateral systems.the clear otc derivative quite limited. some clear otc product conductedin sweden several years. last year, london clear house (lch) begin offer suchservices broadly, volume date limited. in unite states, clear ofotc derivative hamper legal uncertainty associate possible application ofthe commodity exchange act. if recommendation report president’s work groupare implemented, uncertainty resolved. clearinghouses otc derivative could becreated various regulatory regimes. the restriction would clearinghouse besupervised. that supervision could provide cftc, security exchangecommission, comptroller currency, federal reserve.clearing otc derivative offer several potential benefits. a clearinghouse substantially mitigatecounterparty credit risk multilateral net obligation implementation sound riskcontrols. legal risk tend reduce clear default procedure clearinghousesare support specific provision national law. clearinghouses also usually impose stringentoperational standard members, likely would provide add impetus effort developautomated system confirm trades.but clear limitations, too. clearinghouses tend concentrate risk risk management. thekey issue effectively clearinghouse manage risk assumes. the record riskmanagement provide clearinghouses unite state quite good. the safeguardscould apply otc context, particularly relatively simple otc products. but certain 5bis review 17/2000hurdles arise nature otc market would overcome. contract theclearing process would value model rather price generate exchangefloor. more important, event member default, otc product likely would take long toclose exchange-traded products. this hurdle could overcome, however, impositionof high margin requirement member clearinghouse’s maintain large supplementalfinancial resources.clearing also may perverse effect increase risk counterparties’ portfolio ofnoncleared contracts. clearinghouses otc contract typically propose clear relatively simpleotc instruments. the remain contract settle bilaterally two counterparties,as today. the bilateral exposure noncleared contract might increase degree ifthe contract remove clear offset exposure. the magnitudeof effect vary counterparty counterparty portfolio specific. individualcounterparties, therefore, must carefully ass potential benefit clearing.4.conclusion: role public policythe role public policy encourage sound risk management. in regard, policymakers areencouraging firm enhance risk-management systems, include appropriate managementoversight, adequate risk-management policy procedures, effective risk-measurement andmonitoring systems, comprehensive internal control independent external audit. policymakerssimply cannot dictate detail risk management base upon assume market developments.markets currently tremendous flux, policymakers cannot foresee need future years.thus, sound course create clear legal regulatory environment within marketparticipants develop risk management tool needed. in instances, rather mandatingcertain steps, policymakers might provide proper incentive risk-reducing step capitalrequirements disclosure regulations.the recommendation work group’s report otc derivatives, particular, aim clarifythe legal status electronic communication, trading, clear systems. these recommendations, ifimplemented, offer variety enhance risk management tool market participants. informationflows could improved, backlog settlement process might reduced, benefit ofmultilateral net might realized.however, remain market participant develop system best serve market withinthe give legal framework. i hope market participant pursue opportunities. the risk oftrading settle otc derivative reduced. obviously, thing firm canpursue individually easy tackle require collective action. but potential benefitsof new communication, trading, clear system evaluate carefully. participant inotc market work together past develop standard master agreements, example,or obtain legal opinion netting. those experience useful new opportunitiesfor reduce risk addressed.the challenge policymakers new opportunity evaluate may well nothing.policymakers doubt tempt mandate cooperation part market participant aneffort hasten development believe may reduce risk. in adopt course, however,they risk push market market participant inefficient undesirable paths. oftenmarket participant pursue step that, surface, appear desirable benefit donot seem sufficient. in event, policymakers’ effort would good spend help demonstratethat benefit appropriately evaluate rather dictate market structures. 1bis review 17/2000mr noyer give address outlookfor euro area economy financial marketsspeech mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, “cérémonie deremise de victoires de sicav”, paris, 24 february 2000.* * *i please address distinguish audience fund manager today witness thepresentation award excellence financial innovation. it belief process offinancial innovation general, celebrate today’s ceremony, deserve particular attention. thisis improvement work financial market eventually improve allocation offinancial resource economy, turn beneficial sound economic growth overthe medium term.1.trends 2000 euro area economyin first part address today, i would like discus major trend monetary, economicand financial development euro area 2000. i examine trend within frameworkof eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.the primary objective eurosystem maintain price stability medium term. pricestability define year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) forthe euro area 2%. the assessment risk price stability context monetarypolicy strategy base two pillars. first, reference value 4½% growth rate broadmonetary aggregate m3; second, broadly base assessment outlook price developmentsand risk price stability euro area. to begin with, let consider first pillar thestrategy. in 1999, three-month average annual percentage growth rate m3 consistentlyabove reference value. over recent months, money growth growth credit theprivate sector signal generous liquidity condition euro area see pose upwardrisks price stability.let turn second pillar monetary policy strategy, broadly base assessment ofthe outlook price development risk price stability euro area. variousmacro-economic indicator available euro area consistently point towards strong cyclicalupswing euro area 2000. these expectation development economic activity theeuro area support external developments, outlook global economic activity isimproving, development internal euro area. at time cyclical upswingstarted materialise, however, increase consumer price recent month relatively largeand protracted. this reflect mainly impact increase oil price see throughout 1999 wellas, follow continue depreciation effective exchange rate euro, increase importprices. these increase oil price import price lead situation increasingrisks second round effect consumer prices.with respect first pillar second pillar strategy, development lastfew month lead govern council ecb raise interest rates. the main refinance ratewas raise 3% 4 november 1999 3.25% 3 february 2000. by raise interest ratesin view development i described, aim contribute ensure thecyclical upswing currently way euro area strong sustainable, itwill occur environment price stability medium term.over next month particularly important social partner keep wage increase line withprice stability well supportive growth employment. the rate unemploymentin euro area fall throughout 1999 still remain high. a last reduction bi review 17/20002unemployment could achieve progress make structural reform aim atpromoting flexibility labour market, provide job low skilled worker facilitate thereturn job market long-term unemployed. in addition, growth prospect euroarea medium term would clearly benefit completion deepen ofstructural reform promote competition market good services.2.euro area financial marketsalso financial market euro area, structural reform aim promote competitionappear necessary. these reform time contribute improve work financialmarkets integrate area-wide level. furthermore, eurosystem obvious interest wellfunctioning efficient financial market financial market conduit whichmonetary policy decision channel economy. let consider first money market. in1999, within euro area cross-border operation constitute large share operation themoney market. the market evidently benefit creation strong secure backboneof payment systems, include real-time gross-settlement system operate european systemof central bank (escb). the money market euro widely use daily reference index forinterest rates, notably eonia overnight transaction euribor transaction longermaturities. a full set standard instrument build upon reference indices, particular moneymarket future option contract well short-term interest rate swaps. this lead situationwhere market participant able manage day-to-day fund efficient manner atrelatively low costs. important progress remain achieved, however, particular instancewith regard repo market. the integration repo market area-wide level willbenefit operation common platform clear delivery-settlement securitiesused collateral repo transactions.if i turn bond market euro area, observation make 1999 also seem indicatethat market already relatively well integrate level euro area. a show thenewly publish ecb statistic field, considerable increase participation ofprivate sector issuer bond market 1999. to extent, development appear havebeen link high merger acquisition activity. furthermore, volume transaction onboth secondary market bond market interest rate derivative product alsoappear increase 1999. in context, sophisticate market participant seem tobe able easily take position point term structure interest rates, thus contribute tothe formation representative reliable price entire range instrument available theeuro area bond market. these observation tend indicate bond market euro area hasattained good degree depth liquidity.further progress towards constitution efficient bond market euro area can, however,certainly still made.in run-up stage three european monetary union, bond market participant countryof euro area appear increasingly hold bond issue country euro area. thisdevelopment reflect notably decline spread link expect removal intra-areaexchange rate risks. follow creation euro, bond market investor naturally notconcerned intra-area exchange rate risk more. instead, seem focus assessmentof intrinsic credit quality issuers. thus, assessment credit quality development ofa “credit risk culture”, constitute important feature active open bond market, arelikely develop partly result creation euro. the activity rat agenciesmake possible define common standard assessment comparative rank creditquality borrower issuers. in regard, interest note that, 1999, share ofrelatively low-grade borrower new bond issues, although remain small, seem increasesomewhat. over medium term, context development “credit risk culture”,it therefore expect bond market euro area become increasingly diversified,in particular regard range participate issuers, attract private issuers. 3bis review 17/2000with regard stock market, similar observation may made. in particular, development arange area-wide stock market index indicative progress make integration euroarea stock markets. in particular, stock market participant seem increasingly take account theeconomic factor common euro area whole. furthermore, integration stock market atthe euro area level mean issuer across euro area privilege access large number ofinvestors large open market place. this perspective certainly support factor thedevelopment segment stock market dedicate relatively small and/or new firms, theso-called “new markets”.i would like conclude brief discussion trend euro area financial market referenceto - admittedly still timid - emergence new market place operate internet. it appearsthat internet market place potential cover broad range activities, so-calledprimary market time issue new security secondary market. one theadvantages new market place may access wide range usersbecause take advantage exist communication network infrastructure, internet.furthermore, new internet market place also seem characterise high degree ofautomation trade processes. these factor would seem make possible achieve lowertransaction cost and, generally, contribute improve work financialmarkets. 1bis review 16/2000mr noyer summarise main feature eurosystem’s monetarypolicy strategy

consensus among europeansthat maintenance price stability utmost importance. a stability culture also facilitate theachievement objectives, high employment.the introduction euro mark culmination long period successful preparatory work,the magnitude hardly overestimated. a result efforts, introduction ofthe euro take place environment price stability observer would predictedsome year ago. in short history, eurosystem start build credibility gain asound reputation financial market stability-oriented monetary policy. in course 1999,inflation euro area remain rate consistent price stability around 1%. theeurosystem determine conduct appropriate policy order ensure price stabilityremains place.let also mention that, expected, transition euro area financial market year 2000went smoothly. this reflect careful preparation bank financial community thecomprehensive flexible operational framework eurosystem.the establishment monetary union mark outstanding historical achievement. in remark ishould like summarise main feature eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy theexperience gain euro first year. by subsequently address forthcoming challenges,i like span bridge towards future.a clear transparent monetary policy strategylet describe first experience monetary policy strategy euro area. theeurosystem choose clear transparent monetary policy strategy quantitative definitionof primary objective price stability. the choose stability-oriented monetary policy strategy isforward-looking medium-term oriented. the eurosystem policy framework truly bi review 16/20002reflects complexity economy. it sufficiently flexible allow appropriate response tospecific shocks. it also allow account take possibility regime shift could impacton stability important economic relationship course time.let briefly recall main element eurosystem’s strategy. a clear definition primaryobjective maintain price stability euro area contribute stabilise market expectations.price stability define annual increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp)for euro area 2%. the eurosystem aim maintain price stability line thisdefinition medium term. in order achieve override objective, govern councilhas adopt two-pillar approach.the first pillar assign prominent role money. by announce reference value growthrate broad monetary aggregate, strategy take account inflation monetaryphenomenon medium term. the reference value exploit lead indicator property thebroad aggregate m3, accord empirical study useful guidepost futureprice development euro area. the first reference value set late 1998 annual growthrate m3 4½%. follow review reference value december 1999, governingcouncil decide leave reference value unchanged grind underlyingassumptions still valid. under normal circumstances, significant sustain deviation actualmonetary development value would signal future risk price stability. however, thereference value annual target. rather, base medium-term assumption serf asa guide development medium term. moreover, ecb commit ensure thatm3 grow line reference value particular point time.the second pillar monetary policy strategy broadly base assessment outlook forprice development risk price stability euro area whole. this assessmentencompasses wide range financial market economic indicators, include forecastsproduced within outside eurosystem. within second pillar, cyclical development andwages important indicator future price developments. in addition, exchange rate one ofthe important determinant outlook price stability. if exchange rate development pose athreat price stability euro area, threat take account together theinformation price development reveal indicators.monetary policy react mechanically development single indicator forecast. instead,based signal provide pillar strategy, govern council ecb setsthe monetary policy instrument eurosystem level best serf achievement ofits primary objective.watchers ecb criticise communication policy lack transparency. centralbanks use kind criticism. more recently criticism also extend othercentral bank follow strategy (direct) inflation targeting. however, clear thatrevealing every aspect ongoing discussion objective itself. instead, communicationshould element reinforce efficiency monetary policy make comprehensibleand facilitate acceptance economic agents. it therefore important judge carefully thecontribution various element communication make fulfilment primaryobjective monetary policy.such consideration apply example issue whether ecb publish forecast euroarea variables. forecast represent information important monetary policydecision-making. however, publish forecast central bank different publishingforecasts outside institution. it objective ecb maintain price stability. since theobjective ecb achieve medium term, forecast, examplebased constant interest rates, take account monetary policy take action time toensure price stability. in words, forecast may inform interest rate decisions, should,in principle, never doubt ecb’s decision outlook price developmentsshould line price stability. in context, would problematic send signal intothe public debate, could influence inflation expectations. furthermore, construction 3bis review 16/2000forecasts, behavioural, institutional structural uncertainty overlooked. largeuncertainties make forecast price development euro area inevitably difficult.forecasts therefore interpret great caution assessment supplementedby evaluation risk uncertainty underlie forecast. therefore, publish singlenumber inflation outlook would clearly misleading. instead, careful interpretation theresults require order exploit signal monetary policy purposes. before ecbpublishes forecasts, crucial explain carefully uncertainty surround it, theassumptions make extent forecast actually play role decision.otherwise, publish forecast might finally increase uncertainty even complicate themaintenance price stability.let point ecb set high standard term openness, transparency andaccountability. a part communication policy, ecb provide public policymakers regularly timely detail information govern council’s assessment ofmonetary, financial economic condition euro area. this assessment revealsforward-looking information outlook price development well risk pricestability. a statement president release immediately first govern councilmeeting month. this advantage present council’s assessment economicsituation almost instantaneously meeting. each month ecb publish bulletin providingadditional background information explain current assessment monetary, financial othereconomic development detail. once year, ecb release annual report activitiesto european community institutions.gaining first experiencethe monetary policy strategy pass first test successfully. in addition describedelements strategy, consistency transparency eurosystem’s monetary policy decisionswere crucial aspect. this best illustrate discuss important factor influencingthe interest rate change decide far eurosystem.in first month last year, sign emerge extent slowdown economicactivity euro area might strong anticipated. at point time pricepressures continue weak. in environment become increasingly clear negativeeffects stem crisis asia russia growth employment euro arearepresented downward risk future price stability euro area. this assessment alsoreflected downward revision inflation forecast international organisation thattime.a monetary policy reaction downward risk price stability was, however, complicate bythe fact time indicator appear point opposite direction. in particular, thethree-month average annual growth rate m3 slightly reference value. consumerconfidence remain comparatively strong despite economic slowdown. furthermore, oil priceshad rise since mid-february euro depreciate effective terms. these two factorswere also able exert upward pressure price short term.however, several indication m3 temporarily distort upwards early1999 result changeover stage three emu. thus, early 1999, appear thatm3 growth reveal upside risk price stability. moreover, since could assess bythen normalisation correction excessive development late 1998, governingcouncil regard appropriate overemphasise relatively volatile movement oil pricesand exchange rate first month 1999.all all, early april first pillar monetary policy eurosystem judgedas point upward risk price stability, second pillar strategy signal significantdownward risk price stability. this assessment make necessary govern council takeaction. with view maintain price stability euro area medium term, bi review 16/20004governing council ecb thus decide begin april 1999 reduce interest rateson main refinance operation 50 basis point 2.5%.at around begin summer, appear downward risk price stability receded.over summer, three-month average annual rate m3 growth increase andprogressively approach rate 6%. overnight deposit credit private sector continue toexpand rapidly. a protract monetary expansion thus evident. at time, externalenvironment strengthen asian economy stabilise start recover, whileconcerns financial crisis emerge market receded. in environment, economicactivity euro area progressively recovered. in addition, effective exchange rate euroweakened oil price continue rise. these two factor gradually feed toconsumer prices. therefore, information contain pillar provide evidence balanceof risk future price stability progressively move upward since begin thesummer. the downside risk present time cut ecb interest rate april nolonger prevailed. on 4 november govern council decide raise interest rate mainrefinancing operation 50 basis point 3%.the increase interest rate point time aim help counter upward pressureon future price contribute keep inflation expectation safely 2%. the interestrate decision take timely manner avoid need strong measure later. this isconsistent focus maintain price stability would thus contribute sustainingnon-inflationary economic growth euro area medium term.in late 1999 2000 risk price stability move upside. both pillar wereindicating increase risk price stability. consider first pillar monetary policy strategy,monetary credit growth continue signal generous liquidity conditions. monetary expansionremained high evidence late three-month average annual m3 growth 6.1% theperiod cover october december 1999. the expansion credit private sector continue tobe strong rate around 10%. these development indicative continuation generousliquidity situation.as second pillar monetary policy strategy, oil price exchange rate movementsobserved late 1999 january 2000 add upward pressure price euro area. infact, price cost increase large protract foresee early hence indicatedrenewed upward risk price stability. the late price development euro area werereflecting pattern, give pick-up hicp inflation rate 1.7% december 1999. addingto risk fact international environment show continuous sign ofimprovement prospect cyclical upswing euro area improved. indeed,significant improvement economic outlook confirm estimate real gdp growthfor third quarter 1999 eurostat available confidence indicator point acontinued solid output growth fourth quarter 1999. against background governingcouncil decide raise ecb interest rate 25 basis point february 2000.the explanation decision change ecb interest rate 1999 february 2000 showthat react mechanistically individual indicators. instead, always interpret themovements signal indicator evident pillar conjunction other.as outline give live complex world, reasonable approach thanrelying simple indicator. timely appropriate monetary policy adjustment

avaluable forum foster mutual understand among representative major bank east asiaand pacific region. more two year pass since outset currency crisis asia,and say clearly witness recovery. thus, juncture, i believe ituseful examine kind regional cooperation desirable asia long-term perspective.positive negative side globalizationlet first consider globalization. the essence globalization integration marketsworldwide deepen various interdependent relations. a know, speed ofglobalization accelerating, especially financial markets. this clearly evidence thesignificant increase foreign exchange transaction international bond issue span thepast ten years. you agree rapid progress information communication technologyhas play decisive role drive force behind globalization.but, forget dynamic mechanism whereby globalization create pressure theharmonization system accounting, taxation corporate governance across borders,which, turn, lead globalization. a commonly said, “globalization begetsglobalization”. thus, move toward globalization inevitable reality, likely bereversed.bearing mind reality, need examine problem relate globalization weshould respond them. globalization bring variety changes. one obvious benefitfrom long-term viewpoint active cross-border capital flow realize efficient allocationof world resources.at time, precisely enhance efficiency, great risk rapidincrease international capital flow induce unexpected adverse impact, case whenfinancial crisis contagion follow outbreak asian financial crisis 1997 spread russiaand latin

toward regionalism orregional cooperation various part world. these movement toward promote regionalcooperation take due account trade financial relations. for example, europe, theintroduction euro

contrast trends, progress economic financial globalization onthe one hand, strengthen regional cooperation other? one possible interpretationof difficult question drive force behind globalization also make interaction ofeconomic financial activity close region lot common. for example, rapidprogress information communication technology regard one major factorssupporting integration financial market euro zone.therefore, globalization regional cooperation proceed simultaneously. furthermore, regionalcooperation, manage properly, promote globalization. for example, problem forwhich take long time form global consensus, may possible reach consensusrelatively quickly among specific regions. this case regional cooperation low barrier toglobalization country within region concerned.furthermore, common platform discussion framework solve problem aregion consist country similar economic condition policy orientation, may beable reduce cost global negotiation event international policy conflict shocks. insuch case, regional cooperation may supplement global cooperative framework. it may sound alittle ironic, regional cooperation become significant important whenglobalization progress rapidly. the global economy twenty-first century likely amulti-layered global network various form regional cooperation.regional cooperation asianow, i would turn regional cooperation asia. needle say, asia extremely diverse termsof culture, politics, religion. such diversity entail difficulty promote regional cooperation.in fact, speed regional cooperation asia slow compare regions. however,it also true extent interdependence become widespread deep witnessedby progress horizontal division labor increase capital flow east asia. in addition,since bitter experience currency crisis 1997 make u recognize risk spilloverand contagion, i believe momentum actively promote regional cooperation device tosupport globalization steadily increased.in promote regional cooperation, let offer three important point economic andfinancial area. first strengthen mutual surveillance. it major premise regionalcooperation country concern share common recognition respect economicand financial condition individual country region, interdependence, risksinherent regional economy.second, country region share common view future direction regionaleconomy also concrete policy response base recognition. bear mind lesson welearned currency crises, improve function financial market foreignexchange regimes, also strengthen domestic financial system financial supervisoryframeworks. in order make appropriate policy response, coordination among countriesin region also competition among much needed.third participation global effort toward stability international financial system, whichis often term “new international financial architecture” problem. it seem increasinglyimportant send coherent message asia international forum financial stabilityforum, group twenty finance minister central

relation country asian region, japan make appropriate contribution toregional development. to end, first all, japan must aggressively implement structuralreform realize robust economic fundamentals.at time, japan promote open improvement domestic market tocontribute efficient fair allocation world resources. particularly financial markets,various measure improvement effected. for example, benchmark

ferguson review last year’s economic performance theunited state raise topic relate underpinnings ofmacroeconomics monetary policyremarks mr roger w ferguson jr, vice-chairman board governor u federalreserve system, downtown economist club, new york, 17 february 2000.* * *thank much give opportunity join illustrious group economist thishistoric setting. the end one year start another natural time focus accomplishmentsand also list thing understand better. in spirit, i would like review last year’seconomic performance raise topic relate underpinnings macroeconomics andmonetary policy.of course, view i express necessarily reflect ofother member fomc board governors.economic performance 1999last year present various challenge monetary policymakers. domestic demand particularlystrong, lead consumption expenditures, grow 5½% last year. however, consumption onlyone engine drive spectacular performance 1999. business fix investment, pace byspending producers’ durable equipment, also rise strongly - 7%. one investment sector, thehousing sector, source considerable strength 1998, grow le rapidly last year.although single-family start rise 1999, start multifamily unit 1998pace.long-term interest rate trend downward early 1999 retrace decline theend year. equity price rise much 1999, raise value household asset andimproving general sense financial well-being citizen well low cost ofcapital face businesses.recovery asia, perhaps apparent exception japan, pick-up growth europeaccompanied good news unite states. during first half 1998, net export subtractedalmost 1¾ percentage point gdp growth. with condition improve overseas, externalsector subtract le ¾ percentage point growth second half 1999.throughout 1999, federal open market committee take action maintain balance theeconomy. the sense fomc tighten labor market accompany growthof demand exceed even stepped-up pace supply growth would likely create upward pressureson labor cost eventually rate price inflation. accordingly, move preemptively,raising rate 75 basis point three increments. this tighten reverse ease putin place second half 1998 response market turmoil, include u markets,triggered unexpected event russia. a well know, rate raise another 25 basispoints meet early month.at february meeting, fomc also abandon approach discuss “biases” regardinginterest rate movements, seem engender overly strong reaction misread ourintentions markets. instead, fomc adopt approach discuss view oneconomic development potential risk good economic performance. use new approach,the fomc early month indicate concern risk weight mainly toward conditionsthat might lead increase inflation. bi review 15/20002sources performancefour major force provide underpin vigorous domestic growth currentlyexperiencing. the first creation of, massive investment in, information communicationstechnology. this capital spending, along apparent technological improvements, think tohave important increase productivity - output good service per hour ofwork - currently provide momentum economy unite states. the secondmajor force business deregulation. the removal unnecessary government regulation start morethan 20 year ago, administration president gerald ford, gather momentum duringthe carter years. it alter business landscape. deregulation allowed, indeed forced, businessesto focus clearly market place become competitive, few constraint andincreased flexibility. the third major force prudent fiscal policy. the 1990s werecharacterized movement federal

business manage affair priority efficiency.observations open issues: resource utilizationagainst backdrop, i want raise issue progress need tounderstand recent macroeconomic event better. some issue concern sometime, new.the first issue i wish raise involve supply side economy grow recent,unusual conjuncture rapid growth high resource utilization low stable inflation. whatis proper measurement resource tightness? the two prominent measure resourcetightness, capacity utilization manufacture rate unemployment, historically movedfairly closely together cycle. however, diverge past several years, part asthe surge investment provide considerable capacity manufacture sector labormarkets become tight tighter. we need good understand implication thisdivergence and, particular, clear sense measure, combination measures, ofresource utilization best foreshadow emergence price pressures.a second, related, issue whether nature “capacity” changed. in 1940s 1950s,large-scale unit fix machinery - blast furnace assembly line - normallycharacterized manufacture capacity. many observer argue that, capacityrequired long lead time manufacture, test install, available capacity easy measure andslower change. in circumstances, high level capacity utilization good predictor ofresource tightness, likely translate price pressure. now, hear, capacity inmanufacturing technology intensive adjust easily reflect supply anddemand conditions. if true, relatively “elastic” supply manufacture capacity would imply thatcapacity utilization may become “tight” historical standard measure capacityutilization would therefore less-certain early warn signal potential price pressure. i haveseen proof assertion nature manufacture capacity changed, although theexperience last several year suggest has.a third relate issue average workweek labor force participation. during thisepisode strong growth, average workweek increase significantly. in 1994, averageworkweek 34½ hours, today 34½ hours. this steadiness part due mixshifts, economy move away manufacture sector jobs, 40-hour workweek isthe norm, service sector jobs, short workweek common. moreover, laborforce participation rate, fluctuating, remain around 67% period. give thevarious element evidence regard labor market tightness, include survey data job 3bis review 15/2000market condition measure unemployment rate, i find puzzle workweek andthe labor force participation rate increase strongly. one theory, course, thathousehold wealth, i turn next, might limit felt need potential workers,presumably young people dependent parent perhaps old citizens, participate labormarket.observations open issues: equity marketsalso interest valuation equity markets, role play policymaking, andwhether old relationship changed. many observer ask i think federal reservecan fix view proper level equity markets. every time i consider thisquestion, i come answer: feed cannot target specific level equity markets.equity price set give-and-take supply demand, participant buy sellingbased information shape long-term expectations. investor beinfluenced several factors, include expectation corporate earnings, attractiveness ofalternative investment (both domestic international), differ appetite “ownership” riskas oppose “creditor” risk. i believe federal reserve’s tool - primarily short-term interestrates - blunt attempt achieve specific level stock market valuations. i also believe thatpolicymakers necessarily attempt put judgment correct value ofthe market. simply put, equity price properly think relative price-the value theexisting capital stock relative goods. central bank good fine-tune relativeprices. rather, leave u responsibility determine policy anchor general pricelevel long run.however, equity market important spillover effect real economy. a know,economists often speak “wealth effect”, econometric model indicate consumersultimately tend spend three four cent every dollar increment wealth. in addition,consumer sentiment tie feel financial well-being. through channels, theso-called wealth effect general influence consumer sentiment, equity valuation canand affect consumption macroeconomic performance. equity market also significantsource investment capital, valuation stock market one determinant cost ofcapital businesses. therefore, equity price affect business fix investment, major driver oureconomy. give economic importance equity prices, reasonable policymakers tomonitor development market even “target” specific values. we see othereconomies burst bubble financial market create unsettle condition affectreal economic activity. therefore, maintenance sound equity market condition concern topolicymakers, though accomplish often far clear.my question equity market center issue valuation wealth effect. economistspropose numerous approach determine “correct” level equity prices. one approachcompares equity market valuation (namely earnings-price ratios) return fixed-incomesecurities, generally 10-year u treasury bond. but many observer suggest thismeasure “correct” stock market valuation may long accurate. some suggest thenature equity market change introduction new instrument allow bettermanagement share risks. therefore, observer assert low premium risk-freereturns appropriate old relationship earnings-price ratio return ontreasury instrument long hold. others argue that, world knowledge-intensiveindustries, account treatment accurately measure true economic earnings, thereforemeasures “correct” stock valuation capture economic reality market participant see.these assertion interesting, need investigation.in addition, respect proper valuations, know many business use option aform compensation employee value option record ascompensation time granted. we roughly estimate account value ofoptions grant would reduce report income s&p 1,500 firm nearly 10% 1998. thesame adjustment would reduce growth rate report income s&p 1,500 firm almost bi review 15/200042½ percentage point per year, average, 1996-98 period. when look theserefinements, current earnings-price ratio appear even alignment historicalexperience.when one consider performance stock market recent past, clear thegains evenly distributed, even among stock market investors. some great beneficiariesof unprecedented generation stock market wealth skill workstyle work high-tech companies, reward stock, courage toinvest high-tech sectors. this observation lead several questions. first, skew thedistribution gain stock market? if gain indeed skewed, actualdynamic wealth effect? when unequal participation equity become sufficientlybroad-based influence path economy? i think question provide themicroeconomic underpinnings macroeconomic performance.finally, see run-up margin debt, particularly last two month 1999 thefirst month 2000. i believe federal reserve foster impression aretargeting equity market adjust one tool margin area, namely initial marginrequirements. however, give obvious interest macro-stability, useful understand morefully motivate recent run-up margin. some argue reflect desire partof investor capture capital gains, others quick point that, percentage ofmarket valuation, margin increase dramatically. accord another theory, marginborrowing realm small investor whereas large investor finance equity purchase throughother means. in event, prudent margin procedure important part sound business practice.i expect extend margin credit, especially major clear firms, well investors,and public large, would continue recognize conservative margin practice owninterest.observations open issues: international marketslet turn role international development policy. our mandate give priority toprice stability maximum sustainable employment, i think right element u toconsider policy deliberations. therefore, i believe international economic considerations, likestock market valuations, receive focus merit implication theus economy. certainly, development international sector, particular large growingcurrent account deficit, might indicate imbalance economy unite states.similarly, movement exchange value u dollar might transmit pressure inflation, butthey also important transmission mechanism monetary policy. however, manage theexternal balance exchange value u dollar obviously

period domestic prosperity. how much long prosperity cancontinue obviously key question. the answer depend ability business workersin unite state continue generate grow productivity increases. because u forecastthe current period investment-driven productivity increases, difficult predict willend. we know that, point, productivity stop accelerating. but potential forchange exclusive domain unite

actual budgetary result could deviate quitesignificantly current expectations. some uncertainty center likelihood therecent spectacular growth labor productivity persist year ahead. like many privateforecasters, cbo office management budget assume productivity growth willdrop back somewhat recent stepped-up pace. but distinct possibility, i point outearlier, development diffusion new technology current wave innovationmay still relatively early stage scope acceleration productivity thusgreater embody budget projections. if so, outlook budget surplus would beeven bright anticipated.but significant downside risk budget outlook well. one limit knowledge ofthe force drive surge tax revenue recent years. of course, good part surge due 5bis review 13/2000to extraordinary

recent years, willdissipate reverse. if happen, project surpluses, even current economicassumptions, would shrink appreciably perhaps disappear. such outcome would especiallylikely adverse development occur part budget well - example, recentslowdown health care spend follow sharp pickup assume currentbudget projections.another consideration argue let unify surplus build budget stillsignificantly

noted, however, currently available forecast weremade autumn last year underlie assumption initial conditionsmay thus long fully reflect current perceptions. for example, imf since revise

reason worry? the bulkof forecast make autumn last year subject caveat potentiallyoutdated forecast assumption already mention earlier. in number cases, forecast alsoincorporate assumption rise

ourparticipation group basel committee bank supervision, joint forum, thefinancial stability forum help u meet challenge ahead.because time brief, i focus balance remark work basel committee. thefederal reserve actively involve committee since inception mid-1970s, andthe basel committee continue take lead coordinate bank supervisory policy andpractices globally. although representative g10 country luxembourg work ofthe committee, recognize supervisor non-g10 country typically adopt 3bis review 21/2000policies principle committee adopts. a result, committee seek incorporatethe view supervisor throughout world. a non-g10 work group, example, isparticipating current revision capital accord.as i know aware, basel committee devote tremendous amount time andresources effort develop new capital adequacy framework sensitive levelof underlie economic risk. indeed, comment due soon consultative paper issue last yearon topic. feedback industry important basel committee, i hope many ofyou communicate idea reaction bank international settlements.capital requirement essential supervisory tool foster safety soundness banks.the 1988 basel capital accord major achievement establish uniform standard forinternationally active banks. in year since, committee continue develop refine thestandard effort keep pace bank practice maintain adequate level bankcapital throughout world.many ask basel committee revise accord time. there beenrecognition start 1988 accord rather crude imperfect many respects.although accord incorporate differentiation credit risk, limited. moreover, theaccord explicitly address interest rate risk, operational risk, risk besubstantial banks. consequently, countries, include unite states, put inplace supplementary requirement - target ratio minimum level - help mitigatethe accord’s shortcomings. for example, prudential measure, unite state decide toapply separate leverage constraint provide limit leverage, regardless therisk-weighted basel approach might allow.beyond initial inherent imperfection accord, simply dramatic innovation overthe past decade financial market way bank manage mitigate credit riskhave drive need change. the committee concern particularly incentivesthat accord give bank take higher-risk, higher-reward transactions, engage inregulatory capital arbitrage. effort make standard sensitive underlie risk shouldgreatly reduce incentives.basel committee consultative paperlast year’s consultative paper set new paradigm judge capital adequacy base set ofthree so-called pillars. pillar i sound minimum capital standard or, essence, exist accordwith improvements. pillar ii supervisory oversight capital adequacy individual banks, andpillar iii market discipline support adequate public disclosure banks. these three pillarsrepresent evolution basel committee’s approach capital adequacy mutuallyreinforcing. the addition pillar ii iii acknowledge importance ongoing review bysupervisors capital adequacy individual bank critical role market discipline incontrolling risk-taking banks.the committee’s revision pillar i aim develop minimum capital standard moreaccurately distinguish degree credit risk appropriate bank vary level ofsophistication. in consultative document issue last june, committee set two possibleapproaches: standardize approach would tie capital requirement external credit assessments,such credit ratings, another approach would base bank’s internal ratings. thelatter would derive capital requirement bank estimate default probability fromestimated losses-given-default individual exposures. use estimate would help greatly inmaking capital requirement sensitive different level risk would also introduce moresubjectivity lack transparency process. therefore, may need limit constraincertain measures. how validate estimate also issue, especially consider thatbanks, themselves, often little historical data base key assumption calculations.comparability competitive equity among bank national bank system importantfactors debate. bi review 21/20004nevertheless, two-pronged approach offer simplify complex methodseems necessary reasonable order accommodate type banks. even then, however,we must recognize standard continue evolve. although i believe internalratings-based approach would provide important step forward, result would still likely differfrom bank’s economic capital allocation models. question correlation ofrisks among different asset group whether consider regulatory capitalstandard still unresolved go heart full credit risk models.beyond credit risk highly complex matter operate risk risk explicitlydealt accord. in past, course, overt charge credit risk carry full loadof risks, begin change. both basel supervisor committee theinternational bank community need address topic directly satisfactorily.regardless regulator supervisor do, bank manager must fully recognize andcontrol risks. a make great progress, regulators.in past, relatively rough rules-of-thumb traditional practice suffice supervise andmanaging banks. but derivative allow unbundle risk price structurefinancial product precision, similar technology innovation require moreprecision almost everything else do. and also everything bank supervisors.opportunities arbitrage within financial market capital regulation easily found. what youdo within industry bank supervisor must closely connect allrespects underlie economics. meet challenge keep u toes.recognizing supervisor need relate capital requirement individual bank closely totheir unique risk profiles, basel committee’s second pillar - supervisory review capital -emphasizes principle these:• supervisor expect, authority require, bank operate theminimum regulatory capital ratios• require bank ass maintain overall capital adequacy inrelation underlie risks• supervisor review evaluate internal capital adequacy assessment andstrategies banks, well compliance regulatory capital ratios• supervisor intervene early stage prevent capital fall belowprudent level require remedial action quickly capital become inadequate.i believe essential effective supervisory oversight assessment individual bankcapital complement meet regulatory capital requirements. this mean, however, thatsupervisors ultimate responsibility determine adequate level capital bank northat supervisory judgment replace bank management. rather active dialogue shouldtake place bank management supervisor regard optimum level capital.pillar ii thus move accord beyond simple ratio-based standard comprehensiveapproach assess adequacy capital levels.the supervisory review capital call pillar ii obviously resource implication forsupervisors around world may require significant change supervisory culture andtechniques many countries, g10 non-g10. the committee need develop guidancefor bank supervisor use evaluate adequacy internal capital assessment processes. aresidual benefit evaluation supervisor easily stay current evolvingindustry practice relate risk management good understand risk individual banksface.the third element propose new capital framework - pillar iii - relate market discipline,which i believe supervisor recognize critical complement supervisory oversightprocess. when bank disclose timely accurate information capital structure riskexposures, market participant good evaluate risk deal institutions. 5bis review 21/2000greater market discipline, turn, give bank incentive manage risk effectively toremain adequately capitalized.recognizing current disclosure practice country relatively weak, baselcommittee pillar work guideline would make bank risk transparent.the goal protect legitimate proprietary information, promote consistent disclosureamong nations. adequate disclosure become even important base regulatory capitalrequirements internal risk measure banks. clearly, information, itself, alwaysbetter. work industry, need decide specific element need job.indeed, ongoing partnership bank supervisor crucial success anyregulatory capital standard success supervisory process overall. it everyone’sinterest succeed effort international financial system remain sound.other basel committee initiativesalthough basel committee may best know work capital standards, effort extendwell beyond - suggest two pillars. it development core principle foreffective bank supervision 1997 particularly noteworthy. these twenty-five principle covera broad range supervisory issue involve license supervise bank enforcingsupervisory judgments. by set reasonable threshold standard bank supervisor allcountries achieve, committee substantially help promote financial stabilityworldwide. of course, challenge help country meet core principles, despite thelimited expertise resource may have. fortunately, international monetary fund andworld bank work committee significant help.the security insurance supervisor take similar step develop supervisory principlesof contribute strong supervisory regime worldwide provide aframework harmonization bank standards, appropriate.conclusionin closing, i see shortage difficult challenge face financial institution supervisor periodahead. clearly, supervisor various sector financial industry - banking, insurance, andsecurities - continue confront rapid dramatic change bank financialmarkets. supervisor need react technological innovations, expansion financial institutionsinto new increasingly complex activities, ongoing consolidation within industryworldwide. a rigorous, coordinate supervisory approach necessary counterbalance thepressures increasingly dynamic competitive marketplace. i confident workingtogether financial industry supervisor meet challenge. i want assure youthat, central bankers, federal reserve strong interest maintain efficient,well-managed, responsible financial institutions.i wish well year ahead. thank attention. 1bis review 20/2000mr garganas look challenge greek

precursored observation that, euro area, financialmarkets rely bank credit unite state unite kingdom. by contrast, debtsecurities share represent considerably small proportion gdp euro area doin unite state unite kingdom. hence, notwithstanding process ofdisintermediation securitisation currently way, financial structure euro area becharacterised bank-oriented security market-oriented. start thissituation, many commentator correctly observe euro area currently engage aprocess structural change towards market-based finance. a alan greenspan put it, recent“changes appear move continental europe’s financial system close structure evident ingreat britain unite states”.with regard debt securities, outstanding amount euro-denominated instrument increase allissuing sector 1999. however, increase pronounce private publicsector. at end-1999, share 52% public sector still account considerable proportionof total debt security denominate euro, decline compare 55% witness atend-1998. at time, share financial sector increase 38% 40% theshare non-financial private sector increase 5% 6%. obviously, significant changesin relative share various sector occur gradually time. however, developmentsseen 1999 receive large amount attention part market commentators, severalreasons.first, considerable increase private issuance euro area 1998 1999.this continue broadly unabated begin 2000. it recognise temporary orexceptional factor may play role 1999. for example, borrower may havefrontloaded issuance activity 1999, benefit possible enhance attractiveness newissues aftermath introduction euro. in addition, issuer may wish avoidplacing new issue around century date change fear possible liquidity problems, whicheventually occur. however, explanation sufficient account full theincrease private issuance activity see 1999, since trend continue thebeginning 2000.second, available data show increase private issuance, also series changesin various characteristic newly issue debt securities. for example, average size newbond issue increase considerably 1999, number large issues, eur 1 billion ormore, increase significantly. it recognise development partly reflect theincreased preference investor deep liquid instrument follow episode financialturmoil autumn 1998. however, another reason change, particularlynotable euro area, fact borrower able take advantage newly createdeuro-denominated bond market. by virtue size high degree openness, theeuro-denominated bond market able absorb large issue individual bondmarkets predecessor currency euro. 3bis review 54/2000looking detail component increase private euro-denominated bond issuance,it noteworthy issuance non-residents, although small relative total, increasedparticularly rapidly 1999. stand around eur 630 billion end 1999, outstandingamount euro-denominated debt security issue non-residents represent slightly le thanone-tenth total outstanding amount euro-denominated debt securities. however, thisconstituted increase 40% compare end-1998. in 1999, amount new issuesof euro-denominated debt security non-residents come close newdollar-denominated issue non-residents. hence, course 1999 euro-denominatedcomponent international bond market play far large role predecessor currency theeuro hitherto. this development line prediction make commentatorsbefore introduction euro. however, speed increase euro-denominatedinternational bond issuance 1999 remarkable.in 1999 main investor active euro-denominated segment international bond marketwere, previous years, investor locate euro area. hence, show recent ecbworking paper, although euro become important placement currency international bondsvirtually beginning, use euro international investment currency likely todevelop gradually time. from point view monetary policy, let recall theinternationalisation euro policy objective that, therefore, neitherfostered hind eurosystem.turning security form shares, close 900

well-rated borrowers, amount bondsissued category borrower increase rapidly 1999.it cannot deny process economic monetary union contribute positively tothis development.with introduction euro, financial price long affect intra-area foreignexchange risk premia. furthermore, i mention earlier, financial price generally incorporate muchlower inflation risk premia. a result low foreign exchange inflation risk premia, credit riskhas gain importance, relative terms, price financial instruments. in order dealwith evolution, financial market participant active euro area step theirassessment credit quality security issuers. this development may describe thedevelopment “credit risk culture”. in course 1999, development “credit risk culture”amongst investor active euro area lead borrower

follow aconsiderable increase 34% 1998.although considerable progress make far, appear nonetheless area ineuro area financial market lag behind term development. let u take, forexample, case repo market. the unsecured money market become fully integrate thelevel euro area soon introduction euro. however, strike that, althoughsome progress also make secure money market, repo market yet becomeintegrated anything like extent unsecured counterpart. in particular, turnover incross-border repo transactions, although increased, considerably. furthermore,market liquidity, measured, example, bid-ask spread repo transactions, still variessignificantly across countries. several technical factor seem prevent full developmentof area-wide repo market far. first, market infrastructure currently available repotransactions conducive cross-border trades. trade clear platform sufficientlyintegrated. in addition, security settlement system always make possible transferefficiently ownership security short-term basis, need repo transactions. asecond set factor hind development repo market area-wide level seem berelated country difference tax regime applicable repo transactions. furthermore, arealso legal difference across countries, particular relate possibility net financialobligations. these problem pose considerable challenge preparation thecontractual documentation underlie repo transactions.with regard market infrastructure, eurosystem belief market participant todeal problem find best market-oriented solutions. in repo operations, orderto ensure level playing-field, eurosystem put place system whereby counterpartiescan use eligible asset, irrespective location, collateral credit receive theeurosystem. at risk tread rather technical ground, let recall system consistsof two parts. first, national central bank act correspondent bank one another, takeeligible asset custody one another’s account. second, link thesecurities settlement systems, asset may transfer use links, provide link havebeen review european system central bank (escb) judge comply escbstandards. in fact, thank facilities, counterparties eurosystem make extensive useof collateral cross-border basis.are financial market euro area become efficient?i like reflect upon question efficiency financial market euro area. iwill first briefly touch upon retail financial markets. i shall address wholesale financial market ingreater detail. 5bis review 54/2000one particular development illustrate progress recently make retail bank markets. in theeuro area dispersion interest rate loan house purchase decline noticeably courseof 1999, continue trend apparent since 1996. between 1996 1998, theconvergence interest rate loan house purchase parallel convergence ofmarket interest rate across country would late form euro area. by 1999 differentialsbetween market interest rate reach stable level across euro area. however, cross-countrydifferentials interest rate loan house purchase continue narrow sizeably. morespecifically, country use particularly high, interest rate loan housepurchase come close euro area average 1999. hence, despite fact bank yet, inmany cases, directly compete cross-border basis grant loan housepurchase, customer already able benefit competitive loan prices. thisdevelopment particularly interest interest rate rise 1999 exceptionally lowlevels record begin year.although considerable progress already made, clearly remain obstacle thedevelopment competitive market bank product service level euroarea. for example, need improve cross-border retail payment service euro area. inorder encourage development cross-border payment system enable public benefitmore fully single currency, eurosystem draw list desirable objective forcross-border retail payment euro area. it stand ready play coordinate supportiverole. in particular, eurosystem consider highly desirable price settlement lag ofcross-border transfer similar national transfers, whenever applicable standard andprocedures permit.turning wholesale financial markets, progress clearly rapid retailfinancial markets. already run-up introduction euro, especially since 1 january1999, large decline transaction cost many areas. in foreign exchange, interestrate equity markets, bid-ask spread often decline 1999 compare 1998, sometimes verysignificantly. furthermore, trade activity expanded, particularly segment theprivate bond markets. a result increase trade activity, market participant able tocarry large transaction within short period time easily low costs. hence, in1999 bid-ask spread also indicator point towards increase depth andliquidity financial market euro area.the change transaction cost particularly notable unsecured money market. in thecontext conduct monetary policy, creation area-wide operational framework therefinancing operation eurosystem modify micro-structure money marketconsiderably. despite continue use different trade systems, money market euro hasgained clear cross-border orientation, largely thank establishment target. very soonafter introduction euro, typical bid-ask spread quote unsecured money market ofthe euro become narrow liquid money market global level. furthermore,swaps index overnight reference rate, measure eonia, become verywidely use instrument, also offer particularly small bid-ask spreads. it therefore clear theunsecured money market euro become fully integrate function well. however, asalready mentioned, still scope development repo market.in segment euro-denominated interest rate market equity market, range offinancial instrument available market participant expand markedly 1999. for example, themost widely trade short-term interest rate future denominate euro contract index thethree-month euribor. for instruments, range available delivery date currently go upto five years. this le ten year available three-month libor future trade theunited states. however, wide range maturity use available thepredecessor currency euro. from point view monetary policy, market price ofsuch product provide information interest market expectations.the development mortgage bond market constitute another example. in several country theeuro area, legal text recently enact permit development market mortgage bi review 54/20006bonds similar german pfandbriefe. new issue non-german pfandbriefe verysuccessful, strong demand part investor type instrument.in 1999 number financial market institution create wide array stock price index bondindices cover euro area whole. this development contribute extend range oftrading position-taking opportunity available investors.stock price index available mainly two forms: broad narrow. broad index provide aprecise measure stock price development euro area stock market. the narrow indices,which nature cannot consider representative euro area whole, useful becausethey easy investor track purchase sale limit number stocks. forthis reason, narrow index instrumental development equity derivative contracts.overall, turnover area-wide stock index derivative grow steadily past 18 months,increasingly take large share total turnover stock index derivative euro area. withthe progress economic integration context economic monetary union, recentyears stock market investor increase share stock portfolio manage withreference area-wide risk factors. this process accelerate 1999, introduction euroseemed act catalyst creation area-wide stock price indices.in course process, investor also take advantage sectoral stock price indices. inparticular, interest observe exchange create future option contractsindexed certain sectoral stock price indices, technology sector, telecommunicationssector bank sector, take examples. not introduction financialproducts respond demand investors, also make possible process informationand circulate across market price formation mechanism. this information onarea-wide sectoral development clearly beneficial investor manage large area-wideportfolios. it also useful small investors, help form judgement takingof position certain specific stocks. at global level, noteworthy that, begin of2000, various financial market institution publish sectoral stock price index take stepstowards good harmonisation sector classifications. these changes, expect tobring benefit user data, obviously also apply stock price index availablefor euro area.for bond indices, much observation make stock price indices. the availablebond price index include area-wide index split accord various maturity bucketsalong yield curve break accord whether issuer government orfrom private sector. in turn, private sector index often available sectoral breakdowns, forexample financial sector versus non-financial sector, credit rat breakdowns, exampletriple a versus double a versus single a forth go credit curve. it cannot bedenied benchmark index bond play useful role course developmentof bond market euro area.in sum, wholesale financial market euro area currently benefit strongly thecontinued reduction transaction costs, development spread new financial productssuch pfandbriefe, introduction wide set area-wide sectoral index stockprices bonds.looking forward, number challenge met. in regard, without aim beingexhaustive, i like address three topics: question benchmarking euro area bondmarkets; challenge pose electronification trade systems; need take intoaccount risk extreme event modernise market infrastructure euro area.over recent weeks, episode when, countries, unite state andthe unite kingdom, process reduce public debt advanced, government bondyields subject strong unexpected downward pressures. some downwardpressures yield reflect sudden increase liquidity premia. investor seem concernedthat future pace reduction government debt would become high create imbalancebetween high demand low supply government bonds. on heel developments, thequestion benchmarking instrument bond market naturally consider quite acute. 7bis review 54/2000prior introduction euro, euro area country non-negligible private bond market,government bond generally use benchmark price corporate bonds.furthermore, government bond also generally use conduit position-taking hedgingon interest rate markets. in respect, future option contract use national governmentbonds underlie reference widely used, conjunction position-taking bothgovernment private bond markets. since introduction euro, certain limit number ofgovernment bond play role benchmark level euro area whole. thismainly include german government bond and, short end maturity spectrum, frenchgovernment bonds. furthermore, total turnover government bond future option becomevery concentrate contract index german government bonds, although beenrenewed competition contract recent months. the risk associate anopen position single contract large underlie bond available delivery mayhave play role.in context, question arise whether amount outstanding benchmark governmentbonds remain sufficient cover benchmarking needs, particularly public deficit debtsshould reduce euro area. already quite time ago, commentator putforward idea interest rate swap market, which, international standards, welldeveloped euro area, could least partly play role benchmark. in fact, clear theswap curve constitute widely use reference price private sector debt instrument aswell measurement market risk instruments. with regard derivative instruments, iam confident financial market institution come solution possible shortage ofthe underlie government bonds. this development, itself, would welcome, would reflect adecline government deficit debt level line stability growth pact. forexample, instrument pool instrument may use provide underlie pricereferences exchange-traded derivative instruments. all all, two main condition befulfilled instrument serve reference interest rate derivative contracts. first, referenceinstruments trade market sufficiently deep liquid constitute reliableand efficient price source. second, requisite legal institutional condition place toensure position derivative may easily either reverse prior expiry, roll thetime expiry settle time expiry way cash payment.moving second item short list issues, let consider challenge pose bythe electronification trade systems. this development remarkable foreignexchange markets. automatic trade system rapidly, course past threeyears, become widely use way match buy sell orders. in course thisdevelopment, large part voice-based trade process disappeared. in context, certainobservers regard symptomatic possible problem that, particular day 1998 1999,foreign exchange rate fluctuate unusually large amount within short period time. theseobservers argue change role market maker price formation mechanism, resultof market electronification, cause underlie unusual gap behaviour see inforeign exchange rate particular days. if hypothesis prof correct, likely thatany gap phenomenon would disappear transition new framework complete andthe new market infrastructure become well established.meanwhile, electronification market also make progress interest rate equity markets.over recent months, certain institution make available, particularly internet, relativelycheap automatise trade systems. these system carry match order well thesettlement transactions, sometimes net basis, stock exchanges. the shift portionof trade activity away stock exchange onto electronic trade system may result morepronounced risk gridlocks, electronic trade platform adopt sufficiently safeprocedures. furthermore, quality price discovery process electronic trade platformsmay always sufficient, least transition period. this could, example, casewhen several system cover identical instrument function independently eachother. the result risk fragmentation certain market prompt

governor oesterreichische nationalbank, paneldiscussion monetary policy, 28th economics conference oesterreichische nationalbank,held vienna, 15 june 2000.* * *ladies gentlemen!central banker use act uncertainty - fact, major rationale theirexistence. the eurosystem - i.e. ecb euro area national central bank - undergo -and, i believe, successfully pass - special test “monetary policy uncertainty” managingthe transition emu conduct monetary policy first one half year theeuro area’s existence. indeed, emu represent major regime shift, number associateduncertainties, data uncertainties, uncertainty monetary transmission mechanismacross euro area, uncertainty economic structure euro economy adaptingto new, competitive environment, and, last least, uncertainty interactionbetween various economic policymakers.ladies gentlemen, let contribute six observation issue panel discussion whichwere obviously similar.the first observation relate role monetary policy situation economy possiblyentering new era. some proponent new economy claim monetary policy berelaxed “give growth chance”. now, i certainly sympathy economic policiessupporting economic growth, employment welfare, i think categoric claim beside point.monetary policy always unambiguously - without “new economy” - pursue itsprimary objective maintain price stability. a stable anchor price expectation particularlyimportant period heighten uncertainty. it common wisdom that, crediblysticking price stability, monetary policy serf growth best. indeed, argue - i wouldsubscribe assessment - low inflation 1990s among contribute favorableframework condition lay grind recent emergence dynamic entrepreneurshipand innovation unite states. in addition, highly competitive far le regulate marketstructure u economy contribute substantially new business new technologies.this does, however, mean monetary policy blind ignorant vis-à-vis changesbrought new economy. quite contrary!this bring second observation, lady gentlemen. in situation uncertainty aregime change, central issue monetary policy is: economic indicator best focus inorder ass inflation prospects. and indicator - policy objective -where shift weight might appropriate.any regime change may unwelcome effect alter long stand economic relationships.the advent new economy affect number variable central bank would normallymonitor ass whether economy below, potential whether thereforeinflationary pressure likely emerge. a new economy would, definition, increase theeconomy’s potential output, potential output concept directly indirectly derive -such output gap, nairu (i.e. non-accelerating-inflation rate unemployment) naturalrate unemployment growth - become le reliable indicator future price developments.thus, central bank attach le weight indicator period fundamentalchanges trend growth potential output suspected. at time, potential break inlong-standing economic relationship mean quantitative models, usually estimatedfrom long time series, become le reliable guide interpretation current future bi review 52/20002economic developments. thus, necessity, central bank attach weight detailedanalysis current economic developments.ladies gentlemen, lead third observation. the eurosystem’s two-pillar monetarypolicy strategy particularly choose cater period transition uncertainty, although - tobe frank - time design strategy, certainly new economy mind buthad quite different concerns. the two-pillar strategy allow u - compel u - follow closely andsystematically wide range monetary, economic financial indicator may giveindications future inflation economic development large. it easily accommodate theadvisable shift relative weight attach various variable i advocate previously.what more, two-pillar strategy pretend existence certainty stable economicrelationships reality things. in sense, honest strategy. to betransparent public, though, require special communication effort central banks.by means, two-pillar strategy conviction clearly superior - particularly presentjuncture considerable model uncertainty - mechanical rule-based approaches. the latter areusually tailor specific view economy operate therefore le likely performwell period view might adapted. monetary policy rule usually derive theirpolicy recommendation narrow set economic indicator only. in many case restheavily output gap equilibrium real interest rate, which, i point out, arepotentially unreliable concept present juncture.ladies gentlemen, let now, fourth observation, address issue neweconomy would influence monetary policy long run, word would affect thelong-term prospect real interest rates. again, unfortunately simple answer.even unite states, recent data clearly point substantial increase growth rate ofproductivity, still open whether new economy would permanently increase trend rate ofproductivity growth or, alternatively, cause one-off shift level productivity only.what more, even latter case one-time level shift productivity, could take theeconomy quite time - decade - reach new steady state. it therefore alsoin near medium-term future remain unclear two effect ict revolution entails.ladies gentlemen, let now, fifth observation, turn immediate period thetransition possible new economy. a recently point alan greenspan, thepotential problem monetary policy new economy pick-up productivity maycreate even great increase aggregate demand potential aggregate output. so, otherwords, monetary policy need closely watch relative size - time - potentialeffects aggregate supply demand. let elaborate little bite this. i close wassaid president broaddus governor bäckström.the prospect high productivity, high economic growth thus high profit may boost stockprices particularly firm operate new ict sectors, observe past fewyears. the associate stock price rally increase consumers’ financial wealth.at time, current high labor demand generally optimistic outlook economy mayincrease workers’ expectation future salaries, thus also increase human wealth. takentogether, may boost consumer spend even ahead of, excess of, growth effectsactually materializing. in case, temporary excess demand would spur inflation, monetarypolicy intervene order cool demand pace consistent increase theeconomy’s productive capacity.by contrast, demand supply effect new economy develop broadly parallel,monetary policy could pursue neutral stance. this mean central bank keepnominal short-term interest rate constant. rather, see overall monetary conditions,including exchange rate long-term interest rates, remain neutral.it also follow i say before, monetary policy try target specific level ofstock price put lid stock prices. particularly era potential substantial regime 3bis review 52/2000change, impossible judge confidence appropriate level stock prices.monetary policy should, however, take account current - potential future - aggregatedemand effect arise rise - potentially fall - stock prices.concluding, lady gentlemen, let finally observe factor behind new economyapplicable u could also similar positive effect europe.as regard technology, i already point open remarks, chance europe- base u experience - achieve good results. a second argument consist benefit ofthe european integration global economy advantage common market - likederegulation area telecommunication public utility sector. finally, theestablishment monetary union force restructure corporate sector facilitate neweconomic policies.all all, latter require much strict approach european level abandon rigidity thelabor, good service markets, create favorable environment entrepreneurship toimprove structure technique risk capital markets.compared situation year ago, head forward crucial areas. therefore,i much convince europe also potential new economy will toadopt process structural reform. but many good reason optimism.

evolution;– economic strength scope progress euro area.both topic fact related: bear future international monetary andfinancial system; illustrate worldwide effort build stable economic monetaryrelationships increasingly globalize world.1.let’s consider first international financial architectureseveral complex issues, often inter-related, currently stake. on them, eurosystem(i.e. european central bank - ecb - eleven national central bank - ncbs - euroarea) elaborate common view. it common view i present i havehad occasion present it, position banque de france, last g vii meeting, lastapril.i see five major point systemic interest: – orderly liberalization capital movements;– question reserve debt management;– key issue transparency;– question moral hazard associate private sector involvement;– finally choice exchange rate regime.1.1orderly liberalization capital movementsthe liberalization capital movement benefit individual country world economy: itenhances long-term growth potential improve savings/investments allocation. however, twofollowing principle need carefully take account order minimize risks:– restructure domestic financial system strengthen domestic regulatoryand supervisory framework precondition utmost importance: emerge economiesshould bring domestic financial system line regulatory supervisoryminimum requirement prevail mature

private sector involvement crisesresolution. but need general principle highlight role responsibility thepublic private sectors, define framework adopt g7 atthe köln summit june 1999. among principles, i would particularly stress:– focus medium term sustainability country’s finance position;– objective achieve comparability treatment within country’s bilateralofficial private creditors.1.5choice right exchange rate regimethe sustainability exchange rate regime depend crucially consistency country’sdomestic macroeconomic structural policy framework.this said, choice exchange rate regime rest follow principles:– so-called “corner solutions” necessarily available options. free float ratesmay help accommodate volatile capital flow asymmetric shocks; however, theymight prevent misalignment lead balance payment desequilibrium, mightprove disruptive real sector small open economies, often lack size fordeveloping necessary market infrastructure cope exchange

in case country need respond large capital inflow relate risk ofinflation real appreciation, great exchange rate flexibility might become desirable.let conclude consideration two observations:– first, concentrate effort implementation exist code andstandards. implementation key word present times. apply standard code bi review 52/20004all economy world, include emerge economy economy transition animmense, challenge urgent endeavor.– second, regard private sector involvement, i recommend pragmatic andas consistent possible. pragmatic case case assessment always need andthere is, opinion, mechanistic “a priori” approach would advisable.consistent, mean assessment make international community theconcept participation private sector crisis solution, stick it.2.let turn second topic presentation relate economicstrengths euro zone impact euro itselfmore specifically, i would like stress three reason make confident euro zoneand therefore convince euro significantly appreciate future:– euro zone may expect long phase steady economic growth;– structural reform underway strong economic growth sustainable;– european firm restructure enter global competition.2.1the euro zone may expect long phase steady economic growthin past months, euro zone benefit strong economic recovery. at end 1998and notably first half 1999, european country face temporary economicslowdown, partly result financial economic turmoil east asia. but since then, theeuro zone benefit strong economic recovery (4% annual term second half of1999). one important feature evolution fact country whose economic growth hadbeen lag far catch up.this present economic recovery take place sound economic environment. inflation levelremains control even though balance risk price stability recently go up: somepressures result recent oil price rise may result capacity constraint thatcould encounter course next years. needle say govern council theeurosystem remain vigilant order secure primary objective pricestability.besides, current account slightly surplus fiscal deficit are, euro zone whole,on downward trend.it worth stress european economy never create many new job fast. thepast two year (1998 1999) see rapid job growth (about +1.5% year) bigdecrease unemployment. in france, rise sharp since almost 900,000 new job werecreated enterprise (excluding government administration) december 1996 december1999 i.e. +6.6% three years. with economic growth speed up, expect dropin unemployment rate presently 10%.due economic recovery, growth differential u euro zone isprogressively disappear. this gap two economic zone term economic growthhas result past year lag economic cycles. accord presentanalysts’ consensus, growth differential two zone narrow year practicallydisappear next year. accord imf forecasts, growth reach 3.2% u 2001compared 3.0% euro zone.2.2structural reform underway europe likely permit sustainablenon-inflationary growththe undertake speed structural reform one condition complete successof euro. in regard, lisbon european council, hold last 23 april, view 5bis review 52/2000important step towards necessary medium term strategy structural reform union. thelabor market become flexible past year europe. i would like give fewexamples evolution. in countries, number people fixed-term contract quicklyincreased; count large part job create 1995 1998 trend hascontinued since then. in many countries, fiscal measure (for instance reduction non-wage costs)have give incentive hire young less-skilled people (france, italy, spain germany).another key change rapid growth part-time employment, especially among women.while europe long strong tradition economic regulation, must acknowledge thatderegulation well underway countries. the change particularly noticeable several keysectors telecommunication (mobile phone particular), transportation (particularly airlines)and power-supply industry (electricity gas) mention them.major country embark ambitious overhaul public sector. in country alarge public sector, italy france, ambitious privatization program steadily reduce thenumber state enterprise (banking insurance sectors, manufacture sector…). it noteworthythat program carry various government different political orientation.in addition privatization, state enterprise changing; company remain government ownedare become profit-minded (particularly airlines, railways…).2.3european firm restructure enter global competitioneuropean firm go deep restructuring. merger acquisition hit new recordsas company seek create national, regional global market-leaders (m&as close $1,500bn in1999 500bn 1997). venture capital start-ups boom investor entrepreneursbecome convince europe compete america knowledge-based industries. heavyindustries large conglomerate restructure never before. finally, new rule corporategovernance spread over.the outflow foreign direct investment merely mirror dynamism european firms. europeanfirms lag behind u firm term foreign direct investment catch up.european firm enter “globalization process” whereby aim reach global sizethrough external purchases.as conclusion, i would like make three remarks: global financial markets, euro andon people’s republic china.– on global financial markets, i draw attention one importantchallenges face with: “herd instinct” market participants, which, incertain cases, amplify considerably volatility, create augment misalignment andinduce large-scale global contagion case local crisis. the herd instinct probablyprofoundly enshrine function marketplace. in order minimize effects, ihave three provisional conclusions:• perhaps second look rapid generalization day daymark market accountings. perhaps good medium term function marketwould call clear distinction various market participant depend ontheir time horizons.• it seem would also important reflect upon consequence thevery rapid increase mutual fund major markets. all manager thesefunds prove permanently short-term basis bettermanaged average. this create powerful potential herd instinct.• finally, i profoundly think full transparency efficient tool counterthe set “herd” cope potential “herd” behavior. when oneknows particular “signature” particular country, muchless reason embark blind crisis contagion. here motto i would like bi review 52/20006accepted globally market participants: “let u judge quality andcreditworthiness particular signature upon peculiar fundamentals, uponits own, particular, asset liabilities”.– on euro, i want stress euro zone adopt sound macro policy hasembarked fairly comprehensive program structural reforms. these reform taketime fully completed. but already boost economic growth, job creation andthe restructure firms. i impress achieve past yearsand national central bank well ecb strongly encourage government andcorporate business foster structural reform business restructure future.the eurosystem, guardian euro sake people europe,knows fellow citizen want single currency least solid theirprevious national currencies: france, give one example, 96% people arecalling euro least solid franc; needle say ingermany country monetary union. that reason i fullysubscribe declaration president, wim duisenberg, name governingcouncil: “european citizen assure future euro strongcurrency, base price stability strength european economy.”a stable, solid, strong euro interest europe.– on people’s republic china, i would like praise highly responsible attitudewhich adopt beijing asian crisis. china play decisive rolein help stabilize full body region gain immense credit inasia global community whole. i entirely share sentiment premier zhuon role prudent monetary policy people’s bank china success.i impress quality

internal resource implement internal ratings-based approach, somesupervisors indicate implementation approach would create resource strain forthem. further, want ensure bank look accord common standard -many locate emerge market country - subscribe revise framework.in order improve risk sensitivity standardize approach without become overlycomplex, committee propose use external credit

regulatory capital sovereign orbank claims.notwithstanding support, many commentator offer modification committee’sproposed standardize framework, several observer suggest go far enoughtoward risk differentiation. the committee take concern heart, actively evaluatingwhether would feasible incorporate additional risk weight standardize approach, and,if so, done.as work toward great risk differentiation among claim rated, continue giveextensive think treatment unrated claims, give penetration external ratingsremains low countries. it difficult avoid create incentive remain unrated thesame time retain continuity exist accord’s treatment credits. further workwould need develop standard unrated claim would risk-reflective but,unfortunately, commentator offer significant suggestion

point trouble become apparent.this important point, one must give serious consideration. it view theglobal financial system need move toward address potential credit problem preemptively -before problem time grow minor disturbance major disruptions. a risk-sensitive capital framework help ensure bank hold appropriate capital behind high-riskcredits first place, thus reduce tendency accentuate need capital afterproblems arise loans.credit risk mitigation techniquesgreater recognition benefit risk mitigation technique - collateral, guarantees, creditderivatives net - also forefront committee’s work revise accord.in january last year, committee hold consultation 50 bank industry associationswithin g10 method mitigate credit risk. we evaluate incorporatethe risk-reducing benefit

important risks, interest rate risk thebanking book operational risk.for interest rate risk, pursue methodology would require capital charge forso-called “outlier” bank whose interest rate risk significantly average. the envisionedframework determine “outlier” bank interest rate risk similar general framework forcredit risk - sophisticate bank would use internal measurement system assign bi review 50/20004capital, bank without sufficiently robust internal system would use simple standardizedapproach. the committee still work number issue topic, include definitionof “outlier” bank supervisory assumption would need build standardizedapproach.the committee, risk management group, also engage development capitalrequirement risks, particular operational risk. over past year, meet

bank financialsystems. the committee, january year, issue paper bank disclosures, cover banks’capital structures, risk exposure capital adequacy. currently, transparency group isconsidering whether possible establish set core disclosure would bolster marketdiscipline. this involve draw upon exist disclosure recommendations, reviewingthe extent disclosure new area - internal ratings-based method, external rat orinternal assessment risk - might appropriate.i hope overview give sense key point committee learn theconsultative process, headed. in near-term, complete work andexpect next month make progress number areas, include great riskdifferentiation standardize approach development supervisory standard internalratings.as continue fine-tune new capital adequacy framework, also strive avoid gettingbogged secondary issue could slow overall process. a i often remarked,the perfect cannot enemy good. it imperative stay track goal torelease new capital adequacy framework early next year, comment period industryimplementation follow shortly thereafter. 5bis review 51/2000corporate governancemy remark thus far focus need risk-reflective capital framework. clearly, astrong capital position crucial sound operation bank organization. it allow banks’board director senior management focus strategic objective growth opportunities,supports business activity organization, provide financial strength necessary tosustain occasional loss inevitable business take calculate risks.in latter sense, capital represent last line defense potential loss-creating problems.but, i want briefly address first line defense - effective bank management, increasinglyis important element today’s supervisory framework banks’ activity associatedrisks become ever complex.there several aspect effective bank management. the importance good corporategovernance cannot overemphasized. broadly speaking, corporate governance refer theorganizational infrastructure necessary achieve workable corporate strategy, effectivelyimplement strategy, continually evaluate risk benefit organization. thesebasic infrastructural element include:–independent competent outside directors;–capable experience management;–a coherent corporate strategy business plan; and,–clear line responsibility accountability.there three key point closely relate good corporate governance critical anybanking institution. the first rigorous internal control apparatus, essential soundand successful execution banks’ strategic objectives. second, bank institution must inplace technical system management process necessary identify risk associate withits activities. third, effective risk management control structure must accompany theinstitutional management culture require ensure policy procedure translate intopractice, buy-in staff levels.primary responsibility ensure bank place good corporate governance, rigorousinternal control effective risk management lie board director seniormanagement. the task board director oversee development overall strategy ofthe organization decision make senior management pursuit strategy. the role ofsenior management, turn, assure day-to-day decision make within organization areconsistent policy long-term objective board. with regard board ofdirectors, i recognize difficult elect member necessary skill time todevote oversee bank. while major challenge, obviously important weget right overall well-being bank.conclusionin closing, i want emphasize effective supervision modern bank organization willnecessarily entail close cooperative partnership industry participant officialsupervisors. the industry’s participation formulation risk-sensitive capital adequacyframework good example kind constructive interaction. indeed, three pillar theproposed framework - minimum standards, supervisory review banks’ capital assessmentmethodologies, market discipline - reflect understand regulatory requirement alone areno long sufficient address grow complexity banks’ activity associate risks.consistent notion need effective corporate governance, play increasinglyimportant role rapidly evolve bank environment.it clear me, former commercial banker supervisor, industry andsupervisors work together, meet responsibility reinforce other, ableto successfully manage supervise modern financial system. while perspective may differ bi review

analyst meet atenskilda securities, hold stockholm, 14 june 2000.* * *i would like thank invite today’s analyst meet give opportunity todiscuss financial stability issue qualify audience.i would like start briefly explain riksbank’s analysis financial stability. in addition tothe inflation target, riksbank another primary task, namely responsible forfinancial stability. these two important function closely linked. a stable financial system isimportant price stability since financial imbalance threaten inflation target. likewise, aninflation target policy contribute stability financial system, level effect oncyclical fluctuations.the riksbank’s analysis financial stability interest analyst bank propertyshares, since closely monitor bank sector property market within scope thisanalysis. our perspective somewhat different, however, since mainly interest riskswhich threaten stability financial system often appear relativelyimprobable, stock analyst attempt ass likely development market.however, information market largely analyst also need consider therisks company covering.after introduction, i go discus strong credit expansion sweden themeasures central bank take ass development constitute potential threatto financial stability. i conclude look international developments, since developmentin sweden mean unique.the riksbank financial stabilitythe comprehensive change take place financial sector financial crisis thathave occur various part world mean work secure financial stabilityhas become increasingly prioritised. those country undergo severe bank crisis inmodern time lead way term work financial stability. for example,sweden first country world regularly openly publish special stability reportsanalysing situation financial system. we would say initiative receive withmixed feel central banks, concern kind reportswould cause problem rather prevent them. however, attitude riksbank beenthat open honest communication financial player observe andremedy potential problem early stage. despite initial scepticism, several country havenow follow riksbank’s example. norway uk publish stability report anddenmark also recently issue first stability report. since financial market operate acrossnational borders, riksbank work together closely foreign central bank issues. forexample, riksbank participate several ecb committee relate stability issue take anactive part ongoing work reform capital adequacy regulations.it also stipulate law one primary function riksbank promote stable andefficient payment system. in order fulfil task, riksbank must closely follow developmentsin financial institution central importance payment system, i.e. primarily thefour major banks, sufficiently large cause problem financial stability fail.the analysis focus three main areas. the first area concern general development bankingsector - competitiveness long-term profitability bank developing. the secondarea examine credit risk relate banks’ lend household non-financial companies. bi review 50/20002the third area analyse counterparty settlement risk arise connection thebanks’ trade take position financial markets. the analysis undertake ongoingbasis present financial stability report, issue twice year.i mainly focus analysis banks’ credit risk associate lend household andcompanies. this subject attract grow attention lending, especially thehousehold sector, rise significantly. a certain increase lend normal economicupswing, company need borrow order invest, household borrow, example, inorder meet rise house prices. in economic boom, loan loss also generally low, theytend high recession.the increase level indebtedness also come discussion. the question raise ofwhether household company today borrow extent could lead problem inthe bank sector economic cycle turn downward. history show u factor whichhas trigger bank crisis modern time often extensive loan loss cause changesin macroeconomic environment. this also case swedish bank crisis thebeginning 1990s.is growth credit worrying?so situation present? figure april show total lend general public up7.3% compare april 1999. the main growth household lending, rise 8.8%,while corporate lend increase 4.1%.1 a perspective figure obtain weconsider relation gdp. this give measure whether lend grow fast ratethan economy whole, provide u indication whether imbalance beingbuilt up.corporate lend relation gdp remain relatively constant last four years, iscurrently far level prevail end 1980s. the financial statementspresented company also currently strong, suggest good solvency. in context, iwould also like point company within “new economy” currently verymuch news show weak profitability finance primarily via risk capitalmarket via bank loans. this mean possible downturn part corporate sectorshould limit direct effect banks.in term household lending, situation rather different. lend household risenrelatively strongly last two year currently amount 40% gdp. it thereforeapproaching level saw end 1980s. however, stress households’interest expense currently low due low interest rates. this rise lend also reflectedin household debt ratio, i.e. debt relation disposable income, rise nowamounts 104%.households borrow increase extent, time economic situation hasimproved result rise disposable income fall unemployment. household havetraditionally borrow mostly housing, current increase type lend perhapsnot surprise view fact house price metropolitan area rise relativelysignificantly. what remarkable lend purpose increase high rate.it difficult see statistic exactly borrow money used, lend frombanks finance company grow fast rate lend mortgage institutions.this give rise apprehension household borrow consumption order toinvest shares, could lead rapid increase risks. in order gain good understand ofwhether case, financial supervisory authority recently commence anexamination banks’ lend household sector.1excluding repos. 3bis review 50/2000there several reason property price play central role discussion financialstability. in addition fact, i mention earlier, credit demand among household islargely govern demand price level property, property also use collateralfor loans. another reason monitor property sector large part banks’ lend isto property companies. these company also account large part loan loss thebanking crisis early 1990s.property price rise recently, particular price residential property metropolitanregions. in contrast 1980s, see broad price increase across whole ofsweden, case then. likewise, cause rise price appear low interest rates,a high rate new occupancy low construction activity rather speculation. this indicatesthat currently major risk fall residential property prices. however, everycause observe development carefully. new construction always take place considerabletime lag experience show many project ready come onto market untilafter turn point occurred, point thing quickly deteriorate.with regard commercial property, development moderate. again, mainly inthe metropolitan area price rise due high demand. the level new constructioncontinues low premise today already lease build commences.one way analyse extent speculative tendency inherent property price toplace direct yield relation risk-free interest.2 at end 1980s, risk-free interest ratewas considerably high direct yield properties, suggest people boughtproperties expectation future price rise and/or significant rent increases. today, situationis different. direct yield level appear reasonable relation risk-free interest. with regard toapartment build stockholm, direct yield low risk-free interest, sametime price affect fact property deal make connection convertingapartment build tenant-owned apartments. for type transactions, direct yield cannot beused measure since tenant-owners association require return comparable tothat owner rental property.the financial statement present property company also considerably strong today thanwhat ten year ago. the risk associate lend sector bank appear tobe considerably low then. among list property companies, seem though many considerthat level indebtedness become low, consider extensive interest buy backshares within sector. at time buy back share lead high return equity,there reason company credit granter observe risk associate higherindebtedness. above all, company become extremely sensitive change interest rates.an overall assessment credit situation sweden thus suggest great cause bepleased lend grow integral part current economic upturn worry aboutthe risk may accumulate. however, integral part riksbank’s role remind aboutchanges occur rapidly unexpectedly.what situation countries?getting back credit expansion household sector, development see sweden todayis unique. the american economy subject much recent discussion. a growingnumber voice warn risk build something financial bubble.the apprehension derive highly inflate asset values, low save increase indebtedness,i.e. principle, similar situation one currently sweden. total lend americanbanks increase march 10.1% compare march 1999 lend relation gdp iscurrently historically high level. the lend statistic show primary increase lending2for example, 5-year government bond. bi review 50/20004for housing, due rise property prices. at time lend increasing, save isdeclining. over last five years, save proportion disposable income fall nearly 5percentage point amount low 2% last quarter 1999. sweden show asimilar development. during last five years, save ratio fall 9 percentage pointsand currently 2%. there thus several sign development worry view offinancial stability. the rise debt ratio without doubt make household vulnerable.however, sweden, employment households’ financial asset increased, favoursthe households’ ability pay.another example netherlands which, like sweden, normally characterise small, openeconomy. even there, worry signal similar swedish american economy canbe perceived. the improve economic activity lead fall unemployment rise asset prices.during last two years, total lend rise annual rate around 15%. in netherlandstoo, large part rise lend explain rise prices, especially house prices. dutchhouse price rise average 15.8% 1999. a comparison, mention swedishhouse price rise approximately 8% period (prices tenant-owned apartmentsrose considerably high extent, however). in netherlands, household indebtedness relationto gdp traditionally low, rise dramatically recent year today amount toalmost 45% gdp.if compare development sweden, usa netherlands, see dutch propertyprices rise considerably fast swedish american price real nominalterms. in context, development sweden appear le sensational.what riksbank build-up risk increases?an increase level indebtedness economy, combine rise asset prices, involvesgreater vulnerability change macroeconomic environment, i.e. grow risks. the obviousquestion then, authority prevent build-up risk. the riksbank discussesa number possible measure late financial stability report. firstly, riksbank try toinfluence development communicate view happen publicly form ofa dialogue banks. the financial stability report play central role context. theriksbank certain situation provide comprehensive picture risk theindividual market players, latter attache great importance evaluate development theirown portfolios.if riksbank belief unhealthy build-up risk occur assessment hadthe intend influence individual market players, measure riksbank cantake. in extreme cases, quantitative regulation may introduced, raise require capitaladequacy ratio reserve requirement. nor increase repo rate rule financialstability threatened. however, far-reaching measure would use thebuild-up risk assess constitute acute problem. the assessment situation make bythe riksbank authority always mar large measure uncertainty, isextremely difficult evaluate serious build-up risk actually is. if drastic measure betaken, assessment must base strong foundation.the development see today is, i mention earlier, far require intervention. theriksbank’s assessment macroeconomic situation worsen, lead problemsfor individual household meet payment obligations, hardly comprise serious riskfor bank general therefore threaten financial stability either. in context importantto mention household sector normally account small percentage loan losses, evenduring bank crises. there thus reason current situation riksbank resort tospecial measure intervene build-up debt currently occur household sector.when discuss banks’ loan losses, i allude risk household company willnot able pay loans. loan loss also arise bank cannot meet obligationsamong themselves. these risk usually call counterparty settlement risks. this type risk 5bis review 50/2000arises banks’ trade take position financial markets. a major swedish bankshave extensive commitment one another also foreign banks, problem one bank canrapidly spread others cause problem throughout entire financial system. such problemneed due bank insolvent; may base on, example, fail computer systemor similar. the riksbank several occasion point individual exposure agrowing problem point view stability. to overcome problem, riksbank hasbegun review regulations, together swedish financial supervisory authority.conclusionin current situation great expectation future bring economic growth andgood times. “the new economy” low inflation rate high level employment growthhas gradually cross atlantic reach us. in time strong confidence future,consumption indebtedness increase, save declines. we see happen many timesbefore. if expectation fulfilled, problem. however, expectation race ahead ofeconomic developments, asset price indebtedness develop way cause imbalances. ifthere economic downturn, household may find difficulty meet payment obligations,which lead rapid increase saving, fall asset price decline demand. this alsosomething see contexts.while development could give cause concern, important paint excessivelynegative picture. a riksbank point earlier, decline macroeconomic situationwould probably lead problem individual households, would hardly cause sufficient loanlosses threaten banks’ stability.however, every reason vigilant regard continue developments, particularly froma price stability perspective. continue rise asset price credit expansion could risk lead tooverheating thus rise inflation. an increase repo rate would case contribute tocounteracting incipient inflation tendency reduce risk financial imbalances, adampening effect demand credit asset prices. 1bis review 50/2000eddie george: a snapshot development global

neweconomy term two principal developments: first, increase economy’s maximumsustainable growth rate and, second, spread increase importance information andcommunications technology. the latter presumably major contributor acceleration laborproductivity that, turn, principal source increase trend growth real gdp. a third,and perhaps related, development possible increase economy’s sustainable utilization rates,specifically decline non-accelerating-inflation rate unemployment (nairu).our laboratory new economy unite states, give little evidenceoutside unite state even narrow definition new economy. in case unitedstates, however, little doubt underlie rate productivity growth increasedsignificantly second half 1990s.from 1974 1995, labor productivity advance annual rate

sichel suggest effect quite smallto date, though explosive growth e-commerce, particularly business-to-business segment,suggests potential important contribution time.but development - specifically

questions, none thesedevelopments, view, powerful enough moment support notion labor andother utilization rate rise ever high without trigger accelerate price - broad versionof “new economy”.so, new economy? a i said, depends. for part, i accept proposition hasbeen significant improvement underlie productivity growth unite states, veryclosely tie improvement information communication technology, likely tospread around world. but i resist new economy label seem encourage adisrespect old rule could seriously undermine success take advantage newopportunities. this bring second topic.welcome back supply demandi startle bold title article appear the wall street journal 31 december1999: “so long, supply demand”. but illustrate unbounded optimism - might evencall irrational exuberance - economic prospect willingness abandon time-testedeconomic principle offer caution imply constraint economic opportunities.i rather certain confidence supply demand would make comeback, i wasdelighted see front-page story the wall street journal 16 may 2000 - day lastfomc meeting. the title time “firms start raise prices, stir fear inflationfighters,” began: “even new economy, least one old rule still applies: demandexceeds supply long enough, seller raise prices.” so let count way supply anddemand help u understand recent experience challenge face monetary policy today.first, productivity shock affect aggregate demand well potential supply may initially havean even large effect demand supply. in early discussion productivity shock, theemphasis was, surprisingly, exclusively supply-side implication - specifically fast rateof productivity growth hence sustainable gdp growth. the natural corollary seem thata fast growth supply demand would powerful disinflationary force.but period productivity accelerated, demand grow fast potentialsupply. the demand effect - extent directly relate productivity shock -likely reflect favorable investment opportunities, effect expect profitability equityprices hence household wealth consumption, effect increase expect future bi review 48/20004labor income current consumption. demand, appears, receive additional boost thisperiod run-up equity price high productivity growth alone could fully accountfor.the balance supply demand infer movement utilization rates,specifically unemployment rate. when actual output expand pace potential,the unemployment rate stable. when output growth outpace growth potential, theunemployment rate declines. and unemployment rate decline almost 0.4 percentage point ayear past four years. this translate excess demand growth 0.75 1 percentage pointrelative potential supply growth.the second insight - endure old economy wisdom - proximate source change ininflation imbalance level aggregate supply aggregate demand. this beexpressed imbalance actual potential output divergence theunemployment rate nairu. the imbalance growth rate aggregate supplyand demand is, course, source change balance level aggregate demandand supply. but inflation relate directly level growth imbalance. and, even thenew economy, excess aggregate demand ultimately drive inflation. thus limit may havechanged, consequence overtax limit remain same.do excess aggregate demand? in judgment, excess demand condition thelabor market. the central tendency estimate nairu range 5% 5¼%,compared 4.1% current unemployment rate. this estimate consistent large-scalemacroeconometric model estimate nairu underlie economic andbudget projection council economic adviser congressional budget office,but nonetheless legitimate uncertainty estimate nairu. this uncertainty hasbeen, view, important consideration way monetary policy respond recenteconomic developments. obviously, whether nairu close 4% 5% affect difficultyassociated rebalancing supply demand contain risk high inflation.but inflation remain moderate persistent excess demand labor market?this still another supply demand story. the economy subject two fundamental type ofaggregate economic shocks: supply shock demand shocks. these two type shock give rise todifferent challenge monetary policy.supply shock come two varieties: relative price shock (such change relative price oil)and productivity shocks. early episode, economy benefit series favorablerelative price shock and, throughout last several years, adjust increase inproductivity growth. both development temporary disinflationary effect. togetherthey suppress inflation while, counter potential inflationary consequence theprogressive increase aggregate demand relative potential supply. once disinflationaryimpetus supply shock begin dissipate reverse, inflationary consequence thesupply-demand balance begin show through. the disinflationary effect increase inproductivity growth begin dissipate productivity growth stabilize high level. so unlessproductivity accelerate further, disinflationary effect continue erode time.when favorable supply shock dominate, growth demand stimulate utilization rate rise, butinflation tend moderate. the result offset implication set nominal fundsrate and, thus, monetary policy may leave little work do. this account relativeinactivity monetary policy 1996 end 1999, point federal fund ratewas within 1/4 percentage point begin period.but disinflationary effect favorable supply shock dissipate reverse, challenge ismore like one accompany demand shocks. excess demand, evidence utilization rate abovesustainable levels, put upward pressure inflation, monetary policy must restrain aggregatedemand bring balance potential supply avoid rise inflation. 5bis review 48/2000a brief inflation reportbut evidence inflation pressure fact building? of course, overall inflation hasclearly increase significantly last year. the consumer price index, example, increasedat 3% rate last twelve months, compare 2.3% rate previous twelve months.similar trend evident pce gdp price index. but increase overall inflationreflects mainly rise oil price 1999 2000. assume oil price stabilize, theeffect dissipate, overall inflation return toward, indeed dip slightly below, corerate (the rate net food energy prices). so, look forward, core inflation rate moreimportant consideration.the core cpi advance 2.2% rate last twelve months, rate equal theprevious twelve month 1/4 percentage point cyclical low reach injanuary. these number suggest inflation pressure remain well contained. but dig littledeeper, evidence, judgment, support conclusion core inflation move modestlyhigher last six nine months.first, introduction methodological change measure cpi january 1999 low cpiinflation relative early period. a result, methodologically consistent basis, core cpiinflation last twelve month actually couple tenth percentage point. but,more important, higher-frequency data provide evidence rise trend core inflation.for example, annual rate, core cpi inflation 2.4% last nine months, 2.5% lastsix month 3.2% last three months. so i conclude underlie trend core cpiinflation move close 2½% today.the core pce gdp price index also accelerate last six nine months. thecore pce index increase 1.4% rate 1999. over last year rate 1.6%, lastsix month 1.9%, last three month 2.4%.the high core inflation could explain pass-through core early increase oilprices. however, whether pass-through lead one-time increase price level tocontinuing inflation depend whether monetary policy accommodate high inflation.whether accommodation occurs, turn, depend policy deal excess demandthat felt first instance wage pressure tight labor market.i therefore turn assessment pressure come labor compensation. here data areeven confusing. for example, consider trend year-over-year growth rate three keymeasures. for employment cost index, trend decidedly up; average hourly earnings,however, year-over-year growth rate flat; compensation per hour theproductivity cost report, trend actually down. again, need dig little deeper, thisexcavation allow u reach definitive judgment extraordinarily mix set ofindicators.until may employment report, recent monthly data clearly point acceleration inaverage hourly earn - give 4½% rate post first four month year 3½%rate 1999. but unexpectedly small increase may leave year-over-year increase averagehourly earn 3.5%, previous twelve months. year-to-date,average hourly earn increase 3.8% rate - still acceleration, one far lessdefinitive base data april. there considerable interest nextreport evidence degree upward trend measure.there are, judgment, grind discount productivity cost measure. duringthe last benchmark revision, measure adjust sharply. i confidence therecent data measure labor compensation deceleration remain intact nextrevision. in addition, measure tend use trend instead real-time data benefit cost -although bureau economic analysis adjust trend judgmentally response thereal-time eci data benefit costs. lately, benefit component eci rebound sharply.even evidence acceleration nominal labor compensation definitive, theimplications inflation altogether straightforward. if trend growth labor bi review 48/20006compensation upward, could response uptick overall inflation last year overlytight labor market catch-up high rate productivity growth. just slow inoverall inflation 1997 1998 contribute moderation nominal wage demands, higheroverall inflation 1999 2000 would expect boost nominal wage demands. but anyrebound nominal labor compensation could also reflect catch-up high productivity growth. ifnominal compensation match high productivity growth, source acceleration innominal compensation would inflationary. but important caveat here. the slowinitial response nominal compensation high productivity growth source temporarydisinflationary effect productivity shock. therefore, catch-up way, thisdisinflationary impetus gradually disappears. and point, pass-through high inflationand effect tight labor market offset begin dominate. so even catch-upstory play role upward trend inflation.a second reason nominal compensation difficult factor inflation forecast thatcompensation practice changing. for example, measurement catch theincreased importance stock options. stock option incorporated, base gain upon exercisingthe options, productivity cost measure, eci. in addition, many way whichfirms recruit retain worker - in-house fitness child care centers, flexiblehours, educational assistance, on-site personal services, in-kind payment - reflect incompensation measure (although hire referral bonus include eci nextrelease). finally, grow importance variable pay temporary worker may haveimportant implication wage dynamic fully understood.so outlook inflation, relate interplay new economy force andtraditional supply demand considerations? in judgment, take benefit earlierfavorable relative price shock productivity shock, partly decline unemploymentrate nairu partly decline inflation. this statement whatpolicymakers planned, rather evolve respond unexpected development ininflation growth. at rate, could take benefit favorable supplyshocks low inflation, give inflation already low, combination end upwith seems, fact, reasonable. at point, however, temporarydisinflationary impetus favorable supply development dissipate, somerebound inflation, unless transition make back sustainable utilization rates, arisk continuous upward movement inflation. during transition, least earlierdecline core inflation reversed.to sure, difficult precise sustainable utilization rate path ofinflation uncertainty nairu aspect inflation dynamic periodof significant structural change. but i believe qualitative story i set right one.given uncertainty sustainable utilization rate wage-price dynamic neweconomy, however, policy set must remain flexible responsive new information boththe supply demand side economy.conclusion: challenge face monetary policythis analysis suggest monetary policy face challenge - rebalancing aggregate supply anddemand contain risk high inflation. i believe move effectively getthis job done. the major question respect whether slow economy trend alone willget job do whether need period below-trend growth unwind imbalance betweenthe level aggregate demand supply. if task slow economy trend - becausethe nairu turn close 4% - task challenging, inflation remain stablenear current levels. if nairu turn close 5%, task demanding, andgrowth slow trend while, inflation likely rise somewhat furtheruntil rebalancing complete. if successful, either scenario, payoff monetary restraintwill contain risk high inflation extend life remarkable expansion. 7bis review 48/2000several consideration provide optimism outcome benign one - soft asopposed hard landing. first, high-growth rather low-growth economy.even slow growth trend period, result growth rate could remainwell average growth rate previous 25 year still get job done. second,supply force could smooth transition. if oil price least peak - and, good yet, ifthey decline least modestly next year half, suggest expectation reflect infutures market - upward impetus overall inflation oil price dissipate even reverse.in case, overall inflation likely decline next year, decrease could help moderate therise core inflation follow year. third, long-term inflation expectation remain firmlyanchored, reflect considerable confidence monetary policy contain threat higherinflation. this damp rise inflation short term. fourth, monetary policy get headstart contain inflation begin tighten last june, sign build inflationpressures evident. fifth, tight monetary policy contribute le accommodativeset financial condition throughout economy - include high short- long-term privateinterest rates, low equity prices, strong dollar, stringent lend condition banks. ifthese tight financial condition remain place, make significant progress inestablishing foundation

at thesame time, euro area central bank emphasise role inflation forecast key monetarypolicy indicator. of these, several proceed announce direct inflation targets, becamefashionable 1990s. furthermore, many ncbs euro area pursuingexchange rate target within context european monetary system. in several cases, centralbanks adopt various combination approaches.this rich vary experience

bubble thelate-1980s, underlie structural factors. to extent explanation overlap ofthem certainly play part dramatic course event early 1990s.in order understand happen i believe go back begin 1970sand collapse bretton wood system. for stability orient regime - aregime work well post-war era - break country. in absence aglobal currency system, prove difficult establish regime sweden would

structural weakness conceal overheat economy. activitylooked strong potential growth rate swedish economy weaken time before.as 1980s draw close, however, grow awareness something would tobe done. the structural problems, high inflation speculative behaviour warrant realignmentof economic policy. in time, necessity change support widely. the taxsystem reform certain segment transfer system. sweden

manage somewhat differently question nodoubt analyse future. some thing could certainly do differently late1980s, well throe crisis. bi review 41/20002however, i believe main lesson draw root deep crisis run quite long wayback. a realignment economic policy essential. the fact crediblestability orient policy regime sweden almost twenty year far-reaching repercussionsthat ultimately affect material prosperity. it high time establish new anchor formonetary exchange rate policy, wage formation economic policy general. structuralreforms also need correct early structural mistake restore economic vitality.whether measure take present sufficient debatable issue; thepoint i want make change direction political action already initiatedin 1980s. the work continue since undertake government diversepolitical hue personalities. in words, something happen swedish economic policy awide sense late 1980s.when immediate crisis manage early 1990s clear weak governmentfinances would tackled. moreover, independent status central bank beenformally confirmed, accompany clear mandate. the float exchange rate regime theexplicit target price stability work well. several segment swedish economy havebeen deregulated, though le do way labour market market goodsand services. but labour market organisation work account improvethe system wage formation.as result this, swedish economy good see long time. theeconomic upswing continue six years, annual gdp growth hasaveraged around 3%. and notwithstanding strong growth demand, inflation low thanone would expect early relationships. everything suggests, moreover, economy willcontinue impress. last year, gdp growth 3.8% increase employment highestin past twenty-five years. another indication good circle swedish economy isdeveloping present forward-looking gdp assessment also revise upwards,whereas forecast inflation adjust upwards degree. financial marketpricing also tribute present credibility swedish economic policy. who would havebelieved decade ago swedish economy would achieve favourable path?the successful combination relatively high gdp growth low inflation principle beattributed number factors. one may plentiful supply unutilised resource thecrisis early 1990s. a change price behaviour may contribute rate inflationhad bring low stable level. increase competition connection with, forexample, deregulations, globalisation it commerce may also play part. but may alsohave well upward shift trend productivity, good service beproduced without increase prices, words, high rate potential growth.it argue factor fact contribute favourable development. when theupswing start plenty unutilised resources. it highly likely price behaviour alow inflation regime differ inflation high. another circumstance worth mentioningis external domestic competitive pressure increase lead many case todownward price adjustment slow increase. the recent figure inflation one ofseveral illustration phenomenon. while strictly speak matter series one-offeffects, increase competition continue leave mark general price level sometime come.another point worth note prominent part investment play swedish economyover past six years. increase investment tend generate high productivity growth. that turnraises expectation future corporate profits, often lead high share prices. highercorporate valuation stimulate additional investment firm question also give enterprisesbetter access risk capital expansion. meanwhile, share-owning household perceive anincrease net value assets. increase wealth optimistic expectation lead turn astronger growth consumption. 3bis review 41/2000in way, growth process drive investment create good circle. the supply side ofthe economy generate increase demand favourable composition demand tend strengthenthe supply side still more.in twenty year 1974 1993, annual growth labour productivity average 1.4%.the rate since 1994, however, average 1.9% cannot attribute solely cyclicalfactors. thus may indicate increase potential growth. while yet par theunited states, productivity growth accelerate recent years, constitute animprovement.neither would surprise future productivity growth turn somewhat high thanobservers count date, though matter dramatic change. certainindicators early part year, although still somewhat uncertain, may point upwardadjustment. it would interest confirm would mean productivity growthis tend move even late phase business cycle. at correspond stage theprevious upswing 1980s, productivity growth already slow price wageincreases begin accelerate.from concluded, least time being, economic upswing sweden hasnot cyclical improvement. it also result factor structural.the transformation economic development new pattern naturally face forecaster andmacro economists, include riksbank, major challenges. from i conclude whenmaking assessment future, must highly alert new economic information beprepared reassess early models, relationship forecast need arises.the continuation strong demand trend expect render resource utilisation generaland labour market particular increasingly strained. on hand, inflation

perspective.before i continue, please allow emphasise expand international use euro couldhave far-reaching consequence monetary policy. indeed, evidence suggest thatthe capital market might play increase role transmission monetary policy (at the4for methodological problem connect data, see international bank financial marketdevelopments, bi quarterly review, february 2000, p 33ff june 2000.

elaborate pace structural reforms, already produce tangibleand positive effect growth rate euro zone.second, i focus integration process way financial market across euroarea.1.the euro area may expect long phase steady economic growth sustain thestrong pace structural reforms: liberalization, increase labor flexibility andgovernment budgetary disciplineliberalization base privatization, deregulation transparency successthe time long past significant portion european economy control throughvarious government body regulations. the liberalization movement, acceleratedsubstantially development european union principally completion singlemarket, include three aspects:– a significant privatization movement, spread throughout europe. since1990, europe’s government sell $200 billion worth state companies.this movement particularly important italy, france germany, salesrepresented almost three-quarters total amount. the change ownership pavedthe way corporate strategy benefit open access financial markets.– another force work europe deregulation. the change particularly noticeable inseveral key sector telecommunications, transportation, power supply industryand, course, financial sector. this movement prompt rapid response fromregulatory body monitor introduction market rule ensure appropriatefunctioning fair competition throughout entire european union. today, thisinstitutional framework appear quite appropriate background in-depthrestructuring numerous merger acquisition across europe.– moreover, liberalization require single market endeavor accompaniedby increase need transparency accountability, bring substantialchanges corporate practices. more detail rule disclosure financial informationand competitive offer public procurement program implement throughouta large part europe. this phenomenon enhance overall efficiency theeuropean market economy.a second series reform result increase flexibility labor marketduring past two years, employment

labor markets.european country increase flexibility labor market, particular develop part-time andtemporary contracts.let quote figure illustrate point:– from 1995 1999, part-time employment rise 14% 17% total employment theeuro area. this proportion important unite states, amount toaround 13% total employment. more half overall net job creation due topart-time employment.– in conjunction

deficit euro area fell 3.5 percentage pointsbetween 1993 1997 bring back 3% threshold. since then, deficit havecontinued fall. the recent data point public deficit 1.2% gdp euro area in1999, 2.0%

fact, member states,including france, still way go meet stability growth pact goal budgetpositions close balance surplus. in addition, need reducegovernment debt levels, remain 70% gdp euro area.when one consider cumulative effect change currently experience - field ofregulations, labor market public finance - trigger single market andnow single currency, one reasonably confident euro zone progressivelycatching u economy term long-term potential growth.2.the integration process euro-wide financial marketsturning situation financial markets, i would like offer couple comments, relatedto integration market process consolidation bank sector.2.1first, allow recall important step take 24 march 2000 lisbon europeancouncil towards integrate financial service capital market european union. in lisbon,the head state government recognize central role efficient financial market forlong-term european competitiveness development new economy. the centralbankers market practitioner participate meet share, course, commoninterest achieve smooth full integration financial market within euro area: 3bis review 52/2000and us, nature respective job responsibilities, attach utmostimportance smooth

operate deep liquid capitalmarkets.as regard crucial issue financial market integration, needle insist alreadybeen achieve last eighteen months. however, also important keep mind areaswhere work remain done.• the integration interest rate market within euro zone first, key achievement thatdeserves underscored. the high level integration accomplish beobserved short end market, inter-bank money markets, butalso long end. market participant across euro area trade accord thesame rule practices, use index (for example eonia euriborreferences swap market). when look behavior market governmentsecurities, strike see fast intermediaries, also issuers, adjust thenew environment create introduction single currency. at time, theadvent euro catalyst development buoyant market forcorporate securities. a market high-yield bond already following. i would, forexample, underline development asset-backed security market different countries,among france, take advantage demand global investor type ofsecurities. let also mention, regard short end yield curve, rapiddevelopment market commercial paper euro and, particular, success theparis-based market, attract large foreign issuers, thank security, anappropriate regulatory framework efficient function dvp procedures.the euro’s market share issuance currency reflects, large extent, ability ofintermediaries promote deep liquid market issuer investor need. hence,as predict observers, since start stage three euro become secondmost important currency segment international capital markets.• at short end market, integration interbank market take place last yearright start emu, thank installation target system, whichenabled large-value payment system move money efficiently safely real time fromone location another. an important feature mind efficiency beenachieved centralization payment systems, decentralizednetwork national rtgs system manage ncbs link together. such astructure work well. this mean relax sit back: additionalimprovements consider field. for instance, keep workingon reduce costs, especially concern cross-border payments. this certainly lead tofurther harmonization: harmonization standard practice also theharmonization systems.• the integration euro money market obviously prerequisite ecb thenational central banks, so-called eurosystem, able conduct single monetarypolicy efficiently. this challenge meet successfully decentralize framework inwhich national central bank, act aegis ecb, responsible thedaily implementation monetary policy country, regard open market operations,standing facility minimum reserves.however, i mention previously, important work remain do canconsider euro financial market fully integrate contribute themost efficient way best allocation resources.• at juncture bond money markets, repo market still lackshomogeneity harmonization. this situation derive complex nature thismarket, legal settlement issue play prominent role. the difference bi review 52/20004domestic legislation prove detrimental development homogeneous repomarket euro-wide basis adoption common market standards. a such, thisissue need addressed. indeed, lot work conduct issue marketparticipants - i know isma drive force regard - well thepublic authority european level. to large extent, find way thedirective collateral european commission propose facilitate thecross-border collateralisation technique.• a regard specifically security markets, cross-border circulation settlementof security need enhanced. one expect consolidation process istaking place among security settlement system (ssss) improve eventually ability ofmarket participant move security efficiently low cost across euro zone.• similar remark make regard stock markets. confront fierce competitioncoming new entrants, traditional stock exchange implement major changes.the introduction euro catalyst add another strong incentive therationalization exist market structures. these tremendous changes, perhaps wecould even call revolution, speed never end improvement intechnology. indeed, technology revolution transform architecture ofstock markets, also organization bond markets. it impact way intermediariesand investor conduct business. the outcome change bring thesedevelopments yet well known. this certainly need closelymonitored, within individual firm also level supervisory bodies.• at moment activity tend accelerate render location issue moreacute, change regulatory environment crucial foster efficient financialmarkets. let mention particular ucits (mutual funds) directive directiveon occupational pension funds, ought eliminate barrier investment and, ofcourse, importance directive take-over bid context integration ofnational stock exchanges.more generally, important european union accelerate reform financial field.in respect, i said, key directive lay transpose adequately nationallaws, whereby public authority within fesco professional (like member yourassociation) play role facilitate harmonize set principle recommendations.on subjects, expect lot progress follow months, within guidelinesalready issue european commission (in financial service action plan). france, itspart, already express intention put matter agenda take thepresidency european union july.2.2coming process consolidation bank sector, need recallhow bank financial consolidation speed recent year europe. of course, thisevolution closely connect introduction euro creation single capitalmarket. some major player emerge country eec. clearly, new andexciting challenge ahead u way european bank consolidation.the body charge bank regulations, along responsible supervision creditand financial institutions, keep close eye developments.the stance national regulator europe base strong efficient coordination ofbanking financial supervision, ongoing flow information and, necessary,coordinated action may lead designation lead regulator.recently, several example coordinate supervision european bank authorities,such belgian french authority dexia group, show thatnational supervisor well prepare cope large cross-border groups.2.3finally, let say word situation euro foreign exchange market. 5bis review 52/2000we hear quite frequently recent months, especially euro weakenedagainst dollar, cause situation find suppose absence ofstructural reform disadvantage euro zone vis-à-vis main competitors.in vein, often say poor performance euro reflect growth differentialbetween euro zone economy u economy.let comment briefly two points. a regard lack structural reforms, i hope myprevious remark underline euro country clearly embark major structuralreforms - trigger single market single currency - bear last effect thefunctioning economies. the central bank europe call pursuit reinforcement ofthese reforms. at time, order serve economy efficient way, eurofinancial market experience deep rapid integration process i describe previously.on second point, one keep mind american european economy notpositioned identically economic cycle, latter probably begin morerobust phase expansion. accord imf forecasts, growth reach 3% euro area in2001, compare 3.2% us.from central bank perspective, present situation clearly characterize misalignment ofthe euro one refer euro area fundamentals: robust domestic growth, inflation control,strong domestic savings, healthy external accounts.we are, certain extent, situation symmetric prevail 1995 theweakness dollar clearly line fundamental u economy. at time,it take month correction appear align dollar economic underlyingfundamentals. the euro experience similar episode recently. this situation seem tocorrect itself, sign point close growth gap unitedstates continental europe.thus, potential appreciation euro ever topical question. this potential clearlyreflects economic soundness, dynamism strength euro area, support structuralreforms way. a win cards, i may say so, materialize

market last year bring question forefront policy debate.for practitioner monetary policy like myself, area contain number difficult issues. i shallbe raise morning also discuss conference. by theend conference i hope able look back fruitful discussion betterunderstanding issue problem involved.how monetary policy respond movement asset prices? this depend centralbank choose use information contain asset prices.in regime explicitly target inflation, asset price take account via effect onaggregate demand. rise share price increase household wealth would raise consumptionfor give level income increase wealth consider permanent nature. atthe time, consumer confidence boost high share price could potentially make individualsmore prone spend increase wealth.an increase share price also

price indicator panacea central banks’forecasting problems. asset price move variety reasons. understand reason isimportant determine appropriate monetary policy response. for example, rise shareprices stem increase productivity thus expectation high future profits, theimplications monetary policy would different case fundamental reasonfor high share prices.this raise number questions. the first pertain relative informativeness different kindsof asset prices. the second integrate information obtain asset price othermacroeconomic information. notwithstanding empirical evidence indicator property ofasset prices, causal relationship asset price real macroeconomic variable bi review 50/20002proved difficult understand model. but, i illustrated, answer tothese question important monetary policy. it seem quite clear central bankscannot afford adopt view asset market merely “side-shows”.there other, sometimes le straightforward, situation monetary policy reason toreact movement asset price even though effect inflation negligible. one reason isthe central bank’s responsibility stability financial system.if asset price drive unsustainable level correspond underlyingfundamentals, face special kind problem. we know experience speculativeasset price bubble eventually burst. when do, collateral value fall balance sheetsdeteriorate, potentially threaten stability bank system. to avoid kind ofdevelopment, central bank need closely monitor potential excessive credit growth andthe possibility asset price bubble build up.it seem historically form speculative price bubble closely link anexcessive expansion credit. but need operationalise concept “excessive” thedifficult concept asset’s “fundamental value”. a history show us, judge extentrising

the burst large property price bubble serious effect financialintermediation. this could motivate early monetary policy response.the cost pre-emptive strike strategy would weigh fact inflationand real

try actpre-emptively is, spot price bubble time? so even though conflict betweenshort-un price stability financial stability, latter view important,implementing policy could fraught substantial

classical quantity theory money, simple: “the central bank raise thediscount rate long price rising, low long price fall keep constantwhen price stable”.in words, price stability achieve interest policy. although rule apply tothe price level rather inflation forward looking, clear parallel rule ofthumb use today central bank target inflation.sweden’s price stability norm 1930s last year follow return afixed exchange rate regime. during years, however, perform central function ofstabilising expectation well prices. this important least extent helpedshield sweden global economy’s depressive impulse thereby contribute recoverybeing speedy countries.here i perhaps add although swedish price stability “experiment” attract gooddeal attention time, certainly leave deep last mark modernapproach inflation targeting. in aftermath depression second world war,keynesianism gain ground. the introduction inflation target sweden 1930s wastherefore pioneer kind regime introduce early 1990s, first bynew zealand late others. bi review 50/20002a great advantage regime explicitly target inflation, central bank adjust theinterest rate continuously light inflation prospects. compare fix exchange rateregime, imbalance prevent build extent. a slight upwardadjustment interest rate early stage, reduce risk inflation pick up, somethingquite different hike short-term interest rate order defend fix exchange rate.as personal reflection i say explain importance low inflation much easy - notleast central bank governor - task sell advantage stable currency. this isparticularly true latter task become increasingly press economy hit byproblems cost face speculative attacks. some may remember daysin autumn 1992 instrumental rate sweden raise much 500 per cent. in myview, probably one important explanation sweden member erm system - atleast stage.the challenge 1990s inflation target country build rigorousframework around new regime. answer need particular question like thefollowing: what rate inflation targeted, index used, band around thetarget necessary, degree transparency, etc.it also important formulate monetary policy reaction function, is, define thebalance inflation variability output variability. the reason central bank aimfor maximum short-term stability either inflation output attain one targetswould costly.on one hand, central bank’s legitimacy among general public could lose short-terminterest rate move sharply cause output fluctuate widely inflation heldstable exactly target. maximum stability output could, hand, result sharpfluctuations rate inflation erode target’s credibility. instead matter find apoint somewhere midway two extremes.looking ahead, i believe least two major question central bank address morethoroughly.first, monetary policy react asset prices, equity and/or real estate prices? weknow history development asset price significant impact inflationand real economic activity. we need establish whether action central bank canand take minimise likelihood macroeconomic instability arise extremefluctuations asset prices.second, monetary policy react structural change economy? on issue quite alot think already done, among academic policymakers. nevertheless, ibelieve must do field, especially since least part world economyhave see something productivity shock recent years. i carefully try avoid use thebuzzword “new economy” here, since history full expression like ever since turnof 19th century.unfortunately, i time elaborate first question. instead i say wordsabout second.although discussion monetary policy productivity shock take place mostly theunited states, light impressive economic performance acceleration therate productivity growth, one could certainly ask: what europe?europe is, one hand, strong upward economic phase. in addition, new technology,especially internet telecommunications, gain grind many european countries. on theother hand, europe also differ us. the rapid growth u investment yet seenin europe. one could also argue existence quite structural obstacle europe makesan acceleration productivity growth le likely immediate future.a handful country - include netherlands, ireland, uk and, recently, sweden andfinland - achieve strong economic growth case also low inflation. but 3bis review 50/2000exception ireland, country yet enjoy strong productivity growth theus.nevertheless, possibility productivity breakthrough also europe cannot rule out. it willprobably depend well europe succeed reform microeconomic policy.higher - accelerate - productivity growth indeed pose new challenge monetary policy. itcould set motion complex effect aggregate supply demand, inflation, equity pricesand interest rates. just give examples, let briefly mention follow effects:first, positive productivity shock raise economy’s potential growth rate. it also affectsaggregate demand new, profitable investment opportunities, high equity price andexpectations among household high permanent income. one question policymakers iswhether demand effect powerful potential outpace growth ofaggregate supply short medium perspective.second, could temporary disinflation effect work increase productivity isunexpected initially. if wage slow adjust, high productivity growth low unit labour costsand thereby reduce price inflation. here important question policymakers. shouldthis effect allow result temporary reduction price inflation unemployment?third, increase trend rate productivity growth could also result high equilibrium realinterest rate, output gap closed, order balance save investment. fiscal policyand development public financial balance could least partly offset effect, could theeconomy’s degree openness.all imply monetary policymakers, also europe, could face quite challenges. one ofthem identify structural change distinguish cyclical variations. another challengeis detect magnitude effects. furthermore, look ahead monetary policy hard whenthe economy go major change make difficult forecast future path theeconomy inflation.it quite clear demand great deal forecaster well construct macromodels. the forecast concern inflation one two year ahead, calls, instance, forreasonable precision measurement output gap relationship output gapand inflation.it already evident, example, 1990s inflation forecast many country werefrequently high side. i believe best do, least stage, pay closeattention incoming data forecast process, mechanically use result modelsthat rely heavily historical relationships. we deal successfully fact thatforecasts economic development never completely accurate still allow monetary policyto forward looking.when discuss monetary policy today, must remember come long way. theworld economy show strong growth couple low inflation monetary policy contributedto development. however, interesting, though somewhat difficult, challenge ahead uswhich must meet preserve bright picture world economy. this conference willcontribute good understand issue problem involved. 1bis review 49/2000masaru hayami: the role japan amid changinginternational financial environmentspeech mr masaru hayami, governor bank japan, executive board directors’meeting japan foreign trade council, hold tokyo, 7 june 2000.* * *1.introductionthank invite 263rd executive board directors’ meeting. it great pleasure tohave opportunity address distinguish audience. it also bring back memory mydays one council’s executive director vice chairman chairman mimura. yourinvitation today allow again, first time almost ten year since i leave thecouncil become chairman japan association corporate executives. know manyof come trade company active globally, today i’d like share idea fromthe viewpoint role japan amid change international financial environment.2.tensions generate globalizationhaving previously work bank japan 34 years, i chance work thenforeign department, london office position relate bank’s internationalactivities. it great experience attend important international meet bisand g5 meetings.then, two year ago, i return bank japan governor. now, represent bank, i havea chance take part various international meetings. attend meetings, i noticedtwo things. first, number international meet multiply years. in context, ofparticular note presence emerging-market countries, particularly asian economies,has also increased. one reason somewhat paradoxical since asian currency crisesof 1997, consensus economic financial stability emerging-market economiesis crucial global economic financial stability. indeed, rise number internationalmeetings participant evidence extent economy become globalized.the second thing i notice various kind tension arise market economyhas become globalized. i clearly recall ngo activist surround wto’s ministerialconference seattle last december. the imfc meeting, i attend late april dayafter g7 meeting, also target similar protests.how imf, pivotal contributor development liberalize marketeconomy second world war, wto, legitimate successor gatt, becomethe target protests? perhaps phenomenon see typical example increasedtension ride tide market-oriented economy havegrave concern global environmental issue widen gap among region arepossibly cause rapid global developments.i think many agree world economy currently midst one importantturning point since industrial revolution 19th century. ongoing globalization andcomputerization mega trend continue well future. in context, competitionat global level expect intensify. it global competition principal drive forcebehind economic dynamism. no one stop trend react positively. however, wecannot deny fact newly form tension uncertainty emerged. therefore, shouldcontinue look way promote sound stable development world economy throughsteady effort establish appropriate rule regulation compatible new trends. bi review 49/20002one thing certain, effort accompany difficulties, involve disagreementson international front, incumbent upon u try find solutions.3.meaning imf reformagainst background trends, international monetary financial system burdenedwith responsibilities. in particular, asian currency crisis bring fore various issuesof concern international financial circle include prevention resolution future currencycrises. and, outcome discussion constitute part concept so-called “new financialarchitecture”. the financial stability forum, inaugurate last april request theg7, publish recommendation issue highly leverage financial institution (forexample, hedge funds) international capital flows. this one example fruit workundertaken international financial fora.the reform imf important issue. and also asian currency crisis thattriggered intense debate necessity reform. the asian currency crisis break outas result rapid outflow short-term capital call “21st century-type crises”. here, theimf come target criticism hold imf improve surveillanceability increase transparency policy-making process sufficiently carriedout mission crisis prevention resolution. i personally think problem surround theimf deep-rooted partly reflect history.as well know, period precede second world war characterize negativefactors competitive devaluations, restriction current account transactions, widespreaduse protectionist measures. without doubt, significant impact internationaleconomy create tension countries, fuel pro-war sentiment. the imf wasestablished aim avoid repetition disruption. the primary concern timewas create well-structured crisis-proof international monetary system. for example, fixedparity u dollar gold (with $1 equivalent 35 ounces), adoption adjustablepeg system, abolition restriction current account transaction key elementsunderpinning bretton-woods architecture. regard capital account transactions, membercountries imf allow impose degree restrictive measures. therefore, fairto say attention pay stable expansion current account transaction rather thancapital account transactions.however, thing dramatically change since then. with respect foreign exchange regime,the so-called “nixon shock” 1971 mark abrupt end convertibility u dollar andgold, eventually lead arrival float exchange regime global scale 1973. and,capital account liberalization pursue much vigorously architect thebretton-woods system envisioned. a result, volume today’s cross-border capital flow farexceeds current account transactions. a i note earlier, huge increase cross-border capital flowsseems exert big impact current account transaction economic financialconditions individual countries, and, times, could trigger serious currency crises.in brief, present condition surround international financial system entirely different fromwhat use imf created. amid accelerate globalization accompanyingrising tensions, kind contribution imf make stability internationalmonetary system? what core function imf context? these question areprime mover behind recent discussion imf reform.the imfc meet i attend april washington previously call interim committee.but, unlike interim committee, imfc structure permanent forum. thus, thetransformation interim committee imfc comprise part effort strengthen theimf, see symbol current challenge face international financial system.at first imfc meet april, lively discussion reform imf. althoughfurther consideration need reach realistic conclusions, i believe kind ofconsensus form regard future direction take reform imf. 3bis review 49/2000first, agree develop rule basic concept utilize market functions. in regard,the late g7 imfc communique underscore importance involve private sector inforestalling resolve currency financial crises. at time, agree strengthenthe imf’s role make various rule apply new development global markets, andin monitor observance rule member countries. such role consider asensuring condition proper market function place, correct market failures.second, agree review redefine imf operation basic concept utilize marketfunctions. in regard, suggest that, instance, imf lend operation limit toshort-term liquidity provision member face capital account crises. it also argue thatmedium long-term financial support promote development reduced.third, since imf strongly criticize lack transparency decision-makingprocedures, accountability enhance interest good governance.imf reform started. however, important challenge may determine futurecourse international monetary financial system. japan second large subscriber theimf, follow us. at time, japan one country involve internationalfinancial markets, witness fact japan world’s large capital exporter well aslargest net creditor. japan make various contribution formation consensus amonginternational financial circle regard direction imf reform continue so.4.role japan change international financial environment(1)what expect japan?now, let clarify japan’s role period change international finance. first, japan shouldactively participate develop international rules. the introduction international standard andcodes involve important element determine future path global economicdevelopment, may also substantial impact domestic finance economy. forexample, see japan observe corporate management affect theintroduction international account rules. in practice, however, take part international rulemaking easy may sound. it require enormous amount knowledge well aspowers persuasion. and note japan’s position global economy well therole play asian economies. it thus desirable japan actively involve contributeto international rule-making effort full understand situation region. in thiscontext, bank japan seek strengthen relation colleague emeap (executives’meeting east asia-pacific central banks) intensive dialogue regard regionaleconomy finance. furthermore, japan expect contribute process implementingrules asia technical assistance field financial system reform establishmentof economic financial infrastructure data collection dissemination systems.japan’s second role directly contribute stable growth global economy secure itsown sustainable growth. for purpose, bring economy back recovery phase thebusiness cycle important challenge. furthermore, important japan go beyondthis regain economic dynamism steadily pursue structural reform. in addition, i willdiscuss later, big challenge japan win global confidence economy whole.(2)japan’s economy role yeni enough time today discus japan’s expect role comprehensive manner.therefore, i would like focus think one important issue regard role ofjapan’s economy global economy finance; “the role yen internationalcurrency”. this issue also closely relate point i made: win globalconfidence japan’s overall economy. bi review 49/20004international currency define “a currency actively use non-residents tool tomeasure, store, exchange value”. although non-residents use yen, perhaps hardto say “actively used”. rather, often argue yen sufficiently use aninternational currency relative japan’s status global economy. what mean?for currency widely use global manner, several condition met. first, isindispensable win confidence currency internationally. in order realize goal, need astrong economy support stable currency value.in connection, let briefly describe current state japan’s economy. it becomingincreasingly clear economy improve support decisive macroeconomic policy.in particular, observe welcome sign private sector demand evidence continuinggradual increase capital expenditure background improve corporate profits. in thecoming period, carefully examine momentum recovery, focus recoveryin corporate sector spread household sector.here, i come back issue international currency. a second condition theinternational use currency, i point “user friendliness”. for currency userfriendly, existence liberalize open economic environment, include deep financialand capital markets, necessary. third, existence mechanism creation aninternational network currency catalyze accelerate significant. for example, globalactivities shipping, finance, insurance industry british empire, thenamerican multinational firm finance it industries, respectively accelerate global use ofthe pound u dollar. it may possible japan’s contribution country moreintensive technical assistance lead expand network yen.in sum, extent nation’s currency globally use depend confidence nation’seconomy whole. to enhance confidence, every measure take threeaspects i mention mind.i would like take issue japanese government bond (jgb) market example. theratio jgbs own non-residents currently percent, extremely lowcompared u g10 countries. this especially understandable japan’scumulative current account surplus high save rate take consideration. however, interms global bond index, world bond investor refer make investmentjudgments, share jgbs second large next u government bonds. if currentbudget situation two country remain unchanged time, possible share ofjgbs become comparable u treasuries. if so, imperative jgb marketbecomes attractive international investors.what necessary jgb market achieve global standard? needle say, policydecisions might impair confidence jgbs must avoided. in regard, budget policy thegovernment constrain long run. it would also significant improve safetyand user friendliness jgb market viewpoint aspect usability futuresand repo markets, tax treatment jgbs, standardization trade settlementcustoms.in speech today, i touch upon three condition currency internationally used,namely, confidence currency, high degree user friendliness, international network. ibelieve condition coincide direction japan move come century.let add every time i refer “internationalization yen”, carry strong hopethat japan adjust new global economic order contribute international rule make andthe foundation sustainable economic financial development asian region. 1bis review 48/2000eva srejber: the role monetary policy growth swedenspeech m eva srejber, second deputy governor sverige riksbank, theföreningssparbanken’s economics day, hold vellinge, 6 june 2000.* * *i would like begin thank invitation speak föreningssparbanken’seconomics day. in speech today, i shall try look beyond day-to-day monetary policy wherethe focus interest rate point minor difference assessment consumer price index attimes entail risk lack perspective. it therefore sometimes justify remind oneselfand others role economic policy play. for decision-maker theriksbank, apply particular course role monetary policy importance thestability payment system. i would also like recall success achieve swedisheconomy past decade, fiscal monetary policy make importantcontributions. the challenge reinforce achieve time bestrong enough carry change remain. it also important continually evaluate anddiscuss design economic policy new experience obtained. this require openness, whichhas lodestar riksbank recent years.to create understand support goal price stability, necessary explain theconceptual framework guide monetary policy decision simple, pedagogic way. this hasperhaps result create exaggerate idea monetary policy decision arrive withthe aid simple rules. a simple conceptual framework support complicate reality.however, factor cannot capture simple rule decision-making need take intoaccount. since effect monetary policy extend number years, every decision must reston assessment probability individual valuation risk associate alternativedevelopments macroeconomy future. in conclusion, i draw attention risk inthe development swedish economy present situation.the three pillar economic policya well-balanced economic policy contribute create good prerequisite stable, high growth,which generally regard important component welfare concept. for this, requiredthat component economic policy play role well. this apply fiscal, structural andmonetary policy. good condition growth create uncertainty future income andexpenditure minimised. if time resource use make greatestcontribution welfare, prerequisite good development. economic policy bedesigned minimise uncertainty regulatory framework tax system notdistort allocation resource economy.if fiscal policy carry central government debt stabilise reasonable long-termlevel, certainty establish design transfer system come tax burden andinvestment consumption decision facilitated. structural policy also important role withregard create good condition growth. structural policy broad concept i onlypoint important components. the tax transfer systems, instance, design sothat create motif citizen act way harmful long-term growth andwelfare. the task educational system provide access relevant, high-quality education andthat labour market policy ensure demand supply labour power match. bi review 48/20002the task riksbanka monetary policy aim price stability reduce uncertainty future real incomes. agreementson future payment assessment future income thereby facilitated. demand forcompensation risk reduce which, among things, stimulate real investments. pricestability also improve ability price system spread information resource tobe distribute area benefit citizens. in market economy, task pricesystem communicate information household preference and, instance, provide signalsas productivity best developed.besides task safeguard price stability, riksbank also responsible country’spayment system. it prerequisite function modern economy payment becarried safe, efficient way. in order payment system function, important thatfinancial stability maintained, which, instance, mean bank crisis shall avoided. thereare close connection responsibility central bank price stability itsresponsibility financial stability. in order instrumental rate desire effect oninterest rate formation, is, instance, important payment system function efficiently andsecurely, since monetary policy instrument operate via payment systems. price stability canfurther threaten financial imbalance financial instability. at time monetarypolicy focus price stability per se probably reduce risk financial instability. it notmeaningful draw sharp boundary regard central bank’s monetary policytasks include responsibility secure, efficient payment system. i confine myselfhere stress price stability financial stability require create good growthconditions economy. and central bank play important role achieve goals.on 1 january 1999, new riksbank act come force. it state goal riksbank’sactivity maintain stable prices. the riksbank shall also responsible secure, efficientpayment system. in preparatory legal material act, also state riksbank,without set aside price stability target, shall also support objective general economicpolicy view achieve sustainable growth high employment.the price stability goal confirm law. the riksbank’s executive board isresponsible make price stability goal operational design framework monetarypolicy. among things, mean executive board decide price stabilitygoal define period price stability maintained.the executive board riksbank decide price stability shall define annualincrease consumer price index 2% tolerance interval plus/minus one percentagepoint. if consumer price index affect factor consider temporaryeffect cpi, executive board agree shall able disregard this. the reason thatmonetary policy otherwise risk lead unnecessary fluctuation employment production.a lot achieve although thing remain doneeconomic policy successful many area recent years. when centralgovernment debt increase dramatically first half 1990s, when, time,unemployment increase high level large fluctuation long interest rate theexchange rate indicate great uncertainty inflation prospect mid-1990s, probablynot many could imagine would quickly positive development atpresent experiencing. central government finance improve markedly one ofthe best eu regard size central government debt central governmentbudget balance.for time now, growth strong expect unemployment fall towards 4% duringthe come year. and despite this, inflation expectation remain stable level close target.we therefore note riksbank successful create support credibilityaround price stability target. without responsible fiscal policy, would beenpossible reduce inflation expectation way happened, however. the prohibition 3bis review 48/2000against finance budget deficit central bank step direction. the rule thegovernment riksdag adopt mean fiscal policy strive towards surplus ofan average 2% business cycle furthermore support price stability target create goodconditions growth. the expenditure ceiling central government finance set limit howmuch public activity expand effect.many structural reform improve condition

areas. transport, communication andenergy deregulated. at time, eu membership continue internationalisationhave expose business sector increase competition.however, still great potential deregulation. this applies, instance, many part ofservice production moreover growth prospect look favourable. a study recently carry bythe competition authority confirm competition improve 1990s, also point toconsiderable competition deficiency many industries. besides many industry servicesector, also applies, among others, construction industry regulatory framework andbuilding norm contribute exclude competitor countries. the study follow-up astudy carry 1991. it conclusion lack competition concomitant high price wasa feature number industry investigated.exaggerated expectation growth path create macroeconomic imbalanceeven though growth prospect swedish economy appear bright, early towrite risk old problem economy make presence felt. there is, forinstance, risk overheat household business seem make decision onconsumption investment base expectation strong future real income increase resultof high productivity growth. this lead financial imbalance exaggerate indebtednessheightened high

backthe inflationary pressure build resource use economy increases. low inflationcombined high growth per se strengthen concept early pattern brokenaway long term enter period long-term high growth. if demandincreases much resource put pressure, however, inflation sooner lateraccelerate. there risk price increase quickly inflation expectationswill also increase. to get inflation line target situation, may necessary toconduct stringent monetary policy long period. if expectation future growth prospect atthe time interrupted, need consolidation arise household business sector,which strongly dampen growth. the consequence altogether strong growth couldtherefore instability inflation production later. if financial imbalance becomealtogether great, risk consequence limit great variation ingrowth inflation even lead low overall production.the course development usa?as said, incontestable swedish economy function good before.however, risk overshoot. the exceptionally long upswing usa hascontributed strengthen expectation fast long-term growth sweden well. there arecertain developmental feature swedish economy reminiscent american economywhich could indicate that. an important basis favourable development usa probablythe approach budget consolidation price stability guide economic policy along time. and area similar development sweden although processstarted late

competition also remain swedish economy. anotherdifference cyclical upswing experience take place time asgrowth increase surround world resource use increasing. the american upswingcould benefit surround world lot free resource low price pressure withfew compete investment alternative international investors.should monetary policy counteract financial imbalances?how shall monetary policy design risk exaggerate indebtedness andoverheating?a decision-making rule riksbank sometimes us motivate monetary policy decision insimple term describe follows: inflation exceed target one-to-two year horizon,then interest rate increased. interest rate increase reduce demand good services,which turn reduce inflationary pressure. in simple conceptual framework, inflationary pressureis assume vary use resource economy. when free capacity,inflationary pressure low absence so-called shocks. when demand high exceedsthe level compatible long-term production path, inflation tend instead exceed thetarget. the line reason base inflationary expectation establish close targetfor monetary policy. price increase demand strong may instance depend bottlenecksbeing create part production chain. a company situation, cannot improveits profit increase volume sales, profit margin increase price increases. shortageof labour also increase risk excessively high wage increases. the result higherinflation.if strictly apply simple rule decision-making, shall disregard risk buildingup financial imbalance overheat long inflation deem exceed targetduring forecast period.in recently publish inflation assessments, assume price stability target wasnot threaten forecast period despite growth demand strong use ofcapacity strain end period. the majority view executive board wastherefore reason increase repo rate. this assessment base freeresources initial situation, good productivity growth, low price increase certain recentlyderegulated areas, low import price finally low inflation expectations. it per se strange thatgdp increase much 3-4% couple year without inflation sharply accelerating, theuse resource low initially.if pattern previous cyclical upswings repeated, price pressure increase.however, prove difficult identify exact stable correlation. a i mentionedearlier great change take place swedish economy. while still considerabledeficiencies competition many areas, nevertheless probable inflation acceleratestrongly next years. an important reason price stability target 5bis review 48/2000obtained strong support inflation expectation increase despite cyclical upswingthat strong long time. i have, however, reason i mention early myspeech, somewhat pessimistic majority executive board regard inflationassessments forecast horizon. fluctuation consumer price tenth percent anddown around target economy strongly accept price stability regime per se lessimportant mode function economy.i concern happen inflation growth forecast period ifdemand increase rate anticipated. the simple rule say monetary policy shallonly react target inflation meet forecast period good help whenconducting monetary policy. however, reasonable mechanically apply rule everysituation. the consequence economic development macroeconomic stability andinflation beyond forecast horizon must also weigh in. the risk financial imbalance nowbeing build indebtedness increase inflationary pressure accumulate sametime must view therefore take account monetary policy decisions. adevelopment i describe early consequence expansion demand creditcontinue increase high rate. the quantity money lending, especially households, arefor instance increase present rate probably sustainable long term.the advantage simple rule decision-making easy explain beespecially important

would almost certainly fail thegovernment, majority shareholder, will two occasion provide substantialcapital injection. one major financial institution (not bank, certainly quasi-bank, aninstitution process apply bank licence) fail, one largestfailures new zealand’s history. another bank would fail private sector shareholdernot position inject large amount additional capital, even do bi review 47/20002the institution eventually wind up. at point look likely whole bank systemmight fail, certainly major problem large participant system.what lesson learn experience? there course whole host factor thatcaused difficulties. one important factor sheer inexperience many bankers:they accustom highly protect environment, ill-prepared deal thedemands deregulate environment. nevertheless, i think four important lesson areworth share you. while every country make judgement decision light itsown particular circumstance – certainly two country exactly alike – lessonswe learn promote financial system stability may relevance country well.i deal monetary policy lesson last somewhat succinctly, leave mycomments prudential policy lessons, move away traditional‘rules-based’ approach supervise banks. i choose dwell mainly prudential policylessons, experience may relevance you. i suspect i havemuch offer national bank belgium monetary policy front, give interest arelikely concentrate monetary union issue single monetary policy euroarea operation year. (as issue currency union new zealand iscurrently matter public discussion country, time i would welcome commentsmembers audience might want make experience monetary union far.)prudential policy lesson new zealandlesson 1: encourage bank behave prudentlyfirst, i believe important bank give every incentive behave prudently. this may seema self-evident statement, astonish frequently importance principle isignored. in new zealand’s case, diminish incentive behave prudently allow theview go unchallenged bank effectively ‘sovereign risk’, least ‘too big fail’. thismeant bank creditor felt little need ass creditworthiness bank theydeposited fund - bank were, widely believed, effectively guarantee government. bankboards management may felt similarly protect possibility failure, madeloans disregard risk was, cases, breath-taking. this so-called ‘moral hazardproblem’ may particularly severe case two three institution get intoserious difficulty late eighties, own wholly part government. therewas little direction lend government, management institutionscertainly embark upon lend transaction newly liberalise environment rapidly gotthem serious difficulties.for country experience financial instability recent years, possiblethat incentive bank behave prudently seriously erode impression thatmost large financial institution would allow fail also extent whichgovernments direct lend activity bank themselves. after all, government aregoing become extensively involve direct bank lend, notunreasonable bank creditor assume government ‘see right’ thingsgo wrong. bank management certainly little incentive carefully ass credit risk if, endof day, decision whether lend make bank’s board influenceor direction high political authority.at moment, know, great deal international attention focus thisproblem poor credit decision bank sector deal with. most attention appearsto strengthen external regulation bank sector, make bank moreindependent political influence. certainly, free bank political interference creditdecisions desirable, strengthen ‘rules-based’ bank supervision one possible way toreduce risk future problem bank system. 3bis review 47/2000but new zealand persuade strengthen ‘rules-based’ bank supervision theonly way proceed, indeed even necessarily best way proceed circumstances. whenwe review bank supervision early nineties, become concerned.at time, conduct bank supervision along conventional basel committee lines. wewere gather large amount confidential information bank quarterly (sometimes amonthly) basis. we lay large number rule limit design ensure banksbehaved prudently.several thing prompt u review approach, one worry riskswhich incur behalf taxpayers. what would happen if, despite bankingsupervision, bank get difficulties? might depositor argue want fullcompensation, since knowledge bank’s financial condition thereserve bank fully aware condition also responsible lay downthe rule limit bank oblige operate?we console think bank supervision good bank wouldfail watchful eye. but look abroad – unite states, japan, atscandinavia, unite kingdom australia. we find bank go significantnumbers, despite extremely professional politically-independent bank supervision. wecould confident traditional bank supervision would prevent bank failure, couldbe confident that, sole recipient detail financial information bank mainarbiter constitute prudent bank behaviour, major risk would heldliable, politically morally legally, loss incur depositors.then become aware anecdotal evidence bank supervision reduce incentivefor bank director make decision crucial aspect bank’s operations. inother words, reserve bank lay maximum individual credit limits, limitson open foreign exchange positions, guideline internal controls, bank director wereassuming necessarily behave prudently provide operate within thoselimits guidelines. they stop address risk bank face andsimply comply general limit guidelines. to extent true – wefound evidence true bank – conclude bank supervisionmight actually increase risk bank failure, reduce incentive bank director andbank manager make careful assessment risk.the outcome review substantially strengthen discipline director managersof bank operate bank prudently, strengthen ability marketplace disciplinebanks. we also retain system supervisory discipline, take seriously. but retainonly absolute rule within framework, principally bank must least meet baselcapital adequacy rules. we rely mainly requirement bank disclose public substantialamount financial risk information quarterly. in addition, bank director must sign thesequarterly statements, time attest fact internal control bank areappropriate nature bank business, control properly applied.we reserve bank attempt tell bank control look like, directorssigning quarterly statement without make careful assessment adequacy internalcontrols expose considerable legal risk event bank get intodifficulty.we also go way number occasion make clear public neitherthe reserve bank government new zealand guarantee individual banks, wepublished booklet design assist general public interpret banks’ financial information.none action guarantee imprudent bank behaviour course, believe thatwe go considerable distance towards ensure bank face strong incentive behaveprudently. no bank operate new zealand own government, none guarantee bygovernment, none oblige lend particular sector companies, supervision basedheavily mandatory public disclosure director attestations. three year ago, alan greenspancommented ‘regulation government unavoidably involve element perverse incentives. bi review 47/20004if private market participant believe government protect interests, effort todo diminish.’1 we try minimise perverse incentives. a william mcdonough,president federal reserve bank new york chairman basel committee onbanking supervision, say march year, ‘… give accelerate pace change andinnovation financial service industry, notion supervision must encompass disciplineapplied marketplace, well official supervision.’2 in new zealand, notion ofsupervision rely heavily marketplace discipline.of course, extent approach work clear framework companylaw make clear company director manager unambiguous responsibilities.having agree account rule important. have risk-proofed payment system important.having vigorous media, probe financial journalists, also great value, bankis force disclose public deteriorate financial position, breach one ruleswe retain, least reasonable chance pick sensibly analyse themedia. not country lucky. where country infrastructure place, morehands-on involvement supervisor banks’ activity may well appropriate. where thisinfrastructure place, new zealand, believe supervisory regime base largelyon self-discipline market discipline viable option.i mention little early concern international initiative currentlyunderway address financial system instability. the major issue u see theinitiatives potentially undermine incentive establish bank behaveprudently. while increase recognition need harness reinforce marketmechanisms pursuit supervisory goals, time international supervisorycommunity appear move towards ever prescriptive intrusive approach bankingsupervision. an example supervisory validation supervisor intervention proposal thebasel committee’s june 1999 consultative paper new capital accord. if proposal wereimplemented new zealand, could considerably weaken market incentive distort thebehaviour bank director managers. we see occur result supervisorbecoming directly involve management banks, associate risk thegovernment draw underwrite bank time stress.another potential risk u that, thing differently, might assess notfully comply basel committee’s core principle international standard arebeing developed. the concern new zealand bank might end penalise (forexample, high borrow cost risk weight capital accord link tocompliance international standards). this could result process assess compliance withinternational standard become ‘one-size-fits-all’, checklist, mechanical tick-the-boxes, approach.we stress submission basel committee assess compliance anyinternational standard need focus look whether substance, rather form,of standard met.i add that, notwithstanding concerns, new zealand strongly support introduction ofinternational standards. we consider international harmonisation co-operation important inwhat rapidly become ‘borderless’ global financial system. our plea implementation ofsuch standard do appropriate degree flexibility adequately cater individualcircumstances country.to frank you, impossible say sure whether prudential policy approach isworking not. we bank failure since new policy implemented, had1remarks chairman board u federal reserve system, dr alan greenspan, annual conferenceof association private enterprise education, arlington, virginia, 12 april 1997.2speech mr william j mcdonough, president federal reserve bank new york chairman baselcommittee bank supervision, the monetary authority singapore, singapore, 24 march 2000 5bis review 47/2000no bank failure previous 100 year either (although certainly bank wouldhave failed, late eighties, shareholder inject lot capital). moreover, allbut one 17 bank new zealand foreign-owned, increase proportion banksin foreign ownership last decade, also mean new zealand case notnecessarily compel demonstration validity market-based approach.but quite lot anecdotal evidence bank director take theirresponsibilities seriously, seem mark increase attention givento internal controls. we mild recession first half 1998, relate fall value ofthe new zealand dollar 30 per cent u dollar (from peak trough), bankscame absolutely minimal adverse effects, low ratio impair asset andcontinuing strong profitability.so far least, well satisfy way new system working.to conclude long first lesson, let illustrate main point specific event. afew month new system first come operation, begin 1996, one bank wasobliged disclose public fact credit exposure shareholder bank whichconsiderably exceed limit stipulate exposure. the attention focus onthis issue media, indeed banks, create strong incentive bank never torepeat mistake – quite probably strong incentive threat central bank sanction couldhave created.lesson 2: beware government ownership bank remove barrier foreign ownershipthe second lesson new zealand experience late eighty ownership banksis important issue. for us, issue part government ownership bank part foreignownership banks. the government-owned financial institution almost without exception sufferedvarious degree financial difficulty – sometimes manager undertake imprudentlending, sometimes oblige invest large amount governmentsecurities sub-market interest rates. the large foreign-owned bank suffer much limitedextent bad debt loss government-owned bank experienced.there various reason give difference, plausible largeforeign-owned bank watchful eye experience parent banks, thereforemuch le able stray risky proposition tempt government-ownedinstitutions, especially year immediately bank sector liberalise themid-eighties. (the newly-arrived foreign-owned banks, however, often succumb temptationof lend risky propositions, perhaps because, quite small absolute term inrelation overseas parents, subject much le intensive parental scrutiny.)more recently, new zealand run large balance payment deficit, probablyamounting 7 per cent gdp present time. this balance payment deficit hasbeen experience time government run fiscal surplus. in words, ithas private sector borrow heavily overseas, public sector.and borrow do corporate sector directly, much beendone bank sector. comparable level overseas borrow bank country havebeen sufficient make foreign lender nervous (for example, asian country recentyears), yet similar nervousness evident new zealand. why? i onlyconclude foreign lender take considerable comfort fact banksoperating new zealand fact wholly-owned foreign banks, indeed branch offoreign banks. those parent see financially strong, fully able back operationsof new zealand subsidiary branches. (it may also relevant that, overwhelmingly, theoverseas borrow undertake new zealand bank carry foreign exchange risk thebanks themselves.)in countries, political reluctance allow foreign institution unrestricted entry localbanking sectors. i would say that, country one 17 bank own bi review 47/20006and control overseas, see absolutely disadvantage situation, manyadvantages. we financially stable bank sector, vigorously compete highlyinnovative banks, subject monetary policy influence central bank. i nodoubt bank sector considerably stable would case allthe bank domestically-owned, whether private sector public sector.monetary policy lesson new zealandlesson 3: keep price stablethe third lesson experience crucial importance financial system stability ofkeeping price stable. i sure audience assignment monetary policy theobjective keep price stable extraordinary, evidence price stability theprimary objective single monetary policy eurosystem. but let comment linkbetween price stability financial system stability.by late eighties, new zealand experience nearly 20 year consumer priceinflation 10 per cent almost without break. interest rate adjustment tax andinflation often strongly negative, consequence strong incentive invest inreal estate shares, use much borrow money could obtained. this undoubtedly animportant contributor severe difficulty corporate sector part thebanking sector experience monetary policy tighten order reduce inflation thesecond half eighties. interest rate go asset price go down, several banksincurred large loss consequence.in new zealand, monetary policy direct achieve maintain domestic pricestability since mid-eighties, exchange rate allow float freely since march 1985.prior that, objective monetary policy much confused. in new zealand, asindeed many countries, deeply engrained belief monetary policy could beused directly achieve fast growth output employment. there widespread belief thatpolicy-makers could choose tolerate somewhat high level inflation exchange moregrowth low level unemployment. (after all, bill phillips phillips curve fame newzealand’s best know economist.) since mid-eighties, accept suchtrade-off inflation one hand growth employment other, bestthing monetary policy foster sustainable growth output employment deliverpredictably stable prices, low rate measure inflation. and, course, sound bankingsector likely environment steady economic growth.unfortunately, relatively low consumer price inflation always accompany low asset priceinflation. there single explanation asset price inflation and, new zealand discoveredin mid-nineties, quite strong increase price residential rural property, isoften extraordinarily difficult restrain asset price inflation even inflation consumer price islow. nevertheless, confident monetary policy target low consumer price inflation incombination float exchange rate likely result weak le sustain asset pricecycle would otherwise case.the problem cause asset price inflation well illustrate part asia recent years.it least possible asset price inflation japan late eighty – reversal hasdone much damage bank balance sheet country – consequence monetary policybeing keep easy long, whether appease unite state plaza accord forsome reason i know not. similarly, may well central bank asiancountries preoccupy try avoid appreciation currency againstthe u dollar capital flow economy mid-nineties, interest rate wouldhave high asset price inflation commensurately reduced. and course asset priceinflation less, over-investment certain kind real estate would presumably beenless and, it, subsequent fall asset prices. 7bis review 47/2000lesson 4: avoid peg exchange rateand bring rather naturally final lesson new zealand’s experience, isthe danger peg exchange rate unless one prepare go way full currency unionas do belgium, least currency board, hong kong countrieshave done.in new zealand, peg exchange rate march 1985, i mentioned. prior thatdate, uncommon company borrow overseas, often interest rate verymuch low within high inflation new zealand economy. some company make ratherspectacular loss new zealand dollar devalue time time, when, even whenpegged, new zealand dollar depreciate currency loan denominated.(borrowing swiss franc particularly popular, particularly painful, companies.)but loss probably fairly moderate comparison loss government itselfincurred behalf taxpayer 1984. in year, new zealand dollar devalue 20 percent foreign exchange crisis government, write large volume offorward exchange contract company try protect positions, incur loss manyhundreds million dollars.since march 1985, new zealand dollar freely floating, indeed i suspect may bethe central bank claim intervene directly foreign exchange market formore 15 years. (i say ‘directly’ time time adjust monetary policy whenwe felt movement exchange rate seem likely threaten single goal low inflation.)one benefit that, though many company bank borrow overseas,none borrow undertake belief currency risk involved. overseasinterest rate frequently much low new zealand but, factor theexchange rate risk, incentive borrow offshore foreign currency substantially reduced.as consequence, when, period strong new zealand dollar appreciation early 1993and early 1997, new zealand dollar fell 30 per cent u dollar, veryfew company unhappy fall – indeed plenty exporter delighted. evenfewer bank catch depreciation, best knowledge noneincurred loss consequence move. because know new zealand dollar wasfreely floating, careful avoid take unhedged position foreign currency.conclusionin conclusion, world open capital markets, challenge face bank considerable.central bank prevent bank get trouble, try so. butcentral bank responsibility country promote stability bankingsector. in view, best create strong incentive bank behaveprudently; discourage government ownership banks, remove barrier foreignownership banks; keep focus monetary policy price stability; create theimpression borrow foreign currency riskless activity. we learn lesson hardway. 1bis review 46/2000masaru hayami: revitalization japan’s economyspeech mr masaru hayami, governor

production high corporateprofits household income. with mind, continue carefully monitor economicsituation.business cycle structural adjustmentwhile economy recovery path, observe structural problem yet beensolved. since observation lead controversy relation business cycleand structural adjustment, allow elaborate little.it correct say economy never recover unless structural problem solved.needless say, kind structural problem always exist point time economy,and i deny japan currently face extremely big problems. moreover, beremembered time also experience business cycles. on hand, notcorrect claim economic recovery nothing structural problems. if structuralreform proceed smoothly, economic recovery lack strength, big problem remainunsolved even economy recover substantially evidence situation japan thebursting bubble. i think true say economic recovery would robust ifaccompanied progress structural reform. bi review 46/20002the nature structural problem may differ time time country country, isnot easy come clear-cut definition. have say this, current structural problem injapan could characterize arise process economic system adapt newenvironment, words,

theeconomy eventually shift full-fledged recovery path.characteristics economic recovery structural adjustmentcurrently, judgment japan’s economy stage number firm take theoffensive start increasing, is, economy moderately recover parallel structuraladjustment. let point major characteristic recovery.first, recovery lead corporate sector. in 1990s, prolong recession slowadjustment employment wage prevail management system lead substantialrise proportion labor income national income, one factor behind thedeteriorating profitability japanese firms. put aside effect active monetary fiscalpolicy well steady development overseas economies, current recovery is, large extent,triggered earnest restructure japanese firm aim restore profitability. thus,with respect recovery private demand, seem natural corporate sector, hasregained profitability result restructuring, take lead increase investmentfollowed household sector income condition gradually improve. this development weare witnessing.second, observe polarization various area economy. for example, moderate recoveryof business fix investment mean uniform increase across board. while thoseindustries produce basic material burden excess capacity continue restraininvestment, relate information technology, electric machinery, increasedinvestment substantially. another example. in labor market, recently witness thesituation new job offer grow double-digit rate year-on-year basis whilethe unemployment rate remain high even slightly increased. this signify wideningmismatching supply demand labor market. under globalization market economiesand progress information telecommunication technology, worker skill thatfirms need short supply, worker accumulate firm-specific skill traditionallifetime employment system long demand.when economic recovery structural adjustment proceed simultaneously, often observeconflicting developments. thus, accurately grasp economic developments, extremely importantnot examine macroeconomic indicator also thoroughly understand microeconomicmovements behind macroeconomic indicators. 3bis review 46/20002.movements toward structural reformresponse aftereffect burst bubble - decline financial intermediary functionnow let turn earnest structural reform effort see various area economy.first, problem decline financial intermediary function burst bubble hasbegun resolved. it go without say aftereffect burst bubble oneof major factor responsible make 1990s “lost decade” japan. the burst thebubble create balance sheet problem. indeed, non-performing asset problem financialinstitutions reduce risk-taking capacity impair smooth circulation money. inparticular, behind extremely severe recession end 1997 1998 decline inconfidence part corporate sector household sector stem financialsystem instability deterioration financial intermediary function often beentermed credit crunch.since spring last year bank japan effect zero interest rate policy public fundswere inject major bank strengthen capital base, public confidence financialsystem gradually restored, observe favorable impact economy.furthermore, important development observe nearly half century sincethe end world war ii, financial industry move toward large-scale consolidation.last year, private consumption support economy midst decline household income,which mean decline save rate. this perhaps interpret households, wereconcerned financial system instability increase save end 1997 early1998, turn loosen purse strings. in regard, survey lifestyle financialbehavior conduct bank

restructuring, ithink begin observe result efforts. when talk restructure bi review 46/20004results recent period, business world say pursue restructuringfor long time. i fully commend past effort toward corporate restructuring, i would like toemphasize restructure witness since last year different nature compare withthe past tendency recently become distinct. in view, past restructure focusedmostly cost reductions, words, downsizing. to contrary, current restructuring, thoughinitially tendency toward downsizing, shift focus business content orreengineering, mean restructure production management system beenrendered inefficient. i believe restructure japanese firm truly enter new phase.behind change focus restructuring, business world, case offinancial institutions, experience protract recession face severe financialenvironment, particularly 1997 1998. during period, many small medium-sized firmsfaced fund difficulties, summer autumn 1998 financial capitalmarkets home abroad stress due factor russian crisis, fewrepresentative big japanese firm also face similar difficulties. such experience link withchanges account system, namely consolidate mark-to-market methods, broughtabout recognition sense crisis part firm japan’s traditional corporategovernance include main bank system cross-shareholdings would viable long andthat survival enhance evaluation capital market suchmeasures improve capital efficiency. all seem trigger current full-fledgedrestructuring.current restructure different past downsize nature firm require morethan ever efficiently allocate resource improve profitability. for example, since big firmsengaged production electric machinery chemical could enjoy economy scopeany more, concentrate area edge, recently term “areas corecompetence” japan, time withdraw scale unprofitable businessareas. and, among basic material industry burden excess capacity, beenmovements toward consolidation include merger acquisition obsolete

investment semiconductor manufacturers. and, i feel expectation aregradually emerge japanese business circle mega change occur twicein hundred year might start japan. however, still remain deeply-embeddedpessimism japan ten year behind unite state it-related business area andit easy even catch up. to understand coexistence expectation pessimism, let usexamine discussion regard it-related revolution affect japan’s economy. 5bis review 46/2000one topic discussion spread it-related investment corporate sector. in regard, itis necessary distinguish investment it producer it users. it true thatit-related investment unite state center computer telecommunicationsindustries record large improvement productivity. but also true it usersin wide variety industry manufacturing,

point spread investment awide area, include small medium-sized firms, key sustainable expansion ofinvestment, eventually improvement productivity.it utilize corporate sector call b-to-b, is, business business, alsoby household sector call b-to-c, is, business consumer. another topic fordiscussion japanese firm respond situation it introduce householdsector. the it revolution unite state 1990s substantially enhance productivity throughthe enhancement operational process personal computer network introduce thecorporate sector. japan behind u regard, perhaps one reason behindthe “lost decade 1990s”. some feature japan’s corporate system say relate tothis delay. a may remember, 1980s, japanese-style management, represent bykeiretsu transactions, main bank system, lifetime employment, regard superiorin term information share among relate party long-term relationships. in contrast,since us-style big business model vertically integrate susceptible sectionalism, hadbeen consider inferior japanese system process information. however, managementsystem evaluate relation technology available time. the japanese system isno exception find necessarily superior account cost oftransmitting process information dramatically decline due rapid progress ofinformation telecommunication technology. rather, merit japanese system lead alack incentive actively introduce it cost reduction purposes. in addition, firm mustreview exist transaction style reduce worker take full advantage benefit it, thejapanese system tend make difficult firm implement changes. furthermore,

thefoundation venture business create flourish finally lay symbolize the“bit valley”, partly due development number newly establish firm whole hasbeen gradually increase since last summer. the use it

notwithstanding this, important even though therelative position unite state japan may reversed, possibility emerge thatjapan fully compete unite state it field. these development also seem havehad positive impact firm enable regain vitality.3.escape lose decaderemaining taskscompared july 1999 speech i say dynamism japanese economy hadbeen contained, development i describe today indicate dynamism haseventually begin re-ignited. however, far say structural problem inherentin japan’s economy solved.for example, regard balance sheet problem financial institutions, financial systemhas indeed escape instability, problem yet fully resolve i previously remarked.the excess debt problem part firm yet completely solved. furthermore, resultof firm put emphasis capital efficiency, continue reduce assetswith low profitability. in regard, bank japan’s march tankan survey show majormanufacturing industry expect ratio ordinary profit sale current financial year tobe around 4 percent, past average. we may able say profitability indiceson flow basis recover average level past. however, profitability index astock basis roe roa remain substantially level 1980s, isa different aspect i refer

corporate restructure it revolution, know leadto improvement corporate profitability increase investment. even high profitabilityand large investment realized, possibility polarization see

regard, public utilities, haveexperienced series deregulatory measures, continue suppress investment, small andmedium-sized wholesaler retailer susceptible effect distribution revolutionhave slow exhibit business recovery. regard employment, possibility whiledemand worker skill compatible new era increases, demand worker wholack skill declines. in context, unemployment problem might become

contribute currenteconomic recovery, forget remain structural problem must solve toachieve sustain economic expansion future. structural problem cannot solve solely bymacroeconomic policy measure monetary fiscal policy. now financial capitalmarkets highly globalized, attempt wipe past problem generate inflation willnever successful. let emphasize private sector vitality form “creativedestruction” solve structural problems. and, u experience shows, private sectorvitality gradually absorb adverse effect structural reform.in “era metamorphosis” represent current it revolution, exist considerableuncertainty future. from another angle, say era innovation leadto business opportunities. under circumstances, role public sector play toprepare market environment conducive nurture innovation. one thing stability ofthe macroeconomic environment. in regard, responsibility bank japan tomaintain stable macroeconomic condition price stability. other important role

upon monetary policy, meet mainlyabout reform international financial system. on occasion, doubt lotmore time spend monetary policy.i would like start meet traditional way review forecast i give thecommittee last november, outline current view likely development yearahead.last november, half year’s data available, i say expect gdp growth 1999 tobe 3½%. in event, 4.3%, continue record expect modest slowdown thatdid arrive. i also say expect growth 4% year june 2000, presentindications still look likely, even though rate may well dip 4% year march. ofcourse, difficult usual read true trend year, expenditure beingshifted quarter gst, boost olympics.most monthly indicator economic activity point slow far 2000. however, tooearly know whether merely represent slowdown domestic demand beenwaiting for, build forecast time, whether represent somethingbigger - significant slow gdp growth. our judgment see mainly former,namely change composition gdp growth. in words, slow private domesticdemand, undoubtedly occurring, largely offset boost get fromnet export soon get fiscal policy.while expect slowdown gdp sense expect repeat 4½%average achieve 1997, 1998 1999, still see quite solid growth ahead. we noquibble sort figure contain budget paper show growth gdp of3¾% 2000/01. such outcome would quite remarkable achievement compare therecord past three decades, i return subject later.on inflation, november forecast cpi would rise 2% year december 1999and 2¾% year june 2000. we get close mark forecast - outcome forthe year december 1999 little lower, 1.8%, think figure year tojune 2000 little higher, 3%. some increase cpi due temporary factors, sothat 3% cpi correspond 2½% underlie inflation. thus finish theperiod inflation bottom band - period last long usexpected - move back cpi near top band, partly due tosome temporary factors.where now? this particularly hard judge, give least year year-ended figure cpi obscure once-off lift due gst, effect ofthe abolition

understand fully context although, necessity, mostcommentary concern short period month month, line board meeting, evenshorter, day day, reflect deadline daily press.i start restate logic inflation-targeting framework, underpin ourwhole medium-term approach. we inflation target say inflation averagesomewhere 2 3% medium long run. we accept time outsidethis range, think go happen briefly call adjustment monetarypolicy return inflation target keep there.we base monetary policy framework care inflation, butbecause think give u best result whole economy long run. in particular, ifapplied sensibly, enable economy’s average growth rate reflect potential growth rateand therefore deliver maximum sustainable increase employment live standards.we already see nine year expansion growth average 4%, considerably longerexpansion able achieve 1970s 1980s. and every prospect theexpansion continue good deal longer. for first time work life, australia the1990s come near top decade growth rate among develop countries. we grow fasterthan unite states, ireland, among develop countries, record fast growth.this growth occur time inflation rate average 2¼%, good deal low inearlier decades, comparable international standards. there also le variability yearto year growth early expansions, although variability inevitable: hadannual growth rate 5% le 3% expansion, yet fundamentalmomentum remain intact. i think system prove good one, i amconfident best way ensure monetary policy make sense medium term.it also worth note course expansion, one complete cycle ininterest rate - rise 1994, fall 1996-98. these play part sustain expansion.the increase official interest rate 125 basis point occur past seven monthshas see context. for present expansion continue long possible, monetarypolicy adjust circumstance change. the economy undergo shift aperiod inflation target one go target range.without policy adjustment, prospect would, time, rise desire

specialhonor me, country, croatia, well. let thank this. it aprivilege deliver lecture two distinguish central bank governors: hannagronkiewicz-waltz two year ago jacob a frenkel last year. which remind right iam break one main bi rules: “never speak jacob frenkel”. my hope thetime lag one year long enough memory fade.making speech honor mr de larosière enormous challenge. i always veryimpressed work distinguish domestic especially international career. i metmr de larosière first time 1996 (after i become governor central bank) havemanaged stay touch regularly since then. even difficult moment croatia’s historyduring period international political isolation, manage honest professionalrelationship, today i respect even i then. for highlight relationshiphappened last year mr de larosière accept invitation give keynote speech thetraditional vth dubrovnik conference transition economy organise croatian nationalbank. definitely, knowledge, experience insight transition process invaluable tothe conference. the title lecture non-pretentious (like man himself): “transitioneconomies”, message strong deep (again, like mr de larosière himself). in hisconcluding remark mr de larosière, among things, courage point thenegative human facet transition, example: “… country human cost transitionhave high, instance term male life expectancy ..., grow inequality income andincreased poverty.” (de larosière, 1999, p.10).of course, many positive human side transition. what i would like today neitherpresent comprehensive survey transition numerous article entitled: “ten yearsof transition …”, give new empirical evidence causality main variablesin transition process. i would simply like share experience i apolicymaker transition, experience course gain country - croatia. beside i willtry, ask questions, make reflect moment simple ideas. for example, one ofthe question i look answer whether past consistently checkedour progress transition country international standards, whatmust ultimate goal transition process - increase wellbeing people.my lecture divide three parts. first, i try answer simple question: what transitionall about? the second part discus main “ingredients” process achievingrapid sustain growth focus human social capital. in third part i discusssome obstacle transition way i see them, mean central banker. i end bysumming remarks.1i would like thank mr. boris vujcic mr. gary o’callaghan suggestion prepare lecture. theusual disclaimer applies. bi review 43/200021.what transition process about?numerous researcher analyse depth transition process term speed reforms, theirsequencing, result possible outcomes, rarely ask simple question like:why transition start involve it? without elaborate answer detail, letme offer one possible answer. socialism (as define kornai, 2000), predominant system incountries ebrd operate today, imploded, collapsed. this system able meetthe grow demand population good life, say: raise live standards, thedevelopment civil society political freedoms. in globalize world, information livingstandards development civil society political freedom neighbour west couldnot hide transition economies, discontent grew. the political conditionsfor change symbolize fall berlin wall. this create huge expectation among peoplein country formerly socialist economies. the expectation population time werethat would rapid catch-up western standard live (including political freedomsas well). with regard speed catch term economic wellbeing, turn bea naïve view.the main goal economic policy increase welfare population, whichincludes sustain high growth gdp desirable distribution income. in words,we want welfare increase; want people good off. not many people troubleagreeing statement. today, indeed, evidence dual goal growth andequality income distribution mutually compatible (wolf, 2000).whether policymakers always fully aware ultimate goal promote welfare peopleis another question. policymakers transition face many challenge bold decisions. let memention few. whether privatize rapidly not? whether open economy orretain external control time? whether aim zero inflation not? the main point thatthose (and similar) question answer viewpoint either ideologyor academic debate, answer light fact mean achievethe ultimate goal increase welfare people country transition. i would argue thatpolicymakers tend forget think measure transition goal itself. for example,sometimes proud rapid privatization regardless effects.the second danger policymakers care ultimate objective all. sometimes,politicians thing order enrich themselves, family friends, instead increasingsociety’s welfare. such behaviour call “bad” political culture (hillman swank, 2000). it hasto stress society perform badly. corruption endemic, tax evasion high, resourcesare misallocated, growth lower, inequality higher.in transition process people sometimes forgotten. and i refer poor ordeprived, people general. therefore we, policymakers, ask whether wehave consistently check progress must ultimate goal transitionprocess.my message transition policy ultimately benefit people, thepeople understand reform necessary kind reform pursue. inshort understand policymakers doing. let stress thelegacy socialism goal even challenge transition. usually people averse torisk high discount rate future. in socialism two behavioral pattern seem tobe even stronger. people spend part life socialist system come onlyten year ago, average tend even: a) risk averse b) strong preference thepresent.a) in socialism notion risk consequence almost unknown. one think ofsocialism big insurance company. no bankruptcies, unemployment, financialmarkets, volatility whatsoever, little choice (both household companies) asalmost everything lay central plan. most risk (which always exist) weretaken society whole (socialized) individualized. or, vice versa,individual decision rarely affect individual wellbeing. in market environment 3bis review 43/2000so many decision take almost associate risk itsconsequences.b) in socialism reason worry much future. free schools, freeeducation, free health insurance, unemployment, secure pensions, short fewincentives take long-term perspective life. question like: how i go financemy children’s education? should i save old age? will i able afford mortgageif i’m unemployed? rarely ask socialism. so, comfortable thinkonly present, someone else - “the socialist system” - would take care thefuture. the reason could apply companies. why worry long-termmarket developments, almighty central planner would take care that?for reason even challenge policymakers transition explain goal andactions clearly population would otherwise be.in reality seem act consistently pursuit goal whether transitionbenefits people whether understand process. sometimes people get leave behind andwe embark reform without ask whether fulfil ultimate goal raise people’s livingstandards. moreover, fall trap measure success piecemeal reform withoutasking whether whole spectrum economic relation move forward together. therefore, wemust bring people forward reform ensure politically accepted. if isnot case, may become big obstacle rapid transition (as i explain due course).which remind old joke use tell socialism, go something like this.during preparatory seminar future member almighty communist party localparty secretary explain group candidate future belong socialism thatsocialism advance system world. a young candidate ask question refer topermanent meat shortage socialism: mr secretary, advance come nomeat shops? the swift answer was: “my dear comrade, advance quickly thefuture cattle can’t keep us”.i i argue slow reform transition, contrary, let u forget rush tomarket economy transition do benefit people.2.what “ingredients” need achieve sustained, rapid growth?economists agree transition successful need sustain growth. therefore, thequestion need do transition ultimately lead question cause growth?the literature growth expand lately, work transition agree thatmacroeconomic stability link structural reform essential growth (wyplosz, 1999; fischerand sahay, 2000). and equally true transition economy respond positively tothe combination two sharp decline gdp today positive growth.we learn well growth process much complex anticipate onetime. we know future success reform depend much element like: institutionbuilding, contract enforcement, rule law, etc. to explain complexity growth transition alittle bite i use two concepts: a) human capital b) social capital.a)human capitallet immediately start quote lucas (1993) cause growth: “the main engine ofgrowth accumulation human capital - knowledge - main source difference inliving standard among nation difference human capital” (p.270). so, want sustainedgrowth must promote accumulation human capital transition economies.the next question is: how accumulation human capital happen? obviously, manyways human capital accumulate but, mention few: happen schools, otherforms training, particularly on-the-job, research institutes, etc. therefore seem reasonable bi review 43/20004argue transition economy pay special attention formal education, form oftraining research. a empirical evidence suggest (flanagan, 1998), return school beganto rise rapidly transition. relatively soon, approximate many marketeconomies. under central planning, main distortion human capital formation theovervaluation vocational train undervalue university education. however, thetransition process quickly start correct shortcoming socialism.formal school need main factor develop human capital. let mention thataccording lucas (1993), central feature human capital accumulation growth islearning job (learning doing). for happen, need manager worker beconstantly expose new challenges, move “quality ladder”. in globalize world oftoday seem one best way expose new challenge exporting. an old latinsaying could paraphrase into: “exportare necesse est, vivere non necesse est”.2 by open theeconomy, promote human capital, turn essential growth.a similar approach use argue foreign direct investment (fdi) transitioneconomies. fdis bring physical capital, but: new organization, know-how, etc thenincrease “domestic” human capital. that strategic investor new knowledge soimportant overall growth.let little provocative state unfortunately multilateral institution rarely talk abouthuman capital explicitly. for example, ebrd charter (quoted bronstone, 1999) notmention develop human capital ebrd’s role. a bureaucratic answer might itsmandate. but, accord ebrd’s transition report: “the ebrd seek foster transition toan open market-oriented economy promote private entrepreneurial initiative 26 itscountries operation”. (ebrd, 1999, p. vi.) if agree human capital important intransition, i ask achieve ambitious goal without know leveland development human capital country operation? doe ebrd set ofmeasures human capital transition country (both cross-country time series), maybe invent anew index human capital (like broadly quote one privatization), separate chapter thetransition report? please, let assure ebrd governors, management staff remarksare make good faith hope reflect upon little bit.in general framework let u ask follow question: have do enough thepast achieve goal? i doubt whether lot people room (and policymakers transitioneconomies general) say yes without hesitation. base experience country,croatia, i would say unfortunately somewhat neglect development humancapital last ten year transition.b)social capitalnew literature try explain complexity various phenomenon social capital (collier,1998, fukuyama, 2000). it clear growth need physical human capital, butquality social capital well. social capital describe feature social organisation, asnorms, trust, networks, etc., facilitate coordination cooperation among group themutual benefit group. a group anything household nation. in productionprocess addition physical capital (machines, tools) human capital (accumulatedknowledge). social capital enhance benefit investment physical humancapital.one may distinguish government social capital civil social capital. government socialcapital encompass government institution influence people’s ability cooperate getmutual benefit it. example are: rule law, enforceability contracts, civil liberties. civil2 the original latin say is: navigare necesse est, vivere non necesse est. 5bis review 43/2000social capital includes: common norms, values, informal group network influence abilityof people work together.both resolve, i.e. overcome collective action problem (the prisoner’s dilemma). trust, aspromoted social capital, reduce uncertainty thus reduce transaction costs. this clearlybeneficial growth, may conclude: quality social capital high growthwill be.in lecture i elaborate concept social capital further. my intention focusnarrowly issue i think comparative advantage may be, namely central banking, andits role promote social capital. it common associate central bank thedevelopment social capital, i would argue forcefully pursue function centralbank increase social capital especially transition economies.central bank usually associate two main functions: macroeconomic stability moreprecisely price stability today consider principal mandate central bank andfinancial stability, usually narrow bank system stability. not transitioncentral bank responsible bank supervision, are.first let explore idea increase social capital pursue price stability. today, mosttransition economy manage relatively modest inflation initial outburst ofinflation even hyperinflation. but worth remember inflation always constantthreat, never dead, tamed. central bank must continuously send credible message thatcomplacency set price stability main long-term objective. people mustalways remind inflation tax. and tax is: undemocratic (rarely approve discussedin parliament), regressive (a heavy burden put poor; cannot protectthemselves it), economically inefficient (high inflation inhibit economic growth andultimately reduce budgetary revenues). and inflationary environment create wrong incentives.in highly inflationary environment incentive produce reduced. for entrepreneur take adecision produce (the “make it” approach) redistribute (the “take it” approach) one need along-term stable environment. therefore maintain price stability central bank give clearincentive gain experience production, redistribution. per contra, carry itsmain function, let inflation rise economy, central bank give incentive engage inredistribution high necessary transaction cost avoid inflation tax.let illustrate croatian experience. in twenty year precede independence(from 1971 1991 - croatia time part former yugoslavia), average inflation 69%per annum. in 1992 1993 average yearly inflation 1000%. similar trendsremained october 1993, stabilisation program launched. from personalexperience i assure highly inflationary environment household’s objective toavoid inflation tax. currency substitution “shopping around find old prices” mainbehavioral patterns, long-term planning. the say production. what purposeof get monthly 2% efficiency gain production process monthly price change morethan 20%? the principle apply monthly inflation 4% croatia (onaverage) two decade precede independence. throughout period gdp either stagnantor falling.3 gdp start increase 1994, price successfully stabilized.the cost inflation relatively well analyse literature, need analyse themany further, let reiterate important incentive country help people producenew wealth put effort redistribute it. inflation favor predation production.the second important function central bank stable financial or, narrowly, bankingsystem. but, bank crisis affect large number country almost none transitioneconomies escape (frydl, 1999). a lot transition economy pass two banking3the dramatic fall gdp croatia early ninety cannot attribute inflation alone. it even maincontributor. the disintegration former yugoslavia, war transition take place time. bi review 43/20006crises: first crisis old bank legacy (dubious assets) previouseconomic system. the second crisis occur bank found change economic systemthat able remain viable, either weak management and/or increase competitionin market transition period progressed.croatia follow pattern. the first bank crisis, crisis old banks, called,started begin transition process (and even it), even end withthe sale rehabilitate state bank foreign strategic investors. the cost crisis, broughtabout legacy past often forgotten, enormous consequence war,can estimate 23% gdp. these high cost typical country catch war,like kuwait israel part histories.during first half 1998 second bank crisis become visible croatia. the governmentmade decision rehabilitate two bank represent 7% total banks’ balancesheet. bank rehabilitation pay budget. the croatian national bank require thatbankruptcy proceed start nine bank four save banks, withdraw theoperating permit one branch foreign bank, one bank six save banks. this imposedhigh budgetary cost payment insure save deposit bank bankruptcyproceedings started. the total cost second bank crisis could estimate about4% gdp.the cost first second crisis represent 27% croatia’s gdp 1999. it isobviously heavy burden economy. the cost mention fiscal costs, bear thetaxpayers. economic cost certainly higher. if regulation supervision inadequate, bad bank emerge proliferate thanotherwise would case.4 this impose cost budget, economy willsuffer bank efficient financial intermediaries. for example, bank may allocateresources (loans) accord market principle good bank practices, aim to“favor” (management), relatives, friends, connect businesses, people’smoney. asset stripping, simple theft similar activity easily develop within around banks.all feature benefit few. a long management bank “can get away withmurder” continue behave way.by create stable environment (both macroeconomic financial) central bank favour thelong-term perspective. people expect stability price financial system, take along-term view get involve long-term wealth creation short-term redistributiongains.3.obstacles transition - personal accountcertainly, long list obstacle rapid transition. besides, i sure one youpresent would different list obstacles. today i elaborate two them,which i consider important experience. they are: a) rent-seeking behavior, b) lackof broad political support reform (which i partly discuss before).a)rent-seekingif private return predation large private return production, send “wrong”incentives people society develop desire direction. therefore makeevery effort “get incentive right”. this easy exercise. socialism and, sometimes evenmore, early transition, create vest interest understandable every socio-economic4in way i try imply main cause bank crisis inadequate supervision regulation. but,they certainly deepen bank problems. 7bis review 43/2000group fight either preserve status quo try “grab” even more. the problem isespecially exacerbate prevail mentality society whole “take it” “makeit” philosophy.every change redistribution, redistribution power relative wealth. transition definition isa change. people average resist change. i call newtonian law transition,namely: “every action create reaction.” (škreb, 1998). this resistance reform (changes) isprobably “time-dependent” positively correlate time spend transition. in earlystages reform general (macroeconomic stabilization) much support forthem. in late stage “transition fatigue” start develop, disappointment slowness (oreven decline stagnation) rise live standard present. on top this,structural reform imply microeconomic change (usually labor-shedding). this challenge thestatus quo. these reason structural reform much difficult toimplement slow glamorous macroeconomic stabilization program measure like theannouncement new currency, new exchange-rate regime new central bank governor.based croatia’s experience i would like say important large-scale privatization andforeign direct investment either postpone abandon resistance worker andlocal communities. they prefer imaginary safety status quo. the conventionalwisdom government ownership (the status quo) ensure least minimal wage jobsecurity. by contrast, private ownership company mean job uncertainty employees, theyhave observe many case privatize company labor-shedding take place. we beaware worker automatically embrace privatization restructure companiesin spite fact often carry interest option thecompany stay alive.the say case bank crisis resolution croatia. base ownexperience, resolution bind face strong resistance delays. first, budget(i.e. ministry finance) willingly accept pay cost bank crisisresolution. second, management bank try change bank problem resolutionand shoulder cost actions. they clear vest interest bank (theirhigh salaries, influence credit allocation, wish hide previous decisions, etc). third,depositors (households companies) make every effort minimize loss getsomeone else bear cost problem. fourth, owner bank try put politicalpressure government bail out. fifth, personnel bank, theyknow either part lose jobs. sixth, politician try minimize theproblem hope hurt “image”.every decision bank resolution problem redistribution problem. there always welfarelosses interest groups, aware decision create stronglobbying, corruption, ruthless behaviour, fight preserve vest interests, etc. needle say, allsuch behavioral pattern mean use scarce resource influence outcome redistributive way,and use produce new wealth. to overcome problem policymakers must make sure thatthey “incentives right” clear set rule diminish scope discretionarydecision-making always give room rent-seeking.b)support policiesultimately sound economics sound politics well. but problem economic measure maytake time bear fruit. in word reform usually immediate cost benefit are(sometimes) distant. let stress policymakers must educate public large get theirsupport. if case, may serious obstacle rapid transition.with benefit hindsight perspective central banker i would say pastwe lack much sound economic decision good public relation policies. this isespecially true case central bank initiate bankruptcy procedure withdraw licencesfor 25 bank something unheard croatia last fifty years. let u blame onlypeople politician resistance measures. new economic policy like new bi review 43/20008product. it responsibility producer - policymakers - overcome informationassymetry inform consumer - population politician - benefit thisproduct (bankruptcies bank system) sell successfully. if central bank transitioneconomies want successful much “customer-oriented” educate thepublic politician benefit main products: price stability financial stability.otherwise, risk weak demand services.without clearly explain goal reform people, policymakers put risk necessarysupport changes. this challenge long-term task easy get people ofcommunism communism people. this problem nothing new history. it withoutgood reason take moses forty year bring people slavery egypt promisedland (simply replace entire generation), trip could complete week (hillman, 1999).it therefore duty make journey transition desert short possible.4.summing uptransition tremendous excite project last ten years, well invaluableexperience u take part one way another. out learn lot, notonly economic system function initiate economic changes, learnedabout human nature well. so, let u keep mind transition process do peopleand people. they happen time: main objective transition (we increasetheir welfare), main engine transition (through human social capital) main constraintto rapid transition (rent-seeking behaviour lack political support).therefore, view, policymakers ask constantly follow three questions:a) whether consistently check progress transition must theultimate goal transition

to manage crisis, theauthorities implement measure avert complete breakdown financial systemwhile attempt limit cost taxpayers. in addition, imperative authority toconsider whether action would contribute future moral hazard problems. during thecrisis, effective division labour develop authority involved, namely ministryof finance, riksbank, central bank, finansinspektionen, financial supervisory authority andthe bank support authority. a crisis progressed, riksbank provide emergency liquidityassistance (ela) twice, act role “lender last resort”. the remark note largelydrawn riksbank’s experience crisis, experience use toassessing role ela general crisis management infrastructure.when discuss infrastructure place handle financial crises, two aspect ofprimary importance. first, ela must put context overall method crisismanagement authority would employ financial crisis occur. ela measurethat use every financial crisis. the way crisis management procedure areset also

thefinancial sector. this discuss second part note.before discuss two aspects, importance speed grant ela must emphasized, asthe speedy implementation ela essential effective crisis situation. ela theonly measure crisis management framework normally use quickly. it beseen acute measure use avoid sudden disruption large-value paymentsystem, particular threat system emerge suddenly.incidents like failure bar bank, ltcm swedish currency bank crisis showthat threat financial system may indeed emerge suddenly, authority must react veryquickly - within minutes, least within hours. the growth

authority must limit support bi review 42/20002offered. support may warrant considerable risk systemic crisis thatmay lead severe decline real economic activity. typically, real economic activity

supervisory authority able make valid assessment solvency troubledinstitutions quickly enough. a mention above, request liquidity support may arise rapidly.the conclusion practice difficult draw divide line thecentral bank’s responsibility authority distinguish institutionswith solvency problem pure liquidity problems, least sudden crisis.another conclusion crucial establish rule information share authorities,especially financial supervisory authority central bank advance thecentral bank quickly make assessment. it also important central bank, even doesnot direct supervisory responsibilities, closely monitor general financial market developments,including major institutions, detect potential crisis situation may call ela.the traditional view ela never give insolvent bank

however, take anargument government use central bank provider support want touse budgetary resources. the central bank independent control resources.the conclusion ela operation role general crisis

would occur central bank act. these two featuresbring requirement way central bank organise ela function internally. thepossible need speedy assistance necessitate central bank must internal procedure formanaging request liquidity support rapidly. to accomplish this, central banksneed detail crisis plan put place within short notice. the crisis planshould include follow type information:organisational structure• a division responsibility analysis, information, decision-making, etc.• staff requirement different tasks, substitutes.analysis plan• a description information

bankperspectiveaddress dr donald t brash, governor reserve bank new zealand, aucklandrotary club, auckland, 22 may 2000.* * *introductionin recent years, huge increase interest exchange rate regimes, within newzealand internationally. should country maintain currencies, adopt currency ofsome country group countries? if country maintain currencies, they“float”, attempt “peg” currency country?as know, new zealand currency many decades, since march 1985 thatcurrency float currencies, value determine day day thefinancial market. but mid-nineties exchange rate appreciate strongly, many peoplebecame concern whether best arrangement new zealand (between early 1993and early 1997, inflation-adjusted trade-weighted measure new zealand dollar appreciatedby 29 per cent, put considerable pressure exporter compete imports).interest subject become even widespread last couple years, 11 thecountries europe abandon currency form currency union, thegrowing interest several latin american country adopt unite state dollar. last month,sir frank holmes dr arthur grimes, two highly-regarded economists, release study hadundertaken australia new zealand business council entitle an anzac dollar?, hasfurther intensify public political interest matter. it clear strong interest inthe subject part business community.so today i want make comment reserve bank perspective.but outset i want make clear decision abandon currency isfundamentally political issue. currency union generally form part large strategic pushto integrate country enter currency union, often combination free trade agreements,harmonisation legal standards, liberalise migration laws. view way, enter acurrency union major foreign policy decision, thus matter elect politicians. it amatter central banker express overall opinion, i so.but choice currency regime important economic implication need becarefully assessed, i believe appropriate comment those.one point clarify outset. there difference “currency union”(implying new central bank new currency cover range country currencies, inthe case european monetary union) “dollarisation” (implying simple adoption thecurrency another country, whether new zealand’s case australian dollar unitedstates dollar). and important difference u whether new zealand would haveany part make decision monetary policy would affect us. in currencyunion, country include union principle say form monetary policy forthe area cover union. all country voice table, even single voiceamong many. in case dollarisation, however, country whose currency adopt makesthe decision monetary policy.the study sir frank holmes arthur grime suggest currency union australia(involving new central bank countries, new currency) could useful benefitsfor new zealand. and suggest currency union, rather new zealand’s adoption theaustralian dollar, largely reason political acceptability new zealand. bi review 42/20002whether approach would meet political acceptability test australia, course, bitdebatable. preliminary comment australia suggest interest whatsoever abandon theaustralian dollar favour new trans-tasman currency. but whether currency union withaustralia, simple adoption australian dollar new zealand, outcome would insubstance similar. with exception get seigniorage income, i willcomment moment, option would involve new zealand’s relinquish effective controlover monetary policy new zealand.in case unite state dollar, currency union even raise possible option.the possibility case would involve new zealand’s adopt unite state dollar. andthat too, course, would mean relinquish control monetary policy. since theterm “currency union” widely use new zealand include currency union asproperly understand simple process adopt another country’s currency, i mostpart use term “currency union” balance comments, recognise allpractical purpose talk “dollarisation”, “australian dollarisation” “usdollarisation”.some myth currency unionbefore i comment economic advantage disadvantage currency union, mightbe helpful dispose myth become rather prevalent.the first myth reserve bank oppose currency union, perhaps “don brashwould lose job”. certainly, “dollarised”, use either australian dollar u dollar,there would need anybody employ reserve bank new zealand thosenow employ bank would lose jobs. if go currency union, presumably withaustralia, also likely many exist reserve bank staff would lose job (though i mustadmit european precedent perhaps suggest job loss would great thatsituation!). but i assure neither reserve bank don brash oppose currencyunion. nor promote currency union. a indicate moment ago, bank’s responsibility isto advise minister economic implication currency union, pro cons, andto foster inform public discussion issue.the second myth small country way vulnerable owncurrencies modern world. this sometimes express term metaphor tiny rowingboat, toss around turbulent ocean, turbulence arise vast flow capitalwhich every day wash backwards forward click mouse. but extremelysuccessful small country currency - singapore switzerland spring immediatelyto mind - and, contrary popular mythology, new zealand dollar particularly volatilecurrency.not particularly volatile currency? no. the reserve bank look issue term ofshort-term volatility term big exchange rate swing are, i suspect, rather greaterconcern.looking short-term volatility (measured 30 day volatility unite state dollar), thenew zealand dollar volatile australian dollar, british pound, japanese yen,and german mark time float march 1985 august 1988. but ofthe period since september 1988, indeed average whole 12 year period, newzealand dollar somewhat le volatile currencies.looking big exchange rate swing make life difficult exporter competingwith import stage last decade, compare size exchange rateappreciation trough peak currencies. we find maximumappreciation new zealand dollar experience decade (measured aninflation-adjusted, trade-weighted, basis) was, sure, 29 per cent rather great thatexperienced australian dollar (at 20 per cent), closely similar maximumtrough-to-peak appreciation experience german mark (27 per cent), unite state dollar 3bis review 42/2000(also 27 per cent) british pound (31 per cent), substantially small thatexperienced japanese yen (62 per cent). in words, i indicate occasionsand contrary much current mythology, big exchange rate swing experience newzealand dollar ninety least unusual standard currencies.this suggest rather unambiguously that, currency union would eliminate nominal exchange rateuncertainty new zealand trader trade within currency union, currency wecould adopt would eliminate big exchange rate swing country outside currencyunion. and since new zealand’s trade australia amount little 20 per cent thetotal, currency union australia would still leave exporter face currencyuncertainty. in words, currency union australia would buy nominal exchange rate certaintyfor handle little 20 per cent trade (perhaps especially themanufacturing sector), leave handle 80 per cent trade still face suchuncertainty.and i say currency union would buy trader “nominal exchange rate certainty” make clearthat currency union would buy anybody real exchange rate certainty, words, certaintyof constant exchange rate inflation take account. this something hongkong discover years. although currency tightly tie theus dollar since early eighties, real, inflation-adjusted, exchange rate appreciate quitestrongly, u dollar appreciate currency hongkong’s inflation rate markedly high unite states. this lead thesteady erosion competitive position hong kong’s manufacture sector, indeed beenone factor lead move manufacture hong kong southern china.the third myth currency union australia would greatly increase competition newzealand bank sector, everybody’s benefit. i find hard see might casegiven large australian bank already actively involve new zealand market.moreover, new zealand already open contestable bank sector. there regulatoryobstacles foreign bank enter new zealand, provide meet certain minimum qualitativecriteria. it clearly necessary enter currency union order derive benefit foreigncompetition bank sector. in regard, i strike figure release kpmg earlierthis month, suggest net interest margin earn major bank new zealandhas fall steadily recent years, markedly low net interest marginearned australian u banks.1the fourth myth currency union australia would somehow suddenly enable newzealand economy grow quickly australian economy, enable new zealander beinstantly richer. that perception appear drive quite lot public comment matter. butof course nonsense. the fundamental driver live standard new zealand rate atwhich improve productivity. currency union may modest bear productivityperformance, i argue moment, fundamentally productivity quality oureducation system, quality new zealand management, incentive provide tax andbenefit system work acquire skills, attitude work leisure, pace innovation, soon. currency union would little effect matters. currency union within australia itselfhas certainly guarantee economic growth tasmania south australia match inqueensland - currency union within new zealand guarantee southland willenjoy auckland growth rates. and panama’s adoption u dollar 1904 enabledpanama perform well u economy. other factors, policies, much moreimportant long-term growth whether part currency union.and final myth argument that, country form currency unions, ordollarising, new zealand same. but reason country forming1financial institution performance survey 2000, kpmg. bi review 42/20004currency union dollarising little relevance new zealand. the country theeuropean monetary union form currency union, involve new central bank new currency,in situation intra-union trade flow high proportion trade membercountries (certainly much high proportion new zealand/australia situation), wherecurrency union simply one part much wide agenda political, economic, andregulatory integration. the country latin america have, cases, lock theus dollar, case think full u dollarisation, decade extremely poormoney management hyper-inflation. neither situation relevance new zealand.moreover, last year large number countries, particularly exclusively asia,have move away tie currency tightly currency, favour floatingexchange rate. certainly generalise international move towards currency unionor dollarisation.the real economic pro con currency unionbut valid argument currency union might economic advantages.to begin with, currency union seem certain reduce transaction cost incur tradersand traveller exchange new zealand dollar currencies. this would probably producea huge save currency union australia - although would worthwhile benefit fortourists direction - but, much international trade conduct u dollars, thesavings would rather great adopt u dollar currency.second, currency union australia might reduce average new zealand interest rate little. overthe last decade so, australian long-term interest rate pretty similar newzealand, much period (though currently) australia’s short-term interest rate wereappreciably low new zealand. adopt u dollar would currently reduce interestrates new zealand rather more. although difference much le adecade ago, u interest rate currently low across entire range maturity innew zealand. by adopt either australian dollar u dollar, would avoid need topay currency risk premium saver currently demand hold new zealand dollar assets.(there could well on-going difference interest rate new zealand one hand andaustralia unite state other, course, arise credit liquidity risks, thedifferences would small currently.)but also case currency union would remove chance new zealand interest ratesfalling australia (or unite states, u dollar adopted). while itmight seem unlikely new zealand interest rate would ever fall australia theunited states, worth recall new zealand’s long-term interest rate somewhat lowerthan australia first half ninety slightly low unitedstates time 1994; interest rate canada, singapore, switzerland theeuropean monetary union unite state today.the main reason new zealand interest rate high last decade throughmuch period cop hang-over high inflationary expectations,especially property market, result two three decade high inflation bingeing. theunited state high interest rate early eighties, grapple high inflationaryexpectations. if new zealand continue keep inflation well control, continue maintainthe confidence financial market follow prudent fiscal policy, seem entirely reasonableto expect time new zealand interest rate could fall australia theunited states. in form currency union, would effect bet that, matter whomwe form currency union, policy performance would good could havebeen indefinite future.third, currency union, australia single country, would eliminate theexchange rate uncertainty new zealand exporter face, would clearly eliminate nominalexchange rate uncertainty trade country country form part currency union 5bis review 42/2000(and probably reduce real exchange rate uncertainty also). a indicate earlier, currency unionwith australia would eliminate nominal exchange rate uncertainty relatively small part ofour total trade, quite important part trade qualitative sense. a much large part ofour manufacture export go australia single destination, australianmarket particularly important “testing ground” small company get thebusiness exporting.as result reduction exchange rate uncertainty within currency union, seem verylikely currency union would stimulate trade part currency union. empiricalresearch effect currency uncertainty trade is, unfortunately, conclusive, withsome study suggest effect currency uncertainty actually pretty small otherssuggesting quite significant. my rather subjective view currency unionwould indeed increase trade new zealand part union, seem bethe view business community also. if correct, currency union, australia theunited states, would stimulate trade within currency union, extent could produce someworthwhile productivity gains, new zealand producer move area great comparativeadvantage. this probably particularly true currency union unite states. there isalready substantial trans-tasman trade, reason arguably le scope increase itthrough creation currency union.on side ledger, would one potentially major one minor disadvantageof currency union.the potentially major disadvantage would loss independent monetary policy, henceloss important way moderate demand shock ability influence owninflation rate. and loss would seem apply whether currency union australia theunited states, whether involve creation new central bank (possible case ofaustralia) simply dollarisation. (clearly, event new zealand’s enter formal currencyunion australia, involve new central bank representative country newcurrency, new zealand would say formulation monetary policy, realisticallythat say could ever small voice alongside much large voice australian economy.)views differ important loss would be. but see recent internationalexperience loss substantial sometimes adverse implications. and thoseimplications would potentially significant form currency union theunited state form currency union australia, give broad similaritybetween new zealand australian economies.there seem little doubt fact argentina prolong recession lastfew year major country latin america largely result ofthe fact argentina tightly tie unite state dollar currency boardarrangement. a consequence, argentine currency push upwards, along usdollar, currency many argentina’s trade partners. similarly, hong kong seem tohave prolong recession many asian economy sort reason.(interestingly, ninety trade-weighted real appreciation hong kong dollar, tiedtightly u dollar, much great maximum appreciation new zealand dollarduring nineties.) conversely, seem clear within european monetary union thesmaller economy ireland over-heating rather dramatically recently, monetarypolicy determine new european central bank interest whole currency unionalmost certainly easy small economies. while may create prosperity theshort-term, may create considerable difficulty road.i well recall mid-nineties, common complaint i encounter speak audiencesoutside auckland suffer high real interest rate rise real exchangerate even though inflation (so least claimed!) areas, inflationbeing confine auckland. even claim true, reality part newzealand form then, still form, currency union, room one interest ratestructure one exchange rate within currency union. be join australia currency bi review 42/20006union, interest rate exchange rate face would influence common centralbank (in case genuine currency union), reserve bank australia (in case ofaustralian dollarisation). in practice, would need australian economy woulddominate monetary policy decision either case. and course, adopt u dollar wouldmean accept whatever monetary policy seem appropriate u economy.this would probably tend increase magnitude new zealand business cycles, thevariability new zealand’s inflation rate. with ability use new zealand monetary policy todeal cycles, would necessary use fiscal policy actively, encourage moreflexibility, down, price wages, moderate cycles.the minor disadvantage dollarising, point i need make distinction betweendollarising form currency union new currency establish countriesforming part union, would loss central banker call seigniorage income. this isthe income central bank generate issue little piece paper, case little piecesof plastic, call money. what happen issue little piece plastic inexchange good value, invest value government security go marketinterest rate. the interest income earn call seigniorage income, new zealand amountsto $130 million year (a currency issue little $2 billion, invest governmentsecurities yield somewhat 6 per cent per annum). if join currency union modelledon european monetary union, would retain share seigniorage income appropriate toour relative size new currency union. but simply adopt australian dollar theus dollar, likely would lose benefit income country whose currencywe adopted. not huge loss perhaps, $130 million year, grow gradually, begiven away without thought!how weight pro cons?as i indicate commencement comments, join currency union, adopt thecurrency another country, potentially important implication go well beyond economicissues. but even focus economic issues, weight various pro con easy.it sober note canada, country almost 80 per cent trade unitedstates, nevertheless choose retain currency. and recent article senior economist atthe bank canada argue that, give way canada’s term trade behave relative tothose unite states, separate canadian currency much canada’s nationalinterest.2it seem clear survey conduct holmes/grimes study national bank newzealand substantial majority new zealand business community - least asubstantial majority respond survey - favour currency union withaustralia.but i entirely sure make strong support currency union withaustralia. of course business favour le currency uncertainty. i suspect businesscommunity ask favour low taxation would also register stronglyfavourable reaction. the real question whether le currency uncertainty would helpful butwhether le currency uncertainty would compensate cost currency union, therisks great variability output domestic inflation. and answer question muchless clear.to illustrate, let’s suppose sharp fall new zealand export prices. with currency,this quite likely lead fall new zealand dollar, second half 1997 and2murray, john (1999), “why canada need flexible exchange rate”, bank canada work paper 99-12. 7bis review 42/20001998. this

ourown currency, hand, increase risk fall new zealand export pricesleads fall (new) currency, exporter suffer full pain fall ininternational prices, may well force lay staff reduce output. that indirecteffect, course, rest country, closely associate exportindustries may relatively little affected.in final analysis, choice exchange rate regime mainly choice nature thepain prefer experience consequence international shocks. it provide anopportunity escape pain inevitably cause shocks.conclusionit would nice conclude comment today clear conclusion, on-balance judgement.i don’t propose that, partly decision currency regime is, i indicated,finally matter elect politician central bankers, partly even economicpros con point clear conclusion.moreover, may well appropriate widen range option somewhat, think morelaterally reach conclusion all. for example, might possible negotiate acomprehensive free trade agreement unite state part package involve adoptionof u dollar surrender relevant seigniorage income? lose seigniorage incomemight well worthwhile concession return free trade agreement us.clearly, lot potential options. there little doubt issue matter forpublic discussion

productivity, national economy successfullyprepared take advantage rapid globalization characterize current economicexpansion.while private decision rightly deserve primacy discussion current economic climate,they take backdrop important policy decisions. i believe productivityincrease might occur policy adjustment make start thelate 1970s continue even today. furthermore, open many nations’

economic progress possible thatdoes make obsolete method practice earlier, le efficient economy? in 1950book capitalism, socialism, democracy, economist joseph schumpeter describe capitalism asystem “that incessantly revolutionize economic structure within, incessantly destroy theold one, incessantly create new one.” schumpeter saw economy continually bounce fromone growth path another, time remake themselves. he coin phrase “creativedestruction” describe process.simply put, economy constantly competitive pressure re-invent themselves. a theymove toward high level productivity, necessarily make production technologiesobsolete. schumpeter caution economic policymakers fail appreciate relationshipbetween relentless churn competitive environment wealth creation end upfocusing

challenging.beginning evaluation recent financial crises, i concentrate growingimportance globalization process challenge bring globalization.i.developments international financial environmentthe 1980s 1990s witness significant change international financial markets.with advent globalization rapid integration financial markets, world live isgetting small every aspect life. nowadays, international bank system areexperiencing significant changes, bank discuss global level. therefore, theglobal standpoint, seem important bank system size, level ofcompliance internationally accept rule standards, functionality.in today’s financial environment, dominate dynamic, aggressive financial service industry,banks major player operate great freedom. market participants, however, expose

non-bank financial institutions,institutional investor company good manage risk use complex hedge strategies.ii.globalizationin part speech, i concentrate opportunity challenge bring byglobalization.(a)opportunities challengeswe define globalization integrate financial markets, economy trade, high factormobility, spectacular change information technology lead spread knowledge bi review 79/20002throughout world. i, personally, consider globalization beneficial challenging,inevitable, irreversible process world economy international financial system.globalization liberalization financial market bring variety changes, presentingopportunities well risk economy financial system throughout world. one factis quite clear: undeniable benefit globalization available country bestmanage economies.(1)one obvious benefit globalization active international capital flow improve theefficiency allocation world financial resources. a world market economy hasbecome globalized, witness rapid growth world trade, lead higherstandard live 1980s 1990s. in plain language, competition, productivitygains, low trade barrier low cost external finance worldwide basis thekey factor lead growth world trade rise standard living.(2)globalization also increase enhance competition worldwide. there severalfactors behind consequence.(a)firstly, integration world market rapid technological change lead toefficiency gain growth drive low transaction information costs.these turn increase competition low cost high marketefficiency, high productivity, low barrier entry, new investmentopportunities. geographic distance long factor limit provision ofgoods services.hence, competition industrialize develop country hasreached almost level. at point, worth note manydeveloping countries, particularly emerge market economies, activelyparticipated world trade global economy last two decades. thepresence emerge market countries, particularly asian economies, isgrowing, share world trade increase significantly.(b)secondly, importance non-bank financial institution financialintermediation process increased. the main example institution aresecurities firms, insurance company mutual funds.therefore, say high level international competition, thehigher economic growth, high income level, high quality ofproducts thus high live standard globalization process wouldbring.(3)globalization reorganize concept stabilization, risk-taking, supervision andregulation bank systems, market discipline, public guaranty deposit moralhazard.as i mention earlier, parallel development new financial instrument marketsand resultant complex dynamic transactions, risk measurement riskmanagement technique change dramatically. financial institution increasinglybeen use internal rat risk measurement system model var,stress back testing, scenario analysis.as result developments, every trade institution, include central banks, hasbecome expose change world economy financial markets.indeed, recent asian financial crisis reveal financial economic stability ofemerging market economy extremely vital global financial economic stability.(4)banking business bank transaction become complex. development off-balance sheet transaction derivative market enormous impact banks’balance sheet structure, level variety risk exposed. base thesedevelopments, importance derivative instrument banks’ risk profile increased. 3bis review 79/2000(b)risks arise globalizationif evaluate risk arise globalization, realize loser well winner inthe process globalization.it well-known fact process globalization evolve equally worldwide. somecountries obtain great benefit process, mainly drive rapid integration globaleconomy relative countries. in words, integrate global economy guaranteethat benefit globalization share country involve process.more importantly, opportunity provide globalization process always beneficial, asshown recent crises. hence, process globalization always carry social, economic,financial, cultural even political risk addition risk contagion.there several reason situation. some beyond control countriesinvolved external shock unexpected change external environment. indeed, mostof reason due to:• weak macroeconomic financial policy implied;• inconsistency domestic policies;• increase vulnerability national economy external shocks;• high international capital mobility (ie high sensitivity international capital flowsamong economies);• high volatility exchange rate due integrate financial markets, hit real sectorsof economies.as countries’ economy become vulnerable external changes, expose shock andcrises severe consequence financial real sectors, well face heavy social costs.in context, i would like emphasize importance risk contagion highly integratedglobal financial environment. a experienced, instability emerge one country canspread almost instantly countries. there doubt every country face ownchallenges directly affect particular economic social conditions.positions take one country hedge another so-called proxy hedge ofcountry risk spread shock crisis across national borders. a result this, even country withno direct exposure country crisis could find deep trouble. in fact, recentcrises east asia russia remind u rapidly compellingly financial crisis canerupt.at point, i would like briefly discus progress turkey, particularly turkish bankingsector globalization process.during last two decades, bank sector, play prominent role turkish financialsystem, make significant progress implement structural change towards financiallyliberalized turkish economy. combine effect restructure turkish economy theefforts integration modern world finance, turkish bank achieve importantchanges institutional structure one hand, quality service product onthe other.in outward-oriented closely supervise bank environment, need highlyqualified manager specialize personnel obvious. with mind, turkish bank becamemore effective utilization human resources. the number university graduate andpostgraduates bank sector steadily increase last two decades, level ofprofessional training.the increase number bank qualify personnel, turn, enhance competition andcontributed broad utilization new financial instrument techniques. furthermore, bankswere motivate attain dynamic structure automation. during last decade, turkish bi review 79/20004banks become automate efficient, along foreign counterparts. for example, thenumber atm turkey increase zero 8,000 last decade. intensecompetition desire integrate global financial market drive bank improve thequality variety service information technology international payment systems.as result this, turkish bank start provide interactive bank service decrease theircosts increase efficiency bank transactions. they also part electronic fundtransfer system internal bank transaction s.w.i.f.t. external transactions.parallel process liberalize economy, turkish bank make significant progress ininvestments organization abroad. they open branch abroad take important step toincrease share international market acquire financial participation partnerships.as june 2000, turkish bank sector, include branch abroad, operate total asset sizeof usd 140.4 billion, 8,000 branch almost 170,000 personnel.the turkish bank sector also open international competition. at present 25 foreign banks,including development investment banks, constitute 31% total number bank thesector. the share foreign bank also increase past years. while share was5.8% 5.6% end 1997 1998 respectively, increase 6.7% june 2000,representing total asset size usd 9.4 billion. the majority share belong foreigncommercial banks.as july 2000, turkish bank have:• 83 financial subsidiary 24 different countries;• 41 branch 10 different countries; and• 62 foreign representative office 10 countries.at present, turkish bank sector

economy. 5bis review 79/2000the ambitious disinflation program rest three pillars:(i) up-front fiscal adjustment;(ii) firm exchange rate commitment support consistent income policies; and(iii) structural reforms.this program support structural reform four fundamental areas, namely bankingsector, social security agriculture public finance.with awareness fact soundness bank system vital

dramatically past decades. never historyhas situation many people improve much quickly. since begin 1980s,purchasing power per caput world doubled. in poor develop countries, thishas mean purchase

sector.singapore entirely typical region. we small, open economy, half size ofthe swiss economy, heavily reliant foreign trade. we also financial centre asia, andtherefore highly expose disturbance international financial system. so surprisingthat singapore affect asian crisis. our gdp growth plunge 8.4% 1997 0.4%in 1998. retrenchment go sharply. our stock market fell, line regional markets.navigating crisisbut overall singapore le affect region. the bank unshaken, singa-pore company keel over. why case?firstly economic fundamental sound. we pursue pro-business pro-developmenteconomic policy many years, maintain consistently low inflation.5 we keep oureconomy open, take market-oriented approach towards economic development. so4 keynote address, meet good

industry lack competitive advantage, singaporecompanies generally efficient.secondly, government strong financial position. indeed continue register budgetsurplus throughout crisis. we foreign debt, much le short-term debt. foreign exchangereserves comfortable.thirdly, response crisis reduce business cost directly, help business stay viableand preserve jobs. no company bail government; creditor prevail uponto maintain loan fail borrower. instead grant rebate tax government chargesacross board, reduce employers’ monthly contribution employees’ retirement fund –effectively wage cut. fortunately union leader understand gravity crisis, help topersuade worker accept unpalatable prescription. overall measure amount 7% ofgdp. the measures, population’s positive response them, instill confidence amongsingaporeans foreign investors.fourthly, bank sound. even boom years, bank generally prudentand conservative lend policies. also ma supervise bank strictly, require highcapital liquidity standards, insist prompt adequate provision non-performing loans,and frown upon excessive expansion bank loans. so crisis struck, bank stay onan even keel,6 even ma require make large general provision anticipation futurenpls.fifthly, lucky time deflate property bubble early. like several otherasian countries, singapore experience property boom. it start 1993, 3 yearsproperty price doubled. by early 1996, property market become dangerouslyoverheated. the government decide prick bubble. we restrict bank credit cappinghousing loan 80% valuation, impose anti-speculation measures. so time theasian crisis strike year later, property price already declining. the froth skimmedoff. have act 1996, adjustment would painful, bank wouldhave serious problem loans.managing financial sector reformsalthough crisis past, back status quo ante. while asia preoccupy itsproblems, globalisation financial market proceed apace, spur deregulation andtechnology. with internet, market become borderless. banks, insurance firms, nowsecurities exchange face cut-throat competition, go worldwide wave ofmergers consolidation.singapore keep global trend remain sound yet dynamic financial centre. formany years, regulate financial sector tightly. we insist high standard integrityand competence. we seek protect investors, especially retail investors, circumscribe whatthey could allow invest in. we protect local bank stockbroker foreigncompetition, order build dependable singaporean players. we seek minimise riskwherever possible, accept trade le vibrant innovative industry.this approach worked, prove worth crisis. but go forward, long suffices.in new environment, need take bolder, le dirigiste approach. we regulate alight touch, accept calculate risks, give industry room innovate. we need toliberalise allow great competition.we abandon high standard integrity sound financial management havebuilt up. but attitude supervise risk must change.6 before crisis, npls 3% loans. during crisis, npls rise 12%, accountof lend region. 7bis review 76/2000we focus systemic risk rather protect individual firms, prevent riskyproducts reach market. we allow investor judge take business risk forthemselves. we rely market discipline full information disclosure protectinvestors, rather extensive formal informal regulation. we need shift emphasis fromregulation supervision, one-size-fits-all rule oversight tailor characteristic ofindividual institutions.we decide fundamental change policy framework financial sector 1997.we go ahead launch it, storm cloud gathering, saw essentialstrategic shift, independent short-term up down economic fortunes. we felt confident ofweathering storm, although know would turn super hurricane.we decide make phase transition several years, rather single big bang. we hadseen big bang country lead excess problem late road. wecould afford risk, unlike establish financial centre like london. our regulators,financial institutions, investor need time develop new expectation one another, andunderstand new way thing worked. we need manage reform process environmentmade difficult asian crisis, keep system even keel.over last three years, systematically review every part financial industry. wehave free use compulsory save state retirement fund scheme, demutualised andmerged stock future exchanges, deregulate brokerage commissions, open area ofthe financial industry new entrants, take step develop bond market.i focus two specific changes, illustrate trade-off consideration design ourliberalisation programme. the first review policy encourage theinternationalisation singapore dollar. the second decision open domestic marketto foreign banks, give impetus local bank strengthen themselves.singapore dollar non-internationalisation policywe long maintain explicit policy encourage internationalisation singaporedollar. be small vulnerable, especially wary large volatile capital flowsdistorting exchange rate, thus damage real economy. our international trade 3 timesour gdp, high country world. if exchange rate move like thejapanese yen u dollar, would deep trouble.singapore capital exchange controls. anyone move fund freely

non-internationalisation policy, virtually complete capital mobility singapore.empirical study show domestic s$ interest rate almost entirely determine paritywith offshore u dollar interest rates, adjust future exchange rate expectations. in economist’sjargon, “interest parity condition” holds.the role hedge fund asian crisis controversial. there evidence hedge fundswere active number regional

excessive volatility unstable period. of course policy could nothave effective singapore’s economic fundamental sound, hada float exchange rate could manage flexibly line fundamentals. we aneasier ride hong kong, also sound economy, whose currency was, goodreasons, peg u dollar. bi review 76/20008going forward, intend maintain non-internationalisation policy, periodically review itsscope implementation. in early phase development financial centre, internationaland regional business service singapore could conduct u dollars. but financialcentre matured, capital market become comprehensive integrated, foreign playersincreasingly want issue s$ debt equity, hedge position use s$ swap andrepurchase agreements. at time, singapore economy foreign reserve havegrown, confidence

otherwise tempt try luck.banking liberalisationthe second example measure liberalisation approach open retail bankingsector, simultaneous step help strengthen local singapore banks.our start position different countries. foreign bank (mostly british) dominate thesingapore bank system gain independence. for three decades, government hasprotected local banks, especially retail business, enable expand market share.we believe strong well-managed local banks, significant share home market,were critical resilience stability financial system. we want sure acrisis, could count major institution whose long term interest align singaporeeconomy. we still hold view.like bank asian countries, local bank start family banks, still runby control shareholders. but strict supervision enable grow sound, well-capitalised institutions, free problem improper imprudent lend relate companies.by asian standards, local bank exceptionally well run. but compare bestinternational banks, lag many areas: size, technology, expertise, range quality ofservice, shareholders’ returns.we could afford let singapore bank fall behind, deprive rest economy world-class financial services. in case, globalisation cross-border competition, aprotectionist policy become le le tenable.therefore move last year open singapore market foreign banks. we hopedthat would spur efficiency innovation among local banks, push well-run bank seekscale expand home abroad. we convince unless open up, thistransformation would never take place. there substitute real competition.we want liberalisation weaken bank destabilise financial system. so arenot take big bang, laissez faire approach. instead, phase liberalisation five years,and open market financially strong, commit foreign players.at time, motivate local bank strengthen themselves. we raiseddisclosure standard international norms, require bank publish detail non-performing loan inner reserves, previously closely guard secrets.we also raise corporate governance standards, lie heart improvementsrequired asian bank systems. we institute nominate committee bank boards, comprisinga majority independent directors. their remit ensure person appoint board 9bis review 76/2000to key executive position select expertise, ability contribute bankand interest shareholders.most important all, require bank group make clear separation theirfinancial non-financial businesses. the bank divest control non-financialactivities, remove cross-shareholdings. this help ensure transaction non-financial entity remain arm length, interest bank confuse otherinterests control shareholder, management attention stay focus theincreasingly complex business banking.if programme works, hope singapore bank grow become strong regionalplayers. of course, success cannot guaranteed. if local bank lose much ground, ouranchor player may end marginalised, take over. still resolve proceed,knowing nothing would certainly lead u difficulty.the local bank strengthen compete open domestic market, andinternationally. we encourage merge consolidate one another, least toform alliance consolidate back-end operations, derive economy scale.but industry trend may even enough hold thelarge global banks. after all, even deutsche bank big feel need merger partner.local bank want niche player may need contemplate foreignacquisitions, cross-border partnership partner large large themselves.the small european country wrestle issue. in scandinavia beneluxcountries, press need economy scale force major bank look beyond theirdomestic market partnerships, cross-border merger common.in singapore, thing already happen telecommunication industry. the govern-ment decide allow, indeed encourage, dominant local player like singapore telecom togo beyond foreign acquisitions, seek foreign mergers. a singapore bank increasingly confront thesame imperative, consider exactly far will trade retain fewsingaporean-controlled bank logic globalisation.conclusionthe asian crisis lead rethink consensus favour globalisation free capital flows.the result reaffirm logic globalisation, value free market free trade.but also cause sober

reservebank new york, eleventh international conference bank supervisors, hold inbasel, 20-21 september 2000.* * *i greatly honor chairman basel committee bank supervision. i’d liketo begin thank swiss national bank, kurt hauri swiss federal bankingcommission, andrew crockett bi organize host important conference.they’ve do wonderful job, i know we’re grateful.it also great pleasure dramatically different circumstance welast gather together. just two year ago, turbulence financial market around world hadaffected, one way another, bank system virtually every nation, bank supervisorswere struggle preserve confidence stability. today, course, global financial situation ismuch stable outlook favorable.in unite states, continue enjoy long economic expansion nation’s history, and,following passage financial modernization legislation, bank financial institution nowenjoy unprecedented strategic opportunities.in europe, follow monetary union january 1999, bank industry, along othercorporate sectors, become efficient competitive economic political reform havesharpened focus shareholder value.in asia, many emerge market economies, meaningful headway make towardrecapitalizing bank systems, rid banks’ balance sheet problem assets, improvingsupervisory regulatory frameworks. a result, economy grow again, equity marketshave rebounded, foreign capital begin return. what difference two year hard work canmake.when i last address conference october 1998, i say bank supervisor specialrole maintain financial stability, special role two components: facilitate theresolution problem occur, take necessary step low risk problemsoccurring. two year ago busy first component – crisis management resolution.today, stand threshold new century, opportunity focus second– prevention.with mind, view great challenge long-term goal financial stability,both locally globally, accelerate pace change financial innovation, drive thesteady march technological advancement. to sure, rapid change create unprecedentedopportunities producer consumer financial product services. but must also beacknowledged remarkable progress come new, complex potentially far-reaching risks.i’d like begin address profound impact today’s technology bank financialmarkets, move implication impact effective supervision twenty-firstcentury. on subject official supervision, i discus basel committee’s core principlesfor effective supervision, conclude update committee’s major initiative torevise refine 1988 capital accord. bi review 75/20002technology change world, bank supervisionit’s say information power. whoever say surely never deal flood ofe-mail u receive day. indeed, increase frequency, complaint nowadays isabout “information overload.” with wireless communication enable u conduct businessanytime, anywhere, i sometimes feel, i’m sure many do, matter i theworld, i’m expect awake working.for occasionally feel overwhelm technology’s marvels, it’s worth remember thatthere time, long ago, reliable market information decidedly scarce andconcentrated hand privilege few. the rothschild build international bank empireon wing carrier pigeons, whose message enable brother buy sell informationabout investment opportunity financial disaster distant place long competitorsheard news.today, information kind transmit easily, inexpensively instantaneously around theworld, provide finger-tip access anyone laptop computer, cellular phone palm pilot. asbut one example, i’d mention that, last month, popular item federal reserve’spublic web site – include statistical report foreign exchange rates, select interest rates,consumer credit industrial production, along press release federal open marketcommittee announcement – accessible wireless remote.if information power, surely is, profound irreversible transfer power isunderway global financial marketplace – provider product service consumers.for example, internet – something u never hear five year ago – change howconsumers shop financial product services, price pay, provider theyestablish relationships.in response, financial institutions, view technology mainly cost center, see theinternet technological capacity strategic tool enhance value customerrelationship cross-selling improve customization. a recent survey bank manager inthe unite state report that, first time, investment internet technology cite thetop budgetary priority, ahead item investment call-centers brick-and-mortarbranches.the grow importance internet distribution channel also erode traditional barriersbetween financial service provider technology firms. bank increasingly providingtechnology services, account reconciliation software “web-enabling” assistance, whiletechnology firm make inroad service domain bank brokerage firms, suchas financial plan bill payment. indeed, many bank begin think technology firmsas competitor – contemplate way partner them.i’d guess us, perhaps even us, consider advancement compute andinformation technologies, role development ever-more sophisticate financialinstruments techniques, decidedly positive developments. such technologies, theinnovation enable, reduce cost financial transactions, improve allocation offinancial resources, increase competitiveness efficiency financial institution markets,and open new avenue individual institution good diversify hedgetheir risks.but progress also come new difficult challenges. the rapid pace technologicaladvancement financial innovation introduce new, highly complex element risk, increasedthe speed volatility markets, blur barrier previously distinct sector ofthe financial marketplace.even supervisor confront change, fundamental question remain same. where risk inbanks’ activities, effectively manage it? where bank extend credit inwhat form? who banks’ customers, customer changing? to extent arecredit risk transform liquidity operational risks? 3bis review 75/2000the difference today timeframe answer fundamental question dramaticallyshortened. a supervisors, must able look rapidly change financial institution assesswhether strategy make sense whether effectively evaluate risk associatedwith execute strategies.technology innovation also render geographic boundary meaningless, andundermined power control financial authorities. a know, one principal mean ofsupervising internationally active bank process whereby host supervisor approve theestablishment brick-and-mortar presence country jurisdiction. by way web-basedplatform, bank target customer far beyond reach typical branch, even crossborders country local office may never conduct businessbefore. we’ve already see case bank charter one country, handle dataprocessing another, target customer still others. such situation surely challengetraditional notion “home” “host” supervisor, raise difficult issue regard internationalcoordination cooperation, information sharing, law enforcement privacy.in world instantaneous communication, interconnect markets, complex instrumentsand risks, effective supervision important ever maintain financial stability, bothlocally globally. to remain effective relevant, supervisor must understand whatextent “wired” economy technology change bank finance. at sametime, must take care effort ensure safe sound operation financial marketsdo stifle innovation creative energy change bank finance – indeed, theworld – better.with think mind, firm conviction successfully meet challenge thetwenty-first century, notion supervision, broadly speaking, must evolve include financialinstitutions discipline apply marketplace.supervision twenty-first centuryand purpose supervision twenty-first century? what objectives, andhow objective best pursued?let say first easy single answer questions. the twenty-first centuryfinancial marketplace dynamic, complex, supervisor must work within politicalrealities respective nations. what i envision flexible, multi-faceted strategy emphasizesprudence problem prevention, compatibility market, close cooperative workingrelationship private public sector.with priority mind, i believe three essential element modern supervisionframework:• effective bank-level management;• market discipline; and,• official supervision.let discus turn, note reinforce others effectivelypromote safe sound financial system.effective bank-level managementprimary responsibility safe sound operation bank institution lie board ofdirectors senior management. board director oversee development overallstrategy organization decision make senior management pursuit strategicobjectives. in effectively execute responsibilities, board make critical contribution thelong-term success institution. this fundamental principal bank changedwith technological advancement. indeed, anything, great complexity sophistication bi review 75/20004modern financial service firm require energy, effort expertise director everbefore.i see two area board operation particularly crucial. first, bank financialinstitutions must ensure specific skill competencies, consistent institution’s strategicfocus, represent boards. institution engage complex credit market activities,utilize sophisticate financial products, expand internet e-commerce capabilities, shouldinclude one board director pertinent expertise areas.second, board establish clear guideline regard independence directors.generally, desirable least directors, perhaps majority, independent andfrom outside rank management institution. further, board set parametersregarding point, circumstances, director’s outside business interest become sosignificant raise question possible conflict.serious measure ensure relevant competency independence greatly enhance boards’effectiveness go long way toward ensure perform increasingly critical role inoverseeing decision senior management.the role senior management, turn, set business strategy, oversee day-to-day decisionsmade within organization, ensure consistency long-term objective policy asdetermined board.there several aspect effective bank-level management. first, i would underscore theimportance good corporate governance, basic element include:• independent competent outside directors, i mention moment ago;• capable experience management;• a coherent corporate strategy business plan; and,• clear line responsibility accountability.together, element contribute overall operate process conducive long-term health andprosperity. a tightly run ship discipline crew lead experience competent cadre ofofficers far good able survive long journey inevitably confront sudden storms.closely relate good corporate governance critical bank institution’s well-being arigorous internal control apparatus. of course, effective internal control system always beencentrally important sound banking. this point become clear consider moment theirbasic purposes:• to provide reasonable assurance bank’s customers’ asset safeguarded,that information timely reliable, error irregularity discoveredand correct promptly;• to promote bank’s operational efficiency; and,• to ensure compliance managerial policies, laws, regulation sound fiduciaryprinciples.with purpose mind, clear long-term success bank organizationdepends effectiveness internal control apparatus.and never true today. a activity commercial bank becomeincreasingly diverse complex, internal control become critically important sound andsuccessful execution banks’ strategic objectives.i want stress point strongly i can. a former commercial banker myself, i know isa powerful temptation management focus attention resource front office – thoseareas individual generate profit institution. but something go wrong backoffice, quickly become important aspect bank’s operations. we’ve see time 5bis review 75/2000and time again. it essential sufficient resources, staff managerial attention devote theback office internal audit functions.firmly root foundation good corporate governance rigorous internal control thecentral importance effective risk management. bank nature business takingcalculated risks. if didn’t take risks, bank could perform essential function marketeconomy. but sound bank also entail prudent management unavoidable risks. eachbanking institution must place technical system management process necessary toidentify risk associate activity – lend otherwise – effectively measure,monitor control risks.but even institution effective risk management control structure place, structuremust also accompany institutional management culture ensure write policiesand procedure actually translate practice, buy-in staff levels. ultimately, aninstitution's culture determine – – board director senior managementit choose install. management must take active step ensure commitment operatingenvironment include effective risk management rigorous control filter line theorganization.to summarize, aspect effective bank level management – good corporate governance,rigorous internal control effective risk management – represent first important lineof defense potential problems. and increasingly case activity banksand financial institution become complex global.market disciplineafter effective management bank level, second line defense financial instability ismarket discipline, increasingly important ally official supervisor. when arm withtimely meaningful information banks’ performance, market participant can, way theirinvestment credit decisions, encourage bank manager board director manage riskexposures soundly. equally important, market participant penalize institution donot.but, course, effective market discipline possible without meaningful public disclosure. whilesignificant progress make recent years, unfortunately remain case disclosurepractices keep pace rapid change banks’ business activity risk exposures,and exposure measure managed.for situation fully remedied, notion proprietary information bein public domain must change. know company’s appetite risk approach to, andmethodologies for, manage risk essential understand risk shareholder, acreditor counterparty. all financial market participant approach issue disclosure asusers financial statement rather issuers.there little question urgency achieve dramatic progress area. clearly, afull appreciation risk cannot achieve without sufficient information. all u know isno great enemy financial stability loss confidence – nothing undermine confidencemore lack reliable information. discipline impose market might pleasant, butmore, high quality information – word, transparency – bolster confidence depositor andother creditor therefore make business easy secure everyone.of course, progress disclosure front limit account standard enhance toensure proper valuation reflect innovation past decade, term new productsand modern risk management techniques. account system serve variety purposes, nonemore important help creditor investor make rigorous clear-eyed decision towhich enterprise meet market test efficiency, competitiveness profitability necessaryto fulfill obligations. sound account system also enable investor determine value ofenterprises, and, doing, assist attract capital, foreign domestic. with bi review 75/20006important purpose mind, ongoing effort enhance account standard worldwide shouldcontinue even intensify.there also need great harmonization account standard across countries. we simplymust get point supervisor market participant alike analyze compare allinternationally active financial institution consistent basis. and possible haveuniform capital standard achieve consistency account standard acrosscountries. i applaud significant progress

meaningful market discipline crucial element anoverall strategy promote preserve financial stability, neither substitute criticalrole play official supervision. while bank perform function indispensable thesuccess market economy, functions, nature, introduce risk arecapable undermine prospect success.this reality acknowledge adam smith two century ago seminal tract the wealthof nations. and fundamental reality mind government long recognize thatbanking financial institution must subject least form regulation officialoversight.the reason official supervisory intervention bank financial system summedup promote financial stability minimize systemic risk. this broad mandate – ensurethat market operate fair, transparent, efficient manner, participant comply therules game. to successfully fulfill critical responsibility, clear fundamentalapproach, scope methodology official supervision must evolve line way financialinstitutions manage activities, increasingly along business line rather legal entities.with mind, supervisor continue effort develop dynamic, risk-focused andprocess-oriented framework, reflect reality bank financial institution areincreasingly able alter risk profile will. by “risk-focused,” i mean supervisoryresources direct material risk institution capital areexposed, give array business activities. by “process-oriented,” i mean examiner

process subject le intrusive supervision thaninstitutions essential infrastructure place.the core principlesspecific supervisory arrangements, practice technique vary country country dependingon difference culture, financial system structure internal political realities. the diversity ofpractices notwithstanding, set basic principle identify guide supervisor inan increasingly interconnected, global financial marketplace.in 1997 basel committee bank supervision issue set twenty-five core principle foreffective bank supervision serve benchmark effectiveness differentsupervisory regime assessed.the core principle document bring together concisely fundamental element need tocarry effective bank supervision – remarkable achievement right. equally important,in view, document also balance desire set high standard supervisory practice withthe pragmatic recognition country stage financial market development.as such, core principle document particular importance develop market economies, 7bis review 75/2000as establish clear set standard country’s current approach progresscan measured.it emphasize that, attempt craft document would legitimacy, qualityand flexibility meet need bank supervisor around world, committee make aconscious effort consult broadly throughout various stage project, particularly withsupervisors emerge market nations. only inclusive approach could designcomprehensive principle broad applicability support.in october last year, basel committee, cooperation imf world bank,produced follow-up document call core principle methodology. this report initiate inresponse request number country additional guidance interpret andimplement core principles. the methodology document provide specific criterion evaluatingand implement core principle. one set criterion focus issue deem essential theminimum implementation core principles; focus issue deem torepresent “best practice.” the imf world bank currently use new methodology assessthe bank sector individual countries.it stress important effort implement core principle occur inindividual country and, mind, i please say approximately 120 country havenow endorse core principles. without support back national authority followthrough implementation principles, broad effort simply cannot effective.in connection, basel committee long recognize need effective train ofparticipants global supervision community, year sponsor numerousprograms beneficial allow supervisor different country shareexperiences exchange idea improve practices. in 1998, basel committee, along thebank international settlements, jointly establish financial stability institute, conductsleadership seminar supervisor emerge market country facilitate technical assistance.effort revise basel accordlet move basel committee’s initiative revise 1988 capital accord. a wellknow, capital been, continue be, important supervisory tool.since 1988, capital regulation evolve around set minimum ratio devise thebasel committee bank supervision set forth document know basel accord.the accord was, without question, milestone achievement – first time, supervisor ableto use common yardstick assess banks’ capital adequacy. the development risk-basedcapital ratio help strengthen capital standard 100 country adopt theaccord.in recent years, however, accord exhibit serious shortcoming. one significant weakness isthat accord’s broad brush structure may provide bank unintended incentive take onhigher risk exposure without require hold commensurate amount capital. it also notkept pace innovation way bank measure, manage mitigate risk.with concern mind, june 1999 basel committee release consultative paper anew capital adequacy framework. while know paper would represent perfect frameworkfor banks, aim release credible package would serve basis discussion. weactively seek feedback industry worldwide formal comment period endedon 31 march year, continue dialogue.i note please encourage 200

made, clear committee well position tocontinue momentum release revise consultative paper early next year.internal ratings-based approachthe centerpiece new accord likely internal ratings-based approach credit risk. weenvision internal rat method applicable institution placestrong internal rat system accompany robust internal controls. naturally, new standardswill also encompass guidance supervisory oversight provide ample disclosure.the committee look establish standard rigorous yet permit institution will tomake necessary investment use approach. i think fair say committeenow expect many sophisticate institution seek use internal ratings-based approach.how internal ratings-based approach work? simply described, three component tothe internal ratings-based approach develop committee. first, bank would assigneach loan exposure internal grade, reflect risk associate lend eachborrower. a bank would use expert judgment senior lender well-definedinternal rat scale criteria. the bank would ass likelihood default borrower ineach internal grade, base analysis. many large bank now. it thisassessment probability default core internal ratings-based approach.the second step bank ass severity loss loan default – often referredto loss give default. the committee currently envision two internal ratings-basedapproaches, foundation approach advance approach even high minimum standards. akey distinction foundation approach, bank would use supervisory estimate loss-given-default base loan characteristics, advance approach, could make useof analysis.the third step derive bank’s capital requirement. the committee set risk weightsthat correspond different estimate probability default loss-given-default. these riskweights develop committee measure unexpected loss, reflect amountof potential credit loss loan.a key aspect internal ratings-based approach development rigorous supervisorystandards assignment quantification internal ratings. an essential component thesestandards so-called “use test” require system internal rat integral part abank’s risk management assessment capital adequacy. the internal reliance riskratings help supervisor gain confidence accuracy bank’s rat system, butwill also provide key link propose second pillar accord, supervisory review.other work minimum capital requirementswhile focus remark internal ratings-based approach, committee also isworking key aspect new framework, include revise standardize approach,developing expand treatment credit risk mitigation technique assess capital chargefor operational risk. 9bis review 75/2000standardized approachthe basel committee remain dedicate revise standardize approach bank andsupervisors country may yet necessary resource implement internalratings-based method. to improve risk sensitivity standardize approach, committeesought establish capital requirement recognize difference probability defaultbetween borrowers. at time, committee seek attentive view manybankers supervisor want standardize approach remain simple bank allsizes level sophistication could implement it. it consequently propose use externalcredit assessments, credit ratings, mean help assign risk weights, hencecapital charges, claims.we please whole respondent agree goal increase sensitivity ofthe standardize approach credit risk. nonetheless, give difficulty achieve rightbalance sensitivity simplicity, proposal base standardize approach externalcredit rat agencies’ rat raise real concerns. some note that, especially emergingmarket countries, borrower credit ratings, new framework might beable differentiate credit risk substantially borrowers. some also raise question theperformance record rat agencies, particularly context various regional financialcrises around world.unfortunately, alternative suggest comment period. still, remain open tofresh idea work hard address concern noted. for example, explore useof indicator borrower’s credit quality differentiate

whether would feasible incorporate additional risk weights, particularlyfor corporate claim risky asset hold banks. align capital charge thestandardized approach closely economic risk retain relative

thiessen, governor bank canada, calgary chamber ofcommerce, calgary, 14 september 2000.* * *today, i would like bring date bank canada’s view outlook thecanadian economy. prospect period ahead generally favourable. but, often thecase, also uncertainty bank deal pursue objective ofkeeping economy sustainable, non-inflationary track. deal uncertainty presentsa constant challenge bank job conduct monetary policy.another part job involve always look way enhance effectiveness policy - byreducing uncertainty actions, increase transparency accountability, bybroadening public awareness monetary policy works. today, i want outline newprocedures announce change official interest rate plan introduce late autumn.we believe procedure help improve effectiveness monetary policy canada.but first let give update current economic situation.economic updatethe canadian economy expand strongly time now, particularly sincemid-1999. indeed, mid-1999 mid-2000, grow 5¼%.through much 12-month period, economic growth outstrip expectations. in part, beattributed spillover greater-than-anticipated demand unite states.the rapid growth american economy confound observer quite time now.and, might expected, buoyant u demand press economy’s capacity toproduce. one safety valve help relieve pressure u capacity inflowof good service abroad.canada’s export industry benefit greatly spillover excess demand theunited states. not export contribute directly rapid economic expansion incanada, source encouragement add surge purchase ofmachinery equipment canadian businesses. and, course, recent gain employmentand income export sector strengthen momentum spend canadianhouseholds.together, buoyant exports, strong investment domestic businesses, robust household spendinghave lead surprisingly strong demand canadian good services.what remarkable circumstance pressure basic trend inflation canadahave minimal.now, i know 12-month rate increase total consumer price index rise around3% sharp rise energy prices. although high price boost activity forcanada’s energy producers, also raise live cost canadians.the bank remain fully commit preserve environment low stable inflation. butmonetary policy control future trend inflation - temporary up downscaused movement price volatile item energy food. of course, therewas evidence high energy price begin fee price good services, bi review 74/20002or expectation future trend inflation, would different. but far, notbeen case.in order get good fix underlie trend inflation, look bank’s coremeasure inflation - measure exclude fluctuation energy food price effectsof change indirect taxes. this core measure remain bottom half 1 3% targetrange set control inflation.this somewhat low expected. it suggest total demand, although strong thananticipated, may put much pressure economy’s production capacity wehad think begin year.the economic outlooklet shift bank’s view outlook economy.when come monetary policy, “looking ahead” important. why? because action thatyour central bank take today full effect economy price another18 24 months. that bank must always base decision judgment futureeconomic growth future inflation.the bank’s late projection economic growth 2000 (published august monetary policyreport update) within range 4¼ 4¾% - somewhat high expect spring.this projection assume slow balance year rapid pace firsthalf. but, even then, output probably grow fast production capacity; pressureson capacity likely increase. because this, predict core measure inflationwill move 2% - centre bank’s 1 3% target range - early next year. at sametime, world crude oil price stabilize, expect rate increase total cpi willgradually come eventually converge core measure inflation.but, i say before, number uncertainty attach projection. the mostimportant uncertainty revolve around future development u economy. will economyslow sustainable pace? or another surprise spillover u demand ourexports? right now, look growth spend u household moderating.what american economy slow fast enough prevent rise u inflation? will thathave significant adverse effect expectation inflation canada? this bank’scommitment keep trend inflation within target range really come play. our role isto reassure canadians, see inflation remain low stable even u inflationrises.another major area uncertainty economy’s capacity produce. a i say earlier,our remarkable inflation record date suggest probably still excess capacity inthe economy early part year. although projection assume pressure capacitywill contribute increase underlie trend inflation - around 1½% 2% nextyear - is, fact, significant margin uncertainty around numbers.it possible investment boom witness canada since 1996 increaseproductivity growth capacity quickly allow for. there good deal ofanecdotal evidence american experience (burgeoning investment technologyleading robust productivity gains) replicate canada. until recently, littleevidence official, economy-wide productivity statistics. but significant gainin productivity data second quarter year release recently. of course, itremains see whether continue. 3bis review 74/2000monetary policy responsehow monetary policy respond this? because surprisingly strong momentum ofdemand canada since mid-1999, likelihood could lead inflationpressures future, bank canada raise interest rate four time - total of1¼ percentage point - november 1999 may 2000.these four interest rate increase follow similar action u central bank. the federalreserve’s assessment interest rate increase necessary growth demand thatcountry continue outstrip growth supply, important factor decision matchthose moves. the reason imply continue spillover u demand canada, whichwould add already buoyant growth spend canadian household businesses.this additional external demand products, time domestic demand alreadybrisk, essentially increase risk would run capacity constraint pressure oninflation.clearly, u economic financial development always relevant canada. after all, doover 80% foreign trade country. and u financial market importantinfluence interest rate worldwide, include ours. but mean bank canadamust always follow federal reserve, interest rate level unite state mustbe same.the job canadian monetary policy respond trend economy. naturally, becauseof close tie canada unite states, economic trend two country oftensimilar, may require similar policy responses. but always case. since mid-1999, theamericans raise interest rate six occasions. we raise four times. moreover,canadian interest rate continue u rate inflation low oureconomy grow quickly, long, (so risk pressure oncapacity inflation canada intense).still, i appreciate that, economy move together, people may find canadian monetarypolicy difficult interpret - particularly bank move immediately match increase inus policy rates. on occasions, tendency conclude either bank doesnot much choice follow, must target canadian dollar requireinterest rate move lock-step u rates.neither assumption correct. when u monetary authority take policy action, banklooks carefully reason behind move mean ongoing assessment ofthe outlook total demand inflation canada. our job think necessary tokeep economy non-inflationary, thus sustainable, growth path.new procedure announce monetary policy actionsi would like turn another aspect way conduct monetary policy country.as i say outset, bank constantly search way enhance effectiveness ofmonetary policy.over past couple years, look major central bank go aboutannouncing change official interest rates, assess whether currentarrangements could improved. we note foreign central bank announce theirdecisions interest rate certain date set well advance. in unite states, thishas practice time. and also case major economies(japan, euro zone unite kingdom) well number small industrial countries(eg sweden, australia new zealand).after carefully consider relevant issues, conclude pre-set date announcinginterest rate action would improve implementation effectiveness canadian monetarypolicy. bi review 74/20004we decide eight specify date per year would appropriate canadian context. thescheduling eight date would base time flow economic informationthat bank rely gauge economic situation canada, make projections, assessthe need monetary policy action. each eight date would separate u policyaction date week more. in prepare move new system, consultinginterested party appropriate day week time day announce interest ratechanges.the way see it, new approach several advantage exist arrangements,advantages contribute effective monetary policy. i would like briefly highlightsome benefits.to begin with, new arrangement reduce uncertainty financial market timingof policy actions. under current system, bank move interest rate business day(monday friday), 9 market participant sure exactly day change ininterest rate may announced, trade slow early morning, several days, isan expectation bank may move. remove uncertainty improve market efficiencyand liquidity.we also believe new system help focus public attention closely economictrends canada, appropriate monetary policy response base critical trends.let explain.on eight pre-set date interest rate action, bank would issue press release thatwould give brief assessment economic situation canada explain choose either tochange interest rate leave unchanged. this would also give u opportunity link thelatest development directly underlie economic trend medium term - the18 24 month effect monetary policy action spread. integrate theinformation eight press release key monetary policy statement throughout theyear would provide regular, frequent, continuous account view canadianeconomy.in end, bank job keep people well informed, expect economic analysts,market participants, public generally clear factor influence monetarypolicy good position anticipate direction policy. this certainly prove tobe case unite states, euro zone, unite kingdom.there could, course, extreme case might call immediate policy response thebank rather wait next schedule announcement date. the new arrangement would notpreclude option. it would use infrequently, however, extraordinarycircumstances.details new approach announce interest rate change issue next tuesday willbe post bank’s web site, along invitation comment public. we plan toimplement system autumn, first date interest rate action set november 2000.concluding remarksto conclude, let return main point regard economic situation.the canadian economy perform well recent year bank expect willcontinue so. the task monetary policy ensure economy stay expandingbut non-inflationary path.monetary policy face challenge period ahead - challenge arise severaluncertainties surround economic outlook. the key uncertainty future performance theus economy implication canada. from perspective, matter theus monetary authority succeed bring high-flying economy onto sustainable track. 5bis review 74/2000another important challenge monetary policy keep demand supply home inbalance time application new technology may well transform canada’seconomy move onto high growth path. but sure yet. while recentproductivity gain encouraging, early tell begin sustainedimproved performance front.because this, bank closely watch indicator could provide early sign suchan occurrence. but must careful let hope run ahead reality take risk withinflation. a flare-up inflation high interest rate would go would discourageinvestments, especially high-tech equipment software, enhance productivity areso crucial improve economic performance future.the outlook canadian economy promising. the best contribution bank make torealizing economic potential preserve present environment low stable inflation. forthis foster sustain solid economic growth improve standard live time. i canassure bank canada remain fully commit task. 1bis review 73/2000mike moore: financial service wtoremarks mr mike moore, director-general world trade organization, work dinnerof central bank governor hold bank

committee economic monetary affair european parliament,brussels, 12 september 2000.* * *today shall continue regular exchange view monetary policy activity theeurosystem. i glad see since last meet 20 june prospect economic growthin euro area remain favourable. at time, upward pressure price hademerged need address ecb timely manner lead decision on31 august increase ecb interest rate 25 basis points. i shall start remark bycommenting detail step assessment monetary economic developmentsin euro area underpin decision. subsequently i shall address issue oftopical interest, namely preparation euro cash changeover, current effort improve theavailability statistical data eu role ecb oversight payment systems. ishall happy answer questions.1.economic monetary developmentsturning ecb’s decision increase ecb interest rate 25 basis point 31 august, ishould like start explanation point that, prior interest rate hike, upside risk toprice stability evident pillar ecb’s monetary policy strategy.starting first pillar, moderation evolution monetary aggregate beengradually detectable recent months. this could relate increase short-term interestrates euro area course year, dampen effect demand forthe liquid component m3, namely include m1 (currency circulation andovernight deposits, bear little remuneration). however, spite decelerationobserved recently, m3 growth remain reference value. this, part, reflect therelatively strong increase nominal gdp euro area. furthermore, order ass overallliquidity situation euro area, acknowledge that, owe protract deviation ofm3 growth reference value occur since start stage three emu, theactual level stock m3 much high level imply reference value. therefore,as also evidence continue strong demand credit private sector, liquidity euroarea continue ample early summer. particularly phase robust economic growth,the continuation ample liquidity condition would constitute risk price stability.as regard information provide second pillar, favourable picture economicoutlook euro area saw june confirm past months. thisapplies particular prospect strong growth.on basis available short-term indicators, euro area real gdp growth first half year,compared second half 1999, expect amount around 3.5% annualisedbasis. this underpin projection strong growth 3% year come twoyears contain currently available forecasts. if anything, projection revise upwardsslightly past months, reflect favourable condition domestic external demand.on domestic side, growth continue benefit high overall level confidence,with indicator close respective record highs. investment growth expect toremain strong account moderate wage development high degree capacity utilisation.growth private consumption also remain robust, support particular ongoing strongemployment growth concomitant steady fall unemployment. on external side, factor bi review 73/20002supporting growth ongoing strong expansion global economy past gain incompetitiveness euro area, reflect decline exchange rate euro. give thestrength conjunctural indicator domestic demand exports, euro area growth yearcould turn even strong anticipate june.bond market also continue point favourable prospect economic growth euro area inthe period ahead. while yield curve flatten somewhat course year, hasbeen consequence increase ecb interest rates. by contrast, long-term bond yield havebeen broadly stable year, indicate continue financial market expectation robust economicgrowth future.turning indicator relate second pillar, development import price clearlybeen le favourable expect june 2000. a consequence, july 2000 annual consumer priceinflation, measure hicp increases, stand 2.4%. this level ecbregards compatible price stability. at juncture, upward movement consumerprice inflation mainly reflect impact oil price energy price component hicp andthe grow pressure price stem depreciation exchange rate euro.overall, due oil price exchange rate, consumer price inflation euro area likelyto remain 2% month come.monetary policy cannot offset short-term pressure hicp. however, need make surethat temporary deviation ecb’s definition price stability spill long-terminflation expectations, ensure indeed remain temporary. in sense, crucial tomake sure short-term upward pressure import price lead protractedincrease hicp period strong economic growth.in view situation, pillar monetary policy strategy ecb werepointing upward risk price stability, govern council ecb decide 31 august toincrease minimum bid rate main refinance operation eurosystem 25 basispoints, 4.50%. the interest rate marginal lend deposit facility also increasedby 25 basis points, 5.50% 3.50% respectively.the change procedure allotment liquidity main refinance operation theeurosystem, i mention last meet 20 june, prove satisfactory. asyou may recall, govern council decide 8 june that, start operation settledon 28 june, main refinance operation eurosystem would conduct variable ratetenders minimum bid rate. in procedure, minimum bid rate take rolepreviously perform rate fix rate tender signal monetary policy stance thegoverning council. our current assessment market participant adapt smoothly newprocedure, procedure serve purpose well.the govern council remain alert emerge risk price stability. the maintenance ofprice stability continue contribute favourable environment growth. however, cannotincrease growth potential euro area. it responsibility actor create thenecessary condition sustain high growth euro area.first, favourable wage development one key factor ensure continuation robusteconomic growth reduction unemployment medium term. in respect, crucialthat forthcoming wage settlement base ecb’s definition price stability. any attempt toincrease wage reaction recent oil price increase would highly detrimental currentfavourable growth process, since monetary policy would need react result upward pressureon prices. it matter fact recent oil price increase deteriorate term trade theeuro area, thus also reduce real income. this fact need accept party concerned.second, main challenge government euro area country relate theconduct fiscal policy. at present, one major impediment increase long-term growthpotential euro area high level social contribution taxation labour andcorporate income. while reduction tax social contribution would certainly beneficialfrom economic point view, essential course action remain compatible 3bis review 73/2000long-term sustainability public finances. therefore, reform taxation side, verymuch welcome, accompanied, even preceded, reduction level expenditure atpresent future.taking account gradual age population euro area, reform pension systemsshould delayed. such reform necessary order achieve long-term sustainable fiscalpositions and, time, avoid risk impose excessive burden worker andenterprises future. while progress make government past years,further effort essential order support long-term growth prospect euro area.moreover, fiscal reform accompany progress areas. in particular,reforms field labour product market regulation essential economy euroarea take full advantage opportunity create introduction single currency, theprocess globalisation availability new technologies. enhance labour market flexibilityand increase competition product market key factor contribute high growthpotential euro area. in several country notable progress achieve respects.however, still much do look area whole.finally, let also say word recent exchange rate developments. from monetarypolicy point view, clearly cause concern add upward pressure consumerprices euro area. furthermore, appear appropriate look atfundamentals.as aware, already express concern time. in meantime, havewitnessed considerable improvement economic growth prospect euro area. at thesame time, result measure take govern council ecb, outlook pricestability euro area remain intact. at present, inflation euro area among low inthe world. the fact euro continue depreciate recent month line thesestrong economic fundamental euro area. recent global exchange rate development also notin line international balance payment positions.2.other activity eurosystemlet turn activity eurosystem, start several decision weretaken regard introduction euro banknote coin 1 january 2002. the ecb,together european institution member states, pay close attention thiscrucial event, mark final step completion economic monetary union. asyou aware, ecb launch information campaign 2002 cash changeover, onwhich colleague, mr. domingo solans, report may. i like recall ecbshares parliament’s view coordination various information campaign conduct atthe european national level essential order provide clear consistent information tomarkets general public.moreover, several measure recently take ecb order facilitate thechangeover process market participant general public. in july govern councildefined general principle framework euro cash changeover, include financialmodalities credit institutions. moreover, 1 september 2001 fix start date thefrontloading euro cash credit institution euro area. this imply credit institution mayalso commence sub-frontloading euro cash retailers, vend machine industry andcash-in-transit company september 2001.given euro banknote coin become legal tender 1 january 2002, theeurosystem retain ownership frontloaded euro cash then. credit institution beobliged arrange appropriate coverage risk anticipate public use, well destructionor theft. in addition, sub-frontloading shall perform credit institution delivery ofappropriate collateral national central banks. bi review 73/20004as regard cross-border exchange national banknote within euro area, may recall thatthe ecb decided, back 1998, national central bank euro area provide atleast one location exchange national banknote effect officialconversion rates. originally, envisage exchange facility would expire on31 december 2001. now govern council ecb decide extend period until31 march 2002 order expedite changeover process. for sake completeness, i shouldlike add exchange national banknote respective national central bank after1 january 2002 possible much long period (at least ten years). however, accord tocurrent plan member states, time span exchange national coin will, least insome countries, considerably shorter, range one year coin cease legaltender indefinite period.the govern council also review number euro banknote printedbefore end 2001, decide increase launch stock euro banknote from13 14.5 billion. in so, govern council take account participation greece, ahigher expect increase banknote circulation within euro area, anticipate strongdemand low-denomination banknote slow anticipate progress use ofelectronic money. the total nominal value euro banknote amount eur616 billion.another important issue ecb continue pay considerable attention relate toimprovements need field eu statistics. in conduct monetary policy, ecb us awide range statistic - broadly speaking: publish 60 page table monthlybulletin. two set statistic particular importance us, namely monthly monetary data andthe hicp (harmonised index consumer prices) cover euro area, compare well quality andtimeliness correspond data elsewhere. this also true areas, balanceof payment security issues. however, area timeliness quality data availablefor euro area still disappointing.in august ecb publish report entitle “statistical requirement ecb field ofgeneral economic statistics”, outline requirement area. in broad terms, areaswhere improvement high priority relate quarterly national accounts, harmonisedquarterly public finance statistics, labour market statistics, conjunctural statistic quickeravailability data trade outside euro area.the european commission, coordination ecb, currently prepare action plancovering priority rapid improvement. accord current planning, action plan beendorsed ecofin minister end month, give work high possible level ofpolitical support.i like refer briefly issue concern area payment systems. a already statedon several occasions, efficient euro payment settlement system essential smoothimplementation monetary policy stability financial markets. this close relationship isreflected fact treaty assign escb responsibility promote smoothoperation payment systems, imply oversight function include possibility theecb issue regulation area. moreover, ecb also concern security ofpayment instruments, crucial public confidence single currency. a part itscommunication policy order give guidance market public large, ecb issueda statement june explain detail objective activity eurosystem area,especially regard execution oversight function.the focus ecb, however, restrict efficient process large-value transactions.the ecb also clear interest smooth function cross-border retail payment systems.this interest, ecb share european parliament, reflect initiative ofseptember last year concern improvement cross-border retail payment systems. since then,the ecb close contact european bank industry order explore practicalways mean enhance efficiency cross-border retail payment systems. you may beinterested know progress report, provide assessment recommendation ecb inthis area, close finalise publish soon. 5bis review 73/2000as concern retail payments, i also like draw attention one particular issue, namelythe cost cause balance payment report requirements. the ecb share concern has,together commission, national central bank statistical authorities, undertakenefforts reduce costs, particular establish common exemption threshold ofeur12,500, come effect 1 january 2002. this mean bank haveto report customers’ cross-border payment receipt amount threshold. theimplementation uniform exemption threshold constitute major breakthrough reduce anadministrative burden specific cross-border payments. a consequence, reportingrequirements long serve justification high customer fee cross-border paymentsbelow threshold. furthermore, list harmonise economic code prepared, whichshould facilitate automation reporting.to conclude remarks, let briefly mention ecb occasional papers, new series ofpublications launch july refinement ecb’s communication tools.the ecb occasional paper draft ecb staff member publish ownresponsibility. they address various policy-relevant issue make available public dataand analysis use within ecb eurosystem. 1bis review 72/2000willem f duisenberg: the international role eurospeech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, occasion the2000 spruce meadow round table, hold calgary, 8 september 2000.* * *let first thank organiser conference invite share think withyou international role euro. the euro successfully launch 20 month ago thesingle currency 11 member state european union (eu) - know “euro area”. on1 january 1999 member state transfer monetary sovereignty new supranationalinstitution, european central bank (ecb). since then, eurosystem - compose ecb andthe national central bank (ncbs) 11 country adopt euro - chargeof euro area single monetary policy relate functions, foreign reserve management andoperations payment system oversight.the euro bring fundamental change economic financial environment theeuro area beyond. by low transaction cost enhance price transparency, singlecurrency represent major contribution foster competition efficiency good financialmarkets across euro area. a such, introduction euro represent quantum leap towardscompleting fully integrate single market eu lay solid basis improvement inthe live standard european citizens. besides welfare-enhancing effect “domestic”economy euro area, new set also far-reaching consequence world economyand international community.let shed light international ramification monetary union highlight threeinterrelated aspects. first, use euro international currency global financialsystem; second, grow role play eurosystem international policy cooperation; and,third, relevant aspect exchange rate euro. before deal point turn, ishould like recall key economic feature euro area.key economic feature euro arealet begin put euro area international perspective. the euro area represent alarge relatively close economy. give population almost 300 million people itssignificant weight global economy, euro area broadly comparable unite states.as regard size structure, strike fact euro area economy share ofworld output around 16%. this three time large national component(namely germany, account 4.7%), significantly high japan (which accountsfor 8%), low unite state (which stand 21%).being large economy, degree trade openness euro area much small itsconstituent countries, even though still high unite state japan. measure bythe average export import share euro area output, degree openness 16% theeuro area. by contrast, prior monetary union, average export ratio member statesincluding intra-euro area trade stand around 35% 1997, range 20 60%. at sametime, euro area remain open unite state japan, ratio 12% 11%respectively. another factor highlight role euro area world trade share worldexports. with almost 20%, euro area world’s large exporter, compare 15% 9% inthe unite state japan respectively.as regard structure euro area economy, pattern production broadly similar tothose unite state japan. while primary production rather negligible (around 2% oftotal output), bulk lie euro area’s service sector, account almost 70% totalproduction, roughly equal unite state (72%) high japan bi review 72/20002(60%). the industrial sector account around 30%, high unite state butsomewhat low japan.finally, look structure financial market side atlantic, may note thedifference “bank-based” system finance european continent the“market-based” system unite states. although seem trend away bankstowards non-bank finance euro area, reinforce introduction euro, bank stillplay dominant role provide financial service euro area. domestic credit share ofdomestic output account 130% euro area, compare 80% unite states.correspondingly, stock debt market much small euro area unite states.while share euro area debt security stock market capitalisation relative gdp remainclearly 100% (91% 63% respectively), figure unite state caseswell 150% (155% 172% respectively). this bring use euro aninternational currency global financial system.the role euro international currencygiven weight euro area world economy legacy former nationalcurrencies, replace euro, surprise euro second mostwidely use currency behind u dollar. a number observer argue one mainmotivations behind economic monetary union (emu) development euro amajor international currency. this perception, however, incorrect number reasons.first, “euro project” see logical step european integration process,which start half century ago, immediately second world war. it objectiveswere - still - purely economic, european integration aim creation ofa prosperous also stable peaceful europe. for large part, trade, economic financialintegration aim removal barrier free competition engine process.in context, euro see major contribution completion single market ineurope. the primary objective ecb maintain price stability euro area.second, international use euro is, first foremost, outcome market-drivenprocess, steer central bank political bodies. the ecb adopt neutralstance internationalisation euro. the ecb intend neither foster hind useof euro. in past, major country have, times, tend promote international use theircurrency, primarily view potential benefit national financial sectors. there havealso case major country resist internationalisation currency, owingto uncertainty process may imply conduct monetary policy. however, bymaintaining price stability, ecb almost automatically foster attractiveness euro aninternational currency.third, international use currency complex phenomenon lend ad hocpromotion measures. a currency use different functions, also differentgroups economic agents. in context, use euro private agent investment andfinancing currency, well payment vehicle currency, play prominent role. although theeuro also use public sector nominal peg reserve currency, behaviour theprivate sector dominate internationalisation euro. the amount financial asset managedby private sector many time large official reserve holdings. in addition, private agentsusually adjust asset management strategy rapidly

that,whenever monetary policy surveillance, ecb solely responsible interaction withthe imf oecd. standard code recently adopt imf relevant internationalinstitutions way define best policy practice

particular weapon crisis prevention armoury, bank capital.this is, course, topical subject moment, revision basel committee onbanking supervision 1988 capital accord.importance capitalwhy bank capital crucial role crisis prevention? this question two aspects: first, theimportance capital itself; second, special role bank play economic system.capital vital two-fold role. first, capital - rather equity capital - act buff againstinsolvency. it therefore help protect system limit call safety net. and second, equitycapital help align objective firm’s owner objective authorities. wherethe owner firm invest pinpoint capital, see investment erode point thefirm marginally solvent, owner incentive “gamble resurrection”, withlimited liability, take extra risk substantial potential upside extra downside owners.but high cushion capital, owner something lose.that said, overstate role capital ensure health bank system. ifother fundamental shaky - macroeconomic environment, legal system, theframework asset valuation audit - capital likely produce limit comfort. andcapital adequacy course one aspect prudential regulation, aspect riskmanagement liquidity management system control also vitally important.the basel committee course explicitly recognise formal regulatory minimumcapital framework one pillar edifice bank soundness. it complement bysupervisors individually review capital adequacy bank light wide range riskfactors - second pillar propose new accord - market discipline banks, thirdpillar.on question focus banks, would difficult overstate importance stablebanking system economic health growth. bank play crucial role intermediate savingsand credit heart payment system. most firm economy remainheavily reliant bank finance, even economy significant number firm canturn capital market finance, bank retain important role provider payment facilities,short-term credit, backup liquidity. in le advance economies, role even dominant,to extent number full-blown macro-economic crisis root weak bankingsystems.changes basel accordas i said, capital framework bank currently review basel committee. it isworth remind framework consist of. first, set method measuringthe riskiness assets. second, set definition capital. and third, lay minimumratio capital, numerator, risk assets, denominator, namely capital atleast 8% risk-adjusted assets, least 4% consist tier 1 capital.what change new accord make elements? 3bis review 70/2000the work date heavily focus first element framework, method formeasuring risk. there substantial change here, aim introduce risksensitivity exist crude measure widen coverage measure beyond creditrisk market risk address previous review accord. the direction thechanges lay committee’s consultative paper june last year i intend gointo description here.on second aspect, committee state “with respect definition regulatorycapital, committee maintain stage exist rule set 1988 accord.” inother words, stage revise definition capital. just remind you, thisdefinition capital broadly divide capital two tiers, tier 1 mainly consist ofshareholders equity reserve tier 2 certain subordinate debt instrument element ofgeneral provisions. there modification definition since 1988, instance tointroduce another layer le permanent capital back short term trade risks, recently toaccommodate innovative type issue align tier 1 capitalpurposes (but debt tax purpose - outcome i believe technically describe as“having one’s cake eat it”!).it would course intellectually satisfy review whole framework together, butthe committee’s decision revisit definition time is, i believe, defensible pragmaticone: modernise denominator prove quite difficult contentious enough without involvingthe numerator well. that said, discussion need take place point towhether definition achieve right composition element emphasis thoseelements.how much capital system needit third aspect framework i mainly wish offer think today, is, onthe level capital come framework. here again, committee signal a“no change” least “no change aggregate” intention, say “the committee believesthat new framework least maintain overall level capital currently bankingsystem.”we course illusion ratio choose 1988 arrive ascientific process. if i may digress briefly anecdote, i recall bill mcdonough relate thathe ask staff why, market risk amendment capital accord, decidedto apply three-times multiplier outcome var models. why three times? the answer cameback three time select “two time low four time high”. iimagine process select 4% minimum equity similar this. the selection acapital ratio ought, ideally, depend upon answer follow questions: risk aretrying limit? what good measure risk? what residual level risk will totolerate? and fix capital level achieve residual level? these question werenot explicitly address back 1988, although possibly infer implicit answersfrom regime established. however, although neither 1988’s accord’s measure risk norits selection minimum capital ratio may scientifically derived, committee’sstatement least maintain overall level capital system indicate that, ex post,they reasonably happy 1988 accord achieved.but exactly mean statement? and go achieve intendedoutcome? be it, indeed, reasonable outcome strive for? i try address questions.one way think 1988 accord that, aim principally internationally active g10banks, use crude measure risk assume sort average portfolio profile riskfor banks, set “confidence level” soundness individual bank hence system.looked light, committee’s statement mean authority intend tolerate adifferent - ie low - level confidence follow introduction new accord. in words, bi review 70/20004under new regime, average internationally-active g10 bank likely fail thanit would old regime.this seem fairly sensible way view relationship old accord new version. itleaves plenty scope see redistribution require capital, less-than-averagely risky bank tomore risky ones. it also leaf scope overall capital reduce time, good risk measurementor technique lead reduction risk taken.that said, look appropriate level capital way still mean able tomeasure current confidence level g10 bank insolvency establish existingaccord. this entirely straightforward task. one start point could rat g10banks. the median rat banks, take entire rat g10 population 300 banks, isa1 moody’s scale, a+ standard poor’s scale. this would indicate near-invisibleinsolvency probability bank 1 year horizon. however, small insolvencyprobability reflect two factor ideally would wish discount. first, rat reflectthe bank’s actual capital level case significantly regulatoryminimum. and second, case rat also reflect agency’s expectation publicsupport would forthcoming bank, course would wish strip out. a moreaccurate measure confidence level establish basel 8% would “standalone”ratings produce agencies, bank whose capital close basel minimum.even basis, nearly bank rat investment grade. the message thereforefrom view matter new accord target minimum level ofregulatory capital g10 internationally active bank least consistent investmentgrade rating.an alternative way assess regulatory soundness standard would “bottom up” basis,that model probability default arise typical credit portfolio bank heldonly basel minimum capital. the advent credit risk model technique creditmetricsallow exercise attempted. any result sort approach need treat witha fair amount caution, give number assumption involved. the work do thebank, experiment model use different parameters, least support theproposition g10 international bank (the target constituency accord) capitalon basis one-year default probability consistent investment grade rating.assuming somehow identify current confidence level implicit exist capitalaccord, may, i suggest above, nevertheless want debate question whether thecommittee would right aim replicate new accord. be reasonableobjective? or conservative?clearly type bank exposure much capital demanded, aslending high quality corporates. this lead exposure move outside thebanking system, disintermediation regulatory arbitrage. this problem one maindrivers behind basel committee’s current review risk measures. however, equallytransactions basel minimum severely inadequate, lend oecdcountries. but question really whether average regulatory requirement produce rightlevel protection.given bank england’s general concern systemic risk, would tend evaluate thisquestion term whether exist cushion capital give right level protection tothe system, ie establish right level tolerance towards bank crises. individual bankfailures prove inadequacy framework - although complete absence bank failureswould suggest severe overprotectionism.it difficult answer question definitively, give bank failure bank crisis tendto root number different causes, inadequate capital. it difficult saytherefore much difference extra capital would made, many crisis would haveresulted regulatory capital demand lower. nevertheless frequency crises, even indeveloped country since basel accord implemented, low make u feel theregulatory demand capital overstated. use imf data bank crises, find 5bis review 70/20001990s four 11 g10 country suffer bank crisis - statistic i findparticularly comforting. and, although develop country tend escape twin plague abanking crisis combine currency crisis, suppose rather high incidenceof crisis develop country mitigate cost call crisis noticeably low. ihesitate put precise number costs, vary quite considerably. however, bankof england research present late conference indicates, fiscal andwelfare cost measure use significant indeed. on measures, fact, theoutput cost bank crisis develop country tend high emerge markets,largely length crisis long develop countries. overall, therefore, light ofpast experience, i think would take unjustified risk deliberately set low theexisting regulatory demand capital.crisis management paymentsstandstills: i want turn crisis prevention crisis resolution domestic bank tomore general international liquidity crises. while bank system source instability inmany country asian crisis, immediate problem liquidity crisis trigger bythe sudden outflow capital region. it free movement capital i would like todiscuss and, regime, need arrangement would deal liquidity crisis wheredeveloping country get payment difficulties.the international capital marketglobal capital flow explode since 1970s. between 1970 1996, real gdp g7economies doubled. over period, world trade volume rise roughly twice thisamount. but since 1970, real gross private capital flow rise factor eight -double growth world trade four time growth world income.rising capital flow deliver huge benefit develop countries. capital liberalisation,like trade liberalisation, facilitate “catch-up” level income countries. it deliversa permanent, potentially huge, welfare gain. the experience asian tiger 1970sonwards, germany japan 1950s 1960s, testimony that.but large-scale capital flow also bring risks. capital flow large, volatile too. thefinancial crisis mexico 1994, across south-east asia 1997, russia 1998 brazil lastyear recent visible examples. but incidence financial crisis fact beenrising since early 1980s. and cost financial crisis considerable. in strickensouth-east asian countries, capital flow reversal output loss anywhere 5% and20% gdp. in many cases, encourage evidence v-shaped recovery inoutput asset price follow crisis. but depth v clear evidence potential cost ofvolatile capital movements.capital market course prone “panics, mania crashes” long haveexisted. it would naïve think ever entirely prevent crisis - indeed may beundesirable attempt so. but realistic think incidence severity crisis canbe mitigate appropriate public policy actions. this grandly-titled “new internationalfinancial architecture” doubt heard.i want discus effort official sector redesign international architecture -achievements date and, importantly, challenge future. while lot achieved, muchremains done. i also suggest i think official community’s future effort might bestbe directed. bi review 70/20006dealing financial crisisthe first priority official community must course crisis prevention. and front goodprogress made. for example, substantial array code standard bestpractice cover public policy issues: transparency macroeconomic policies; core principle thesupervision banks, insurance company security firm (including change baselaccord i discussed); principle corporate governance, insolvency marketintegrity; standard data, audit accounting. implementation code bestpractice key - ensure crisis-prevention principle put firmly practice, bothdeveloped emerge economies. the imf key role play implementation process,through assessment compliance standard transparency assessments.but even preventative measure place, liquidity crisis still occur time time.creditors may sometimes choose flee simply fear creditor them. acountry face liquidity “run” much way bank. and type coordinationfailure difficult resolve standard macroeconomic policy tools, like monetary policy.so policy alternative available? one mean resolve rush exit imfto provide emergency liquidity support potentially unlimited amount - classic international lenderof last resort. but virtually no-one envisage imf (or anyone else) play role. a apractical matter, imf simply lack resources. it usable resource currently le than$150 billion. the external debt develop country well $2 trillion. so imf’sability fill finance gap already heavily circumscribe become time.even resources, doubtful whether unlimited imf lend would desirable. morelikely, would simply stoke-up moral hazard problem future, potentially increase theincidence crisis correspond cost taxpayers. so international lender last resortappears impractical undesirable.this recognition neither practical desirable see imf role lender lastresort prompt considerable think nature private sector involvement crisisresolution modality sovereign payment suspension standstills. payment suspensionsare way obverse recognise limit imf lending. and, reflect this, sovereignstandstills litter history last two centuries: latin america 1820s; among u statesin 1830s 1840s; latin america 1870s; among majority sovereign debtorsin 1930s; latin america 1980s.all often past, however, sovereign standstill also recipe chaos andconfusion. the recent sovereign default russia, indonesia ecuador good case point. butlooking back history, clear messy protract sovereign standstill much therule rather exception. historical experience sovereign standstill probably look quite alot like corporate experience insolvency rule put place, work-out processinefficient inequitable. i return corporate bankruptcy analogy late on.against backdrop, key issue face official community seem twofold. first,how establish coherent framework crisis management, recognise reconcilesthe countervail force large rise capital flow one hand, small limitedofficial lend other. second, give constraints, possible within framework toestablish role standstill efficient, equitable expeditious. i discus turn.a framework crisis managementthe cologne summit statement g7 finance minister central bank june 1999 steptowards establish framework international crisis management. it list “principles” and“tools” underpin framework - like, ingredients. it not, however, provide recipefor combine ingredients. the official community’s framework crisis management remainsa discretionary, “case-by-case” one. 7bis review 70/2000this approach benefits. crisis clearly differ form severity, call flexibility theofficial sector’s approach deal them. but discretion also carry costs. for privatecreditors, add uncertainty frame lend plans. the imf’s late capital marketsreport state private sector “highly uncertain, outright confuse officialcommunity’s approach achieve goals”.discretion also cost official community. it risk “gaming” private sector, theofficial sector provide money ex-post would optimal ex-ante. by alteringofficial private sector behaviour way, discretionary approach crisis managementpotentially increase cost incidence crisis.are feasible, rules-based alternatives? one simple mean establish official“line-in-the-sand” would place explicit cap imf lending. no rule course inviolable.but publicly-stated constraint likely great credibility. this would reduce uncertaintyamong private creditors. and would drive home point “bail in” private creditor wouldneed greater, large country’s finance needs, provide right set incentivesfrom moral hazard perspective.payments standstill crisis management toolthis limit pool imf lend would need complement crisis management tools.voluntary rollover agreement creditor - like put place korea brazilrecently - would important part crisis management toolkit. so would voluntary bondrestructurings, recently undertake pakistan, ukraine ecuador. an ongoingdialogue country debtor private creditor - institute internationalfinance call “country clubs” - would facilitate voluntary tool crisis resolution.involuntary payment suspension also deserve consideration part official sector’s toolkit,however. a crisis management tool, may beneficial certain situations. where country isvulnerable short-term capital movements, standstill could serve potentially importantcircuit-breaker. they might efficient mean forestall “runs” country theyprevent pessimistic creditor expectation become self-fulfilling. more generally, whether capital isshort-term not, could serve important incentive device. have standstill crediblebackstop might circumstance increase incentive debtor creditor seek voluntaryresolutions crisis sooner.through mechanisms, standstill might help resolve coordination failure amongcreditors, hence forestall liquidity crisis.how ensure standstill efficient equitable? the decision default must beprincipally debtor. but official sector alter debtor incentive important ways. oneincentive device would imf support standstill agree lend duration- imf call “lending-into-arrears” - provide standstill process, enter into, isorderly speedy. if standstill structure part imf’s ex-ante crisis managementframework, would increase chance standstill process prove ex-post efficient.there also encourage work do private sector draw best practiceguidelines sovereign debt work-outs.some argue articulate clear role standstill may perversely alter debtor incentives,by weaken presumption debtor pay debt full time. but orderlystandstills process support, supplant, market force market disciplines. corporatebankruptcy law grow become clear market force deliver loser well winner andthat orderly mean need deal losers. in way, bankruptcy law supportsthe market mechanism.the situation different sovereign context. a well-articulated framework deal withsovereign liquidity problem reduce inefficiency inequity current unstructuredapproach standstills. it would support international capital market mechanism. it would bi review 70/20008more likely induce debtor default bankruptcy law induce corporate debtor default.in neither case default soft option. we would course hope expect sovereign standstill bethe exception rather rule. but good plan contingencies, articulate theseplans, international public policy make hoof. in respect, crisis-fighting sharesmany similarity fire-fighting. fire-prevention ideal, never entirely prevent firesoccurring. so make sense fire-fighting plan, everyone understand abide by,to minimise damage fire occur.would standstill work?the issue whether standstill form part official sector’s toolkit response remainsunder active debate. a number argument use standstill make bypolicymakers, academic private sector. let try articulate concerns.first, would standstill risk cutting-off capital flow emerge market - like, kill thegoose lay golden egg? history offer clue here. for example, appear noevidence 1930s experience default country fare bad non-defaultingcountries term subsequent output growth. and look across broad sweep history, someempirical evidence fail find discernibly negative long term effect country’s priordebt-servicing record term volume borrowing.that say default costless, certainly short medium term. the loss access tocapital market time effort involve restore credibility creditor is, quitecorrectly, strong deterrent country contemplate default.historical evidence may case uninformative investor behaviour future amore structure framework international crisis resolution. if framework help resolve thecollective action problem among creditors, ought benefit creditor well debtors. indeed, byreducing risk creditor way, standstill mutually beneficial parties. ifthat case, reason believe that, world structure standstills, much riskof golden-egg-laying goose cooked.second, might prospect standstill prompt pre-emptive rush exits? in world ofstructured standstills, perhaps risk skittish investor rush exit sooner.indeed, investor may choose enter emerge market first place - standstill wouldpre-empt inflow rather precipitate outflow. but behaviour longer-term investorsneeds also weighed. they would stand gain country run forestalled. theirincentives flee thereby diminished. the net effect might change composition ofthe develop countries’ capital stock, few fleet-of-foot, skittish investor greaternumber longer-term, sticky investors. this change capital stock ought advantageous fromthe welfare perspective.third, might standstill worsen contagion markets, like saw followingrussia’s debt moratorium 1998? contagion appear fact life world cross-bordercapital flows. the question is: would articulate role structure standstill worsen contagion? itis clear coherent crisis-management framework would increase incidence ofstandstills; might reduce cost. and extent contagion source investoruncertainty, might extent mitigate proposal i outlined.so, summarise, good reason think world structure standstill might alterinvestor behaviour international flow funds. it difficult, however, believe thesechanges would damage international capital market mechanism - indeed, wouldclearly improve functioning. sovereign default continue occur periodically. but officialsector could possibly mitigate cost establish coherent framework crisis management,with payment suspension one tools.none suggest issue standstill - outside bank england - fullyarticulated concluded. it difficult area require contribution side 9bis review 70/2000intellectual argument

outside hong kong’smonetary relationship mainland. the old myth 1997 would mean renminbiwould replace hong kong dollar beijing would take control hong kong’s extensiveforeign reserve dead bury three highly successful year experience “onecountry, two monetary systems”. more recently, current issue speculation surround therenminbi - one far ground reality - question whether exchange ratewill give great flexibility near future. this revive old question far hongkong dollar affect movement renminbi, connection china’sprospective wto accession, therefore worth examine rationale behind it, theimplications.first, however, since confusion point, helpful clarify differencebetween flexibility convertibility. convertibility mean ability currency freelyexchanged foreign currencies, either

degree exchange rate isallowed fluctuate intervention central bank. at present, flexibility inthe exchange rate renminbi, exchange rate determine “market” supply anddemand, although central bank remain ultimate banker market. the renminbi indeedbeen trade within narrow band past years. the narrowness i think reflect chinahaving act responsibly, background financial turmoil asia, allow greaterflexibility renminbi exchange rate add destabilise volatility asian currencies. however, anumber observers, include imf, believe scope flexibility. but,while observer regard full convertibility desirable long-term goal, believe anysignificant move make direction near term. this mean that, even renminbiwere give flexibility, would probably still subject exist exchange ratecontrols.the immediate consideration policymakers mainland market whether, greaterflexibility, renminbi would go down. china’s persistent current account surplus suggestthat appreciate. but market seem feel way. the non-deliverable forwardexchange rate purchase u dollar continuously significant premium. the differencein view may two explanations. one large amount negative error omission thebalance payments, many presume indicate unidentified capital outflows. the second theconcern many wto accession precipitate, least initially, surge import isgreater surge exports.why, then, flexibility matter consideration? there could number advantagesfrom perspective mainland. for example, allow interaction supply demandof foreign exchange current account transaction may serve kind market smoothingmechanism, especially short-term volatility trade flow may increase wtoaccession. the renminbi exchange rate also able respond underlie trend inexternal trade. great flexibility may also permit exchange rate adjustment pursuit othermacroeconomic objectives. should great flexibility renminbi pursued, i believe therewould advantages, interest transparency market confidence, mainland setout clearly expect achieve measure, especially absence move towardsfuller convertibility. if benefit doubt, underlie motivation misunderstood, bi review 68/20006there could adverse impact general

xianglong thepeople’s bank china. the gist response that, basis economic fundamentals, thereis reason hong kong dollar impact change renminbi exchange rate.but thing get little complicate market sentiment enter picture. during asiancrisis, market perceive strong correlation hong kong dollar renminbi. thiswas partly attributable misconception economic - perhaps political - relationshipbetween hong kong mainland, partly due market’s practice regard hongkong dollar proxy hedge renminbi. over past year so, however, renminbi andthe hong kong dollar become substantially decouple eye market. this decouplingcan easily read compare hong kong dollar forward spread renminbi’snon-deliverable forward exchange rate, track closely end 1998,when begin diverge. the decouple suggest market draw obviousconclusion fact that, since link exchange rate introduce 1983, renminbi hasdepreciated 70%, while, period, hong kong dollar remainedrock solid. and confirm calmness market take raise thepossibility great flexibility renminbi exchange rate premier zhu.our study suggest that, contrary popular intuition, devaluation renminbi mightactually provide stimulus hong kong economy: positive

argue bank crisis early ninetiesmight much le severe bank system force competitiveenvironment deregulation decade earlier.keeping regulation long danger, get rid quickly another. this may soundpeculiar, let give illustration. when, 1985, credit control abolish insweden, operation forty years. since authority decide onhow much bank could increase credit book every single month, really need toappraise credit application particularly serious manner. mortgage credit take theavailable credit volume remainder allocate safe projects. credit loss bankingsystem fraction percentage point credit stock year. a consequence, theability appraise credit risk slowly dwindle banks. so, unfortunately, case forthe supervisors.when credit control finally remove volume credit virtually exploded. all bank wantedto increase market share plenty pent-up demand. many loan give tocustomers who, appear later, far creditworthy pass propercredit appraisal. the regulation abolish wrong time without realise anextended period regulation do ability bank supervisor handle credit risk.what learn this? quite obviously, deregulate mean abolish rulesaccording bank behave. there good well document reason regulatingbanks. deregulation mean adoption new legal structure consistent competitivemarket economy. the dilemma regulation balance little much. toomuch stifle banks, little lead unsound risk taking. the traditional form regulationwas set strict rule forbid bank conduct certain activities. the modern form tobe flexible. regulation set boundary allow bank operate within theseboundaries prove skill resource sound manner. modernregulation put much responsibility bank owner management.in sweden, former bank act actually prohibit bank engage activity wasnot explicitly permit law. the new bank act start end, permit banksto whatever find suitable except certain activity explicitly forbidden.today’s financial institutions, instrument market are, course, much sophisticate thanearlier. there also much broad diversity sector. for example, need customer aresatisfied many different way many different actors, certainly banks.as consequence, modern regulation need flexible early days, marketwas homogeneous. the regulation encourage competition innovation, sametime discourage unsound risk take generally unbecoming even illegal behaviour. only whenthere strong argument regulator outright restrict prohibit certain activities. instead,regulations provide incentive bank others behave sound manner. for instance,capital requirement prohibit risky exposures, make expensive bank.before move somewhat deep question supervision, thing say aboutrisk management. 3bis review 66/2000risk managementrisk management system core modern banks. bank must consistent system foridentifying, monitoring, control manage risks. these system must endorse andunderstood credit officers, also board management.in deregulate bank sector, division control responsibility bank particularimportance. owner must take active interest bank set broad strategic guideline andpolicies risk management internal controls. bank board must access timely andadequate information act necessary. there must division labour make clearto member management staff specific responsibility have.from swedish bank crisis i would single type risk.credit risk general, link issue collateral, - expect - main problem.it experience bank come shelter world strict regulation havegood consistent system credit evaluation documentation. today, bank must creditpolicies, state kind credit wish grant. usually, small simple loan providedat branch office level, large complicate loan provide successively high levels.banks also adopt internal risk evaluation system individual loan gradedaccording risk. loan documentation improve facilitate monitor loan also toensure bank collect loan event judicial process.in sweden, concentration credit risk major problem crises. some two third thelosses link sharp price decline real estate.a loan collateral must evaluate separately, something forget themany year regulation. if expect return investment make loan uncertainor adequate loan case given, irrespective collateral. the reason isthat collateral, crisis situation, often prof worth far le expected. this isparticularly true tie borrower - company put buildingas collateral.the linkage credit risk foreign exchange risk large swedish bankingcrises. this see also asian crisis 1998. for example: swedish borrower want loansin yen german mark interest rate currency low. when swedishcurrency depreciated, borrower could repay high loan value revenuestream local currency. the bank believe hedge foreignexchange risk since fund currency loan given, fail see thecorresponding increase credit risk.other risk le prominent swedish crisis but, opinion, increasingimportance bank world. among operational risks. several recent financialdebacles, bar crisis, due operational risk. even though y2k problem wassuccessfully managed, huge computer system bank could cause large loss technical orother failure occur.another risk, mind become increasingly important, may call “strategic risk”.the financial market country highly competitive. in order survive prosper, banksmust take bold decision new activities, new establishments, mergers, technological investmentsand on. decision like taken, go wrong, bank may suffer largelosses may even go bankrupt.to handle risks, internal control internal audit system become increasinglyimportant. the huge mass information modern bank make impossible supervisor tomonitor individual transactions. they must rely bank maintain reliable internal controlfunctions, verify accuracy transaction operation also take broaderview bank’s compliance rule policy well external rule andpolicies. bi review 66/20004supervisiontraditional supervision type, may call “checking ledger”, verifyingthat transaction properly record formally correct. to extent must remain, butthe supervisor’s effort sense reduce apply modern statistical methods, eg forsampling, make sure bank adequate internal control systems.instead, supervision risk-oriented focus activities, pose significant risksto individual bank (differing bank bank). risk-oriented supervision also imply strictersupervision large bank bank take large risk others. supervisor focus onevaluating monitor risk management systems, internal controls, corporate governance, andinformation systems. this call large supervisory resource sophisticate skills:lawyers, also economists, financial analysts, statisticians, mathematician accountants. if thelaw permits, indeed should, supervisor could call outside expert assist.in order effective, supervision must case conduct consolidate basis, toinclude part financial conglomerate even non-financial affiliates. the increasingblurring boundary different financial activity build large financialconglomerates make consolidate supervision crucial. consolidation include financial well asnon-financial entity within country, also world-wide. the cooperation exchange ofinformation supervisor different financial activity (banking, security trade andinsurance) important, domestically well globally. informal formal agreement must beconcluded facilitate cooperation. supervisor license banks, affiliates, iftheir organisational structure prevent effective supervision. in vein, home supervisorsshould allow bank establish affiliate abroad, host authority will toexchange important information regard development affect affiliate.transparency key. bank induced, force voluntarily, properly discloseinformation activity general public. information must also timely, relevant andaccurate. in way, daily “supervision” bank market analysts, depositor andothers. it understand bank activity consider strategic secret cannotbe divulged, view few tend think.hence, relate subject great importance issue accounting. to create transparency,accounting rules, include valuation rules, must provide clear picture reflect true situation ofa bank. let give example. a linger problem many country bank hold largeamounts non-performing loan companies, even state-owned formerlystate-owned. the loan usually value accord realistic, low, values. in view, thisis helpful even seem improve financial statement banks. nobody fool aboutthe actual situation bad loan well know market. the loan preferablybe transfer book asset management company - price realistic market value,of course.under circumstances, supervisor require bank consistent true system forthe valuation loans, perform non-performing, without collateral. these systemsshould also take account set aside adequate provision weak loans. these provisionsshould reflect expect loss bank. in calculate losses, collateral may take intoaccount, early mentioned, important collateral conservatively value itsvalue tend decline sharply default situation.for country aim credible financial system, audit standard must high andapproaching best international practices. furthermore, supervisor maintain close andregular contact major account audit firm country. this serf provideand receive information individual banks, also explain get feedback thedevelopment new rule regulation implement market. 5bis review 66/2000asset management companiesbefore proceeding, i would like make point concern asset management companies(amc’s) touch upon above, since seem controversial many countries. they certainlywere sweden peak crisis.asset management company simply company major part non-performingassets bank transferred, give loan historic reason grow tobecome considerable part bank’s balance sheet. the purpose asset managementcompany dispose asset quickly profitably possible close down.as i see it, may two main cause transfer assets. first, experience show thatbankers best equip handle restructure work collateral take thebank consequence fail loans. banker may possibly good lend money handlingminor non-performing loans, usually little experience reorganise industrial activitiesand manage real estate company extent require amc. these activity require adifferent competence.the trouble banker often fail see this, particular heavily involve inhandling fail credits. they talk long term relation customer. they argue theloans could keep book bank relevant competence could hired. i stronglybelieve true. if proper restructure done, professional restructure peoplewithout historical relation customer it. whenever i persuade otherwise ihave late prove wrong.the second argument transfer non-performing asset relate this. when themanagement bank large number bad credit take care of, exactly do.all capacity use take care problem time - money - thinkabout future. this disastrous whole organisation, tend become backwardlooking defensive instead forward look offensive. only bad asset ofthe book bank, mind management thus employee become aimedtowards future.having decide transfer bad assets, next obstacle decide prices. the bankusually consider non-performing asset quite valuable, least long run. sell atwhat might consider present market price create big hole balance sheet makemanagement comfortable. the management new amc quite naturally different view. ithas wish get asset balance sheet value late turn excessively high.according experience, important listen amc rather bank purposeis get restructure done. if management board amc make reasonable profitsby sell assets, indeed purpose, do. however, haveacquired asset high prices, every sale show loss may even approachthe owner get capital. the owner like this, whether company own thebank deliver asset external financial investors. hence board avoidshowing loss consequently little restructure done.thus transfer asset market price essential restructure process work. the troubleis may force write asset book bank, since theyhave value correctly. this turn uncover hole balance sheet may requirea capital injection. and put capital bank may feasible time, politicalor reasons. at point, always start discussion market price really are.this happen sweden happen elsewhere. but hole balance sheet always ahole, whether decide see not. either new capital must put bank thetransfer asset must inject amc real value asset becomesobvious everyone. put money straight bank speed restructure process. bi review 66/20006consolidated supervisory authoritiesi mention supervision conduct consolidate basis, cover activity indifferent financial non-financial sectors. should also organisation supervisory authoritybe “consolidated”? several countries, include uk, korea, australia others recentlymoved direction create “fsa” responsible supervision banks,securities market insurance. in sweden, fsa since 1990.is consolidation necessary useful countries? in view, optimal structure thesupervisory authority depend structure individual country. in many countries, banksconduct important financial activity security market le important. here atleast bank supervision must independent, adequate resource skilled staff. this crucial.in many countries, bank supervision part central bank. this benefit bank supervisionbecause central bank usually legal independence, adequate resource attract qualifiedstaff. combine bank supervision security insurance supervision probably imply thatsupervision move outside central bank, since security insurance supervision notnormally task central banks. in sense, bank supervision may become weaker. in view, inmarkets bank dominate financial sector integration security andinsurance market le pronounced, keep supervision separate within central bankmakes good sense.having say this, i acknowledge present tendency bank merge financialinstitutions, financial instrument look increasingly alike whether create banksor institutions. these tendency would indicate correspond need supervision ofdifferent financial sector cooperate close close and, perhaps, finally merge. the trend isclearly see europe, reinforce common currency, gradually develop also othercountries. a mention above, way organise supervision sweden. but i notsee need consolidate supervisory authority specific country structure itsfinancial market requires. a intermediate step, cooperation agreement thesupervisory authority encouraged.a strong rationale locate bank supervision central bank bank stability crucialimportance conduct monetary policy. in addition, central bank power provideliquidity - normal well exceptional circumstance - banks, instance lender lastresort. to this, obvious central bank must full knowledge financialsituation bank.however, also good argument keep supervision separate central bank. theremay conflict role supervisor role lender last resort. if bankwould fail, supervise central bank, central bank may feel incline provideliquidity support economically defendable. banker may know case moralhazard may therefore strong separate supervisor. rule public administration oftroubled bank outside central bank may give help respect.there may also conflict interest relate monetary policy. if bank fail beingsupervised central bank, may affect central bank’s reputation credibility. in myview, important arguments, credibility central bank basic tosystemic stability also conduct monetary policy.what role central bank relation financial stability independentsupervisory authority? there still remain increasingly important question concern themacroeconomic “oversight” macro prudential supervision financial system. a matter offact, question often tend neglect ordinary supervision remain within thecentral bank, many way different character day day supervision.to effectuate responsibility conduct monetary policy ensure stable payment system,a central bank must monitor risk financial sector. in capacity, central bank mainlyinterested systemic risks, potential problem

excessive leverage ratio borrower might same. it isnatural central bank closely monitor development take prompt action findsthat financial stability endangered. in case may power take direct actionitself, may inform parties, political authority supervisors, urge themto apply necessary measures.i would like emphasise macro prudential analysis mean central bank isduplicating work supervisory authority. we examine audit individualfinancial institutions, clearly task supervisors. most information gatheredfrom sources, include supervisory authority itself.an increase number central banks, eg england, canada sweden establish astructured procedure macro prudential analyses. in sweden, conclusion publish asemi-annual stability report, analyse development risk bank system

interpret manyindividual piece economic data come virtually every day. how important particularstatistic? be indicate strength weakness? be special factor take intoaccount interpreted? doe implication monetary policy? this “bottom-up” approach widely use mean almost daily discussion medium andelsewhere current future strength economy.my observation past four year bulk people express view subjectinvariably argue economy weak reserve bank judge be. there fewon side act balance. the majority people present view think reservebank recur tendency over-estimate strength economy.this view quite wrong: fact consistently under-estimated strength. you onlyhave consult half-yearly appearance parliamentary committee see everyoccasion i explain modest slowdown growth forecast notarrive. the correct way summarise various view say reserve bank under-estimated strength australian economy, critic under-estimated largermargin. bi review 64/20004this unusual. there tendency expansionary phase business cycle beunduly influence inevitable sign weakness individual indicator henceto lose sight underlie strength. there tendency people able see woodfor trees. this true economists, bureaucrats,

monetary policy could affect unemployment - view,monetary policy affect inflation. you please know i member thatschool. bad monetary policy certainly make unemployment worse, follow goodmonetary

australia,compared 3.7% us;• period, reduce unemployment rate peak 4.6percentage point compare 3.8 percentage point us. the fact rate at4.0% low 6.6% entirely due low start point, due tothe relatively mild nature early 1990s recession.in short, clear best thing monetary policy reduce unemployment toprolong expansion delay reduce size subsequent recession. on occasion, thatmeans tighten monetary policy early forestall inflationary pressures, alternative morevigorous application brake inflation build momentum.a third question could ask approach concern australia’s potential growth rate.we are, i think, rightly proud growth performance current expansion, especially ofour average 4½% per annum since mid-1997 hit asian crisis. but mayask think 4½% good result - maybe economy capable grow good dealfaster without push inflation much. we hear australia’s improve productivityperformance 1990s, can’t allow u even growth?there two answer question - mechanical one policy one:• the mechanical one potential growth rate determine supply side theeconomy growth labour force rate labour productivity. while thesecond 1½% per annum high eighties, first - thegrowth labour force - 1¼% per annum lower. this largely due low growth inthe working-age population, much small rise participation rate femaleparticipation rate already quite high male participation rate declining. sothe improve productivity

community policymakers key issues, asthe prevention financial crisis architecture international monetary system. thisexplains european central bank (ecb) follow iif’s initiative great interest andwhy, evening, i please able share think you. give global nature ofthe iif’s activity concomitance annual meet annual meet imfand world bank, i shall focus international dimension ecb’s activities.let start recall that, 1 january 1999, 11 member state euro areatransferred monetary sovereignty new supranational institution, ecb. since then, thegoverning council ecb solely responsible decide euro area’s monetarypolicy. the executive board ecb implement council’s decision mainlythrough national central bank (ncbs) country adopt euro. the ecb andthe ncbs together form “eurosystem”. accordingly, eurosystem central bank theeuro area, although legal personality; confer upon ecb thencbs. on 1 january 2001 euro area welcome new member state, greece. moreover, fivedays - 28 september 2000 - danish citizen decide referendum whether countryshall also adopt euro.the eurosystem enjoy full independence pursue statutory mandate ensure maintainprice stability. “independence”, however, mean “isolation”. the eurosystem, words,cannot perform task without establish appropriate external relation marketparticipants policymakers.this even i shall focus multilateral relation ecb - generally, theeurosystem - maintain policymakers international (ie neither euro area noreuropean union) level. these relation promote within organisation imf, oecdand bis, well forum g7 g20. i shall first provide brief overview thecurrent relation ecb eurosystem, institutional angle pointof view rationale. without want exhaustive, i shall highlight challengeswhich ecb - and, generally, international official community - may confront with.in context, i shall outline ecb’s assessment specific issue, namely issue ofprivate sector involvement resolution financial crises.1.the ecb process international cooperationinstitutional frameworkthe treaty establish european community (the “treaty”) stipulate europeaninstitutions allow either speak act behalf euro area international level.the euro area, like eurosystem, legal personality. this imply euro area cannotnegotiate conclude public international law agreement become member internationalorganisations. this also imply euro area represent externally communityinstitutions body legal personality; means: (1) council minister bi review 79/20002finance economy eu (“ecofin council”); (2) ecb and, accordance anecb decision, one ncbs. while treaty provide interaction ecofincouncil ecb number cases, entity well-defined responsibilities.this legal framework provide guideline give euro area voice international level. inparticular, external representation euro area field international cooperationinvolves task entrust eurosystem, decision centralise hand governingcouncil ecb. this facilitate decision-making process regard externalrepresentation. while ncbs may participate international forum depend respectivememberships (eg g7, g10, g20), participation ecb relevant forum give continuity andvisibility external representation euro area.the role ecb play international community differ depend eurosystem tasksinvolved international relations. in particular, ecb play three different roles. first, ecbis primary autonomous counterpart whenever eurosystem’s exclusive competencies- ie monetary policy relate central bank task - involve international relations. second,with regard issue relate exchange rate euro, ecb share ecofincouncil responsibility consultation third party - example g7 level - andcommunication general public. however, ecb solely responsible decide foreignexchange operations. third, within limit eurosystem’s field competence, ecb canadvise euro area policymakers international issues. in specific circumstance ecb mayalso act “catalyst cooperation”. this may happen eurosystem develop commonviews issue fall within competence euro area authority (mainly nationalgovernments), eurosystem strong institutional interest, accordance itsstatute. this applies, instance, issue relate stability global financial market andthe architecture international monetary system. in deal issues, ecb mayprovide value add development common euro area position take internationallevel.rationale cooperationthe relation ecb policymakers international level involve number ofcooperation activity design increase “joint welfare” result policies.generally speaking, “international cooperation” take place within relevant organisation (eg imf)and forum (eg g7), competent authority different country either give policy(eg monetary policy) set policy (eg macroeconomic policies). in context, term“country” understand include monetary union euro area. in principle,cooperation include wide spectrum activities, namely:• consultation, simply consist mutual exchange information views;• surveillance, ie systematic monitor assessment, independent organisation,of economic policy members. within context, international communitymay also develop “standards” “codes”, constitute form multilateralrule-making implement voluntary basis; and• coordination, ie agreement separate policymakers take implement jointdecisions.as i shall discuss, eurosystem directly involve most, although all, activities.the economic rationale ecb’s involvement international cooperation activity rest theinternational externality domestic policies, ie spillover effect policy one economy canproduce economy via, instance, interest rates, exchange rate equity prices. the euroarea, however, large relatively close economy. the degree trade openness euro areais much small constituent countries. measure average export importsas share euro area gdp, degree openness 16% euro area. by contrast, prior tomonetary union, average export ratio individual member state stand around 35% 1997. 3bis review 79/2000this help understand euro area affect spillover effect extentas small open economies, eurosystem position pursue primary objective- maintain domestic price stability - effective way.this mean, however, ecb neglect external economic development whenestablishing euro area monetary policy. on contrary, ecb take development intodue account may impact domestic economic developments, thus pricestability.the ecb’s approach external economic development three implication participation ofthe eurosystem process international cooperation area macroeconomic policies.first, substantial component ecb’s cooperation reciprocal exchange information andviews within international organisation fora. regular consultation external economicdevelopments enhance ecb’s ability analyse outlook price development euroarea. by take account possible spillover effect third countries’ policy actions,consultation play part reduce likelihood misinterpret impact externaldevelopments domestic variables. give voluntary nature, consultation impinge theecb’s independence.second, consultation supplement international surveillance. in case, third andindependent party, imf oecd, regularly monitor ass economic policiesof members. in regard, whenever euro area monetary policy surveillance, ecbis solely responsible interaction imf oecd. international surveillance add theecb’s transparency imf oecd make assessment euro area economicpolicies available public. in context surveillance, international community alsodeveloping common understand number “rules game” implement eachindividual country voluntary basis. an example give imf code good practice ontransparency monetary financial policies. the selection best practice rule enhancescompetition transparency among policymakers, thus make idea good public governance acentral component international cooperation.third, consultation surveillance form international cooperation relevant tothe ecb area macroeconomic policies. any form ex ante international coordination ofmonetary policy macroeconomic policy could easily incompatible theeurosystem’s mandate independence. attempt coordinate ex ante would blur thespecific responsibility individual policymakers, also reduce accountability. indetermining monetary policy stance, ecb take account relevantinformation. it cannot let policy determine solely current future course otherpolicies. this could easily compromise maintenance price stability. the inappropriateness exante policy coordination also apply specific option exchange rate coordinationbetween large economic areas, instance set range fluctuation majorcurrencies. in regard, i like take opportunity reaffirm ecb notpursue exchange rate target. our objective maintain stable price euro area aspecific level euro’s exchange rate.last least, eurosystem take part process international cooperation itsrole “primary player” - ie euro area monetary exchange rate policy involve - butalso role advisor euro area authority international issue “catalyst forcooperation”. in case, international cooperation mainly design ensure global financialstability enhance architecture international monetary system. the economic rationale forthis kind cooperation summarise follows. first, financial instability materialise evenwith sound macroeconomic policies, result factor inadequate supervision emergingmarket economy so-called “contagion”, ie international transmission instability. second, aworld divide sovereign state inevitably move rapidly towards full capital mobilitythan towards common rules. the asymmetry free movement capital, take placeon global scale, policymaking, remain mainly national domain, haveimplications financial stability call enhance international cooperation. bi review 79/200042.the challenge aheadlet turn challenge ahead. i shall distinguish challenge relate theinstitutional framework international cooperation challenge pertain specific contentsof international cooperation.institutional challengesover past two years, representation euro area international organisation forum hasbeen decide accordance aforementioned guideline lay treaty. theseguidelines decisions, however, direct legal bear statute and/or internal rulesgoverning international organisation fora. this imply need gradual adaptation thetraditional institutional framework international relations. that framework tailor theinvolvement monetary union such, advent eurosystem - and, generally,the euro area - new actor international relations. until now, process adaptation beenconducted large extent basis ad hoc solutions. in long run, however, morefundamental approach may needed.a first challenge arise fact international intergovernmental organisation - imfand oecd - create time national state responsible domesticpolicymaking. a result, individual country - ecb representative theeuro area - member imf oecd, even organisation deal, amongother things, euro area monetary exchange rate policy. both imf oecd haveadjusted internal rule reflect new context. in particular, executive board imfhas grant permanent observer status ecb, oecd allow ecb participatein work relevant committee work group separate member europeancommunity delegation alongside commission.a second challenge definition adequate representation euro area thoseinternational forum minister central bank governor represent (eg g7 g20).here problem raise creation euro area capability speak - whenappropriate - “with one voice”. specific arrangement euro area counterpart thevarious forum deal problem. these arrangements, however, may still call someimprovement. for instance, true issue architecture international monetarysystem fall primarily competence individual euro area countries. the ecofin council,however, need gain increasingly high profile issue discuss competentfora (eg g7). this would strengthen european stance simplify process decision-makingat international level. in respect, eurosystem may provide - i discus afterwards- significant value add euro area governments. more generally speaking, ecb would welcomeany initiative euro area government design enhance - compliance respectivecompetencies ecofin council eurosystem - credibility clout euro areain international community.the content cooperation: ecb’s assessment “private sector involvement”the major challenge ecb eurosystem year come becomemore directly involve process international cooperation beyond area macroeconomiccooperation. this relates, particular, current work do strengthen internationalfinancial architecture, close area traditional competence expertise centralbanking community. the eurosystem support process two reasons. first, theachievement primary objective safeguard price stability euro area would befacilitated safe resilient international financial system. second, statute ofthe eurosystem establish eurosystem shall contribute smooth conduct policiesrelating stability financial system. 5bis review 79/2000a wide range topic could discuss here. however, interest iif show therecent past issue “private sector involvement” lead focus ecb’s assessment ofongoing discussions.owing change magnitude composition capital flows, private sector play anincreasingly important role finance emerge market economies. accord recent iifestimates, 1990s 85% total net inflow capital major borrow country come fromthe private sector. such inflow average usd 170 billion per annum, compare usd 35 billionper annum 1980s. by contrast, net official flow average usd 30 billion

towards international expansion, perhaps selectedmarket segments. i’m sure people audience good qualify predict futuredevelopments i am. i instead focus another important issue: production cost sizeof markets.geographic expansion give institution opportunity sell exist product new customer innew markets. a result, institution spread cost large customer base. however,one may question whether regional national market even nordic market - least someproduct segment - large enough give institutions’ production activity necessary size. 9bis review 78/2000this raise question whether separate production distribution. many institutions,particularly small ones, may find beneficial distribute companies’ products. differentcooperation agreement make possible small player offer broad product range theywould able own. we see several example norway, particularlyamong save banks. at time, large institution may benefit offer theirproducts distribution institutions.this may contribute keep nordic bank - large small - competitive retail market.in segment large enterprises, however, production distribution perhaps difficult toseparate. this may imply many nordic bank small compete

could negative effect financial stability. on hand, bank activitiesin several country strong position cope recession crisis situation agiven country bank whose activity confine one single country. this positive afinancial stability point view.5.2the internet distribution channel financial serviceslet turn impact internet bank financial service industry.the internet create new opportunity traditional banks. for example, bank wellpositioned become key operator trade internet. they large customer base andstrong brand names, offer payment transmission services, advertise space link theirhome pages. internationally, many bank agreement internet telecommunicationcompanies development internet bank marketplace internet. this probablyjust begin trend towards increase cooperation across industry boundaries.the internet pose great challenge well. it clearly intensify competition industry. thisis partly easy customer compare price term partly simplerfor new operator penetrate market. the internet may also change relative position ofexisting market participants.many nordic bank establish form internet banking. so far, service offer onthe internet relatively simple, example loan applications, bill payment account transfers.these probably important service majority customers. several bank also offertrading share fund unit internet. the product range user-friendliness beexpected increase period ahead. i’m sure discussion conference give anindication future product developments. bi review 78/200010nordic country rank top globally term access internet. nordic bank thus aunique opportunity serve substantial share customer via internet. this also relevance tocross-border integration. bank focus internet distribution perhaps particularly interest inmarkets many internet users.although estimate vary, safe say internet significantly reduce banks’ variablecosts. however, substantial it investment may necessary keep pace technological andmarket developments. in isolation, may contribute increase banks’ fix costs.as result, competitive environment may change. there danger over-investment. sunkcosts account large share overall costs. this may lead marginal price fight forvolume intensifies. this could negative effect bank profitability.many nordic bank small customer base distribute fix cost large foreigncompetitors. a mentioned, bank try compensate enter cooperationagreements. however, might difficult reduce total cost without substantial reduction thecosts traditional distribution. bank thus face challenge regard scalingback physical distribution network.in general, financial institution face considerable challenge adapt new technologies,intensified competition globalisation. substantial investment probably require keepthem competitive. both management employee devote considerable attention tothese aspects. the wrong solution approach could weaken banks’ competitive position, profitabilityand financial strength. this may also negative implication financial stability. however, idon’t want give impression it’s doom gloom. new technology offer greatopportunities streamline operation improve efficiency. there also new businessopportunities. although financial sector undergo fundamental changes, competent marketparticipants every opportunity thrive change environment.6.consequences authoritiesdevelopments financial sector also pose challenge authorities. let give fewexamples.the growth complex financial conglomerate represent considerable challenge supervisionand crisis resolution. the international trend towards one national supervisory authority probablyadvantageous respect. the nordic country lead way here.the growth institution significant presence several country increase need forcooperation

addition, structural change also influence central banks’ role “lender last resort”.although structural change alter risk profile financial system, shouldn’t view asnegative. on contrary, change may necessary reap benefit efficientintermediation save good risk management. change thus something authoritiesshould facilitate adapt - high quality supervision surveillance throughregulatory change

internationalbar association amsterdam. the netherlands is, course, well-known nationalfolklore witness example. however, legal circle country also knownas birthplace, year 1583, found father modern law nation trulyeuropean citizen: hugo de groot or, latin name, grotius. interestingly, grotius already deal inhis day challenge question where, one hand, unification law across bordersis desirable where, hand, national differences, often base cultural diversity, standin way unification. nowadays, still one core question creation andfurther elaboration new corpus iuris monetae euro. i shall enter detail newbody monetary financial law later. let first highlight historic event youwho come afar may, thus, le acquaint main feature economic andmonetary union.as crown internal market european union (eu), euro come existence on1 january 1999. this occur irrevocable fix exchange rate currency ofthose 11 eu member state qualify economically, also legally, adoptionof euro. these member state are: austria, belgium, finland, france, germany, ireland, italy,luxembourg, netherlands, portugal spain. greece adopt euro 1 january 2001,while denmark hold referendum adoption euro 28 september 2000. swedenand unite kingdom introduce euro respective countries, may change,of course, future.the birth euro preceded, 1 june 1998, establishment ecb, europeansystem central bank (escb) eurosystem. the escb compose ecb the15 national central bank (ncbs) eu member states. the eurosystem compose ecband 11 ncbs member state adopt euro. the six member ecb’sexecutive board governor 11 ncbs together form govern council. this isthe eurosystem’s high decision-making body, which, among things, adopt theeurosystem’s regulatory framework.in speech today, i elaborate upon ecb, also community legislator, nationallegislators market participant struggle question hugo de grootalready address day another context: view introduction euro, is, onthe one hand, unification law desirable may, hand, national differencescontinue exist? or, remain close title speech: where, extent, theeuro act catalyst legal convergence, convergence appropriate?as preliminary remark, introduction euro globalisation world’s financialmarkets clear incentive development towards “one market, one currency, one law”. thereare, however, least two important impediment law emerge near future.first, community law principle subsidiarity proportionality. subsidiarity requiresthat community legislator adopt legislation necessary achieve community’sobjectives. proportionality require type legal act adopt proportionate, ie tooheavy, relation objective achieved.second, eu consist many different legal system member states, although thereare, course, similar type legal system common orientation (roman law, anglo-saxon law bi review 77/20002the scandinavian systems). recognition peculiarity legal system accordance withthe principle subsidiarity proportionality lead automatically legal diversity.in addition, eurosystem also important mention system-related task execute ina decentralise fashion ncbs respective jurisdictions. for example, regard tothe eurosystem’s single monetary policy, ecb’s decision-making body decide policy,but ncbs execute monetary policy operation respective jurisdictions.all all, system community law evolved, also euro, dominated, aspectrum high low legislative influence, notion unification, harmonisation,approximation, implementation self-regulation. the road towards unification, achievable all,is evolutionary nature, legal action determine case-by-case basis. this nota bad development. after all, unification goal itself. legal action awell-balanced relation objective achieved. particularly area monetary andfinancial law, create well-balanced legal structure ensure fulfilment themonetary union’s objective present.let me, without pretension exhaustive, briefly touch several aspect new corpusiuris monetae explain we, community level, try strike balance betweenunification one hand, differentiation other.institutionally, legal convergence take place regard statute eu ncbs. the eutreaty prescribe escb ncbs independent eurosystem ncbs fullyintegrated eurosystem. this require adaptation statute ncbs. however, legalrequirements central bank independence integration eurosystem preciselydefined treaty. therefore, ecb predecessor, european monetary institute, havedone so-called convergence reports. these report ass whether memberstate qualify introduction euro also contain chapter legal convergence.they develop feature institutional, personal financial independence. in addition, identifyareas statute ncbs likely require adaptation view integration ncbs inthe eurosystem. these report thus give guidance national legislator process adaptingsuch statutes. a result, new statute ncbs come existence, which, far aseurosystem-related task concerned, often contain similar provisions. yet, treaty notprescribe harmonisation statute ncbs may perform own, non-eurosystem relate tasks, aslong task interfere objective task eurosystem. overall, statute ofncbs therefore still differ considerably one another. in conclusion, beenharmonisation, rather approximation law area.operationally, legal convergence take place result adoption escb’s regulatoryframework. this framework prepare emi adopt govern council theecb shortly introduction euro.the escb’s regulatory framework consist variety legal acts. one part intend begenerally applicable bind market participant across euro area. another part intendedto govern internal relationship component eurosystem escb, thecase may be. an example former ecb regulation minimum reserves, statisticalinformation ecb sanctions. they apply party concern across euro area. an exampleof latter ecb guidelines. these address to, bind on, eurosystem ncbs. usuallythey require implementation legal act ncbs apply govern legalrelationship counterparties. these act implement ecb’s legal act may aregulatory contractual nature mixture thereof. this depend legal tradition thejurisdictions adopted. in former acts, ecb regulations, point gravitywith regard application lie clearly ecb. in latter, act implement theecb’s rules, lie clearly ncbs. in words, first case unification law,in latter approximation.the justification balance approach following. obviously, implementation singlemonetary policy euro area requires, one hand, single set rule establish at, andapplied by, centre, ecb. on hand, view decentralise execution 3bis review 77/2000policy, need rules, tailor towards specific jurisdiction theactual operation counterparties take place. of course, eurosystem establishedmechanisms ensure level playing-field across system system-related task ismaintained order avoid regional distortion implementation single monetary policy.clearly, ecb party steer towards level legal convergence need toreap benefit introduction euro. the community legislator, particular eucouncil, also pass legislation variety area relate euro.for example, two council regulation adopt introduction euro. thesecouncil regulation cover topic which, view introduction single currency, need bedealt uniform manner. they cover issue continuity contracts, conversionrates, rounding, substitution euro currency participate member states,transitional provision introduction euro banknote coin 1 january 2002. sincethese council regulation generally applicable, example unification law. theydo preclude, however, adoption auxiliary legislation national level.in addition, community legislator adopt directives, area payment securitiessettlement system example, apply scriptural payment euro. since directivesrequire implementation, may regard example approximation law.finally, community legislator issue several recommendation topic bankingcharges conversion euro, dual display price monetary amounts, andcollector coins, medal tokens. since recommendation non-binding, may beconsidered incentive self-regulation, either national legislator market participants.legal convergence monopoly legislators. market participant may contribute well. inan increasingly globalise financial world, fortunately make considerable contribution.there various representative organisation market participant which, view theintroduction euro result integration financial markets, adopted, theprocess adopting, standard market documentation transactions. a good example theeuropean master agreement (ema) european bank federation. the ema aim toconsolidate harmonise standard various master agreement use within euro area andseveral neighbour countries, particular repurchase transaction security lending. at thesame time, allow parties’ preference regard applicable law, jurisdiction,contractual language specific national legal requirement may take account. the ecbwelcomes market initiative legal convergence.legal convergence spread throughout europe, cross border eu stand atpresent. thirteen central eastern european country apply membership eu. theyrange, geographically, baltic state north turkey south. a precondition ofmembership accession country implement so-called acquis communautaire, ie thearound 80,000 page community law provision which, among many areas, includelegislation euro well. it interest see accession country enrich europe’slegal landscape. when implement community’s acquis may, one hand, profit fromalready well establish structures, could lead fairly high level harmonisation. however,taking account cultural diversity country concerned, considerable legal differencesmay, perhaps, rule out.in case, accession country make ncbs independent accommodate theintegration ncbs eurosystem. it important note accession eu theintroduction euro will, likelihood, coincide.from ecb’s perspective, furthermore important legislation accession countriesin area banking, security markets, payment settlement system collateral madecompatible eu standards. after all, rule single financial passport, membershipof eu imply financial institution accession country may obtain access toeurosystem facility monetary policy operation payment systems. bi review 77/20004this daunt task accession country ecb stand ready assist them, closecooperation course eu authority involve particular thecommission. indeed, ecb build extensive experience deliver opinion draftlegislation field competence community national legislator consult theecb. it go without say accession country may profit ecb’s experience thisfield.all all, birth euro trigger tremendous legal activity, legislatorsspecifically, also market participant generally. i happy, frankly also proud, suchactivity successful. the escb’s regulatory framework important step towards legalconvergence europe prove function well. moreover, i aware legalderailments result introduction euro. an interest example lack legalproblems continuity contract monetary obligation denominate incurrencies sub-units euro. the continuity contract introductionof euro inside outside eu subject extensive legal studies. however, end,and perhaps also result provision eu council’s euro regulation, legal problem notarise area.this mean need legal convergence. on contrary, build asolid house euro, refinement furbishment remain, course, matter attention. suchrefinements doubt follow evolutionary path describe earlier, attempt madeto strike balance need unification wish maintain national differences.as far statute ncbs concerned, may perhaps continue converge time, butthere urgent need adaptation statute eu ncbs present. the situation is,of course, different ncbs yet member eurosystem ncbs theaccession countries.as far escb’s regulatory framework concerned, subject legal

debate themicro- macro-prudential dimension financial stability one example.for sake clarity, therefore, i put forward two intentionally stylise definition termsso highlight differences. a i portray them, sketch extreme conceptualspectrum along perspective supervisor authority located. whileit common associate supervisor micro-prudential dimension, become apparentthat, accord definition, supervisory perspective inevitably include element both, thatthe macro-prudential element gain grind think recent years. indeed, themix differ within supervisory profession may even vary context discussion.the distinction micro- macro-prudential dimension financial stability bestdrawn term objective task conception mechanism influencingeconomic outcomes. it le instrument use pursuit objectives. letme elaborate.the macro-prudential objective define limit cost economy financialdistress, include arise moral hazard induce policy pursued. one couldthink objective limit likelihood failure, correspond costs, significantportions financial system. this often loosely refer limit “systemic risk”.in contrast, micro-prudential objective see limit likelihood failure ofindividual institutions. again, loosely put, mean limit “idiosyncratic risk”. so defined, thisobjective turn probably best rationalise mean protect depositors.an obvious implication macro-prudential dimension focus risk correlatedfailures, pay great attention characteristic institution, size, determine itssignificance economy, regard peer-group analysis le relevant, potentiallymisleading, unless tie institution’s systemic role. after all, deviation average behaviourassume average correct. the micro-prudential dimension, contrast, consider eachinstitution right, thus concern correlation per se view peer-groupanalysis natural monitor tool.to bring contrast, think financial system portfolio securities, ie individualinstitutions. the macro-prudential perspective would focus overall performance theportfolio; micro-prudential vision would give equal separate weight performance ofeach constituent securities.compare, instance, solvency standard might appropriate macro-prudentialperspective would consistent micro-prudential objective i sketched.by solvency standard i mean, simplicity, target probability insolvency.first, macro-prudential solvency standard individual institution would calibrate withreference systemic significance; micro-prudential counterpart would uniform all.second, macro-prudential standard system whole would derive top-downapproach, base view likelihood cost systemic crisis. this, turn, wouldinevitably imply judgement possible correlation financial difficulty among institutions.the correspond micro-prudential standard would derive bottom-up approach, theaggregation uniform solvency standard would apply “representative” institution.as corollary, acceptable probability systemic crisis implicit macro-prudential standardwould low acceptable probability distress individual institution, thehigher cost term output. on hand, overall level capital system could beeither high lower, depend size institution correlation exposures, whichdetermine effective degree diversification system. 3bis review 76/2000in term conception function economy, macro-prudential dimension bedefined view system outcome critically determine collective behaviour

collective action condition ofindividual institutions.it follow macro-prudential paradigm stress possibility action may seemdesirable reasonable perspective individual institution may result unwelcome systemoutcomes. this logical contradiction micro-prudential vision define here.illustrations fallacy composition hard find. for instance, single bank isonly natural tighten lend standard recession, bank resultingimpact economic activity lead deterioration credit quality portfolio. themirror image upswing could generate unsustainable lend boom, sow seed ofsubsequent financial instability. likewise, cut exposure market price fall deepen thedecline prices, lead dry liquidity exacerbate financial distress. andsimilar mechanism explain aggregation short-maturity credit single counterpartymight actually increase risk profile individual exposure compare portfolio alonger maturity.the quintessential micro-prudential dictum “financial stability ensure long andevery institution sound”. from macro-prudential perspective, two objection levy againstthis, surface, compel statement. first, may strive much; second, may deliver toolittle.it may strive much, occasional failure

soundness ofeach individual institution pursue crucial. unless authority take account impact ofthe collective behaviour institution economic outcomes, may fail monitor risk takeremedial action appropriately.where perspective supervisor fit along intentionally stylise micro-/macro-prudentialspectrum? in principle, could locate anywhere. in practice, i suspect micro-prudentialelements still predominate.to sure, increase number supervisor would feel quite comfortable associatedwith task limit systemic risk. certainly, reference systemic cost failure therationalisation policy common. and, i argue later, macro-prudential facet thesupervisors’ task indeed receive great attention recent years, especially themonitoring potential vulnerability financial system calibration supervisoryreview

*introductionit pleasure give open address conference welcome toamsterdam. after couple years, annual conference establish reputation forstimulating discussion economic policy issue europe. this year’s programme look set tofurther enhance reputation.issues heterogeneity subject much debate analysis run-up introductionof euro. the debate continue since then, too, conference doubt provide freshinsights issue. enlargement also conference agenda. obviously enlargement willhave implication current eu members, well accession countries. further, linksbetween enlargement heterogeneity.this afternoon i would like talk little heterogeneity euro area, implication forpolicymakers. i would also like look forward discus issue context eu andemu enlargement.heterogeneityfirst, think heterogeneity. we use think heterogeneity mainly termsof nation states. we focus difference countries. of course, discussingeconomic policy think national differences. we also highlight difference otherareas – netherlands mass colour supporter different country early thissummer european soccer championships. and, sydney olympics provide anopportunity celebrate national achievement, well individual sport excellence.traditionally, monetary policy also conduct national basis, although europeanmonetary policy become coordinate run-up introduction euro. othereconomic policy generally continue set national basis, although eu membershipdoes impose degree consistency. heterogeneity also occur dimensions, asbetween sector economy. i return point minute, first want make coupleof comment country differences.there many study recent year focus difference euro area countries.and, study find evidence contrary, appear general consensus thatbusiness cycle converge extent past decade two. a central banker, i amnaturally interest inflation differentials, certainly low were10 20 year ago. for example, inflation rate among current euro area member range 21% initaly 5% germany last quarter 1980. by second quarter year range wasonly 3½ percentage points.naturally, divergence remain, reflect number factors. some divergence due aprocess convergence country catch euro area averages, well-knownbalassa-samuelson effect. this effect explain productivity growth catch-up process canresult high inflation without undermine competitiveness. country-specific policies, includingfiscal policy regulation, also result divergences. finally, country different industrial orsectoral concentrations. difference economic performance various sector therefore bereflected cross-country divergences. bi review 74/20002these factor go disappear immediately, may diminish price income levelsconverge continue deepen internal market. however, cannot sure howrapidly diminish, certain level divergence normal longrun. in addition, process convergence necessarily continuous. for example, inflationdifferentials widen little last year two, although remain much small thanthey decade ago.for small area within monetary union, common monetary policy specificimplications. small country little influence euro area inflation rate, weightedaverage national inflation rates. if inflation rate small country diverge euro areaaverage, relatively little impact overall monetary policy stance euro area.consequently, possible small country temporarily growth rate inflation ratesthat differ would result national monetary policy aim maintain pricestability country level. large country could also position. if inflation well abovethe euro area average one country, another, monetary policy may contribute tonarrowing divergences. where divergence result catching-up processes,national economic cycle could potentially become pronounced. some euro area country arearguably position now, head towards it. the netherlands one countries. ofcourse, deviation also occur direction, inflation output growth ratesremaining low long would occur national monetary policy. this lead tolong-lasting social economic cost factor inhibit smooth adjustment process. iwill return issue shortly.as i mention earlier, heterogeneity occur across several dimensions. in addition countrydifferences, also difference economic performance sector economy. asthe internal market continue deepen, may few regulatory difference countriesand stability growth pact constrain national fiscal policy. it seem likely cross-countrydivergences increasingly reflect exposure country various sectors. think aboutheterogeneity sectoral level might therefore insightful euro area focussingsolely cross-country comparisons.consider trend inflation. the eurosystem define price stability positive inflation ratebelow 2% medium term. the definition recognise fact time inflation maytemporarily move outside target range. that currently occur result high oil price -which kind sectoral shock. the weak exchange rate also contribute high prices. themost recent hicp inflation rate show euro area consumer price increase 2.4% year tojuly. almost half increase due high energy prices. naturally, cross-country inflationdifferences remain, relevant. however, cross-country difference affectedby high oil prices, reflect fact energy intensity energy taxation vary betweencountries. in current circumstances, analyse relative price trend help assess whetherinflation confine specific sectors, whether lead generalise inflation.implications policyso heterogeneity across several dimensions. what mean policy, shouldpolicy maker concern divergences? let focus price divergences. in marketeconomy, relative price play important role. and, relative price include price ofdifferent good service within country, also price good service indifferent countries. these relative price change provide signal ensure change inpreferences technology flow change resource allocation. in theory, therefore, relativeprice movement welfare enhance something concern about. inpractice, world simple market perfectly competitive. relative pricemovements always occur freely, adjustment change preference technology canbe costly.monetary policy cannot influence relative price within euro area offsetdivergences sector countries. those relative price determine real factors. instead, 3bis review 74/2000the best contribution monetary policy make society’s welfare stabilise general euroarea price level. that reduce noise relative price changes, therefore improve workingsof price mechanism.nonetheless, central banker monitor divergences. why monitor divergence isnothing them? first, knowledge monetary transmission mechanism isincomplete. information various part economy, include divergences, add ourknowledge economy whole. we particularly conscious euro area weare still process develop enhance indicator euro area whole. the secondreason interest regional sectoral difference economic performance provideearly signal area-wide developments, u experience shown.if monetary policy cannot react divergences, policy areas? a imentioned earlier, allow relative price change occur often best approach, resourcesare allocate effective uses. accordingly, structural reform allow relative pricemechanism operate generally sensible. and, hear central banker call structural reform isnothing new! my colleague i ecb govern council regularly call forfurther structural reform. for example, labour market reform stimulate movement labouraround euro area likely reduce euro area unemployment overall, well reduce disparityin prices, wage unemployment rate regions. central banker country makesimilar points.another approach would use fiscal policy try dampen national divergences. however,given plan implementation lags, easy use fiscal policy counter-cyclicalmanner. in addition, main objective fiscal policy normally reduce cross-country orcross-sector divergences. even though fiscal policy normally formulate within multi-yearframework, element discretion remain. any discretion use reduce, rather thanincrease, cross-country divergence inflation. fiscal policy also sustainable positionso automatic stabiliser operate fully. at time may even appropriate fiscal policy toseek offset divergences. it certainly case little gain discretionarypro-cyclical policies. rather, economic cycle could become pronounced, result costlyadjustment take place downturns.the point i make early small country relevant here. euro area monetary policy notsignificantly influence inflation rate small country. it therefore important smallcountries flexibility policy area offset inflation. of course, large countrieswould also gain undertake structural reform avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policy. and therecould time appropriate large country use national policy offset divergences. iwould merely make point cost flexible might great small country inthe event downturn.monetary policy enlargementi would also like briefly discus issue apply enlargement. first, point maderegarding small country currently euro area apply even great force accessioncountries. give relative size accession countries, monetary policy enlarge euro areawill little influence inflation rates. accession country general le converge inreal term initial emu member monetary union began. this true whenmeasured basis gdp per capita, adjustment make difference inpurchasing power. real convergence may therefore take considerable period time. ongoingconvergence, eu membership, eventually adoption euro, could result economicshocks mean monetary policy requirement accession country differ euroarea whole. give factors, extent difference monetary policy requirementscould great protract case small country currently emu. to minimisethe economic social impact divergences, important accession country flexibleeconomies, sound financial systems, solid fiscal position, well-developed institutionalframework. arguably, accession therefore great consequence country bi review 74/20004the case previously, sense le converge real institutional term initialemu members. a cautious approach adoption euro therefore appear appropriate, aspremature adoption could prove costly.second, monetary policy within emu continue focus area-wide conditions. obviously,that area large follow enlargement. one important issue u ensure thatthe indicator use monetary policy deliberation base development across theenlarged area. our data requirement expand accordingly. we also need learn themonetary policy transmission mechanism work across new area. i expect national centralbanks accession country important role play help u understandthe work enlarge euro area.conclusiondespite give warn consequence divergences, i would like concludeon optimistic note. yes difference within euro area. but difference createproblems euro area monetary policy. the overall gain membership certainly outweigh thecosts. i confident apply accession countries. what divergence teach u isthat policy must play part maximise gain common

monetary policy.inflation expectation base therefore forecast development real demand, howmany unused resource economy initially, assessment productivity trend andthe long-term trend level production.however, consumer price affect factor relate resource use theswedish economy. inflation measure cpi also affected, instance, change supply andother factor temporarily affect inflation. when cpi affect temporary factor kind bi review 72/20002that unrelated resource use, inflation diverges, simplify model, target evenwhen output gap closed. und1x measure make adjustment effectsalthough far them.the rule conductthe executive board riksbank decide formulate decision rule state ifinflation, measure annual change cpi, expect rise target 2% thenearest one two years, interest rate normally increase vice versa. the choiceof time horizon justify assessment interest rate change great effect onprice development period. however, interest rate change also affect inflation theshorter long term, reason give consideration inflationforecast come year time beyond two years.however, monetary policy aim situation keep inflation 2% lead largefluctuations output. if monetary policy counteract price increase cpi deemedto temporary consequence excess demand, interest rate must keep sufficiently highto hold demand economy. output would long-term trend level.correspondingly, target achieve 2% inflation, monetary policy must stimulate demandand press output long-term trend level inflation hold factor thattemporarily dampen prices.there therefore reason modify monetary policy rule conduct make possible toachieve balance variation inflation growth. excessively large fluctuation outputcan entail high economic costs. fundamentally, all, reason monetary policy giventhe task maintain stable

one two years, maytherefore reason bring inflation back target slowly usually. however, shouldgive reason this.scope major differences, despite common strategyeven agreement strategy monetary policy, is, course, considerable scopefor difference assessment interest rate situation.in first place, executive board make different assessment probable pricetendency. a know, economics exact science forecast price growth potentialalways rest many assessment enormous mass information correlations. model cannever capture complexity economy people’s economic decision interact musttherefore always regard one many aid assessments.the riksbank us lot different approach indicator make assessments. the focus theriksbank’s analysis real economy affect price trends. in manyareas, come central banks, come far regard theanalysis different financial aggregate linkage inflation real demand. anendeavour certainly make take account information provide development ofthe quantity money growth credit. however, instance develop methodsthat give guidance level indebtedness quantity money compatiblewith long-term sustainable growth economy basis inflation target. while thefinancial economy principle reflection real economy vice versa, change cantake place component drive seat. a well-developed analysis side wouldprobably improve basis decision-making monetary policy. structural change financialmarkets make difficult interpret development find stable correlation between, forinstance, quantity money inflation, although true many part economy. it 3bis review 72/2000applies, instance, method estimate central variable many unused resourcesthere economy great potential growth be. different method producedifferent results.the ecb example central bank build analysis real side thefinancial side - monetary policy rest two pillars. there partly historical reason monetarypolicy strategy conduct way. their strategy perhaps best way take financialtrends consideration. the risk clear division fact actually aboutmirror image disregard consistency real financial analysis lost.the advantage financial trend clearly take consideration monetary policydecisions made.in second place, make different appraisal risk picture price trend theforecast period. a normally great uncertainty inflation assessment main scenario,the riksbank also produce risk scenarios; also publish estimate probability distribution ofdifferent inflation outcomes. the distribution around probable outcome take considerationwhen decision interest rate taken.in third place, make different assessment monetary policy conduct tostrike reasonable balance fluctuation growth inflation. a i mention earlier, theexecutive board agree decide bring inflation back target within one twoyears cpi affect temporary factor economy affect extensive disturbances.making assessment evaluate - within framework - sufficient reason foravoiding output variation extend control horizon far self-evident, however.to maintain credibility monetary policy aim price stability, important therefore tojustify departures.in fourth place - i start sound possible conduct monetarypolicy demand clarity - know exactly stimulation tighten produce aparticular interest rate. this depend our, like everybody else’s, limit knowledge the“transmission mechanism”. it also due difficult exactly define real interest rate,monetary policy neutral effect demand. the difficulty increase “neutral” realinterest rate changing, instance productivity growth economy changes. on thebasis experience, simple rule thumb rough

conceptual framework complement modified. in order lose clarity, endeavour inour inflation reports, speech publication describe analytical apparatus itsdevelopment.challenges present situationthe growth prospect swedish economy improve considerably recent years. theriksbank successful create support make inflation target credible, centralgovernment finance improve many structural reform carry out, althoughmuch remain done.however, although part, look good, risk swedish economy nowgrowing rapidly due over-optimistic assessment growth prospects. this must view betaken consideration conduct monetary policy. excessively optimistic expectation thefuture could lead financial imbalance excessive indebtedness build swedisheconomy. high stock exchange price increase property price intensify tendency. in bi review 72/20004this situation, expansive monetary policy, base over-optimism, would contribute toimbalances build up.however, important issue riksbank whether scenario possible without differentindicators inflation signal time overheat way monetary policy hastime react. experience country show low consumer price inflation healthycentral government finance constitute guarantee future good development.although one always cautious draw conclusion comparison betweencountries, seen, instance, experience japan end 1980s andfrom korea mid-1990s, overheat express exaggerate stock exchange andproperty prices, high lend rate low yield investment rather rise consumer prices.i conceive least two factor swedish economy lead increase overheatingnot express rise consumer price therefore risk lead riksbank generalpublic draw wrong conclusion state economy.in first place i believe wage price behaviour affect inflation expectationsbeing low stable. it take time increase use resource effect price payincreases! in way take time adjust inflation expectation downwards, inertiain shift upwards. this would mean even demand production high issustainable long-term, mark price development use resourceshas come great strain. in second place deregulation increase competition lead consumer price beingdampened result excess profit force previously shelter industries. initially,increased competition perhaps primarily lead redistribution real incomes. in somewhatlonger term, productivity also improved. however, uncertain quickly whatextent potential growth increase result increase competition.if monetary policy assessment base overoptimistic view growth prospect anddevelopments consumer price give signal this, lead considerableimbalances build up.sooner later, however, inflation accelerate. when scope reduce profit margin aresult deregulation increase competition begin exhaust demand pressure finallybegins express rise prices, risk price increase large comequickly. expectation future growth prospect abruptly interrupted. the consequencescan demand drop company household highly indebted. if lot ofcompanies overheat period, base investment decision

theeconomic cost wait long change direction monetary policy high ifimbalances grow great fall production large.the course event usa?although prospect swedish economy look bright, cannot therefore disregard therisk overoptimism. history show many time optimism well-founded startwith become self-reinforcing end create considerable imbalance theeconomy. development japan 1980s asia 1990s clear

tell political business leader country go discus problem thatthe world economy faces, include it revolution globalization. needle say, i lookingforward learn result discussions.some ten fifteen year

cause remove also partly misunderstand side hasbeen resolved, largely owe strenuous effort make involve solve theproblems underlie friction. however, i think also reflect fact past ten yearsjapan’s economy stagnate u economy revived.japan’s economy saw peak bubble ten year ago. at time, japanese firm andfinancial institution expand global market share full confidence. many ofyou remember book entitle “japan number one” write professor harvarduniversity publish immediately bubble hit peak. in contrast, ten year agothe unite state suffer twin deficits, combination huge budget deficit theexpansion current account deficits.but ten year ago. now, u economy enjoy long ever period ofeconomic expansion. the unemployment rate come dramatically 7.5% 1992 4.1%recently. on hand, japan’s economy experience severe trial since burst thebubble. such contrast development unite state japan typicallywitnessed movement stock prices. the current nikkei stock average little than40% end 1989, happen peak, new york dow-jonesindustrial average rise four-fold period.against background, japanese recently tend become overly pessimistic themedium- long-term growth potential japan’s economy. however, i believe japan’s economywill able regain vitality firmly pursue economic reform need medium- tolong-term viewpoint, witness revitalization u economy since 1990s.to end, learn lesson past

lesson japan’s bitter experience begin economy wasstill good condition. bi review 72/20002bearing mind, let talk two issues. the first issue is, context us-japaneconomic relationship late 1980s, bubble emerge monetary policyaffect emergence bubble? the second issue is, though might sound little bite vague, towhat extent difference economic corporate management style, example theunited state japan, affect economic growth?regarding first issue, various factor behind stagnation japan’s economy the1990s. the emergence huge bubble late 1980s subsequent burst 1990swas certainly one major factors. although bubble emerge yet fullyanalyzed, obtain common observation look back history bubblesincluding case japan.one common observation inevitable bubble emerge public expectationsbecome extremely bullish reason. and, borrow expression feed chairmangreenspan, “irrational exuberance” prevail nationwide bubble emerges. however,intensification bullish expectation alone enough emergence bubble, tobe financed, another common observation. a matter fact, bubble period injapan, activity financial institution become extremely aggressive interest rate hadbeen keep low long period time.now, aftermath burst bubble, hear various question criticism as“why bank japan maintain monetary ease long period?” there couple ofreasons behind delay monetary tighten time. above anything else, price beenvery stable. furthermore, japan sizable current account surplus, reach 4.2% gdp 1986.and strengthen prevail argument japan continue monetary ease expanddomestic demand reduce external surplus, another reason delay raisinginterest rates. the unite state advocate japan’s current account surplus reducedthrough expansion domestic demand, argument widely discuss japan aswell.the basic condition current account balance country fundamentally determine thetrend net balance save investment reflect demographic otherunderlying factors. economic theory tell u hardly possible monetary policy affectsuch basic condition current account balance. nevertheless, reality, advocate theerroneous argument warrant economic theory. i think partly becausesome support give misconception microeconomic problem could solve simply bymacroeconomic policy. in words, exist mistake notion problem tradefriction unite state japan could solve monetary policy.looking boom u economy review experience japan’s bubble period, icannot help feel difficulty judge arrival new economy, words, thedifficulty differentiate “irrational exuberance” “rational exuberance.”most central bank would perhaps say “no” question whether monetary policy couldprevent emergence bubble. but, i think would say “yes” assertion monetarypolicy play important role maintain stable macroeconomic environment. a haveseen discussion base misconception reduction current account surplus, istrongly believe important policy maker business leader understand sharesome kind basic logic term macroeconomic theory conduct sound economic policy.let move second issue i want address extent difference economicand corporate management style, example unite state japan, affect economicgrowth.against backdrop prolong economic stagnation recent year japan, beengrowing recognition incorporate system u style managementwhich emphasize market-oriented economic management shareholder-oriented corporatemanagement. simply put, regard economic management, competition intensified.the relaxation lift regulation promoted. the financial system shift 3bis review 72/2000from one lead bank one lead capital market. and, corporate management front,corporate governance put emphasis shareholders. needle say, employmentadjustment drastic.from time time argument go extreme development japan’s economycannot expect unless completely shift japanese style u style management. i thinkthis overly pessimistic japanese style management something never changes,but rather something evolve response change economic environment.of course, i say current japanese style economic corporate management noproblems. indeed, i often mention importance structural reform, sometimes criticize forgo beyond position central bank governor make strong statement subject.nevertheless, i strongly believe japan need structural reform. first all, let emphasize thegrowth potential economy increase largely improvement supply side, is,achieving steady productivity gains, rather short-term boost demand side. forexample, compare productivity worker 1998, figure japan 40%lower unite state base purchase power parity imf’s world economicoutlook, 30% low base actual exchange rate. of course, sole objectiveis high labor productivity, achieve invest huge amount capital raisingcapital per worker. but, case, capital productivity return capital would decline.furthermore, growth drive huge investment resource would eventually reach limit.for sustainable growth, need establish indigenous mechanism promote growth bycombining labor capital optimal manner give price generate innovationin various fields.under circumstances, deal follow three agendas.first, allocation resource review light change economic environmentand resource invest productive areas. in way, resource would moreefficiently utilized. for example, labor capital need reallocate public privatesector, low growth high growth industries, le efficient efficient firms. suchredistribution would certainly accompany pain, without cannot expect steadydevelopment japan’s economy.second, legal, tax account systems, outmode obstacle toinnovation, reviewed. while i recognize never easy review system, whichinevitably entail conflict vest interest, know able take advantageof power innovation unless system review response change economicenvironment.third, really need see emergence innovators. change economicenvironment create variety opportunity make profits. transform opportunitiesinto profitable business cannot achieve mechanical process. it achieve ifinnovators allow pursue entrepreneurial ability full.these three agenda boil problem improve ability economy andsociety cope various changes. such ability always needed, but, technologicalinnovation economic globalization rapidly progressing, economy society canrespond change considerable competitive edge.i think fact unite state recently record high growth europe japanreflects great ability cope change characterize flexibility diversity.at recent conference sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, feed chairmangreenspan emphasize flexible u labor market contribute recent high economicgrowth, note seemingly paradoxical situation low unemployment despite many layoffs.from viewpoints, definitely observe seed change recent development ofjapan’s economy. let give concrete example change. bi review 72/20004first, reform system proceed rapidly. for example, number change madein area accounting, include mark-to-market valuation, adequate pension liabilityaccounting, review relationship subsidiary parent companies. and,importantly, level disclosure greatly improved. by accurately show performanceof firm, change put strong pressure corporate manager pursue restructure higherprofits.second, corporate manager become increasingly aware return capital.third, mentality employee changed. japan’s labor market, characterize bylifetime employment seniority-based wage system, use perceive many lackingflexibility. however, recently see gradual change market large-scale employmentadjustment begin observed.fourth, reform financial system proceeding. since autumn 1998, legalframework smooth dissolution fail financial institution establish publicfunds inject major bank strengthen capital base. although remain lotof thing solved, condition japanese financial institution significantly improvedthanks restructure effort part financial institutions.related positive developments, direct investment japan substantially increase inrecent years. in past, inward direct investment much small outward direct investment.in fact, 200 million dollar 1996. however, rise trend, amount to12.8 billion dollar last year. i great expectation continue increase direct investmentfrom abroad would stimulate japan’s economy transfer managerial resource andbusiness expertise.before closing, i may summarize, firstly, stable macroeconomic environment prerequisite forsustainable growth, regard, monetary policy play important role. second, raisethe economic growth rate medium long run, structural reform affect supply side ofthe economy indispensable. i think contrast u japanese economy duringthe past ten fifteen year exactly prof point.let conclude remark quote follow prayer “serenity“ dr reinhold niebuhrwhich i cherish whenever i face challenge issue

different price development theeuro area cause concern?speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, financial servicesindustry association, dublin, 6 september 2000.* * *1.introductionladies gentlemen, pleasure speak dublin occasion annualdinner financial service industry association (fsia). public support euro irelandhas particularly strong, may due prevail expectation, strong thanelsewhere, economic benefit result single currency. the introduction euro,however, also pose new question challenge ecb national economicpolicymakers. today i like take opportunity elaborate one particular issue, isthe challenge pose different inflation rate across country region within euro area. thereis general consensus euro area economy experience great deal convergence bothin term economic growth inflation past decade. in fact, move singlecurrency introduction euro base successful convergence process towards ahigh degree price stability participate countries. however, mean countrieshave always rate inflation past decade. and, indeed, reason tobelieve - time - rate inflation within monetary union. i wellaware divergence inflation increase lately euro area whole. for example,inflation ireland deviate significantly area-wide inflation.2.different price development generally disappearthere number reason difference economic condition occur past, andthere ample reason expect degree economic divergence continue emergewithin euro area. first, may reason difference inflation may occur overrelatively short period time. second, national even regional rate inflation may also differwithin single currency area long period time. let elaborate factor inturn.short-term difference inflation may generally occur due country-specific, statistical “erratic”factors. first, government policy may lead different price development via tax changes,liberalisation measure administrative price changes, generally samemagnitude time across euro area countries. the deregulation national electricity gasmarkets measure eco tax germany tobacco excise duty ireland may serve asexamples policy measures. secondly, since pattern consumption allparticipating countries, weight use construction national component theharmonised index consumer price (hicp) differ. for example, process food constitute around13.5% hicp euro area whole, 21% hicp ireland. this could, purelymechanically, generate measure inflation differential across country even price change forindividual good equal countries. finally, different weather condition differentnumbers time national holiday create “noise” measure inflation rates, wouldbe limit economic significance. look ahead, reason expect factorswould disappear within euro area.in addition, number deep economic factor may also contribute short-term divergence ofprice developments. trade patterns, production structures, tax systems, financial markets, andinstitutional structure differ significantly across euro area countries. hence, common shock may bi review 70/20002affect country diverse way. the 1998/1999 emerge market crisis, depreciation euroagainst u dollar, recent surge oil price may serve example common shockswhich contribute diverge development within euro area. furthermore, second-roundeffects common shock may differ different institutional structures, thewage-bargaining system. of course, transmission single monetary policy reaction suchshocks may also still differ financial structures. likewise, difference inflation mayoccur account impact asymmetric shocks, difference response shocks.german unification clear example asymmetric shock.looking ahead, deep economic factor may become le important difference intrade patterns, tax systems, financial market institutional structure likely diminish. othersmay become important. in face increase openness trade integration, tendencytowards country-specific regional specialisation might emerge. this could lead inflationdivergences country shock occur. however, extent linkage betweenindustries increase across national boundary part process grow integration euroarea, degree synchronisation across national short-term economic development may wellincrease.let turn factor could lead long-term difference inflation. i like firstto address briefly issue price level convergence. price level convergence could expect totake place euro area least two reasons. first, completion internal market andincreased cross-border price transparency contribute erode scope existence ofsubstantial price differential product easily tradable across borders. to large extent,this may take place already start economic monetary union (emu), butdifferences remain. one example price convergence attract public attention relatesto car prices. secondly, regard good service le easily tradable across nationalborders (such house hairdressing), long-term convergence productivity livingstandards across euro area would create tendency towards price level convergence. countrieswith high level economic development tend high price level non-traded good andservices. while high wage trade good sector largely reflect high level productivity,spillovers wage increase non-traded good service sector often imply wage levelsin economy whole typically high develop economies. a scope forincreasing productivity growth usually limit non-traded good sector, generalincrease wage result productivity gain trade good sector raise cost ofproducing non-traded good services. this lead high relative price increase non-tradedgoods services. in dynamic context, le develop country catch itsneighbours, inflation non-traded good sector could rise rapidly othercountries, result, inflation higher. this type convergence normally take placegradually within certain limit among relatively homogeneous industrial countries, could, ofcourse, reach much large scale difference price level among participate country moremarked.3.are divergent price development cause concern?are difference inflation among euro area country cause concern? the short answer is, “itdepends”. on one hand, i explained, difference inflation rate among euro areacountries expected. they effect partly result completion internalmarket creation single currency itself. on hand, difference inflation ratesare quite large, need thorough examination underlie reason well appropriateeconomic policy action national level.the single monetary policy establishment stable price environment euro areaas whole accompany considerable degree narrow inflation differentials.however, current inflation differential euro area country quite large. an analysis ofdata price development various u city past suggest inflation difference mayoccur within monetary union, least great currently prevail 3bis review 70/2000most euro area countries. a feature u data observe divergence inflationrates among cities, although persistent, permanent. there seem tendency forprice level individual city return initial level relative national average. it beassumed similar adjustment process would generally also operate euro area.the cyclical component consumer price development may affect orientation ofmonetary policy change therein, could thereby exhibit common pattern future.typically, kind specific shocks, oil price changes, seasonal pattern weatherconditions may dominate dispersion price developments. to give example, thedifference high low annual national hicp inflation rate increase to3.8 percentage

governor u federal reservesystem, bank thailand symposium, risk management financial institutions, hold inbangkok, 31 august 2000.* * *i please invite address symposium timely important topic ofrisk management. continue increase scale complexity financial institution thepace financial transaction demand employ sophisticate risk managementtechniques monitor rapidly change risk exposures. at time, fortunately, advance ininformation technology low cost acquiring, manage analyze data, haveenabled considerable ongoing advance risk management lead institution worldwide. asthis symposium illustrates, bank many emerge market country also increase focus onrisk management effort build robust sound financial systems, remedy weaknessesthat expose recent regional problems, position participate fully inthe global economy.why risk mattersbecause take risk integral part bank business, surprise bank beenpracticing risk management ever since bank - industry could survivedwithout it. the real change degree sophistication require reflect morecomplex fast-paced environment.even today, however, simple rule continue critical risk management, i cite baringsas negative example. by simple act separate front-office back-office responsibilities,barings could well prevent enormous loss lead failure. in addition, barings’management never explore nick leeson could produce high returns, even thoughthe trade authorize undertake essentially riskless thus soprofitable. have question “good fortune”, barings’ management might uncover thehidden loss become large enough bankrupt firm. a third lesson bar isthat benefit risk management loss prevent, additional revenue willgenerate.the asian financial crisis 1997 illustrate ignore basic risk management also contributeto economy-wide difficulties. the long period remarkable economic growth prosperity asiamasked weakness risk management many financial institutions. many asian bank notassess risk conduct cash flow analysis extend loan, rather lend basis theirrelationship borrower availability collateral - despite fact collateral wasoften hard seize event default. the result loan - including, i might add, loan byforeign bank - expand fast ability borrower repay. additionally, manybanks abide limit concentration lend individual firm orbusiness sectors, loan overextend borrower often large relative bank capital, thatwhen economic condition worsened, bank weaken most.the asian crisis also illustrate potential benefit sophisticate risk management practices.many asian bank adequately ass exposure exchange rate risk. although somebanks match foreign currency liability foreign currency assets, merelytransformed exchange rate risk credit risk, foreign currency borrower haveassured source foreign currency revenues. similarly, foreign bank underestimate country risk inasia. in cases, institution seem assume stability would continue region bi review 68/20002and fail consider might happen case. a great willingness ability ofbanks subject exposure stress test could highlight risk emphasize theimportance key assumptions. have conduct stress tests, lender might see howexposed change exchange rate interruption steady economic growth.although avoid failure principal reason manage risk, global financial institution alsohave broad objective maximize risk-adjusted rate return capital, raroc. thismeans avoid excessive risk exposures, measure manage risk relative returnsand capital. by focus risk-adjusted return capital, global institution avoid put toomuch emphasis activity investment high expect return equally high orhigher risk. this lead good management decision efficient allocation capital andother resources. indeed, bank shareholder creditor expect receive appropriate risk-adjustedrate return, result bank focus risk-adjusted return rewardedby market.risk management clearly free. in fact, i discuss, it’s expensive resource ininstitutional disruption. but cost delay avoid proper risk management extreme:failure bank possibly failure bank system.a point often overlooked, however, that, focus risk-adjusted returns, risk managementalso contribute strength efficiency economy. it provide mechanismthat design allocate resource - initially financial resource ultimately real resource - totheir efficient use. project high risk-adjusted expect profitability mostlikely finance succeed. the result rapid economic growth. i want emphasizethat point. the ultimate gain risk management high economic growth. without sound riskmanagement, economy grow potential.stability great economic growth, turn, lead great private saving, great retention thatsaving, great capital import real investment. all this, sound risk management.without it, lose gains, also incur considerable cost bankdisruptions failure follow unexpected, undesired unmanaged risk-taking.making risk matter owner managersone might ask many asian bank make mistake pay little attention risk. one answer,to i already alluded, many year strong economic performance asianeconomies lull bank supervisor complacency regard risk. that part theanswer, however. we learn certain prerequisite must exist bank owner andmanagers pay attention risk. at least prerequisite absent many asiancountries. one prerequisite implicit explicit government guarantee bankowners managers. their incentive manage risk avoid insolvency severely blunt ifinsolvent bank merge strong bank simply allow continue operate withoutowners lose stake manager lose jobs. similarly, bank creditor exert marketdiscipline run risk loss claim banks. thus, guarantee bank creditor willalso blunt incentive bank control risk. market discipline also require adequate accountingand disclosure standards, enable bank investor judge bank’s condition accurately.an important complement market discipline promote sound risk management effective banksupervision. to effective, though, bank supervisor must ability ass bank’scondition, especially condition loan portfolio, must authority requireadequate provision loan losses. after ensure loan loss reserve adequate, supervisorsmust authority close bank insolvent, wipe owner shareholder andremoving management. without authority - willingness use - country effectivelyhas policy forbearance, even officially not.another prerequisite risk matter government-directed lending, becausedirected lend carry implicit government guarantee. in korea, example, manyyears direct lend large chaebols, bank develop skill ass risk 3bis review 68/2000these, large borrowers. even end government direction imply guarantee,banks still insist receive full financial information chaebols. consequently,banks could ass risk loans, even though risk face become substantial.prerequisites risk managementthere also prerequisite bank develop ability measure manage risk effectively.first, order measure risk, country must solid account disclosure standard thatprovide accurate, relevant, comprehensive timely information bank ass thecondition performance borrower counterparties. to ensure accuracy, account systemsneed supplement audit system back enforceable legal penalty forproviding fraudulent mislead information government agency outsiders. bank alsoneed reliable information credit history potential borrower macroeconomic andfinancial variable affect credit risks. additionally, bank need staff sufficientexpertise risk management identify evaluate risk.implicit method evaluate credit risk assumption probability repaymentdepends ability borrower repay, words, willingness repay theissue. if repayment depend whim, probability difficult impossible assess. thus,an adequate legal system “credit culture”, borrower expect repay arepenalized not, yet prerequisite sound accurate risk management. theability seize collateral borrower default essential bank incentive andability mitigate risk. without legal infrastructure - laws, court impartial judge -necessary enforce financial contract timely manner, much risk management would fornothing, initial decision extend credit made.finally, potential conflict interest risk management must limited. in particular,regulations need restrict require disclosure connect lend bank owners,shareholders management. without regulations, desire personal gain may distort theincentives bank owner manager manage risk appropriately.sound practice risk managementat juncture, might useful i share development practice one country. ofcourse, i familiar own. throughout past decade, federal reserve devotedincreased attention understand risk

however, certain basic apply quite generally. in institution,support crucial program must come top. each entity’s senior management governingboard must set institution’s risk appetite establish

return. rate return provide compensate risk. ifrates return high, compensate high level risk. risk meansvariability, leverage institution like bank little tolerance loss. that bankinginstitutions must

attractingpersonnel skill necessary apply risk management tool meaningful ways. in 18thand 19th centuries, banker use send son work competitor financial center orderto learn late technique bring home.

morning, i congratulateyou, mr governor, great contribution central bank sri lanka make thedevelopment beautiful country first fifty year i wish continue success inyour task year come.you invite speak central bank independence, course i happy do- although i perhaps make clear outset concept i find somewhat elusive.like many debates, debate central bank independence often seem becomeunduly polarised.at one extreme seem resist central bank independence undemocratic - oreven central banker favour - assume involve elite body individuals, who,once appoint are, virtue statute, beyond political influence, extensive onlygenerally-defined power affect financial environment - hence life individual andbusinesses throughout currency area. at opposite extreme sometimes seem onlyalternative central bank simply another arm government, subservient financeministers officials.now i don’t know many would recognise either extremecategorisations. i guess many.i confess - however attractive definition independence might appear centralbanking career option - really choice made, then, citizen democraticsociety i would choose non-independent alternative. but, course, real debate muchmore subtle extend across much narrow part spectrum polar extremes.the real debate fact well describe john exter, federal reserve board official, whoadvised establishment central bank ceylon, was, stay becomeits first governor.in report - publish november 1949 - exter present draft bill accompany acommentary. it still well worth reading. in commentary exter first outline case newcentral bank “non-political” “a considerable amount independence” - essentiallyon grind central bank “puts government business life country atespecially critical points, namely bank credit activities, capital markets, foreign exchangemarkets supply currency”, “embraces problem unusuallytechnical nature”!but exter go recognise “there many important problem monetary policy, especiallythose relate fiscal policy, central bank must necessarily work close harmony withthe government”. note many government learn value sort independent andobjective, detached, advice central bank able give, exter nevertheless acknowledge that“on matter vital interest state would impossible central bank adopt policycontrary policy government day”. his killer argument central banker canhelp “acutely conscious fact that, since parliament bind successors, theirindependence limit ultimate power government change law”. bi review 66/20002he conclude exact degree independence central bank likely vary time totime (giving example peacetime wartime economy) describe ideal one inwhich continuous constructive cooperation central bank thegovernment. the effectiveness cooperation - say - depend upon menoccupying key position particular time upon legal formula, matter carefullyor elaborately might work out.i quote exter’s report length particular relevance thisanniversary occasion, also because, although write particular context sri lankaat end 1940’s, contemplate move currency board central bank, much hiscomment timeless. i like elaborate upon - supplement - theme drawingupon experience unite kingdom.for 50 year - 1946 1998 - bank england operate legislation which,remarkably, attempt define objective function - simply assume carryover early long history. the 1946 bank england act confer upon u powers, subjectto agreement chancellor exchequer, issue direction banker - though term“bankers” defined; provide treasury give direction bank as,after consultation governor, think necessary public interest. such directionswould necessarily make public: none fact ever given. in event bank ofengland formal, statutory, sense throughout period well along spectrum towards thesubservient polar extreme i describe earlier, relation policy making, although didenjoy element independence, example, relation security tenure duration fixedterm appointment governor directors, degree relation finances.i bind say though felt practice. even within statutoryframework independence rather like age - independent feel!the question really come far able influence government, turndepended upon far value advice far

consensus recognised, too, that, overall fiscal policy significant implicationsfor macro-economic stability medium longer-term sufficiently flexible oradaptable play primary stabilise role short term. that task specifically allocatedto monetary policy. finally, emerge recognition potential conflict betweenthe central bank’s necessary concern systemic financial stability (you cannot hope delivermonetary stability financial system crash ears, monetary stability itselfa primary condition financial stability) consumer depositor protection, carry toofar undermine strength financial

sadly, big step forward come major setback. in 1992 beendriven unceremoniously european exchange rate mechanism (following boom bustof late 1980s / early 1990s), government day adopt explicit

that really concentrate mind i tell you; provide u add stimulus tosharpen act. but effect crucial intend integrity processwas respected. what saw minute “the ken eddie show” verbatim advicewhich i

monetary policy particular new act define responsibility “to maintain pricestability and, subject that, support economic policy government include itsobjectives growth employment”. it chancellor define what, precisely, beunderstood “price stability” do form symmetrical 2½% target aparticular statistical measure retail prices. so “instrument” rather “goal”independence.it sometimes suggest second best arrangement. in national context least idisagree view. the precise objective policy - even within confine concept ofprice stability - remain political decision: always argue somewhathigher

committee often largely question nuance.but good view err side rather attempt submerge differences. we donot, however, attribute particular view particular individuals. to would invite preparedstatements militate inter-active debate outstanding immensely valuablecharacteristic meetings. it would suppress kind “what if” discussion sameindividual may explore alternative views. no attempt make concert outcome policydecision; fact i go way discourage kind collusion, whether internalor external member committee - are, must remain, nine independent members,individually accountable

thepublic large monetary policy make cannot precise science - however much need beinformed science available us. that, context, i think much easy tounderstand consensual approach would be, certainly

japan, probably right bank cut lossesand go home.even japanese bank stay cut back lend here. between march 1997 andjune 2000, total lend japanese bank hong kong fell hk$2,000 billionto hk$643 billion, decline almost 70%. this reduce japanese banks’ market share oftotal loan hong kong 51% 1997 around 25%.of course, i aware figure bite misleading, mr kato bank tokyo-mitsubishirecently point press. most decline total loan account euro-yenloans. these yen loan japanese borrower formerly book offshore hong kongfor variety reasons, include fund cost domestic regulations. a change theseregulations

banks, plenty read. but i hope try quickly possibleand avoid last minute problem delays. there unlikely opportunity forrenegotiation deal, collapse final stage, bank would certainly beworse off.so far i concentrate position japanese banks. let review moregeneral state bank hong kong asian crisis.the first point make local hong kong bank survive crisis good shape.although one two bank lose money, bank remain profitable actually manage toimprove capital ratio period risk asset decline capital baseexpanded. no bank require financial assistance government crisis, contrast tothe situation asian

profitability. but even pre-provision level, profit grow about15% compare 1999. surprisingly, publicity decline margin mortgagelending, growth profit help increase overall net interest margin. thisreflected fact fund cost remain low period.the position local hong kong bank therefore look good time since asiancrisis. however, like japanese banks, bank also face number importantchallenges, albeit small scale japan.foremost amongst increase competition. this display obviously thedecline lend margin already mentioned, particularly residential mortgage lend amajor part loan portfolio local banks. the margin recently reach new lowof 2.25% prime compare pre-crisis level 1.25% prime. to extent thisreflects temporary condition depress property sector, sluggish loan demand

deregulate current andsavings account next year. this due take place end june 2001, bepostponed prevail economic financial condition clearly unfavourable, donot expect case. the bank therefore need prepare pressure margin willcause able quickly introduce new deposit product like interest bear current accounts.if so, competitor will.how local bank need respond challenges? most obviously, challenge raise theissue consolidation bank sector, either merger take-over. this trend wehave see happen financial centres, include japan. it slow take here, itis go come, sooner rather later,

several country affect financial turbulence 1990s relativelynew participant international financial system without first establish sound domesticfinancial system sound economic policy. that apply

containment crisisresolution. much work involve international institution like, instance, internationalmonetary fund, world bank, bank international settlements, basel committee onbanking supervision, oecd, well financial stability forum.however, national authority often hard work implement policy codeslies. the measure contribute good financial stability country actually adopt andimplement them. a crucial ingredient achieve course involve countries, formally orinformally, development policies, code standards. but even achieved, iknow experience difficult actual implementation sometimes be, least forpolitical reasons.the event past decade make clear great effort need strengthen thefunctioning markets. i would like make point today’s favourable trend worldeconomy lead u conclude danger over. we witness many crisis inthe last decade know market confidence suddenly shift. instead, policymakers 3bis review 65/2000throughout world must continue work forestall new problem evidentthreats international financial economic stability still remain may well bevulnerabilities le evident. but chance global economy continue along pathtowards sustainable growth without disruptive financial instability enhance implementingappropriate reforms.monetary stabilitylet turn monetary stability. in last decade grow number country chosento conduct monetary policy explicit target inflation. one reason behind choice nodoubt countries’ poor experience fixed, adjustable, exchange rate regime.the first country formally adopt policy target inflation new zealand 1990. canadadid 1991, follow unite kingdom, sweden australia. other country havealso introduce variant inflation target since then.it interest note 1990s predominant view float exchange rateregime suitable small open economy. today, i believe experience beenexceptionally good among country target inflation. in fact, even emergingmarket country build kind regime. in recent year country southafrica, brazil, czech republic, poland thailand inspire introduce similarstrategy. consequently inflation target introduce quite number countries.let take opportunity commend governor bank thailand bank’s stafffor first excellent inflation report present july. the report impressive ithas give quite new ideas.the challenge 1990s inflation target country build rigorousframework around new regime. question like choice rate index targeted, theusefulness band around target degree transparency need answered.it also important formulate monetary policy reaction function, is, define thebalance inflation variability output variability. the reason central bank aimfor maximum short-term stability either inflation output attain one targetswould costly economy.on one hand, central bank’s legitimacy among general public could suffer short-terminterest rate move sharply, cause output fluctuate widely inflation hold stableand exactly target. maximum stability output could, hand, result sharpfluctuations rate inflation erode credibility monetary regime. a pointsomewhere midway two extreme must therefore found.let also stress importance central bank independence. in order successful theimplementation inflation target approach, central bank must able act independently ofday-to-day party politics set interest rate continuously accord specify inflationtarget. otherwise credibility problem arise hard policymakers convince thegeneral public monetary policy’s long-term nature. lack credibility, turn, mean thecentral bank set interest rate high otherwise would case.looking ahead, i believe least two major question central bank address morethoroughly.first, monetary policy react asset prices, equity and/or real estate prices? weknow history development asset price significant impact inflationand real economic activity. we need establish whether action central bank canand take minimise likelihood macroeconomic instability arise extremefluctuations asset prices.second, monetary policy react structural change economy? bi review 65/20004monetary policy asset priceslet start question monetary policy’s response movement asset prices. thisdepends turn central bank choose use information contain asset prices.in regime explicitly target inflation, asset price take account via effect onaggregate demand. rise share price increase household wealth would raise consumptionfor give level income increment wealth consider permanent nature.at time, consumer confidence boost high share price could potentially makeindividuals prone spend increase wealth.an increase share price also make investment attractive firm since increase collateralvalues low cost new capital relative exist capital. if share price predict higherexpected output growth, could also lead investment.if asset price household firm base consumption investment decisionsprove optimistic, would create inflationary pressure short term. an importantquestion context sensitive households’ firms’ consumption investmentresponses change asset prices.via effect inflation, asset price thus take account formulation monetarypolicy, although feature explicitly target variable.however, simple use financial asset price indicator panacea central banks’forecasting problems. asset price move variety reasons. understand reason isimportant determine appropriate monetary policy response. for example, rise shareprices stem increase productivity thus expectation high future profits, theimplications monetary policy would different case fundamental reasonfor high share prices.this raise number questions. one pertain relative informativeness different kind ofasset prices. another integrate information obtain asset price othermacroeconomic information. notwithstanding empirical evidence indicator property ofasset prices, causal relationship asset price real macroeconomic variable haveproved difficult understand model. but, i illustrated, answer tothese question important monetary policy. it seem quite clear central bankscannot afford adopt view asset market merely “side-shows”.there other, sometimes le straightforward, situation monetary policy reason toreact movement asset price even though effect inflation negligible. one reason isthe central bank’s responsibility financial system’s stability.if asset price drive unsustainable level correspond underlyingfundamentals, face special kind problem. we know experience speculativeasset price bubble eventually burst. when do, collateral value fall balance sheetsdeteriorate, potentially threaten stability bank system. to avoid kind ofdevelopment, central bank need closely monitor potential excessive credit growth andthe possibility asset price bubble build up.it seem historically form speculative price bubble closely link anexcessive expansion credit. but need operationalise concept “excessive” thedifficult concept asset’s “fundamental value”. a history show us, judge extentrising asset price reflect strong fundamentals, rather “irrational exuberance” investors, iseasier say done.nevertheless, certain important risk relate asset price need careful watch today’s world.the first risk imprudent lend could fuel unwarranted asset price increase - often thepast. although little evidence date general low credit standards, credit growthhas rapid loan finance equity purchase rise sharply countries. 5bis review 65/2000ensuring investor shelter consequence sometimes misguidedinvestments important maintain prudent lend standards. it important messagefrom central bank clear: investor count monetary policy underwrite particularvaluation equity markets.a second relate risk high asset price might lead complacency debt levels.household corporate balance sheet may look healthy asset price stable increasing,but price fall? similarly, debt service ratio emerge market country may looksustainable market access improving, happen interest rate rise?rising level household corporate indebtedness industrial countries, well risinglevels external indebtedness number emerge market countries, base expectation ofcontinued strong growth income production. early i remark momentum theworld economy policy action take date give reason optimism. however, volatility isintrinsic financial markets. our experience 1990’s clearly demonstrate danger ofbasing decision solely single central scenario, rather range possible - includingworst case - scenarios.monetary policy structural changeslet briefly touch upon question monetary policy react structural changesin economy? quite lot think already do issue, among academicsand policymakers. nevertheless, i believe must do field, especially since leastsome part world economy see something productivity shock recent years. i amdeliberately avoid buzzword “new economy” here, since history full expressionslike ever since turn 19th century.the discussion monetary policy productivity shock take place mostly unitedstates, light impressive economic performance acceleration rate ofproductivity growth. so one could certainly ask: rest world? the possibility aproductivity breakthrough also part world cannot course rule out.higher - accelerate - productivity growth indeed pose new challenge monetary policy. itcould set motion complex effect aggregate supply demand, inflation, equity pricesand interest rates. just give examples, let briefly mention follow effects.first, positive productivity shock raise economy’s potential growth rate. it also affectsaggregate demand new, profitable investment opportunities, high equity price andexpectations among household high permanent income. one question policymakers iswhether demand effect powerful potential outpace growth ofaggregate supply short medium perspective.second, could temporary disinflation effect work increase productivity isunexpected initially. if wage slow adjust, high productivity growth low unit labour costsand thereby reduce price inflation. here important question policymakers. shouldthis effect allow result temporary reduction price inflation unemployment?third, increase trend rate productivity growth could also result high equilibrium realinterest rate, output gap closed, order balance save investment. fiscal policyand development public financial balance could least partly offset effect, could theeconomy’s degree openness.all imply monetary policymakers could face quite challenges. one toidentify structural change distinguish cyclical variations. another challenge todetect magnitude effects. furthermore, look ahead monetary policy hard theeconomy go major change make difficult forecast future path theeconomy inflation. bi review 65/20006it quite clear demand great deal forecaster well construct macromodels. the forecast concern inflation one two year ahead, calls, instance, forreasonable precision measurement output gap relationship output gapand inflation.it already evident, example, inflation forecast frequently high side manycountries 1990s. i believe best do, least stage, pay close attentionto incoming data forecast process, examine consistent historicalrelationships. we deal successfully fact forecast economicdevelopments never completely accurate still allow monetary policy forward looking.final wordslet conclude. when discuss financial monetary stability, must remember wehave come long way. the world economy show strong growth couple low inflation andmonetary policy contribute development. however, interesting, thoughsomewhat difficult, challenge ahead must meet preserve bright picture theworld economy. 1bis review 64/2000y v reddy: issue manage capital account liberalisationpresentation dr y v reddy, deputy governor reserve bank india, commonwealthsecretariat - world bank

governor bank japan, japan national pressclub, tokyo, 4 august 2000.* * *i honor invite today japan national press club. i hear joke centralbanker deliver speech member esteem club, well know barrageof sharp questions, economy perform satisfactorily confident enough toanswer questions. i today, case, i think goodopportunity elaborate think behind current monetary policy ask comments.the main purpose remark today present overview zero interest rate policy byreviewing various discussion past monetary policy meet respect termination thezero interest rate policy.i.economic development zero interest rate policy adoptedlet begin briefly explain zero interest rate policy is. it february 1999 thatthe bank japan effect zero interest rate policy. at time, japan’s economy vergeof fall deflationary spiral vicious circle combine price decline economicrecession. in response, bank japan decide guide short-term interest rate, specifically theuncollateralized overnight call rate, virtually zero flexibly provide ample fund themoney market. then, april 1999, bank decide continue zero interest rate policy untilsuch time could ascertain deflationary concern dispelled. chart 1 show thedevelopment market interest rate since april 1999. to best knowledge, i cannot think ofany precedent financial history, either home abroad, central bank guidedshort-term interest rate virtually zero maintain level long period. short-terminterest rate key variable transmission mechanism monetary policy central bankinfluences control reserve money market, thereby affect various aspect theoverall economy. thus, guide short-term interest rate virtually zero mean centralbank use traditional policy tool maximum extent possible.a variety economic indicator suggest japan’s economy recovery path, albeit moderate.chart 2 compare recent economic condition february 1999. for example, theyear-on-year growth rate real gdp increase minus 0.4% first quarter 1999 plus0.7% quarter 2000, industrial production growth rise minus 3.8% firstquarter 1999 plus 7% second quarter 2000. business sentiment term tankandiffusion index industry size firm substantially improve minus 44 march1999 minus 18 june 2000. and, consensus forecast private sector real gdp growthfor fiscal year revise upward 0.8% begin year 1.5% recently.moreover, june’s tankan survey show corporate profit expect mark double-digitincrease two consecutive year fiscal 1999 2000. while inflation term wpi slightlyabove previous year’s level, term cpi slightly below.there number factor responsible moderate economic recovery. first foremost isthe implementation several important policy measure restore financial system stability. publicfunds inject major bank strengthen capital base legal framework wasestablished speed bankruptcy process. under circumstances, financial institutionsthemselves strive reconstruct management. the second factor support frommacroeconomic policy, include fiscal policy government zero interest ratepolicy bank japan. the third factor upturn overseas economies. in addition theexpansion unite state europe, asian economy recover rapidly afterovercoming currency financial crises. the fourth factor boom high-tech it-related bi review 63/20002business areas. whether trend like it revolution witness unite state spread tojapan depend firm individual user take advantage information technology.japanese producer relate high-tech business swiftly respond rapid increase indemand home abroad, increase number expand investmentreflecting tighten supply demand conditions.it natural economic recovery lead question whether zero interest rate policy shouldbe terminated. a i mentioned, bank japan announce april 1999 would continue thezero interest rate policy deflationary concern dispelled. discussion subsequentmonetary policy meet disclose deflationary concern would dispel webecame confident economic recovery lead private demand. a describe theminutes meetings, member policy board closely examine economic andfinancial condition determine whether deflationary concern dispelled. though theminutes 17 july meet yet released, statement issue immediately themeeting chart 3 say majority policy board consider japan’s economy wasapproaching stage deflationary concern might dispelled. however, also say someviews express reach final decision lift zero interest rate policy, wasdesirable ensure firmness economic condition include employment household income.moreover, point board need ascertain so-called sogo problemwould affect market sentiment.ii.points issue relate termination zero interest rate policyas know, argument termination zero interest rate policy asevidenced newspaper editorial recent month well opinion business leaders,economists, market participants. such division opinion usually case every time thequestion raise interest rate bring period prolong monetary easing. in may1989 interest rate last raise midst bubble economy, article innewspapers magazine support raise. needle say, past monetary policymeetings, carefully examine various point relate pro con lift zerointerest rate policy. let discus important point issue.is private consumption recovering?the first point whether conclude economy whole fully recoveredwhile recovery private consumption yet confirmed. indeed, current economicrecovery drive mainly improvement corporate sector. while june’s tankansurvey show ratio current profit sale manufacture industry fiscal 2000 isexpected recover 4.01%, slightly high average 3.84% since fiscal 1980, therecovery household sector delayed. the underlie trend private consumption isdetermined consumer sentiment employee income. while consumer sentiment beenimproving background recede concern financial system stability stockprices, employee income recently stop declining. thus, cannot yet confirm arecovery private consumption whole.nevertheless, look broadly situation japan’s economy face include bigchallenges balance sheet adjustment corporate sector transformation industrialstructure, current recovery process consider quite logical improvement thecorporate sector precede household sector. in chart 4, labor’s share income show asignificant increase, hand mean substantial decrease return capital since thebursting bubble. needle say, capital important factor production supportingeconomic development. if capital cannot generate sufficient return long period, becomedifficult firm raise capital. in case, firm cannot help improve return capital byreducing various cost include labor. the need improve return capital become especiallypressing firm directly expose pressure global financial market. in words, 3bis review 63/2000restructuring corporate sector prerequisite sustainable growth overall economyincluding household sector.in view need improve return capital, unlikely household income privateconsumption significantly increase time being. of course, labor’s share incomedeclines substantially, resultant stagnation private consumption hamper recovery theoverall economy. therefore, delicate balance income distribution key full-fledgedeconomic recovery. in regard, though number employee still year ago,supply demand condition labor market somewhat tighten evidence theincrease job offers. wages, decrease past two three years, yearincreased year-on-year basis.we sometimes discus relation corporate profit household income metaphoricallylikening relation water level dam release water it. if canclearly observe rise water level, signify increase corporate profits, probabilitythat water release dam rises, lead increase household income anincrease private consumption. however, since easy take time firm raise returnon capital improve balance sheets, release water dam cannot increasesignificantly. yet i think household income recover even moderately, higherprobability economy return growth path lead business fix investment. if i mayinterpret think member policy board behind statement 17 july, majoritywould like confirm confidence mechanism work.are price declining?the second point whether maintain deflationary concern trulydispelled cpi gdp deflator still falling. a chart 5 shows, price index aredeclining wpi recently begin exceed prior-year level. such movement cpi andthe gdp deflator may provoke argument deflationary concern dispelled,but economy actually deflationary state. the reason afraid deflation becauseonce economy fall deflationary spiral, vicious circle price decline depresseconomic activity turn lead downward pressure prices, difficult escape it.to avoid situation, february 1999 bank adopt zero interest rate policy, wasa drastic monetary ease measure. all show interpret decline cpi thegdp deflator important issue carefully examine it.a close look movement price statistic may always lead full understand whatprice change indicate. this various price index often move different direction ortemporarily movement appear consistent movement economicindicators. for example, take latter half 1988, peak bubble period. while theeconomy strong, measure price extremely stable. another example 1991, immediatelyafter burst bubble. notwithstanding fact economy enter serious recession,inflation mark peak. furthermore, 1996 gdp deflator trace large decline the1990s, gdp growth record high figure post-bubble period. these example underscorethe importance assess movement price index relation overall economicsituation. the current decline cpi partly attributable structural change thedistribution system addition past appreciation yen fall price consumerdurables. it also due decrease unit labor cost, often observe early stage ofeconomic recovery. in early stage recovery, productivity rise idle resource bring backinto use, unit labor cost declines, downward pressure price seen. the phenomenon ofthe decline labor cost price couple high growth observe 1987 1996. itappears factor behind phenomenon partly responsible recent decline inprices, particularly gdp deflator.on hand, may possible argue price decline would eventually lead thedanger economy fall deflationary spiral. however, recent decline cpi hadentailed danger deflationary spiral, corporate profit would decline lead decrease bi review 63/20004business fix investment employment, whereas, fact, observe increase bothcorporate profit business fix investment. moreover, danger would adverselyinfluenced labor market supply demand good services, but, matter offact, wage stop declining. to sum up, i think appropriate judge whether notthe economy might fall deflationary spiral simply look decline cpi gdpdeflator alone.based argument, policy board closely monitor examine deterioration thesupply demand balance, risk price decline stem weak demand.conceptually, supply demand balance japan’s economy whole could describe bysuch indicator output gap. the problem difficult accurately estimate outputgap. the difficulty common many industrial countries, main reason speed oftechnological innovation become fast easy measure economic value ofcapital. a result, face situation estimate output gap cannot explain fluctuationin prices. for example, 1998 1999, calculation base traditional model produce largeoutput gap estimates, economist thus forecast considerable price declines. the actualprice decline, however, large forecast. on hand, supply demandbalance perceive firm report tankan survey greatly improve past year.these observation suggest order grasp change supply demand balance, weshould apply estimate output gap deduce conventional methodology alsomake full use information regard supply demand balance individual good andservices.let summarize view. first, difficult accurately estimate output gap, isthe degree excess supply macroeconomic terms. second, likely potential growth ratehas recently decline substantially result stagnant investment past ten years. thus,even aggregate demand grow moderately one two years, supply demand balanceshould improve, indeed evidence economic development since last year. third, whetherthe output gap continue narrow depend prospect economic recovery lead privatedemand. if become confident recovery, moderate decline price index shouldnot necessarily interpret supply demand imbalance manifestation risk adeflationary spiral.excessive corporate debt financial system problemthe third point whether economy exhibit robust recovery situation firmsare burden excessive debt bank still hold large amount non-performing assets.indeed, one major factor behind sluggishness japan’s economy 1990s wasbalance sheet adjustment firm banks. we fully recognize gravity excessive debt heldby firms, especially construction, real estate, distribution industries, mention thenon-performing asset hold banks. in fact, experience serious financial system crisis 1997and 1998 characterize large-scale credit crunch financial sector exert strongdownward pressure economic activity. thus, extremely important incorporate theassessment financial system economic outlooks. this one reason believe theeconomic recovery likely moderate rather robust.it also true financial system stability significantly restore result injectionof capital major bank march 1999. with improve creditworthiness recede concern overliquidity, bank compete win good customers. accord tankan survey,firms report gradual relaxation lend attitude banks. while may far asituation many bank aggressively assume credit risk appropriate risk control system inplace strongly support economic growth, situation lend attitude ofbanks cautious would hamper economic recovery. therefore, remain industriesand firm burden excessive debt, i think possible expect recovery, though speedyas previous recoveries, overall economy momentum new growth intensify reflectingthe progress technological innovation. 5bis review 63/2000another reason care debt problem large firm like sogo collapse, marketsometimes become extremely nervous. it note impact shock differ caseto case. for example, case sogo special reconstruction framework suddenlychanged. in event, problem financial system, collapse individualfirm likely perceive isolate case. at moment, need closely monitor whetherthere risk market may suddenly turn nervous, is, view, one factorsthat rightly take account conduct monetary policy.the relationship structural adjustment monetary policysince release statement 17 july, various comment effect thebank japan continue zero interest rate policy concern large-scale bankruptciesdisappears structural adjustment completed. there also comment contrary,namely, continuation zero interest rate policy delay progress structuraladjustment. this bring fourth point relate termination zero interest ratepolicy, relationship structural adjustment.regarding view bank continue zero interest rate policy structuraladjustment completed, think necessary. in discuss this, need distinguishbetween potential growth rate cyclical short-term growth rate japan’s economy. inrecent years, often say potential growth rate u economy boost theit revolution. but point take long time it apply businessand result improve productivity. similarly, take long time structural reformpromoted japanese firm lead improve productivity high potential growth. here, itshould note various force structural adjustment influence economy. andhence, even potential growth rate low, economy able grow strongly thecyclical growth rate exceed potential growth rate. this, i think, business cycle.to deal decline potential growth stem structural factors, policy target tosolve structural problem firms’ effort restructure indispensable. there otherway. in short, monetary policy cannot replace structural policy.let turn contrary comment zero interest rate policy hold backstructural adjustment. we also hear relate comment zero interest rate policy beengenerating various kind moral hazard, socially economically. it true zerointerest rate policy, provide market ample fund guide overnight rate tovirtually zero, could create situation bank firm become le sensitive borrowingcosts liquidity risks. indeed, effect policy support economic recoveryand promote structural reform. at time, cannot deny policy may tend delaystructural reform make economic agent large amount debt le conscious borrowingcosts liquidity risks. of course, i think appropriate lift zero interest rate policy toprevent moral hazard. let make clear termination zero interest rate policy dependson whether confident economic recovery primarily lead private demand.is termination zero interest rate policy consistent fiscal policy?the fifth point relation termination zero interest rate policy thegovernment’s fiscal policy stance. some argue stimulus monetary policy side isessential premature terminate zero interest rate policy stimulus fromfiscal policy expect consider significant deterioration government’s fiscalposition. others argue that, government formulate supplementary budget stimulate theeconomy, fiscal policy aim achieve economic recovery lead private demand thebank’s monetary policy harmonized.of course, bank japan never ignore government’s fiscal policy stance conductingmonetary policy. a i reiterate many times, terminate zero interest rate policyunless feel confident economic recovery lead private demand. chart 6 show bi review 63/20006contribution private demand government expenditure year-on-year growth real gdp,which indicate drive force behind economy steadily shift governmentexpenditure private demand, gdp growth rate gradually rising. the bank japanwill terminate zero interest rate policy feel confident economic recovery ledby private demand prospect, i believe consistent government aimingat.impairing proper function market mechanismthe sixth point relate function market mechanism. there view properfunctioning financial market impair zero interest rate policy shouldbe restore terminate policy. in fact, worry impairment marketfunctions adopt unprecedented zero interest rate policy february 1999. therefore, wetook cautious approach guide overnight call rate zero confirm properfunctioning market mechanism way. in retrospect, tentative assessment thispoint time impairment market function turn small anticipated. theovernight call rate exactly zero percent, though close zero be, long-term interestrates zero. under configuration interest rates, market mechanism isfunctioning.the contraction call market often cite example evidence impairment marketmechanism. this reflect fact that, interest rate ordinary deposit high thecall rate, investor transfer fund call market ordinary deposits. under suchcircumstances, sudden withdrawal fund investor ordinary deposit would causeinstability liquidity position bank receive deposits, might eventuallyinfluence formation overnight call rate. however, problem cannot decisive factor indetermining whether terminate zero interest rate policy.interest income pensionersthe seventh last point fact zero interest rate policy negative effect oneconomic agent largely depend interest income, pensioners. obviously interestincome financial asset fall significantly zero interest rate policy, arewell aware fact policy adversely affect household depend heavily interestincome. the elderly hold relatively large amount financial asset evidence fact thatabout half total financial asset individual hold age 60 over, whoseearned income much. a result, elderly affect low interest rate havecontinued long period, sympathize situation.however, let emphasize raise interest rate would solve problem. household canearn interest income deposit bank obtain interest income loans. in otherwords, source interest income receive economic growth, interest income begenerated economy grow. view different angle, economic growth andincreased employment opportunity would ensure stability household income. householdincome primarily consist employee income, account 70% national income.by review facts, i hope understand imminent need achieve sustainableeconomic recovery lead private demand.iii.monetary policy uncertaintyso far i present majority view policy board issue relate termination ofthe zero interest rate policy. the bank japan recently state japan’s economy come toa stage condition lift zero interest rate policy met. however, since thereare inflationary risks, argue termination zero interest rate policy unnecessary,besides risk involve termination unknown. we discuss conduct ofmonetary policy, always bear mind risk termination continuation zero 7bis review 63/2000interest rate policy. the difficulty inherent conduct monetary policy stem fact aclear decision, whether change interest rates, make uncertainty withinherently limit information outlook mechanism economy.among various metaphor central bank, i remember one say central bank like adriver wind road mist windshield rearview mirror inaccuratespeedometer. i think well describe essence difficulty central bank facein conduct monetary policy. the economic outlook correspond mist windshield, andthe limitation economic statistic rearview mirror inaccurate speedometer. and thevarious risk economy face correspond wind road. a central bank drive carunder condition stay alert anticipate risk make use lesson obtainedfrom past experiences. with comment introduction, let present personal view themeaning discuss termination zero interest rate policy time observeany imminent risk inflation.we often hear argument monetary policy change risk inflationbecomes evident. at first glance argument appear reasonable since target monetary policyis price stability. a matter fact, bubble period late 1980s, conduct monetarypolicy base argument. from 1986 1988, economy grow annual rate of5%, asset price soared, general price level extremely stable. under circumstances,the bank japan could find opportunity preemptively correct low interest rate policy atthe time. it may 1989 inflationary pressure become obvious everybody thebank could raise official discount rate. since history never exactly repeat itself, cannot claimthat fully experience various situation monetary policy might change onceinflationary pressure become evident. it also point today’s situation, isheavily burden aftermath burst bubble, vastly different situationduring bubble period. with caveats, ask lesson learnedfrom experience late 1980s today’s context? let mention two points.first, policy change response clear present risk inflation would inevitably bemonetary tightening, and, moreover, cumulative interest rate hike would probably need wasthe case 1989 1990. in view high amount government bond outstanding, forexample compare late 1980s, capital loss government bond cause higherinterest rate would, thing equal, pose much large problem economy. we mustthus avoid, extent possible, monetary policy force central bank raise interest ratesrapidly substantially late stage could destabilize economy financialsystem.second, zero interest rate policy continue long period even economy clearlyrecovers, economic agent tend conduct activity base expectation currentextremely low interest rate sustain indefinitely. this happen bubble period,leading enormous waste resource continue inflict pain u today. i alladvocate high probability similar situation would occur similar scale. what i would liketo mention current situation financial markets, where, example, premium creditrisk suppress liquidity effect zero interest rate policy, could include potential riskof create misallocation resources.then, appropriate time adjust interest rate inflation risk become matter ofconcern? if come perfectly accurate economic outlook well time need forthe policy effect permeate economy, conduct farsighted preemptive policy theright time appropriate scale. this always ideal vision central banks. in fact, bank ofjapan make effort accurately analyze past, present, future economy. though wemake policy judgment base analyses, admittedly conduct monetary policy greatuncertainty limit second sight well imperfect data information like metaphorof car driver. this brutal fact central bank world, include bank japan,must face. bi review 63/20008there central bank visibly incorporate uncertainty modus operandi theconduct monetary policy. for example, bank england forecast inflation, singlefigure, probability distribution. we thus easily understand great uncertainty inpredicting, example, growth rate inflation 2002. if humbly accept suchuncertainty even try utmost make accurate economic forecasts, one useful approachmight confirm degree economic improvement adjust monetary ease accordingly inorder realize sustainable growth. a digression, taylor rule, well know policyrule theories, attract attention internationally actively studied. this rule advocate smoothadjustment interest rate pay attention output gap fluctuation prices, whichseems base similar policy philosophy i described.a hundred eighteen year pass since bank japan established. and, yet, alsoa “young” central bank reborn two year ago new bank japan law, thus notrack record yet established. i believe good track record calmly evaluatingeconomic financial conditions, fully explain decision implement them, give

financial competitive conditionsnecessary contribute pursuit growth sustainable non-inflationary. but themonetary policy council indicate past years, monetary policy need relay theother main component economic policy. four condition would appear necessary preserve andreinforce complete success single currency.firstly, national fiscal policy contribute maintain framework stabilitythe single monetary policy cannot, itself, ensure price stability best possible conditions.fiscal policy must respect letter spirit stability growth pact.in absence significant community budget, close co-ordination national fiscal policiesand careful peer surveillance within council eurogroup ecofin council—consistingof finance minister 15 member countries—are indispensable appropriatepolicy mix euro area

achieve europe france gradually adopt anopen attitude towards important “factors production”, namely labour, capital technicalprogress. for long time, persistent mass unemployment, structural cause poorlyunderstood, lead adoption certain neo-malthusian attitudes: effort reduce availableworkforce order curtail unemployment, spurn productivity-enhancing investment think tocontribute high unemployment and, finally, wariness towards technical progress, seenas potential destroyer jobs.little wonder seek limit available workforce, capital stock technical progress,europe france saw

second quarter next year. noris entirely clear extensive impact event china, world, region,or hong kong – fast slow impact take effect.4.some initial assessment impact hong kong china’s wto accession were,in fact, quite negative. a even alarmist. the trend analysis seem positive.it is, however, qualify recognition challenge hong kong faces, standardswe need maintain, improve on, make uniquely advantageousposition. the chamber’s detail analysis implication (which provide solid basisfor discussion summit) is, view, excellent example need help usunderstand historical turn point world trade

speak detail elsewhere economic implications, and, inparticular, implication hong kong’s bank financial sector china’s entry wto.so i shall deal briefly here, turn two process globalisationand technological advance. to summarise research world bank, hkma otherorganisations: china’s share world’s external trade predict double space fiveyears result wto entry – around three-and-a-half per cent seven per cent.this rapid growth mainland’s share world trade, couple project growth tradevolume rate 7% per annum, likely mean yet mainland-related business hongkong, undoubtedly also mean great deal business shanghai othermainland city well. in words, business ‘creation effect’ stimulate wto accessionwill far outweigh ‘diversion effect’, pessimist predict hongkong’s trade would gradually dry shrivel up. to put figure it, estimate within thehkma suggest hong kong’s annual gdp growth rate boost somewhere betweenhalf one per cent increase re-export trade result china’s membership thewto.6.but end it. for le visible trade, financial, technical professionalservices, outlook even promising. these lucrative service industries, areincreasingly take pride place hong kong’s economy, greatly boost business fromchinese enterprise seek expand capability improve governance handleincreased trade meet foreign competition. they also stimulate overseas investor whoneed advice make best

this? we expect see two main developmentsover next years. the first great demand bank service result thegrowing volume business follow wto accession. the second financial deepening,stimulated rapid financial liberalisation, great bank competition, product innovationinduced term wto accession. these development accelerate reform already intrain within china’s domestic bank sector – reform cover

two years’ time, foreign bank able conduct rmb businesswith chinese enterprise shanghai, shenzhen, tianjin dalian. within five years, beable deal chinese enterprise without geographical restriction. the advantage forbanks base hong kong obvious. many head start mainland, withnetworks branch generation practical experience. they also theadvantages geographical proximity, common language culture,

asthis need little reminder: rule law, free movement goods, capital information, lightgovernment, train energetic workforce.globalisation10.wto globalisation. so let turn subject now. hong kong’s openness, andour connectedness large world, place u excellent position take advantage theacceleration globalisation trade financial liberalisation, force bring about.globalisation new phenomenon. our ancestor embrace idea open tradingroutes, build canal steamships, lay railway line telegraph cables. andfor hundred fifty year more, hong kong classic example global hub – cityat crossroad number regional transcontinental trade routes. the process ofglobalisation not, frequently reminded, universally benevolent force. but process haslargely ensure international capital allocate efficiently used, thatnations produce good service competitive advantage. and, whatever therisks shortcomings, efficient global financial system, effective processof globalisation is. a result, global growth development benefit.11.it possible discus subject number angle long time. but ishould like focus two aspect today. one globalisation, experience today, ischanging role governments. the implication globalisation choice ofexchange rate regime individual jurisdictions.12.to benefit globalisation, national economic system make distinct movementtowards alan greenspan call ‘market-oriented capitalist structures’. fifty year moreago, clear trend towards state regulation, centralisation, – extreme – nationalisation.today, opposite direction: theme liberalisation, privatisation deregulation.indeed, economy grade extent market orientation. government havebecome small relative economy serve. market competition, free distortingregulation dirigiste policies, come fully play, low transaction informationcosts increase market efficiency. there generally great recognition beneficial impactof market-oriented policies, great realisation globalisation make intervention, howeverdesirable might cases, great deal le effective.13.we therefore see sea change way government approach economicmanagement. in post-war period imperative reconstruction concern marketfailure predominated: approach extensive government involvement function aneconomy frequent intervention. the consensus approach now, follow one degree anotherin major economies, government retreat economic management, though without bi review 114/20004abdicating responsibility seek ensure arena market force come intoplay operate fair, equal transparent way.14.hong kong come new paradigm much early most. in fact, general viewoutside hong kong develop example paradigm. the philosophy ofpositive non-interventionism, coin twenty-odd year ago describe paradoxical highlyeffective economic policy government already follow years, intersect neatlywith rise global ‘market-oriented capitalist structures’ whatever size complexity. our freemarket tradition openness world position u well new globalism.15.but globalisation bring challenge scale immediacy seenbefore, openness time vulnerability. the difficult thesechallenges financial market, problem outside rapidly escalate intocrises threaten integrity whole system. capital flows, particularly boostedby high leverage, become large, fast, volatile sometimes quite destabilising. large economieswith deep market may able withstand volatility without stability seriouslyundermined. yet, even then, government intervention one form another necessary:witness ltcm episode 1998, recent intervention support euro. for smalland open economies, own, challenge even hard meet, measuresnecessary prevent market failure even dramatic. we face episode inhong kong 1998, shock wave highly mobile volatile international capital flowsthreatened market collapse. our intervention stock market august 1998 keep ourmarkets work earn u great deal vilification time, – wrong reason perhapssince go make profit – great deal praise since. but let’s leave last word onthis – least time – alan greenspan. he said, post mortem early year onthe asian financial crisis, follow words:official safety net intervention cannot eliminate entirely. there arelimits size extent shock private sector manage, atleast short run, without official assistance.16.looking ahead, minimise need government intervention aim head offmarket failure induce large volatile capital flows, need build big market tostrengthen market already have. the challenge – age grandiose governmentschemes long palatable feasible – find way without muchgovernment, include regulatory, involvement. among significant development theinternational effort deal issue code practice, rather regulatory impositions,and promotion transparency. increasingly, focus much architecture – buildingsomething grand visible replace defunct bretton wood system – infrastructure:laying connection make sure work properly rather build wall andbarriers. i shall say minutes.17.a crucial element management international capital flow is, course, questionof exchange rate systems, special target large speculator look short-term profitopportunities asian financial crisis. where exchange rate target whichbets laid, pressure build quite formidable. even exchange rate isfreely floating, therefore theoretically free precise exchange rate target, sentiment isone-sided, often case financial markets, exchange rate overshoot quitecommon.18.largely background financial crisis 1990s, choice ofexchange rate regime prominent issue, clear trend think whatconstitutes effective credible choice. this choice boil two options, nowcommonly refer two corner solutions: either exchange rate target perceive beimpregnable regime involve exchange rate target, free float. neithersolution is, admittedly, immune crisis, particularly case open liquid markets. and theprecondition exchange rate regime, credible, build upon sensibleeconomic policies, strong institution robust market infrastructures. 5bis review 114/200019.clearly, exchange rate regime perfect, simple regime suit all. thepresent trend towards float regimes, though seem work best large economies,whose foreign exchange market big enough absorb voluminous capital flows, thesmaller economy control restriction practised. for hong kong, ourlinked exchange rate system extreme case exchange rate target perceive beimpregnable – prove impregnable adverse conditions. the link,in combination sound fundamental well manage banks, help u recentcrisis: without hardship, must acknowledged, considerably le damage anduncertainty would experience place. the tight discipline exert onour economy help propel improvement productivity, important element currentrobust recovery. indeed, evidence date suggest hong kong experience one fastestrebounds

likely involve careful controlledexperiments great exchange rate flexibility distant future, cautious andconsidered move towards currency convertibility fullness time.technological advance20.i make reference early emphasis international financial reform lay downconnections, rather raise wall restrictions. so let turn process oftechnological advance, final topic today. this intricately link question ofglobalisation, particularly case information technology. indeed, without it, globalisation aswe understand would take place. again, new trend: century newnavigation aids, railway steamships, telegraph, telephone, late radio, television andsatellites boost speed quantity information travel around world. nowthe internet electronic channel vastly expand capacity.21.in field financial services, recent advance information technology play anenormous role determine speed manner money circulate nature thecompetitive landscape. money, solid, heavy difficult shift around, turn

montreal, quebec, 4 december 2000.* * *why float exchange rate regime make sense canadaas i near end term governor, i find look back more, focus thebroad, longer-term trend economy financial market trend mayimply future.one issue often surface year exchange rate canadian dollar.indeed, past couple years, topic considerable public discussion. thatdiscussion revolve around question as: should continue floating, peg ourcurrency u dollar? in fact, even keep currency, adopt uscurrency?that interest exchange rate hardly surprising. some recent attentionno doubt stem public concern relatively low value canadian dollar incomparison u dollar. but fundamental reason interest exchange rate animportant price economy, particularly one open ours. export represent 40% oftotal canadian output. and add imports, proportion double 80%. in addition, than80% trade unite states. so value currency term u dollar hasalways particularly important us. but must careful exaggerate point, becausewhen come exports, compete many foreign country share u market.and exchange rate currency relative also matter great deal.in 1950, second world war, canada become first major country adopt floatingexchange rate. in 1962, go back fix exchange rate float currency in1970. in all, canadian dollar float 42 past 50 years. no major countryhas much experience float exchange rate.this mean float exchange rate regime somehow outlast critics! forthe part, though, debate year market value canadian dollar- whether float high low, especially viewpoint certain exporter andimporters.more recently, however, certainly montreal, discussion focus onwhether float currency right exchange rate regime canada. this particular debate hasbeen kindle advent euro adoption 11 member european union thebeginning 1999.i enter debate early 1999, argue introduction euro remarkableachievement, provide useful role model canada position northamerica. since then, increase interest subject internationally, considerablediscussion exchange rate alternative canada countries.in canada, debate exchange rate regime mainly among academic economists. but,with decline currency u dollar 1990s, exchange rate alsobeen raise concern business community compare less-impressive economicperformance unite states.outside canada, debate exchange rate regime also become active, especially partsof latin america long history high inflation exchange rate crises. indeed, insome countries, commentator argue favour outright adoption uscurrency. bi review 112/20002today, i would like return issue right exchange rate regime canada. have againconsidered advantage disadvantage current arrangements, i tell outsetthat i remain convince float exchange rate continue make sense u stage ourhistory. i propose examine different side argument respect float currency inas simple straightforward manner possible.the transaction cost float currencywhen amount cross-border trade financial transaction large unitedstates, need exchange currency raise cost transactions. moreover, currenciesinvolved floating, future level exchange rate uncertain, also foreignexchange risk consider hedge against. for example, investor borrower must take intoaccount level interest rate canada unite states, also potentialmovements exchange rate term investment loan. so, yes, certaintransactions cost separate currency.a fix exchange rate canadian u currencies, 1962 1970,does away transaction costs. conversion two currency would stillbe required. moreover, fix exchange rate eliminate currency risk. if anyperceived risk future devaluation fix rate canadian dollar, result would bepersistently high interest rate canada unite state compensate risk.even country go beyond fix exchange rate tie currency rigidly tothe u dollar - hong kong argentina have, currency board - costs, term ofrisk premium domestic interest rates, completely disappeared.so, fact, way eliminate cross-border transaction cost unite state andeliminate premium interest rate potential exchange rate risk fixedexchange rate sort currency union unite states. in reality, wouldmean “dollarization”.dollarization versus monetary unionbut common-currency arrangement, europe? wouldn’t better?on face it, course, currency union would good dollarization. under anarrangement, would, principle, still say determine north american monetarypolicy. presumably, would also able keep revenue (or seigniorage) issuingthat common currency.but must understand north american monetary union would mean reality. the europeanexperience rather enlighten respect. economic monetary union europe theproduct 50 year increase political economic integration. the recent adoption commoncurrency, step road european integration, take mainly political,rather economic, reasons. and come decision-making european central bank,the three large country euro area (germany, france, italy) agree “one country -one vote” rule eight medium- small-sized partners.i see could possibly similar arrangement north america, give cleardominance u economy. in effect, monetary union unite state could meanthat canada would adopt u dollar.the advantage float exchange rateso far, i focus cost cross-border transaction exchange rate regimesthat could reduce costs. but matters. the real world complicate 3bis review 112/2000place, i shall explain moment. and float exchange rate regime make sense forcanada.the case typically make float rate canada give u chance run anindependent monetary policy. that true. but days, really little difference thelow-inflation objective industrial countries. the real value float exchange rate canadais allow u different monetary condition unite state - monetary conditionsappropriate economic circumstances, even pursue general objective lowand stable inflation. the significance option ability respond externaleconomic shock affect u differently southern neighbours, respond differencesin domestic economic policies.let give couple example economic shock policy reflect thesedifferences.fluctuations world commodity price important first example. although reliance onprimary commodity diminish substantially years, good still account for30 40% canada’s exports. the unite states, hand, net importer ofcommodities. the asian financial crisis 1997-98, lead 20% decline price thekey primary commodity export, major negative shock canada. in contrast, theunited state benefit low prices.the decline value currency u dollar time response thateconomic shock. and help canadian manufacture non-commodity sector increasetheir export unite states. in way, impact fall employment income ourprimary sector low commodity price largely offset great expansion theseother sectors.another example involve fiscal restraint measure undertake federal andprovincial governments, begin mid-1990s, deal persistent deficit resultingunsustainable accumulation public debt. the unite state also budgetary problem. but theneed fiscal tighten much great effect corrective measure ontotal demand economy. to help transfer resource public private sectorand support overall demand canada, need low interest rate unitedstates. these low rate maintain period 1996 present. intoday’s globalize financial markets, persistent interest rate difference circumstance ihave describe possible float exchange rate.in examples, exchange rate act shock absorber u canadianeconomies, help facilitate need adjustment response differ shock differingpolicy requirements. even though two economy closely linked, move differentdirections. and happens, shock-absorber role float exchange rate invaluable.although recent example involve downward adjustment currency, alwaysbeen case. indeed, time economic shock policy difference twocountries work opposite direction, lead increase value canadiandollar.it is, course, possible cope unexpected shock policy difference fix exchangerate monetary union. but adjustment process take longer, difficult, willcost overall.imagine adjustment economy would require 1997-98 response thefall commodity prices, canadian dollar floating. to maintain fix exchangerate throughout period, much high interest rate would necessary resist thedownward pressure currency fall receipt commodity exports. in effect, thiswould mean serious economic slowdown bring wage salary level thatwould make industry competitive allow increase exports. bi review 112/20004even common-currency arrangement, would still go much sameadjustment long term. but arrangement, short-term pain - interms decline employment income - would felt primary industry inregions canada high concentration industries.the bottom line is: there escape need adjust real economic shock regardless thecurrency regime. but floating-rate regime help facilitate smooth adjustment process.before concluding, i would like quickly deal couple common misconception aboutflexible exchange rates.the first one relate incentive business innovate invest new technology. if theargument low exchange rate give export firm easy profit blunt theirmotivation innovate become efficient competitive, i incline say thissuggests rather serious problem corporate governance. surely, job company director toensure management everything necessary maximize profit stock values, matterwhat circumstances. any company operate way soon find lose thecompetition.another misconception relatively low exchange rate put country disadvantage termsof foreign takeovers. here, i would say canadian company become attractive recentyears u corporate buyers, primarily high stock market valuation unitedstates, low canadian dollar. high stock price essentially provide u companieswith cheap finance corporate takeover country market valuation lower.we saw similar process involve canadian takeover foreign company recently, whenstock market valuation hit high level country.concluding thoughtslet summarize main points. in view close economic financial link unitedstates, i recognize attraction reduce currency uncertainty low transaction cost thatwould part fix exchange rate arrangement u dollar.nonetheless, i believe canada, macroeconomic advantage flexible exchange ratecontinue far outweigh low transaction cost fix rate. a long remain majorproducer primary commodities, long want pursue separate economic policy thatare suit circumstance require differ monetary conditions, shock-absorberelement float currency serve u well.does float exchange rate regime mean likely persistently weak currency?no, not.through second half 1990s, see u dollar strong virtually allother currencies, reflect remarkable performance u economy. in process, however,the unite state also build large cumulative deficit transaction rest theworld. at stage, external deficit reversed, low u dollar partof adjustment.here canada, slow start early 1990s, fundamental economy improved.growth robust recent years, employment income rising, inflationis low stable. government budget deficit eliminated, public debt relative thesize economy shrinking. moreover, part major restructure effort theprivate sector, business invest heavily machinery, equipment, technology. wemay start see payoff efforts, form large productivity gains,which i hope grow continue, thereby provide basis improve standard live forcanadians future.all all, prospect economy positive. if prospect realized, alsosee

work together sustain long-term prosperity. then dispel theperception region distress, restore confidence get move again.sound fundamentalswhat lesson asean country draw crisis? first, despite upheaval, thetransformation east asia last two decade mirage. the asian miracle real - thehalving poverty rates, dramatic improvement live standards, literacy health standards,and modernisation economies. asia’s prolong boom underpin soundeconomic fundamentals. these remain vital positive factor, help asean prosperagain.however, many economy significant structural weaknesses. financial regulation supervisionwere weak, transparency lacking, serious shortcoming governance publicadministration. “kkn” - indonesian acronym corruption, collusion, nepotism - often aproblem. these weakness may may cause crisis, certainly contribute itsseverity. the weakness must resolutely tackled, otherwise even economic growth resumes, thefundamental problem vulnerability remain.capital account riskssecond, crisis expose risk open capital account prematurely. a free flow capitalcan provide country much need fund develop economies. but country toliberalise capital regime step strengthen domestic economy andinstitutions. if open corporate sector financial system ready, run therisk swamp volatile capital flows, inwards well outwards.bank finance risksthird, crisis highlight danger rely heavily bank financing. capital market inmost asean country relatively under-developed. before crisis, many firm borrowedshort-term foreign currencies, order finance long-term project earn revenue denominatedin local currencies. these mismatch expose borrowers, lenders, entire system toconsiderable risks. when crisis strike currency plunged, vicious spiral.businesses saddle massive increase debt burden foreign currency debts, andran difficulties. this get bank trouble, which, turn, leave firm alternativeavenues raise work capital stay afloat. country therefore need develop capitalmarkets, diversify source fund reduce dependence bank lending.the international financial systembeyond domestic factors, crisis also uncover weakness international financialsystem, raise question role imf world bank. several international groupsare examine issues. they make useful proposal recommendation improveaspects global financial architecture, although issue still remain contentious, howto regulate hedge funds. the task implement without delay reform broadconsensus reached. the reform prevent future crisis mishaps. however, theyshould make financial systems, especially emerge markets, robust le vulnerable tocontagion effect next crisis strikes. bi review 111/20004rebuilding confidence prosperitygiven conclusions, asean rebuild investor confidence achieveprosperity?accepting globalisationfirst, country accept globalisation reality. they take advantage ofglobalisation, fight it. it powerful trend bring benefit people.before crisis, asean prosper rid wave globalisation. their take beenfuelled strong investment mncs, buoyant export free trade economic policies.within asean, open economy also fast growing, whereas isolation lead tostagnation.against backdrop, crisis come profound shock, could easily cause backlashagainst globalisation. have country turn back foreign investment exports, wouldhave impoverish weaken region. fortunately happened.there understandable nationalistic sentiment sell distress company lowprices foreigners. but asean country continue seek foreign investment trade. theirpeople eager learn english, exploit internet. they know plug globaleconomy still best way sustain growth, create job prosperity citizens.they also know competition become keener, make economy moreattractive foreign investments. a malaysian finance minister daim zainuddin acknowledge inhis recent budget speech:“in borderless world, large international conglomerate great choice intheir investment decisions.”accepting globalisation mean progressively deregulate liberalise asean economies, easingrules foreign ownership participation, open hitherto protect sectors. by exposingtheir economy wind change pressure global competition, country willstrengthen players, learn hold without crutch protection.of course process managed. sudden deregulation control economy may lead tochaos collapse, happen indonesia 1998, imf press suharto governmentto dismantle everything overnight. but properly implemented, open lead substantial longterm benefit prosperity, despite short term social economic costs.globalisation mean asean country allow swamp byforeign companies. it legitimate ambition country want build strongcompanies. but company need internationally competitive; viable todepend protect home markets. company cannot hold domestically find itvery difficult compete abroad.furthermore, government must understand industry best chance build up,given nature global marketplace. in many industry technology economy scale haveled worldwide wave merger consolidations. for example bank automanufacturing scale become global, large player dominate worldwidemarket. in industries, promise approach small medium country seekinvestments major players, build national champion compete againstthe giants. this thailand do auto industry.globalisation downside. the competition intense, environment constantly rapidlychanging, restructure upgrade endless tasks, unpredictable disaster strike timeto time. all bring disorientation, new insecurities, sense loss control. but governmentshave manage problem risks. they need cushion social impact globalisation, tohelp industry long viable make change, equip population necessaryskills new economy, provide social safety net bottom. there realalternative accept globalisation order improve life people. 5bis review 111/2000asean economic cooperationit also important asean country work together, strengthen cooperation amongthemselves, address international issue common concern us.asean economic cooperation progressively gain momentum crisis. majorinitiatives launched, especially asean free trade area (afta) aseaninvestment area (aia). these promise increase significantly flow trade investmentsamong asean countries.however crisis cause country hold back, order give struggle domesticindustries breathe space. these pressure real, anxiety protect individualindustries, country lose sight wide benefit asean cooperation theireconomies whole.it therefore important asean member reaffirm commitment regional economiccooperation integration, implement afta asean investment area letter andspirit. the asean member relatively better, thailand, malaysia, singaporeand brunei, take lead, work together put asean cooperation track again.at last week’s 4th asean informal summit singapore, asean leader launch initiative forasean integration “iai”. it intend narrow divide old newermembers asean enhance asean’s competitiveness region. it framework themore develop asean member help member need help, makeasean prosper. to kick off, singapore offer package it train assistance humanresource development myanmar, laos, cambodia vietnam, china, japan southkorea also offer assistance fall within iai’s broad framework.of course, asean’s future depend much external factor direct initiative topromote intra-asean trade investment, build economic strength individualmembers. our economy highly dependent international trade, interest worktogether actively freer, stable secure global trade environment.asean therefore need support open, stable multilateral trade system wto, theearly launch new round trade negotiations. strong multilateral rule foundation forworld trade, protection anarchic bilateral unilateral trade policies. small countriescould survive without them; even large economy would much poor tit-for-tatenvironment. hence asean strongly support candidacy dr supachai panitchpakdi thedirector generalship wto.besides wto, asean member need take full advantage apec, support itsconcept “open regionalism”, goal free trade investment asia pacific region.asean also need explore link regional groups, example north east asiathrough possible free trade area china, japan south korea. at informal summit, theasean plus three country clearly recognise interest dividebetween northeast southeast asia continue widening. the “plus three countries” want workwith asean, develop close deep linkage two sub-regions.the way strengthen asean economic cooperation participate actively externalfora, opt them. this send strong signal world asean remainsan open outward look organisation, member welcome competition andstrengthening group. it help restore asean’s credibility vigorous andeffective organisation play responsible, relevant role international stage.corporate sector restructuringthe third area crisis country focus attention corporate sectors. insolventand non-viable company restructured, set growth firm basis restoreconfidence. the problem differ country country, fundamental issue common. bi review 111/20006first, huge outstanding debt owe corporate sector must resolved, cleanly andexpeditiously possible. government need step push process through, extremis totake insolvent firm clean-up themselves. clear enforceable bankruptcy law areneeded deter prolong default debtors, give creditor incentive settle. and thefuture, must transparency term corporate governance reporting.for example, thailand pass new bankruptcy foreclosure law last year, i understand hasjust pass new account act. among things, new law stipulate minimumqualifications auditors, ensure director take great responsibility accuracy offinancial statements. investor analyst view step positively, especially foreclosurecases bring new law court fairly speedily settled.second, many private sector firms, particularly family-owned companies, need upgrade andmodernise management.family business conglomerate feature many asian economies. these build upthrough business acumen drive founders, still account sizeable component ofthe economies.but world changed. capability competence premium, relationship countfor less. family company need segregate clearly ownership right management functions, andbring significant shareholder external capital. their challenge evolve moderncorporations family companies. they need run professionally best manfor job, heir may may inherit business skill acumen thefounder.third, government need untangle complicate deeply-entrenched tie state, banksand industry, exist many asian countries, like chaebols south korea, thestate-owned enterprise china. such industry enterprise often account significant shareof gdp, neither subject market discipline, drive purely economicconsiderations. they often find difficult operate efficiently private sector firms. bank fail toapply normal criterion approve loans, political pressure implicit state guarantees.employees enjoy de facto life-time job security. well-connected person help privilegesat companies’ expense. and government find politically impossible close theoperations, matter unsuccessful.it essential speed restructure reform unproductive enterprises. in china, thegovernment make massive effort reform soes. in south korea president kim dae jung ispushing chaebols rationalise consolidate, change traditional way business.asean country must lag behind, else affect confidence investment climate.banking sector reformsbesides pursue corporate restructuring, asean economy must persevere clean andrecapitalise unsound banks, strengthen bank sector. bank play critical role everyeconomy. for asean economy continue grow, need new investments. theseinvestments require financing, sound bank able will lend sound borrowers.the immediate priority speed resolution non-performing loan (npl) within thebanking system. the process underway, far complete. even today, npls someasean country remain well 20%. a case corporate restructuring, effectivebankruptcy law essential. asset management company (amcs) need sufficient power dealexpeditiously debt unrecoverable. otherwise bank problem infect thewhole economy, drag country deep-seated malaise japan.finding new money write bad loan relatively easy part. it difficult, butequally important, bank put place proper systems, structures, prudential standards, toprevent problem happen again. they need establish rigorous credit cultures. they 7bis review 111/2000must lend base personal relationships, objective assessment borrowers’creditworthiness.many country encourage bank merger consolidation part plan strengthenthe financial sector. merger help strengthen commercial banks, give scale tocompete globalise financial industry. however, merger insufficient. unlessmergers accompany measure improve corporate governance, merely createone large weak bank several small weak ones.financial sector reform also include strengthen supervisory system institutions.had supervision adequate first place, problem would become grave.professional independent supervisory authority tighten standard acceptable bankingpractices, time instil rigour rectitude among participant system. thesupervisors set standards, penalise errant lenders, remove implicit guarantees. creditdiscipline foster emergence strong companies, provide basis sustain growth.political social preconditionsall policy - accept globalisation, foster asean economic cooperation, restructure thecorporate sector, reform bank sector - essential country recover. but ina position implement make economic policy work, country must first create rightpolitical social preconditions.investors, domestic foreign, adopt wait-and-see attitude know politicaluncertainties resolved. their view colour past experiences, look forevidence clear break past.a stable political climate essential foster confidence, investment growth. government mustput house order, bring corruption control, install men woman integrity andcompetence key position within top leadership. a mr anand panyarachun, former primeminister thailand president thai chapter transparency international, said:“the basis non-corrupt culture integrity. … it state mind, anattitude. you corrupt without take money.”2the values, norm business environment asean country cannot transform overnight. itis enact new law regulations. it mean change deeply establish socialrelationships norm vary country country. businessmen, civil servant andpoliticians use operate one way year suddenly abandon condemn old practicesas soon new law passed. mom rachawong chatu mongol sonakul put aptly:“what long process. we’re talk month years.we talk in, maybe, decade generations. we’re change way ofworking. we actually try change way life.”3these matter country resolve itself, way. external input behelpful, may also counter-productive. for example indonesia imf seek drasticeconomic reforms, inevitably far-reaching political implications. the result completecollapse suharto government. but create new order follow challenge whichonly indonesia’s people leader resolve. foreign advice assistance play asecondary role.2asiaweek, 3 november 2000.3keynote address seminar organise jointly bank thailand world bank entitle “goodgovernance financial institutions” 10 june 2000. bi

deputy governor bank japan, fourth pariseuroplace financial forum, hold paris 27 november 2000.* * *introductionladies gentlemen,it great honor give opportunity speak paris europlace financialforum. i also understand forum, exchange view among distinguishedparticipants different experience special importance. therefore i reserve right ask foryour opinion interest topic recent development capital market impact ofinformation technology euro area.now, respect duty today, i three topic mind. first, i discus japan’seconomy challenge faces. then, i turn recent development euro area, asubject particular interest myself. here, i dare introduce observation theeconomic structural reform recently underway euro area. and last, i briefly touch onenhanced interrelation euro area japan.1.japan’s economy challenge facescompared year ago, i give speech forum last year, japan’s economy shownnotable improvement. the recent economic recovery mainly drive corporate sector, wherewe witness increase production corporate profits. against background, business fixedinvestment increasing, especially it telecommunication fields. although paceof recovery remain sluggish household sector, positive development observe inemployment income, reflect recovery business activity. in sum, japan’s economy isrecovering gradually, business fix investment continue increase.at time, however, cannot ignore fact japan yet solve structural problem inthe economy. in context, japanese firm bank continue suffer balance sheetproblems, aftereffect burst bubble 1990s. and, world economy,especially unite states, register high growth exploit benefit new technologysupported salient entrepreneurship well vibrant capital market, japan somewhatlagged behind ability adjust new environment. with nascent recovery nowunderway japan, constant effort necessary continue tackle remain structuralproblems head on, turn prerequisite sustainable growth.important progress already observed, though, financial sector. bank capital base hasbeen strengthen injection public money. there also progress reinforcingsafety nets. on top that, consolidation financial institutions, especially large ones, inprogress, something japan never experience since end world war ii. i sincerelyhope change beef profitability competitiveness financial institutions, therebyenhancing efficiency stability financial system whole.meanwhile, ongoing corporate restructure process may exert downward pressure economy inthe short run. but i believe facilitate efficient allocation resource high-growthindustries, contribute sustainable growth long run.to accelerate structural change, determine effort part policy maker alsoimportant. such effort include deregulation, tax reform improvement account bi review 108/20002legal systems. the bank japan, central bank, must contribute ensure stablemacroeconomic environment appropriate monetary policy measures, form thebasis creative future-oriented corporate activity. in addition this, bank japan assumesimportant responsibility improve financial market payment system infrastructure. thestart real-time gross settlement fund transfer government bond transfer beginningof next year one efforts.2.dynamism euro area economywhen i think structural reform japanese economy, i always think experience ofthe euro area economy front.today, nobody doubt importance structural reform, difficult achieve social andpolitical consensus practical approach. reform accompany pain, also take along time bear fruit. but direction set, reform call reform, thereby generatingautonomous momentum. development euro area economy considerable implication andare encourage us. i realize may sound simplistic essence reform lie marketintegration.i say market integration lead intensify competition. in euro area, merger andacquisitions drive force corporate restructure industry reorganization. this increasein m&a, start around 1997, doubt spark introduction euro. inaddition, firm force change management strategy survive amidglobal competition keep technological innovation. indeed, firm increasingly awarethat efficient management high profitability important today ever, suchrecognition evident recent m&a examples. these day firm expand businessfields, rather streamline business little competitive edge in, beef theones strategically important.market integration euro area also bring dynamic change economicinfrastructure, include transportation, electric power, telecommunications, finance. in area offinance, example positive development include creation new payment systems, suchas target (trans-european automate real-time gross settlement express transfer), rapidexpansion capital markets, merger integration stock exchanges. in addition, euroarea begin review tax system labor practices.amid sea change market integration introduction euro, deregulation marketinfrastructure consolidation seen. and private sector make resources, soto strengthen competitiveness. thus, market integration accelerate momentum competition, inturn stimulate momentum reform area economy finance. i believe everyeconomy potential growth. the problem realize potential. structural reformseems trigger regard.i know skeptical euro area economy. such voice often argue weakeconomy reason weak euro. for example, say structural rigidity euro areaeconomy, difference productivity unite state euro area, inducedthe massive outflow capital unite state thus cause euro weaken.the mechanism behind exchange rate complex, central banker, i ought makeany careless remark delicate subject. however, i say hastily assume thatthe weak euro merely reflect weak economy. capital outflow across atlantic could resultof intensify global competition stimulate various type strategic alliance across theborder.integration european market introduction common currency historically themost remarkable event since collapse bretton wood system nearly thirty year ago. assuch, characterize part project potential dramatically change 3bis review 108/2000landscape world economy. with mind, i continue keep close watch economicdevelopments euro area.3. interrelation euro area japanlastly, i would like give view interrelationship euro area japan, focusingon capital flows. a i mentioned, euro area, monetary union trigger various kind ofstructural change, bolster development overall economy. the impact large hasaffected euro area itself, also japan.an example effect direct investment. direct investment western europe japan soaredmore tenfold year, 100 billion yen 1998 1 trillion yen 1999.investment france especially large, reflect capital collaboration see inthe automobile industry. direct investment japan euro area also rise. the increasein direct investment promote reallocation management resources, technology transfer, andcompetition, result boost economies.the increase capital flow two economy well evidence portfolio investment. in1999, japan’s portfolio investment euro area exceed unite states. japan’s foreignportfolio investment france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg, four euro areacountries individual data available, total almost 5.6 trillion yen 1999. on otherhand, japan’s portfolio investment unite state 1.4 trillion yen. this rather noteworthy,because, international capital markets, unite states, huge current account deficit,absorbs lot fund provide euro area japan. despite situation, capital flowsbetween euro area japan surging, economy grow interdependent ininternational capital markets.in increasingly integrate global market, euro area japan become moredependent. i hope today’s forum contribute bring two economy closer, serve anopportunity enhance communication private sector euro area japan. iknow forum success. 1bis review

independence certain level ofdetachment everyday political debate, i know experience european centralbank, indeed provide propitious condition true discourse free expression ideas.this i appreciate opportunity i tonight address important topic tocombine widen deepen european union. in doing, i shall approach thesubject specific viewpoint central banker share idea concern theparticular role euro integration process grow european union. at sametime, i like stress clearly central bankers, rather politician andeuropean citizen make necessary “hard decisions” come weeks, month years.the challenge enlargementeuropean integration conceive project aim ensure peace, stability prosperity ineurope. it remain throughout five decade successful progress. at beginning- owe geopolitical circumstance time - new innovative concept achievingreconciliation stability economic integration could apply western europe.today, ten year “return europe” country unfortunate enough otherside “iron curtain”, face challenge extend successful model europeanintegration whole europe, truly overcome division continent. therefore, iwould regard forthcoming enlargement eu institutional response centraland eastern european countries’ application membership. rather, see therealisation union’s longer-term objective provide framework political stability andeconomic progress. such vision clearly underline eu’s current political agenda, whichtreats enlargement include 12 applicant countries, mostly central eastern europe, aquestion “whether not”, rather matter “when how”.what impact european union almost double size? it reasonable expect thatthe forthcoming enlargement increase diversity complexity within union anunprecedented extent.in economic terms, proper fulfilment so-called “copenhagen criteria”, require theaccession country function market economy able adopt exist communityrules, help avoid severe imbalance within enlarge union. in context, alsobe bear mind combine gross domestic product (gdp) accession countries- measure today’s figure - account 5% european union’s gdp. in addition, theinherent dynamic single market “convergence pressure” exercise policymakers andfinancial market alike also set aid rapid catching-up future new member states. theevidence real convergence provide ireland, spain portugal accession theeuropean community give grind confidence respect.in political institutional terms, however, eu indeed face great challenges. the sheerincrease number make decision-making difficult legitimate interest the“newcomers” may diverge significantly exist members, give different stage bi review 107/20002of economic transition development specific historical experience whichundoubtedly shape view europe.the member state appear commit address challenge context theongoing intergovernmental conference institutional reforms. let u hope igc agree onat least reform absolutely essential allow union function even afterenlargement. even so, appear almost certain forthcoming nice treaty amilestone. it mean end point ongoing fundamental institutional debate thefuture shape europe. in wide debate, many observer argue original objective ofan “ever close

union might lead standstill integration even unravel degree ofdeepening achieve far, i would suggest start certain amount “introspection” aim atassessing depth integration eu today.i believe little doubt eu already achieve high degree integration, ineconomic political terms: function single market complement successfulintroduction single currency. the framework pursuit common foreign securitypolicy give real substance, soon underpin nascent military capability. inaddition, scope common activity also extend highly sensitive field internalsecurity, immigration asylum.it premise i like put forward follow proposition, i try toillustrate remainder presentation: the depth integration eu today, isbased only, especially, establishment economic monetary union, will,over time, trigger integrative steps. these dynamic work anyway, unlikely tobe derail process enlargement. use metaphor “bicycle theory”, thenotion european integration progress order avoid backtrack past achievements- like bicycle keep go avoid fall - i would argue future eu, ratherthan diluted, set achieve deepening, even enlargement increase diversity.allow illustrate.emu catalyst integrationeconomic monetary union could regard source of, catalyst for, deeperintegration europe - fact side euro debate country use argumentmight see underline significance. there plenty evidence support proposition,which see preparatory phase emu (during 1990s) connection theactual launch euro 1999. but i believe also true longer-term perspective.over past decade, process prepare introduction euro bring agreater degree integration. the aim achieve economic monetary union 1999 thelatest call complete liberalisation capital movement within european community,closer coordination national economic policies, well institutionalise cooperation amongmonetary authority within european monetary institute. an emerge “stability consensus”among policymakers europe desirability stable currency sound public financesprovided crucial back a, sometimes painful, process budgetary consolidation anddisinflation, domestic policy objective need bring line need fulfilthe maastricht convergence criteria.if preparatory phase emu could best characterise generate common policy objectivesand joint outlook among policymakers - albeit without change exist institution - 3bis review 107/2000actual introduction euro 1 january 1999 certainly mark quantum leap institutionalterms. a day, new supranational institution, ecb assume responsibility themanagement single currency. endow necessary competency define andimplement single monetary policy, give clear objective maintain price stability grantedfull independence, ecb exercise core aspect state sovereignty european level.in policy terms, single monetary policy definition indivisible aim ensure themaintenance price stability euro area whole, mean cannot take accountspecific national situations. there one key interest rate, single integrate money market todistribute liquidity across euro area, - focal point medium report - onlyone euro exchange rate.sharing common currency imply need take policy perspective go beyond levelof national economy, also apply policy field monetary policy. thestability growth pact, aim shore proper function economic monetaryunion, require member state observe fiscal discipline make national budgetary planssubject scrutiny member states. increasingly, member state also will totake give advice learn policy area traditionally - andwill remain - exclusive national domains, labour market reform finance pensionliabilities. in areas, close cooperation europe mean force acceptance auniform model, impose ever-more powerful increasingly remote brussels bureaucracy.rather, exchange view help identify best practice provide room free play ofcompeting concept policy design - benefit involved.finally, “deeper integration” within sphere european economic policymaking could see asno long-overdue, political response market development towards globalisationwhich, case, cannot avoided. take, example, increase integration financialmarkets, drive desire market participant reap benefit arise introductionof euro. close cooperation among policymakers regulators, set common rule andthe promotion consistent practice merely help provide necessary framework properfunctioning single european financial market, depth sophistication similar theunited states. it integrate european financial market resource allocatedmost efficiently, benefit all, individual savers, institutional investor corporateborrowers.as i amply illustrate thus far, introduction euro undoubtedly mark significantstep towards deepen european union. it also advance emergence aunified eu economy, which, turn, contribute towards develop external perception of“europe” entity right.ladies gentlemen, “prepared ground” basis exist evidence, allow toelaborate possibly controversial aspect aforementioned proposition, namelythat economic monetary union will, itself, act impetus deepening.the internal dynamic emu source future deepeningthe euro unique position “a currency without state”. historically, soundness ofmoney always closely associate strength stability political structure ofwhich expression. therefore, legitimate question ask whether emu functionwithout form political union.allow approach question follow manner. to start off, concept politicalunion well defined. i sure you, attentive observer euro debate thiscountry, would agree term “political union” mean many thing many people,often depend political expediency desire public relation impact. from central banker’sperspective, is, “a forward-looking assessment base information currently available”, iwould argue eu today, single currency, already represent highly advancedinstitutional construction, combine supranational intergovernmental elements. with bi review 107/20004introduction euro, member states’ governments, especially euro area, startedto jointly assume - together european commission ecb - “shared specificresponsibilities single currency” (luxembourg european council conclusions). will jointexercise share responsibility area pivotal macroeconomic policy - even thisconcerns far sub-group eu member state - inevitably lead gradual transfer ofcompetencies brussels? be mean “political union” - increase centralisation ofpolicy decisions? i think not. allow give two examples.first, i would consider advisable centralise employment social policy eu level;rather, decision take national, regional, even local level allow necessaryflexibility adjust context specific constraint single currency. second, isquestionable whether centralise “federal” fiscal policy would appropriate mean tosupport ecb’s single monetary policy. instead brussels-steered policy aim at“levelling out” national regional difference within euro area, current system appear moreappropriate. today, national fiscal policy subject basic common rule lay thestability growth pact. these rules, although constraining, fact mean preserve acertain margin manoeuvre member states’ budgetary policies, timeavoiding undue pressure exert single monetary policy.as show example economic policymaking, i would argue make euro successdoes necessarily call creation unite state europe sort “europeansuperstate”. in fact, economic governance euro area - although certainly scope forimprovements term efficiency, effectiveness well legitimacy - could see exhibitingessential feature multi-levelled european polity. such political edifice would base arespect subsidiarity principle clear assignment policy responsibility objectives.at end day, i like make clear more, task shape futureconstitutional evolution european union, determine “finalité

particularly begin 2002 onwards, euro willbe pocket 300 million european citizens, common currency set become asymbol share identity bring reality europe everyday lives.conclusionladies gentlemen, i

bank ofthailand’s international economic conference “practical experience inflation targeting”, hold inbangkok 20 october 2000.* * *while number develop country adopt inflation target early part 1990s, therewas commonly hold view would easy apply approach monetary policy inemerging countries. for instance, paul masson et al. (1997) set prerequisite buildingblocks monetary framework, identify main one being:• ability carry substantially independent monetary policy, especially one notconstrained fiscal considerations; and• freedom commitment another nominal anchor exchange rate wages.they conclude “these fairly stringent technical institutional requirement cannot meet bymany develop country seigniorage remain important source finance and/or becausethere consensus attainment low inflation override objective monetarypolicy. we thus conclude way improve monetary inflation performance ofdeveloping country may adoption framework akin inflation targeting, atleast near term”.in short period since then, lot attention interest inflation target inemerging-market countries. what cause change view? one answer literature hadbeen overly influence poor inflationary record latin america 1980s, betterrecord latin america 1990s become clearer, commentator analysis come recognisethe benefit inflation target framework.perhaps importantly still (and relevant paper emphasis externalsector capital flows), decision exchange rate regime put inflation target inthe forefront. to extent number latin american country choose fix exchangerate nominal anchor monetary policy, hope drive rate inflationand keep low commitment fix exchange rate, place inflation targetingin strategy: clearly alternative strategy inflation targeting. but time, thefashionable paradigm exchange rate regime shifted, several reasons. first, number ofcountries find use exchange rate nominal target present serious problem thephase inflation reduction. even though strategy might quite effective gettinginflation down, inflation come slowly greatly erode international competitiveness.there was, also, “exit” problem. secondly, much attention find exchangerate regime would help difficult task adapt world large sometimesvolatile capital flows. while country respond “hardening” fix exchange ratepolicies (even extent adopt currency board dollarisation), number countrieshave move opposite end exchange regime spectrum, variation float rates.thirdly, course, crisis several fix rate country (mexico brazil), theyadopted flexible exchange rate result.it widespread adoption exchange rate regime float end spectrum -which i would like call “flexible” rather “floating” (more later) - bring inflationtargeting centre-stage. once fix exchange rate abandon nominal anchor monetarypolicy, question put place.going back several decades, answer might adopt form monetary target. butwe come recognise (some u painfully) uncertain relationship bi review 106/20002the monetary aggregate final objective macro policy (inflation output). if arelationship, enough stability predictability make effective basis formonetary policy.so

(both economically politically) task run good monetary policy which,in end, judge largely term inflation performance.what inflation targeting?rick mishkin (2000, p 1) put heart inflation target way: “inflation target amonetary policy strategy encompass five main elements: (1) public announcement ofmedium-term numerical target inflation; (2) institutional commitment price stability theprimary goal monetary policy, goal subordinated; (3) information inclusivestrategy many variables, monetary aggregate exchange rate, use fordeciding set policy instruments; (4) increase transparency monetary policy strategythrough communication public market plans, objectives, decision ofthe monetary authorities; (5) increase accountability central bank attain inflationobjectives. the list clarify one crucial point inflation targeting: entail much thana public announcement numerical target inflation year ahead”. note, particular,point 3.it important keep mind inflation target alternative (not complement) anexchange rate target. mishkin savastano (2000), examine chilean experience, note thatchile embrace inflation target exchange rate target (a move band), wasalways prepare make exchange rate target subservient inflation target extent thatthere conflict. so first strong point want make country need settle ontheir exchange rate regime decide adopt inflation targeting, strongcommitment particular exchange rate target, difficult simultaneously pursuean inflation target. this mean exchange rate irrelevant inflation targetingregime - far it. in fact, i spend fair bite talk today try figure theexchange rate feature within inflation target. but basic start point partof subservient inflation target regime.1 so inflation target see part anoverall approach macro policy, encompass fiscal policy exchange rate regime.1mishkin savastano (2000, p 7) observe: “what important stress, however, perspective ofmonetary policy strategy monetary target inflation target imply require “benign neglect” theexchange rate intervention foreign exchange market (ie ‘clean’ float). what matter centralbank make clear public, action pronouncements, nominal exchange rate willalways move

simply term inflation target, clearly stillhas met. the issue is: “over time horizon”? know change interest rate 5bis review 106/2000have effect activity (after all, one principal channel monetary

temporary short-lived, might well want nothing - whatever upward pressure price beunwound due course, provide price expectation dislodge process, nogreat harm do temporary increase inflation.3 but hand, depreciation ispermanent, even pressure inflation via cost push channel one-shot boost, thedepreciation give ongoing stimulus activity need offset.we already getting, example, hint central issue - is, policymakers needmore information available mechanical interpretation (or rigid adherence to) simpleinflation target, distinguish case get right answer, willdiffer depend circumstances. most specification inflation target includesomething begins: “it depend …”. but uncertain world, right start point.it intuitively tempt suggest inflation target rejigged focus ondomestic price (either non-traded good or, deeply-embedded version, wages). the intuitionhere that, exchange rate depreciation indeed temporary long-lived, isgood policy ignore it, allow temporary rise inflation. while get right answer inthe case temporary reverse change exchange rate, seem get rightanswer exchange rate change long-lived structural. it true direct cost push effectof depreciation inflation may well once-off therefore pas system(hopefully without disturb price expectations). but depreciation leaf permanent boost toactivity remain unless inflation wipe effect nominal depreciation.4when world “it depend …”, need relate policy advice much morespecifically particular economy question. at reserve bank australia, donesome work ask question whether focus non-traded price face variety ofshocks would tend give good answers, short answer “no”. “non-traded inflation (and unitlabour cost growth) rule appear generate least much variability output aggregateinflation - aggregate inflation care - without significant reduction interest ratevariability” (ryan thompson 2000).these issue examine larry ball (2000). he attract idea “optimal rulesin open economy differ considerably optimal rule close economies. in open economies,stability best achieve target “long-run inflation” - measure inflation adjust removetransitory effect exchange rate movements”. but another way state intuitionwith section open - face temporary exchange rate shocks, authoritiesshould react face permanent structural change exchange rate, should.the trick knowing, exchange rate moves, whether temporary structural. in practice, itwould seem sensible assume least movement structural, least lastlong enough either damage price expectations, affect economic activity (too much expansion, inthe case depreciation). so i sure ball rule advance u much past intuition.3the damage do short-term exchange rate movement may change time, regime-dependent: “it alsoimportant central bank recognise that, case economic

bi review 106/20006but perhaps important point make - still need use intuition, common sense, inimplementing inflation targets.5ball also raise another controversial important issue try incorporate exchange rateinto inflation target rule. he make case authority use operatingrule (ie policy reaction function) monetary condition index, rather interest rate. it isinteresting academic come examine issue stage, anissue try practice least two country - canada new zealand - abandonedor de-emphasise use mci. in australia, urge u (by oecd). ball examinesthis issue great finesse subtlety, let try set issue intuitively. it true thatwhen exchange rate go down, expansionary economy nothing else hashappened, interest rate need higher. so right weight find betweeninterest rate exchange rate, might possible produce index reflects, somesense, stance monetary policy. in practice, however, thing remain same. inparticular, often good reason exchange rate move down, case ofaustralia particular, often commodity price move unfavourably. in worldof low commodity prices, need expansionary stance monetary policy, fall inthe exchange rate provide le automatically. it would appropriate good policyto offset raise interest rates. once again, i afraid, good policymaking start theproviso: “it depend …”.so far i talk sort problem face country like australia newzealand. my intuition country region face different problem use thecombination float exchange rate inflation target guide “constraineddiscretion” policymaking. the problem familiar one, face first half 1990s.that is, large increase capital inflows, put continue upward pressureon exchange rate. follow reason i outline far, proper response toallow exchange rate appreciate. to extent long-term structural change, theinflation target framework would allow appreciation reflect inflation, extentthat mean non-traded (domestic) price would rise fast target. on counts, iso.k. - proper relative price tradeables non-tradeables change (in order toencourage current account deficit counterpart financial capital inflows). but alegitimate question ask whether, set inflation target basis rate inflationis disruptive, accept central basic price (principally wages) risefaster - see footnote 4. there is, course, also substantial danger rise non-tradeable price fast target inflation rate trigger asset boom, particularly theclassic non-traded asset real estate property. there also issue that, compare situationbefore capital inflow appreciation exchange rate, interest rate fall: weknow extra capital inflow put pressure domestic asset prices, might well beasked whether appropriate time ease domestic interest rate - seem theimplication simple read inflation target regime.i hope i say enough case (which i believe relevant many beforelong), alert policy difficulty face environment. i hope i leftyou impression i know right answer case. i would return i5there may another, subtly different, reason focus domestic prices, separate point movement inexchange-rate-driven tradeable price may temporary. from point view smooth run domesticeconomy, notion domestic price (either non-traded good wages) may proper target forinflation. this depend extent economics, extent community’s “objective function”. it maybe possible argue economy work best wage (or domestic prices) grow particular constantrate, properly main

byaddressing role euro international currency.the title session, “the euro second one” “second none”, certainly appealing, althoughit might apt beauty contest cool-headed assessment role euro. it istrue that, past, economist advocate darwinian-style competition among privatelyissued currencies, result survival fittest.however, development far confirm use currencies, domestically andinternationally, remain closely associate state sovereignty. this hold true euro,which describe “a currency without state”. i shall return aspect late inmy presentation. give link sovereignty, use currency much influence bypublic policies, even current market-friendly environment create increase globalisation. itis true public policy subject constant scrutiny financial markets, introducesan element competition among policies. i personally see market discipline soundincentive pursue right policies. a such, one could consider international use euro asone yardstick among others measure appropriateness credibility publicpolicies conduct euro area.i like concentrate policy aspect first part presentation. then, althoughstatistical evidence remain scarce early stage euro’s development, i like reviewbriefly international use euro private official sectors.does international role euro matter?the first question i like address concern ecb’s policy stance regard theinternational use euro. this legitimate question, especially country tend topromote internationalisation currency past. such promotion policy motivatedby several factors, include increase income seigniorage, easy finance balance ofpayments deficit enhance opportunity development domestic financial markets.nevertheless, potential advantage overrated. the additional seigniorage revenuegenerated international use currency remain limited. for widely usedinternational currency, u dollar, seigniorage originate use dollar bynon-residents estimate around 1% gdp. a balance payment financing, theinternational use currency may alleviate external constraint time, cannot free aneconomy market discipline. finally, development domestic capital market seenas precondition much outcome international use currency.there also historical example country resist internationalisation currency,particularly view increase uncertainty conduct macroeconomic policy general andmonetary policy particular. for part, ecb adopt neutral stance. it consider theuse euro international currency remain outcome economic andfinancial development policy inside outside euro area. the ecb hold view itwould neither feasible desirable directly promote hind internationalisation theeuro. bi review 103/20002this interpret imply international dimension euro irrelevant tothe ecb. indeed, least one reason monitor international use euro, namely totake account potential spillover effect monetary policy. in particular, one imagine theinternationalisation euro may influence monetary policy transmission mechanisms.international development use euro enhance breadth, depth efficiency euroarea financial market lead reduction transmission lags. it also possible imagine thatmonetary aggregate may become difficult interpret part money stock heldoutside euro area.however, impact internationalisation euro monetary policy beoveremphasised. first, economic theory historical experience suggest international use ofa currency tend change gradually time. second, ecb’s monetary policy strategyis sufficiently robust take account accommodate potential implication internationalrole euro.apart monetary policy implications, international use euro may also provide ayardstick ass appropriateness credibility public policy conduct theeuro area. of course, euro part rely track record 11 legacy currencies. at thesame time, euro new currency use second large economic area world. this sizefactor, particularly far euro area capital market concerned, may influence cross-borderuses euro, resident non-residents. the internationalisation euro beaffected soundness credibility economic policy pursue euro area.this lead touch upon notion euro “a currency without state”, imentioned introduction. in respect, one recognise uniqueness overall policyframework euro area. it combine monetary policy conduct community level othermacroeconomic structural policy remain national competencies. i see uniquepolicy framework factor potentially hamper acceptance use eurodomestically internationally. such framework consistent current level institutionaland political integration community. even may arguably improved, already shownits effectiveness, base basic principles. i like recall three principlesthat relevance presentation today. first, clear assignment policy responsibilities, bothin term well-defined objective appropriate mean fulfil them, require grind ofefficacy, transparency accountability. with regard monetary policy, ensure theecb’s independence define implement euro area’s monetary policy relatedfunctions. second, need coordination fiscal structural policy areconducted national level. in respect, without prejudice sovereignty, memberstates increasingly take account euro area-wide perspective prepare nationalpolicies. third, coordination base best practice selection thoseelements national policy commonly regard efficient. this approach isbroadly similar one use design ecb’s monetary policy framework, draw trackrecord national central banks.evidence international use euro private sectorturning le policy-related factual considerations, i like recall briefly somedevelopments international role euro since introduction start 1999. i shallbegin private sector use shall turn public sector. at outset, let make twopreliminary points. the first overview partial, statistical information notavailable international us euro. the second flamboyant rhetoric use somequarters present euro competitor u dollar may generate false expectationsthat international role euro would develop dramatically date creation. asemphasised begin ecb, expectation unjustified. history teach usthat internationalisation currency gradual process.starting overview private uses, i would consider role euro finance andinvestment operation non-residents one interest aspects. moreover, direct 3bis review 103/2000relevance today’s audience, consist many prominent participant internationalfinancial markets.the complete data available finance side. statistic international debt securitiesshow net issuance non-residents denominate euro double 1998 1999. it wasparticularly strong comparison currencies. figure first half 2000 indicatecontinued strong activity euro-denominated security issuance, although moderatedecline peak reach 1999. this compare fairly low issuance japaneseyen-denominated paper. interestingly, euro-denominated debt security issuance variety oforigins, approximately 75% borrow originate non-euro area advance economiessuch unite states, unite kingdom, sweden japan. the remain 25% issuancestemmed emerge market economies. moreover, private public sector issuer wereactive.developments subdue bank sector, euro-denominated liability intotal cross-border liability witness moderate increase, share around 20%. here again,the euro come second u dollar, 50% outstanding cross-border bankliabilities denominated. the yen rank third share somewhat 10%.turning asset side, come use euro investment currency. unfortunately,statistical evidence generally limit here. an analysis conduct ecb indicate therewas growth use euro international investment currency course of1999. in bank sector, volume international asset denominate euro increase onlyslightly, roughly line development liability side.one might try examine link role euro international financial market andrecent trend euro area’s balance payments. of course, one-to-one correspondencebetween two concepts. nevertheless, one observe correlation, co-movement, theinternational role euro financial market euro area financial account. in particular, theeuro area capital outflow 1999 consistent indication euro use afinancing investment currency. likewise, small net capital outflow first half of2000 would also appear consistent balance use euro finance aninvestment currency. these find still preliminary, confirm relevance ofdevelopments reflect international use euro.let touch upon international private us euro. example role theeuro payment currency exchange good services, invoice currency ininternational trade, vehicle currency foreign exchange market quotation currency ininternational commodity markets. despite scarcity reliable statistical evidence, fewobservations made. first, u dollar continue play lead role areas. second,rapid change cannot expected, function international currency drive scaleand network effect therefore tend develop slowly time. third, euro aprominent role transaction directly involve euro area residents. for example, eurotends use invoice payment link trade flow euro area.rounding overview international use euro private sector, i alsomention foreign currency cash hold number central eastern european countries, inwhich deutsche mark take lion’s share. these cash hold convert euro thebanknotes coin introduce year’s time. the stability euro indeed make anattractive medium exchange store value general public country historyof unstable prices. nevertheless, confidence grow domestic monetary policy conduct inthese countries, specific international role euro develop further.evidence international use euro public sectornot private sector, also public sector may use euro international currency.this encompass use euro official reserve hold reference currency forexchange rate arrangements. statistic relate official reserve publish recent bi review 103/20004international monetary fund annual report, indicate share euro around 13%at end 1999. this comparable weight legacy currency one year earlier. thefact stability prevail consistent notion central bank tend conservativein manage reserve holdings.remaining sphere international official reserves, international monetary fund hasrecently decide new valuation method special draw right (sdrs), come intoforce 1 january 2001. the sdr basket traditionally comprise five currency individualcountries, include deutsche mark french franc. the weight currency thebasket determine basis trade financial data countries. in order reflect thenew economic area result introduction euro, sdr basket henceforth includethe euro, instead deutsche mark french franc. it weight base theimportance euro area single economic entity. similarly, euribor substitutedfor german french national interest rate determination sdr’s interest rate. thesemodifications underscore official international financial community gradually adjust tothe new reality euro.as last point, let deal use euro reference currency exchange rate regimesadopted third countries. today, 50 country manage exchange rate arrangement thatinclude reference euro. this involve variety regimes, range tight pegs(ie currency boards) manage float policies. geographically, country locate theeuropean african continents. this difference u dollar, also use fewcountries outside western hemisphere. the intensive trade financial link euro areaare main factor behind choice euro definition exchange rate policies. for somecountries, european union accession process provide additional impetus select exchangerate arrangement base euro. i highlight choice euro-based exchange ratearrangement unilateral decision, involve commitment part ecb.however, use euro reference currency may see sign confidence thestability-oriented macroeconomic policy euro area.conclusionssummarising almost two year experience euro, one might consider startedplaying international role line economic financial size euro area rathersmooth manner.as i highlight today, development international use euro are, course, onlygradual. nevertheless, look ahead, one expect international role euro developfurther. an establish track record eurosystem reference primary objective pricestability continue integration

governor bank england, annual leonardsainer lecture, 14 november 2000.* * *introductionit’s great pleasure ask give lecture, occasion honour leonard sainer.one first experience young investment banker city work mid-1970swith dick russell michael smith, young turk leonard sainer’s firm, financialreconstruction property company. we remain touch ever since. at time wereworking reconstruction property company, bank england keep fatherly eye onhow matter progressing, concern was, still is, systemic risk run fromthe property sector bank sector fund it. i say never occur me,with root firmly base private sector, i would one day part bank england.indeed one two friends, dick russell michael smith among them, occasionally expresssurprise i move commercial world investment bank central banking.they like ask question: “does investment banker know difference right andwrong?” to answer is: “of course does, provide he’s allow two guesses!”having arrive bank three year ago, i often ask i actually there. and theanswer i three main roles. first, i one nine member mpc; secondly, ihave responsibility bank’s work financial stability; thirdly, i day-to-dayresponsibility management bank. one way another, wear three hat involvesme new bank england - new sense 1997 changes,incorporated bank england 1998 act, fundamental bank’s activities. withoutproviding personalise “this i spend day” account occasionally read thenewspapers, perhaps i could say little roles.monetary policy committeebeing member monetary policy committee hugely reward experience.the process go quite well document elsewhere let brief mydescription. we require 1998 bank england act meet least monthly, although wehave right meet often wish. on friday monthly mpc meet meetwith economics market staff bank, know pre-mpc, go thelatest data; process take whole morning. do friday allow u day tocommission additional work need ahead mpc meet itself. this hold maincommittee room watchful eye augustus john’s portrait montagu norman (governor ofthe bank 1920 1944) start wednesday afternoon. this meet give toa discussion key issue raise data present pre-mpc; tacticalconsiderations. the follow day, thursday morning, meet brief resume theprevious day’s discussion governor, proceed go around table memberindicating factor consider relevant vote. the policy decision (ie interestrates up, constant) release market 12 noon thursday. the minute themeeting, include individual vote members, release two week later.much write mpc’s constitution operation, perhaps i might make fewobservations. in first place, whilst good deal talk bank england’sindependence, important put context. the objective monetary policy deliberation bi review 102/20002- inflation target - set annually chancellor, committee, specify fairlyprecisely. thus decision policy objective rest elect government, execution inthe form technical decision-making rest mpc; sense tend talk aboutour system one “operational independence”.secondly, well known, chancellor set inflation target objective 2.5% thefirst three year operation. such explicit target aid accountablility; play important rolein anchor private sector expectations. our remit aim target times. we arerequired regard deviation target light target thus asymmetrical one. we oblige write open letter chancellor deviate 1% eitherabove below. the importance symmetry target well understood, theworking committee hugely important. a central bankers, would obviously like do“the prudent thing”. and 2.5% target set ceiling, would clearer, timesof doubt, decision finely balanced, right action take interest rateswould be. but since target set 2.5% symmetrical basis, concept “prudence” cannotbe apply way. the result worry much target doabout it. and i believe make good economic sense: problem severe deflationare least great severe inflation.the particular index measure inflation chancellor choose rpix, headlinerpi number exclude - x bite - mortgage interest payments. some believe weshould move harmonise index consumer price (hicp), widely use europe and,accordingly, make comparison euroland inflation easier. hicp inflation country hasbeen run consistently rpix 1%. this reflect difference construction theindex, particular treatment depreciation property costs. some argue - recentlythe engineer employers’ federation - move hicp, interest rate couldimmediately lowered. but follow. if move different calculation inflation, itwould seem natural revise target time. a 2.5% target hicp would mean weare target high level inflation present. in event, view that, weseek disseminate benefit low stable inflation wide audience possible,consistency exist index level advantage.critics process often argue mpc second target; commonlyindustrialists argue exchange rate target, seek stability sterling ourmajor trade partners. i well understand difficulty that, particular, exporter face give thevolatile movement exchange rates; frustration compound difficulty inexplaining movement purely term economic fundamentals. nevertheless berecognised recent historical experience uk operate monetary policy gear toexchange rate stability conflict sooner late emerge exchange rateobjective policy considerations, exchange rate objective abandoned. themost recent experience membership exchange rate mechanism 1990 and1992. fundamentally, problem operate monetary policy achieve two target -which one primacy? how would trade-off made? my view remain single inflationtarget objective better, well much clearer, framework monetary policy.my next point relate transparency process. in almost committee i serve inthe past, process one try achieve consensus way forward. the mpcprocess, however, involve pressure reach agreement. we accountable views;full minute take published; individual vote publicly recorded. this counter-intuitivefor anyone plc background. it impossible believe split board majorcorporation, certainly split air press, could exist length time. either thesplit would need heal rapidly, likely high-profile departure board wouldensue.but mpc system permit different view surface publicly refresh andappropriate. since economic analysis involve great deal peer future, notsurprising disagreement. there is, course, old joke put nine 3bis review 102/2000economists one room get ten views. but good open disagreementsthan try forge false sense consensus. of course, alongside transparency open votingsystem go degree personalisation within press. an industry grow gear guessingour personal habits, psychoanalyse personality classify u different specie theaviary. and alongside go demand even great transparency fall littleshort tv camera committee room. all resemble time economicsversion big brother; indeed i expect view economics community ask next right,through telephone poll, vote member committee!occasionally difference view surface committee arise different view aboutthe work economic relationship; occasion represent difference tacticalviews. there one interest rate path would give inflation profile consistent withthe target. and difference might moment prefer wait andsee - recognise might require sharp movement interest rate late - whomight prefer pre-emptive activist approach set rates, might term macbethschool economics: “if do ‘tis done, ‘t’were well do quickly”. thefact different path achieve 2.5% target one reason automaticlink inflation forecast, publish quarterly basis, month’s interestrate decision.i mention set interest rate require one peer future. unfortunately ismore difficult that. it also require policy maker view happeningcurrently. there often considerable uncertainty current situation - particularproblem relate q3 try ass impact petrol price crisis september. even thepast uncertain

inflation target. some central bank explicit inflation target give anexplanation government authority inflation target met. ourmandate, however, refer exchange rate target oppose inflation target. if situationarises norge bank able return krone initial range, define themandate, without trigger inflation deflationary recession, bank inform authoritiesthat measure available central bank required. one possibility could beto recommend fiscal measure make possible bring krone exchange rate back initialrange stabilise it.some observer argue possibility situation arise create uncertaintythat may weaken credibility norwegian monetary policy. however, norge bank declaredthat cannot open eye contribute high inflation deflationary recession. financialmarket indicator show evidence monetary policy

weakdomestic economy world economy, fall commodity prices. it also usually occurredagainst background widespread public criticism fiscal monetary policyfor expansionary. none element present occasion. bi review 101/20002the comment i make far treat year single development, i think ispossible distinguish two phases. for first seven month so, big influence theexchange rate expectation go happen australian u interest rates.the predominant view strong u economy would mean u interest rate would risemore country (including australia), contribute strong u dollar andfalling australian dollar. any suggestion australian economy weaken (or useconomy strengthening) lead fall australian dollar. in first seven month year,virtually large movement australian dollar could explain way. for example,on two occasions, weak monthly retail trade figure cause australian dollar fall thanone u cent day. our forthcoming statement monetary policy (due next monday) examinesthis detail.the irony situation process actually involve misinterpretation australianeconomy. the sign weakness seize upon anomalies; underlie economyremained strong, incipient inflationary pressure start appear, periodour interest rate raised, turn out, le amount unitedstates. nevertheless, misinterpretation prevail currency fell. over six month fromlate january, australian dollar fell 11% u dollar 8% trade-weighted terms.the second phase occur around mid-year, become widely expect market thatthe u economy go soft landing, increase u interest rateswere likely. a result, market’s expectation future interest differential move directionfavourable australia. have foreign exchange market continue behave first halfof year, australian dollar would risen, not. it steady while, fellappreciably mid-august. it period convince lot people new factormust work, overwhelm normal determinant exchange rate. it alsoin period alternative explanation put forward volubly.the influencesbefore get new explanation currency’s movements, worth lookingat conventional explanations.the first strength u dollar itself, big reason behind ourrecent experience. this affect u mechanical sense u dollar rising, thecurrency side bilateral exchange rate must fall. we part this, isshown fact australian dollar fall u dollar trade-weighted terms. there also indirect effect rise u dollar affect theinvestment preference many market participant extrapolative way i discus later.the u dollar 2000 rise currency industrial countries, although riseagainst yen relatively small. these two currency - u dollar yen - havebeen strong currency 2000, happen large trade partner havethe large weight trade-weighted index.interestingly, new explanation currency movement largely base assumption thatcountries strong currency characteristic similar unite state (see later). butjapan almost opposite unite state - weak economy, barely positive interest rates,massive fiscal deficit, trade surplus economic culture base conventional manufacturing. ido wish dwell differences, note show danger come upwith general explanation exchange rate movement turn applicable onecountry one period time.the second explanation rely well-known tendency exchange rate drive bymomentum. that - trend established, example, event first half 3bis review 101/2000the year - tend continue thereby overshoot level imply fundamentals. there havebeen many document example this,1 market participant often place weight factorwhen explain movement exchange rates. i doubt important factorover recent months, several early occasion past. a relate market rule ofthumb appear year, entirely absent last year, one relatesmovements australian dollar movement euro. the good thing trend andrules thumb continue indefinitely, exchange rate depart fromfundamentals, likely unforeseen event come along jolt rate anew direction.the third conventional explanation give prominence australia’s external position - currentaccount deficit accumulation foreign debt liabilities. this explanation emergeswhenever australian dollar falling, go hibernation whenever rising. theproblem explanation external position relatively stable pastdecade more, difficult use explanation event occur asrecently year. over past decade, current account deficit cycle around average ofabout 4½% gdp, foreign debt stay little 40% gdp. it true totalexternal liability gdp risen, this, ratio debt service export halvedover past decade, current account deficit decline period thefalling australian dollar. i think difficult make case external position hasrecently deteriorated, explanation fall australian dollar 2000.while i generally sceptical year’s event explain sudden focus trend inthe current account position, may promise think development theperspective capital flows.if, one reason another, investor find australia relatively le attractive destination theirfunds, compare destination - eg unite state - would expect willhave implication exchange rate. some want assert occur peoplesuddenly focus australia’s current account, seem unsatisfactory recipient ofthe flow - unite state - see current account deficit expand unprecedented size. infact, share gdp, australia’s current account deficit well way small itsus counterpart, yet u dollar rising, australian dollar falling. so make senseof happening, necessary think term capital flow drive changesin perceive return different countries. in remainder talk, i would like examinethis apparent shift capital flows, think whether temporary permanent.attitudes international investorsthere two reason put forward overseas investor may small appetite forinvesting australian asset - first apply debt second equity.on australian debt, whether short long end whether private public, current interest ratesare low formerly case. for good part past two decades, australian interestrates well u rates, struggle get australian inflation back respectably lowrate. even inflation fell, number year pass fall finally reflect ininflationary expectation interest rates. a result, past three year thataustralian interest rate lose significant premium u rate (diagram 2).1 for example, u dollar 1989, japanese yen 1995, strengthen direction, 1998 aweakening direction. bi review 101/20004diagram 2lllllll246810246810ten year bond yieldsaustralia%%us19981997199419961995199920001993the argument essentially say that, since australian interest bear security long contain apremium, investors’ appetite declined, demand australian dollar buythem fallen. on surface, sound plausible, ask rate fallen. surelythey fell australian debt become attractive investors. whereas 1994 rate of300 basis point u rate require get investor hold bonds, sowillingly rate slightly u rates.clearly, simple form argument logical gaps. however, seem besomething work -

thedifferences two type economy - “old” apply australia “new” apply tothe unite state - greatly exaggerate similarity ignored. this importantbecause fundamental economic substance view, last - see aphase capital market passed. i would like spend remainder time tonightexplaining i believe so.the thing stand economic performance australia unite state thepast decade past year contrast, remarkable similarity. for investor, themost likely place make money strong growth rapid increase productivity.the unite state justly proud performance two areas, one comparable2 net equity flow australia 1999/2000 (only data first three quarter available) appear lessthan two precede years. 5bis review 101/2000country oecd area match -

monetarypolicy continue conduct accord medium-term principle contain ourinflation-targeting approach. this mean exchange rate take account, along withthe variable contribute inflation outlook (where appropriately define toexclude once-off factor petroleum price gst). on hand, seenfrom current behaviour, intention depart medium-term approach anad hoc attempt push exchange rate sake.the period

19 december 2000.* * *ladies gentlemen, distinguish guests. may i first say honour invite say afew word even europe’s new single currency, euro. i admit onewould normally think currency particularly likely interest subject dinnerspeech.for euro, however, i think i correct say case. indeed, euro acurrency quite unlike other. it national currency. instead supra-national currencycreated monetary union 11, soon 12, sovereign member state create second largestmonetary area world. it also new currency, still le two year old. it yetcirculate form banknote coins. not surprisingly, therefore, euro indeed attract agreat deal public attention.it notable, however, different observer seem perceive euro different ways. somefocus attention almost exclusively exchange rate, overlook fact ecb’sprincipal aim maintain price stability fix exchange rate. others seem consider theeuro purely term political economic experiment. they fail notice already fullyfunctioning single currency.this serf convince that, even two year introduction, still need theeuro explain public large. and, perhaps outside europe whereunderstanding european integration policy-making is, surprisingly, limited.therefore, i much welcome opportunity say quite general word whatthe euro is, works, means, euro area world large.* * *let first say one never try understand europe’s new currency isolation acurrency merely introduce 1 january 1999. in fact, euro one, albeit animportant, part process create economic well monetary union europe. thisprocess begin already decade ago. similarly, "economic monetary union" part amuch broad process european economic political integration. therefore, order truly tounderstand euro one fact consider first context european integrationprocess begin already five decade ago.from beginning, purpose process bring country europe theireconomies close together and, doing, create area peace, prosperity stability. i supposethese motivation mean dissimilar lie behind various regional linkswhich since form part world, include asia.the european experience work towards goal one gradual progress, even thoughwith numerous up downs. nonetheless, main objective remain ever intact. a economicintegration progress further, overcome ever subtle barrier trade, itbecame increasingly apparent one substantial barrier creation truly pan-europeaneconomy remained. i refer course persistence exchange rate fluctuation resultedfrom existence separate national currency govern independent monetary policies.in short, european policy-makers face fact that, extend period time, youcannot simultaneously maintain free trade, unrestricted capital movements, fix exchange rate andindependent monetary policies. a choice make ultimately time arrive bi review 115/20002european country deem advantageous firm european "single market" tomaintain national currencies.* * *i add that, beyond fundamental motivation, important developmentswhich probably influence decision adopt common currency. the end cold war set newpolitical parameter integration western europe. regional integration creation alarge economic area also come see even necessary order prosper anincreasingly globalise world economy.from point view central banker, evolve consensus appropriate role ofmonetary policy central bank particularly important lay foundation viablesingle currency. moreover, increase

autonomous monetary policies. by contrast, good deal could gain removingexchange rate fluctuation establish independent european central bank clearobjective maintain price stability.* * *but evolve consensus i refer apply field monetary policy. norwould correct say consensus objective monetary policy sufficient thecreation successful monetary union. the euro become reality also depend consensuswhich evolve need sound economic policy generally. this make possible allof country adopt euro develop agree overall economicframework need complement support monetary union.like process european integration itself, framework coordinate economic policy hasdeveloped gradually considerable period time. the result flexible framework inwhich national policy appropriately coordinate rather centralised. and indeed quiteappropriate. in monetary union even necessary economic policy takenational difference account.on hand, see need ensure national policy take account sharedresponsibility participation single currency. this why, area fiscal policy, co-ordination take quite strong form national policy subject bind rules. in thiscontext, government commit call pact stability growthin order reduce government deficit close balance even create surplus budgets.and indeed past years, government finance position europe improve remarkably. inother policy areas, however, country euro area continue coordinate policy inmore subtle ways. they exchange idea information; agree general guideline andrecommendations; regularly monitor share assessment other’s policies. in thisway, economic co-ordination, various forms, promote and, necessary, ensure thatnational policy appropriate consistent participation single currency. in strictlylegal term euro may "currency without state". in practice, like currency, isembedded well-developed comprehensive economic policy framework.of course, one area policy completely centralise monetary policy. thecountries adopt euro share common currency, single exchange rate asingle monetary policy. the responsibility conduct policy give theecb/eurosystem, clear mandate maintain price stability. like federal reserve system inthe unite states, europe’s central bank organise federal system. in centre ecb,based frankfurt main, germany. the national central bank (ncbs) country haveadopted euro also part call eurosystem. monetary policy

area whole. the eurosystem independententity. this enshrine treaty establish european community, ratifiedby 15 member state european union.and let say i quite proud achievement far. the ecb’s monetary policy andits strategy work well, spite initial uncertainty associate changeover thesingle currency. price stability maintained, even recent price increase temporarilyexceeded target, mainly result almost triple oil prices. moreover, market seemto confidence ecb policies, show level long-term interest rates. inthe euro area, remain persistently u levels.* * *but let move on, since euro also implication extend well beyond euro area ishould also briefly touch upon. a i mention earlier, euro currency world’s secondlargest monetary area. the euro/dollar foreign exchange market large world around40% international debt security issue past two year euro. the euro isalready international currency, second u dollar, business investor aroundthe world need take account.in regard, however, let say speculation international role theeuro, especially suggestion make euro would soon rival dollar, notbeen particularly helpful. i prefer refrain make predictions. rather, i believe theattractiveness currency depend crucially underlie policy economic growth thecountry, countries, concerned.what i say confidence, euro play continue play role offeringnew good investment opportunities, include investor base outside euro area. in thisregard, euro already act catalyst development fully integrate europeancapital market. this market efficient liquid segmented, nationalmarkets precede it. ultimately, however, i repeat, extent translate intoactual inward investment depend market’s perception economic policy growthpotential euro area.and bring another important role euro, namely, act catalyst economicreform. among things, adoption single currency mean euro area government nolonger national currency devalue time need protect inefficientindustries. instead, way find maintain competitiveness, within euro areaand internationally. i believe coincidence policy-makers across europe focusingmore ever overcome economic rigidity which, recent years, tendedto hold europe back term economic growth. indeed, i would even surprise if,looking back year now, catalyst reform euro deem havehad profound effect.i also add lot progress already made. in addition low inflation, economicgrowth euro area high decade unemployment cleardownward trend. budget consolidate structural reform way. if thisdevelopment continues, i confident euro promise future.*

differences: figure mean tosuggest modest slow past growth rates. i would note number gdpgrowth involve substantial slowdown final domestic demand – 6 per cent growth toabout 3 per cent – mostly offset swing net export positive territory andthe assumption inventory rundown record past year occur again.on inflation, story little complicated. last time met, i say i expect cpi riseby 3 per cent year june 2000 – actual outcome 3.2 per cent. not big difference,but first time quite outcome high forecast. the reason wasthe higher-than-expected oil prices. when look ahead, make sure forecast goesbeyond june 2001 order avoid “once-off” lift price level attributable gst. at thelast hearing, i suggest inflation could upper half 2 3 per cent range weare well 2001/2002. our statement monetary

ones, may signify nothing statistical anomaliesreferred above. if rely statistic form view outlook, run risk ofregularly swing optimism pessimism back again, depend relatively short-termvariation data.obviously, approach need augment exclusive reliance statistical observation sohelp identify underlie direction economy. there many advocate approachessuch sophisticate econometric modelling, extensive industry liaison, examination leadingand lag indicator forecast embody financial prices. all merit andcan provide broad perspective. but two approach i would like remind youof.the first go back examine previous expansion ask imbalance thatbrought demise, see whether imbalance exist present. i earlierthis year speech melbourne,1 i identify number domestic imbalance previouscycles: high inflation, wage surge, overvalue asset prices, excessive physical investment andexcessive credit growth. not present towards end early expansions, butusually two were.in look australian economy present, hard see evidence imbalances.• underlie inflation 2¼ per cent, rise 3 per cent forecast horizon.• wage grow somewhere 3 4 per cent.• the share market rise year, seem overvalue compare manyoverseas markets. house price rise recent years, appear stabilise atpresent; rise commercial property price quite restrained.• there evidence over-investment over-capacity plant equipment orconstruction.• credit household still grow strongly, appear moderating. credit growth tobusinesses unduly strong stage recent years.overall, i think hard find sign type imbalance occur early 1970s, late1970s/early 1980s late 1980s lead unhappy results. many people would add thecurrent account balance payment list, point late stage previousexpansions, fast economic growth lead widen current account deficit. again, aredifferent time buoyant domestic demand growth experience past yearhas accompany decline current account deficit.of course, i list domestic factor give rise imbalance imperil expansion.as i say early introduction, world economy play equally important role, haveno control, even influence, that. it possible construct disaster scenario worldeconomy, doubt will, i comfortable stick majority assume amodest slowdown world growth or, current parlance, soft landing.no two economic expansion same; previous one differed, present one hasits unique features. a result, cannot rely cyclical comparison i justpresented, helpful part overall assessment. a second approach, i think auseful reality check, look present set policy affect economy.1“managing expansion”, address economic

expansionary influence theeconomy.on fiscal policy, need compensate consumer imposition gst ensuredthat move expansionary direction last financial year present one. again, ithink agree that, even though budgetary position remain surplus medium-term purposes, current stance fiscal policy impose contractionary influence theeconomy.overall, therefore, i conclude economy develop imbalance past,it necessary attempt remedy sort counter measure fiscal andmonetary area often need past. this another way say have, myopinion, avoid boom-bust cycle economic policy, hence excellent outlook thecoming

isa particularly appropriate place discus effect technological change economy andsome implication monetary policy. a always, view i express ownand necessarily share member board governor federal openmarket committee.let start brief review extraordinary performance u.s. economy pastfive years. since 1995, real gross domestic product grown, average, 4-1/2 percentper year. this pace significantly previous five years, go back tothe 1960s find even closely comparable period consistently robust economic expansion. in thisenvironment, unemployment rate fall 4 percent, underlie rate price inflationhas slowed, net, despite high rate resource utilization. even optimistic offorecasters could anticipate favorable confluence economic events.productivity growth cost reductionsso, happened? a policymaker, i’d like think well-executed monetary fiscalpolicies--each focus importantly respective long-run goal achieve price stability andreining deficit spending--played role create economic condition fosterednon-inflationary economic growth. our economy also benefit past action thegovernment deregulate industries. the removal unnecessary government regulation start morethan twenty year ago administration president ford gather momentum thecarter years. it alter business landscape allowing, indeed forcing, business focusmore clearly competitive marketplace few constraint increase flexibility.but dominant force late appear significant increase rate productivitygrowth: output per hour nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure productivity--hasincreased annual rate almost 3 percent since 1995, well pace early decade.cyclical force inability business add payroll rapidly would haveliked response rise demand probably play role efficiency gains. but isuspect longer-term, structural changes, reflect boom capital spend revolutionin information technology, probably important. let turn evidence thispoint.technology change productivity growthbob solow--the mit economist nobel prize economics work theory ofeconomic growth--once quip see computer everywhere except productivitystatistics. a year ago situation begin change, strong evidence thefaster productivity growth economy experience fact due partly new technologies.research economist steve oliner dan sichel federal reserve board staff shed somelight source fast productivity growth. about 1/2 percentage point increase inproductivity growth 1995-99 period attribute so-called "capital deepening," mostof reflect great spend business computers, software, communicationsequipment. the high (and rising) level business investment raise amount capital per worker bi review 113/20002and thereby boost productivity. another 1/2 percentage point pickup productivity growthreflected technological innovation actual production computer hardware semiconductorsas well good management--perhaps assist high-tech investments--of nation’s capitaland labor resources. oliner sichel estimate consolidate influence high-techinvestments account two-thirds acceleration productivity since 1995. this researchsupports view fundamental change underway economy.what’s so special capital?while interest note trend productivity pick high-tech investment arethe source acceleration, new observations. perhaps stage moreuseful explore deeply positive "shock" ability economy produce good andservices. what special computer information technology havesuch impact economy?let highlight three special characteristic high-tech equipment. first, computer andcommunications equipment depreciate rapid pace. the current best estimate computersprobably depreciate 30 percent annually, although estimate might low, otherequipment probably depreciate rate le 15 percent annually. therefore, computer areretired, average, three years, useful life equipment seven years.firms must invest computer fast rate form capital maintain agiven level capital stock. the rapid replacement high-tech capital mean technologicalprogress become "embodied" capital stock fast rate case longer-livedassets.the second feature high-tech equipment set apart class capital thesensitivity demand fluctuation cost capital. economist debate decadesabout magnitude cost-of-capital effect traditional capital goods. a past consensus thatthere probably cost-of-capital effect small difficult identifyempirically. a somewhat different conclusion arise lately basic model ofinvestment apply spend computer alone. the late research show computer arequite sensitive movement cost capital, result 20 percent per annum declinein relative computer prices, cost type capital fell rapidly past decade. thiscombination high price elasticity rapidly decline price lead boom high-techinvestment.a third characteristic high-tech investment magnitude "external" "spillover" effect thatit generates. high-tech equipment generate benefit owner machine otheragents economy well. i think particular so-called network effects--that is,linking computer together make possible large productivity gain computer operate asstand-alone units. although difficult measure, network effect certainly stimulate thedemand high-tech equipment help speed dispersion new technologies.supporting structural changesthe technological change inspire investment computer enhance ability ofbusinesses reduce operate expenses. in many industries, investment informationtechnologies help firm cut back volume inventory hold precautionagainst glitch supply chain hedge unexpected increase aggregate demand.product development cost probably also reduce use good computerhardware software, new communication technology increase speed whichfirms share information--both internally customer suppliers.this intersection macroeconomics management. many business observer believethat new technology reduce cost transform input output butalso decrease "interaction costs," cost incur get different people company 3bis review 113/2000work together exchange good services. obviously, line "transformation" and"interaction" clear, consultant study topic believe interactioncosts account 55 percent labor costs, industries, financial services,estimated interaction cost high 70 percent labor costs. i cannot verify numbers,but general concept seem useful.largely result increase productivity recent past, experience remarkablestability unit labor costs. during past five half years, unit labor cost nonfinancialcorporations, accurately measured, increase average 0.2 percent annualrate. this compare quite favorably experience precede ten year 2.2 percentannual rate increase. if fact "interactions" account 55 percent labor costs, relatively flattrend unit labor cost increase consistent concept new technology areallowing easier, le labor-intensive, interactions. importantly, give high rate depreciation andthe steep decline cost high-tech equipment, save unit labor cost beingundermined offset increase unit nonlabor costs.moreover, give intense competition resultant lack price "leverage," ongoing program toreduce cost become key part corporate strategy maintain improve profit margins. thefocus cost reduction work head development inflationary pressure thisexpansion.the future path productivity improvementsbut technological wave ebb flow, natural ask whether count rapidproductivity growth future. on score, i cautiously optimistic, i recognize thatforecasting technology extremely difficult occasional bump road. letme explain reason caution optimism.the risk productivity growth might moderate center high-tech sector, computer andcommunications equipment, associate relative price declines. historical pattern suggest thatsuch narrowly base productivity increase might continue, therefore caution order.however, two reason optimistic. first, recent burst productivity growth seem tobe product change technology transient business cycle influences, result,there le chance "payback period" particularly sluggish productivity growth. second,computer industry experts, include semiconductor industry, indicate theindustry exhaust potential produce fast cheap computers. similarly, businessleaders suggest still take advantage advance compute power low coststo find new productive us new technologies.the macroeconomic implication fast productivity growththeory teach u step-up growth rate technological change certainly importantimplications economic activity inflation. the main reason policymakers economist areinterested growth rate productivity help u understand economy’s potential tosupply good services. the effect economy’s ability produce good service areclear, theory predict new high level productivity growth would also affect demandfor good services. the immediate effect would capital investment, seen.a rapid pace technological change raise real rate return new investments--perhapssignificantly. put another way, rapid pace technological change make investment capitalgoods embody new technology profitable. when business recognize newtechnological possibilities, capital spend accelerate take advantage new profitopportunities.the employment income generate business spend capital good boost consumerspending set another round investment spending. typically refer economist as"multiplier-accelerator" effects, process would continue long real rate return bi review 113/20004new capital project exceed real cost capital project. through process, aninnovation supply side economy generate comparable increase aggregate demand.it important emphasize high productivity growth translate high real income growthfor employees. this add income see clearly high wage pay growingnumber worker whose cash compensation tie company performance. in addition, thoseworkers grant stock options, high profit today potential furtherincreases tomorrow translate high stock price company ultimately increase intheir overall compensation. but real income increase even worker whose compensation isnot directly link company performance, profitable business opportunity bolster demandfor scarce labor.theory also teach increase rate return capital--even generate rise thegrowth rate technical change--ultimately require increase real market interest rates. marketinterest rate must rise order maintain equilibrium high demand investmentfunds supply investment funds. and, indeed, see market interest rates,particularly corporate issuers, rise steadily last year so. interestingly, rate ofreturn form capital computer equipment, include structure non-computerequipment, either increase rise much rate return high-techcounterparts. it therefore possible that, period, investment flow reallocatedaway firm produce traditional capital good toward firm industry makehigh-tech good services.this somewhat abstract description effect step-up growth rate technical changebears strike resemblance development recent year labor markets, price good andservices, capital investments, fixed-income markets. but there’s still element missing: stockmarket. a high rate technical change raise productivity hence profitability ofcapital elevate value equities. since equity price reflect market expectation futurecash flow dividends, adjustment profit expectation lead reset ofequity prices. be stock today overvalued, correctly valued, undervalued? i certainly know,and i aware anyone does. a result, i believe would unwise--and indeedimpossible--for federal reserve target specific level valuation equity markets.however, equity market obviously spillover effect real economy and, thus, need beconsidered assess aggregate balance supply demand. give efficiency andforward-looking nature financial markets, even expect future technical innovation animmediate effect equity valuations. equity values, turn, influence consumer behavior. asyou know, economist often speak "wealth effect," econometric model indicate thatconsumers eventually tend raise level spend 2 5 cent everyincremental dollar wealth. a consequence, equity valuation noticeable effect onconsumption macroeconomic performance. to put rough number influences,simulations board staff use econometric model economy suggest wealthgenerated equity market last four year add 1 percentage point growthrate real gdp.of late, equity market give gains. however, economist study thetopic generally think impact change stock market generate wealth consumptionbegins build first year may take two three year fully felt.additionally, equity market source investment capital, valuation stock market areone determinant cost capital businesses. external finance conditions, include equityvaluations, important recent investment increasingly finance externalsources. external fund raise account 20 percent nominal capital expenditures--close high past two decades. 5bis review 113/2000monetary policy "new" economyas i say many time before, uncertainty productivity trend pose major challenge thedesign implementation monetary policy. a imagine, difficult infer truestructure economy interpretation twist turn incoming economic data.how know, example, unexpected development temporary movement

situation one “jobless growth”. totalemployment actually fell 1980s. since 1994, however, strong economic growth beenassociated employment increase around 4¾% per annum. in overall terms, employment

sixteenth seventeenth century especially late industrialisation begin inearnest, great need finance many various industry spring around thattime. commercial bank great finance house become common

three-month average m3 growth stand at5.4%, reference value 4½%. however, indicator suggest recent month amoderation monetary growth occurring.let turn, within second pillar, prospect economic growth euro area, asthese represent key factor affect outlook price stability medium term. the latestestimate eurostat second quarter 2000 indicate real increase gdp 0.8%. the paceof new job creation remain high unemployment rate currently stand 9.0%, level notseen since mid-1992. some monthly indicator suggest moderation real gdp growthmight occur second half year, mainly result negative impact therecent increase oil price domestic income. however, contrast previous period ofstrong oil price rises, euro area economy le dependent oil. this help preventany sustain negative effect confidence. there therefore good reason remain confident withregard growth prospects.on external side, euro area export growth benefit expansion globaleconomy. consider factor together, growth dynamic euro area

reduce thepotential positive supply effect fiscal reform economic growth.2.publication staff macroeconomic projection ecbi shall turn envisage publication staff macroeconomic projection ecb.i previously state remark european parliament ecb could commence thepublication macroeconomic projection course year. i happy informyou preparation concluded. a announce 16 november, governingcouncil decide commence publication staff macroeconomic projection decemberissue ecb monthly bulletin. this decision reflect govern council’s conviction - asreflected practice - information analysis underlie monetary policy decisionsshould share public great extent possible, subject, course, necessary 3bis review 109/2000preparation. provision information enhance transparency lead betterunderstanding single monetary policy.the ecb decide time come publish staff macroeconomic projections, arealready use input assessment outlook price stability. these prepare twicea year eurosystem staff one number input deliberation governingcouncil. the projection publish june december issue ecb monthlybulletin, commence december 2000. projection publish growth rate realgdp component hicp inflation. they two-year horizon, theprojections 2001 2002 publish december year. in order accuratelyreflect degree uncertainty attach exercises, projection publish theform ranges, base upon average absolute error make previous national central bank andeurosystem projections. the projection accompany text describe main features.i emphasise use word “projection” order signal publish projectionsare result scenario base set underlie technical assumptions, include theassumption unchanged monetary policy. this way forecast produce many centralbanks order best inform monetary policy decision-makers. a eurosystem’s staff economicprojections product technical exercise, assumes, inter alia, short-term interestrates exchange rate change forecast horizon, clear staffprojection not, general, best predictor future outcomes, particular somewhatlonger horizons. rather, represent scenario likely falsify practice, sincemonetary policy always act address threat price stability.on make announcement, crucial i explain role staff macroeconomicprojections play ecb’s monetary policy strategy.the ecb’s primary objective maintenance price stability euro area. give lag inthe transmission monetary policy price level, monetary policy must forward-looking.therefore, analysis undertake ecb focus risk future price stability.the analysis underlie monetary policy decision organise within two frameworks, werefer two pillars. the govern council’s forward-looking assessment economicsituation outlook price stability base prominent role money, denote asthe first pillar, broadly base assessment economic financial indicators, label thesecond pillar. the projection publish ecb december are, anyconventional macroeconomic forecast projection, derive analytical framework whichmoney play limit role, any. hence projections, mostly reflect development invariable money, naturally form part second pillar ecb’s strategy.the projection help underpin forward-looking orientation monetary policy. they summariseand synthesise large quantity information might otherwise unwieldy form sensiblebasis policy discussions. they also provide platform integration economic analysisunder second pillar coherent internally consistent way, seek reflect pastexperience fundamental economic relationships.twice year, monetary policy committee eurosystem undertakes, help aworking group forecasting, forecast exercise bring together staff ecband national central banks. the macroeconomic projection produce exercise combineanalysis base variety econometric model expert assessment make staff. theeurosystem’s staff projection therefore result mechanical application singleeconometric model. on contrary, combine variety different analyses, rely onthe staff’s technical expertise.although play useful important role, projection panacea. first, arealways base specific assumption - concern oil price exchange rate - withwhich possible disagree change rapidly, projection become outdated.second, final projection depend great extent underlie conceptual framework ortechniques employ production. third, nature, economic framework bi review 109/20004provide summary description economy thus incorporate relevant information. inparticular, information easily integrate framework use produce theprojections may change finalised. fourth, expert view inevitably incorporatedinto projection good reason moment decision-making deviate theparticular view approach based.the two-pillar approach choose eurosystem - include prominent role money firstpillar - is, extent, reflection general limitation forecast projections.i stress that, limitations, second pillar ecb’s strategy also includesother form analysis addition macroeconomic projections. first, ecb’s projection arecross-checked compare forecast produce others, international organisationsand private sector entities. second, forward-looking information expectation embody infinancial price yield thoroughly analyse evaluated. this information also becompared staff projections. finally, information contain staffprojections practical time reason - late available outturn certain data series -must also incorporate overall assessment. development individual indicator alsoclosely follow outside framework forecast exercise.it follow discussion govern council use staff projection themain tool organise communicate assessment. rather, govern council evaluatesthem alongside - compare - many piece information form analysisorganised two-pillar framework. in context ecb’s strategy, macroeconomic forecastsand projection therefore play important - albeit limit - role.two important point follow role projection ecb’s strategy proceduresused produce projection within eurosystem.first, projection produce staff expert embody policy judgement thegoverning council. they therefore represent one input policy-making process theoutcome govern council’s deliberations. the govern council must exercise policyjudgement evaluate projection receives, alongside analyses, drawingimplications policy decisions.second, since policy decision base broad range analysis conduct two pillarsof ecb’s monetary policy strategy - eurosystem’s projection constitute part -one expect policy decision respond mechanically development publishedmacroeconomic projections. in respect, projection publish ecb role differconsiderably forecast publish central banks.one question raise since announcement govern council notassume full responsibility projection publish ecb, whilst course acceptingfull responsibility staff produce them. let answer question recall thegoverning council’s ultimate responsibility, namely maintain price stability euro area.within framework treaty establish european community (ec treaty), governingcouncil shall hold accountable maintenance price stability accordance itspublished definition. the govern council neither responsible content projections,nor performance judge them. while macroeconomic projection usefulinstrument undertake forward-looking assessment monetary policy decision arebased, limitation i outline imply projection cannot tool use thegoverning council. the govern council assume responsibility staffmacroeconomic projection content analysis constitute input itspolicy decisions, monetary analysis first pillar evaluation developmentsin individual indicator variable financial price yields. assume responsibility one inputinto decision would detract govern council’s true responsibilities, first monetarypolicy decision ultimately maintenance price stability.given govern council’s override commitment maintenance price stability, onlyforecast could take responsibility would one consistent price stability. 5bis review 109/2000such forecast - which, nature, would change time - would not, itself, veryinformative govern council’s assessment prevail economic situation. thegoverning council’s guidepost future publish outset form itsquantitative definition ecb’s primary objective. this definition serf different purpose,namely anchor inflation expectations.against background, publish macroeconomic projection not, anycircumstances, see call question commitment govern council tomaintaining price stability medium term. the public, wage price-setters, firm andhouseholds continue rely ecb’s quantitative definition price stability “bestprediction” medium-term price developments, since govern council commit tochanging monetary policy whenever necessary maintain price stability.the publication staff macroeconomic projection thus inform public important inputinto govern council’s decision process, already use past. thepublication projection consider context ecb’s monetary policy strategy.publication thus change neither ecb’s monetary policy strategy role projectionswithin it.i convince publication staff projection help improve ecb’s presentationand explanation monetary policy decisions. however, case, public - theeuropean parliament committee - must recognise limitation forecast projectionsthat i described, implication limitation role staff projection inthe ecb’s strategy.3.cross-border retail payment service euro areayou may recall september 1999 ecb publish report present view theeurosystem improve cross-border retail payment service define objective thatthe industry expect achieve 1 january 2002. in september year, ecb publish aprogress report. this report conclude that, although objective yet fulfilled,substantial progress make prepare grind efficient handle ofcross-border retail payments. allow give examples:i. the bank sector agree straight-through process standards, allow theautomated execution cross-border payments;ii. the euro bank association develop payment system specifically design forcross-border low-value payments, commence operation 20 november 2000;iii. a 2002, cross-border payment eur 12,500 long need reportedfor balance payment purpose hence statistical report long constitute ajustification high customer fees.insufficient progress make field customer prices. in many cases, payee hasbeen charge cost even though payer agree bear costs. two initiativescurrently develop european credit sector association intend address thissituation. first, multilateral interbank exchange fee developed, which, provide feeis low, could acceptable could indeed contribute solve problem “double-charging”.second, importantly, “basic” service define which, payment order submittedin correct format, provide guarantee service level attractive condition term ofprice execution time. the eurosystem welcome idea basic service offer, progressreport go one step invite bank set “standard” cross-border payment service witha common name, provide bank euro area. such standard service wouldcontribute even great price transparency and, consequently, enhance competition.the progress report also recognise achievement objective depend banksbut also company customers, include adequate information invoice andpayment order facilitate straight-through processing. the eurosystem therefore urge bi review 109/20006banking industry launch information campaign expect specific proposal end of2000. the organisation information campaign would greatly facilitate standardservice common name existed.the eurosystem continue closely monitor progress make bank industry withregard outstanding issues, well development customer prices, order ensure thepreparations currently way ultimately translate adequate service european citizens.all options, include operational involvement eurosystem, retained, case thesituation improve significantly 2002. 1bis review 108/2000david carse: environmental issue implication financialinstitutions hong kongkeynote speech mr david carse, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority,at conference environmental risk management hong kong financial institutions, hold inhong kong 29 november 2000.* * *ladies gentlemen,i please deliver keynote speech conference environmental riskmanagement hong kong financial institutions.i congratulate various organiser put together conference, i understand firstof kind hold hong kong. if so, long overdue. environmental issue come verymuch forefront public awareness hong kong recent years, clean theenvironment become one government’s main preoccupations. there sort goodreasons wish this, term improve quality life long-term health andwell-being people hong kong. but also grow recognition part ofbusiness, elsewhere, economic growth inextricably link healthyenvironment. at year’s world economic forum davos, business leader vote global climatechange press issue face world’s business community. it disappointingtherefore last week’s un summit conference the hague climate change endedin failure.at first sight might appear bank financial institutions, service companies, lessresponsibility environmental protection companies, notably whose industrialprocesses direct impact environment. however, would ignore central rolein economy bank financial intermediaries. while may pollutersthemselves, probably bank relationship company polluter orcould future.this create number risk banks, raise question risk beidentified, measured, monitor controlled. this primarily matter banks’ management todeal with, i hope today’s conference help so. but also issue forbanking regulators, particularly increase focus risk-based supervision. in case thehkma, process whereby try ass extent bank expose varioustypes risk quality system use manage risks. for purpose, haveidentified eight different type risk: credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal,reputation strategic.environmental risk straddle number risks. in particular, subset credit, legal andreputation risk:• credit risk arise indirectly bank lend customer whose business areadversely affect cost clean pollution change environmentalregulations. for example, cost meet new requirement emission level may besufficient put company business. bank may also find directlyaffected find value property take collateral impairedby contamination.• legal risk take number different forms. most obviously, bank like othercompanies risk comply relevant environmentallegislation. but specifically, risk direct lender liability clean-up costsor claim damage actually take possession contaminate pollution- bi review 108/20002causing property result realise security. there also even worryingprospect jurisdiction mere act lend company project whichcauses environmental problem may lead lender incur liability clean-upcosts. bank may protest, justification, force roleof “environmental police”, may carry little weight courts.• reputation risk may arise even absence lender liability, particularly bank areseen associate large-scale project view socially environmentallydamaging, dam projects. the growth globalise protest movement use ofthe internet disseminate information greatly increase risk individualcompanies subject concert campaign public criticism.these risks, would also wrong ignore opportunity environmentalprotection provide bank financial institutions. most obviously, cost cleaningup pollution need invest environmentally friendly technology imply need finance,either bank capital markets. just take one small example hong kong context,the government’s initiative persuade diesel taxi owner switch lpg taxi create chancefor bank finance purchase new vehicles. bank also need bear mind whilethere loser drive cut pollution, also winner shape thosecompanies exploit new technology curb emissions.another by-product effort combat climate change growth emission tradingbetween companies. such trade allow company reduce carbon emission belowallotted target sell surplus credit company cannot reach targets.admittedly, immediate future emission trade doubt follow hagueconference, still potential become major commodity market. if so, willinevitably role financial institution broke deal buyer seller emissioncredits, perhaps take position themselves.finally, bank financial institution profit grow public awareness ofenvironmental issue offer “green” investment products.how bank hong kong measure term environmental issues? a internationalfinancial centre, hong kong provide base number multinational bank developeddetailed environmental policy procedures. in case local regional banks, i would saythat environmental issue le highly articulated. this i welcome conference theinvolvement hong kong association banks.it purpose speech anticipate detail advice subsequent speaker aregoing offer. but i would like offer general recommendation bank take intoaccount deal environmental issues.first, bank keep inform international regional initiative theenvironment, particularly directly concern financial institutions.in connection, i would draw attention institution already aware tothe work unite nation environment programme (“unep”). this main un institutionthat deal environmental questions. a part work, establish financial institutionsinitiative environment partnership unep lead bank andinsurance company promote sustainable development environmentally sound businesspractices. the basic role initiative promote integration environmental considerationsinto aspect financial sector’s operation services.one product initiative “statement financial institution environment andsustainable development” (which append speech). the statement include commitmentby financial institution contribute towards sustainable development, adopt precautionaryapproach environmental management foster public awareness communication theirenvironmental policies. over 160 institution sign statement, none i regret fromhong kong, except do virtue part international bank groups. iwould therefore urge bank hong kong consider become signatory statement, 3bis review 108/2000familiarise work initiative generally. you find variouscomponents work initiative, include annual roundtable meetings, provide much usefulpractical guidance financial institution tackle environmental issues.secondly, line unep statement refer above, bank consider producinga formal environmental policy statement make publicly available.such statement represent acknowledgement bank must take environmentalimplications account business operations, decision processes. this include itsown use energy resource interact customers. however, own, policyruns risk become “motherhood” statement. policy therefore back bymanagement structure systems, specific objectives, action plan monitor procedure toensure concrete result achieved. bank also issue regular environmental report thatinform outside world progress meet environmental objectives. this one areawhere public sector take lead hong kong. follow chief executive’s 1998policy address government bureau department (including hkma) require topublish annual report environmental policy actions.thirdly, bank appropriate build environmental risk assessment creditdecisions.this follow early comment environment credit risk. of course, detailedenvironmental risk assessment appropriate cases. at general, environmentalconsiderations simply part process “know customer” - words, awareof nature business industrial operations, alive possibility theremay environmental angle. in particular cases, however, detail assessment andquantification environmental risk required. this case, example, whereland take security borrower involve high-risk industry aschemicals. obviously, large bank’s exposure, important environmental riskassessment becomes. take extreme, bank involve finance large-scale project construction power plant, full environmental impact assessment shouldbe obtain professional independent expert.one point particularly relevant bank finance company project country likechina rule environmental game change quickly. the authority chinaare get serious cut emission pollution, requirement beijing municipalgovernment shougang steel group cut back output shown. the problem china isthat regulation always strictly enforced. but change overnight, result majorcompliance problem company concern increase risk bank lend tothem. hong kong bank lend china would therefore well advise keep mind.finally, bank pay close regard “corporate ecology”.banks contribute environmental protection way manage use ofresources operations. in way bank responsible corporate citizen thesame time reduce business costs. the type measure adopt include save energyconsumption, recycle paper, waste management, purchase environmentally friendly productsand use video conferencing cut unnecessary travel. use office automation asemail also help reduce consumption paper, provide course staff beencouraged print messages. the important aspect this, area ofenvironmental management, try set measurable objective green initiatives, assignmanagement responsibility monitor performance offer staff guidance train onhow achieve desire results. a note earlier, progress communicate theoutside world bank’s environmental report.i would like close express appreciation allow opportunity speak youtoday important topic. do research speech certainly help raise ownawareness importance environmental issue general implication forfinancial institution particular. i hope find conference useful bi review 108/20004informative, pick lesson advice environmental issue takeback build business operation decisions. the need keynoteof speech main theme conference. 5bis review 108/2000 bi review 108/20006 1bis review 108/2000m r chatu

supervise responsible people.it would nice true, bank industry leverage ratio 12:1 thetemptation rather great owner take advantage people’s money, people haveno right know go money even year notshareholders depositors. the temptation supervisor evade responsibility bynot take correct action also great, rich people powerful, bad political system along time help make brave.this philosophy must changed. we must go philosophy transparency offencesand important financial ratio number publicised, peer investor pressure could usedto reduce flow resource wrong-doers.back credit bureau, course, borrower important this. bank shouldn’t lend tobad borrowers, bank lend bad borrower bad banks. but bank lend badborrowers, don’t know are? there are, course, alternative remedies, bestinstrument industry-wide credit bureau keep track credit stand ofborrowers.this possible present law allow disclose clients’ information. thebank thailand require prospective borrower renewal must sign form declaringthat allow credit stand disclosed, feeble alternative. it timeconsuming argumentative, consequences. a credit bureau law quicklylegislated, where, price good society, bad debtor identified. bi review 108/20002as commercial banks, good governance put place. audit committee required.independent directors, vote upon major shareholders, encouraged. npl, relatedlending fine penalty impose must disclose bank end every month,and publish bot’s web.directors must devote time bank, cannot director three otherprofit-seeking companies, well disallow borrow cross ownership thanone percent pay capital borrower.of 92 people involved, 53 complied, arrangement make theothers comply, possible exception representative ministry finance whomay find representative sort people devote much time thebank part ownership operation bank, governmentrepresentatives. we look discus ministry time right.the problem fact innocuous look state bank remuneration affect byconsiderations director reward shareholders’ value bemaximised.but do sanction coercion, new commercial bank act theauthority explicit.my last word commercial banks, intervene bank might yet completely take care of,but least cost rescue well estimated. the proper finance debt burden isprobably one first job new government.temporary provisional finance good none, clear-cut schedule largedebt finance next ten twenty year must make investor tradingpartners confidence clear idea deal with, i think isessential.how central bank do also important. the bank thailand beingrevolutionised. the pay system change, promotion system change careerdevelopment instituted. risk management supervision institute first ofjanuary next year.simple thing letter transmittal supervision team manager bank berequired. this may seem trivial, put responsibility firmly supervisors, wasnever possible supervision mission go whenever felt like tellanybody except banks. it also make job control supervisor impossible verydangerous allow people criminal prosecution capability work manner.the important thing new central bank though probably keep really independent.thailand quite complicate place, large economy considerable sophistication. the roleof central bank help finance development direct among sector economywill soon long possible.if central bank could keep economy stable, would major achievement.but force country, especially political ones, direct towards high growth ratherthan sustainability stable growth, even end stability would probably lead good andhigher level economy roller coaster growth past.to that, central bank go rest economy government fromtime time evident past year two. if central bank independent, willbe difficult this.in mind, best model central bank one central bank become constitutionalbody parliament like election commission the national frequency management board.this doesn’t mean change constitution constitution differ fromordinary law mainly far supersede ordinary law procedure change 3bis review 108/2000provisions rather complicated. by ordinary legislation, could make central bank body ofparliament senate new central bank legislation usually do.this doesn’t mean either central bank operate monetary policy independent theeconomic social policy government. the two must make intertwine clearlegislation make procedure central bank appropriate interval agreemonetary target government allow implement work independently andunimpeded.but i guess there’s point talk much now. let’s wait see mandate peoplegive election. the obvious thing present senate seem quite qualifiedto take important role safeguard central bank.let continue new government look at, instance general guarantee ondeposit. this general guarantee cut across good bank practices. bank misbehave notbeing penalise try well drag capricious thegeneral guarantee government gives.the general guarantee get rid sooner rather late thailand get back aneven path. probably, order this, kind deposit insurance place andseen working.it look like long road new government, sequence implementation manydifficult concept still need full prosperity returns.let’s start road prosperity soon possible.ladies gentlemen, let turn general economy central bank commercial banksalone cannot make country good quickly.it quite obvious world grain price way down. between year 1800-1900 whenthe west open unite states, grain price fell 30% span century.with genetic engineering, something similar nature might happen next 20 50 years.we plan still agricultural-dominated population eventuality.it make sense base strategy expansion production fall market. it makesmuch sense base strategy cost reduction add value final agricultural products.a ton grain may worth 10,000 baht, ton biscuit worth 100,000 baht. but makebiscuits, need brand need flavours, thing take long time develop endowto economy.as agricultural finance, available moment crop finance. but can’t makethe weather order. the bad year kill you, mechanism must develop finance thedisaster bad year abundance good year rather leave pot luck tothe effort individual farmer present.again vein, resource must make available farmer good productionmethods change nature farm cost reduce farmer change tomore valuable product need big investment large gestation periods. no doubt indoing this, old debts, quite considerable pervasive, also look at.in industry, problem role smes obvious. there major industrial economywithout smes. i would say half smes npl. and lot owner abandonedtheir old company don’t need historic record quota, instance. they could assumesome identity live another life become smes difficult way, abig burden banks.a lot smes can’t need past performance records. effort prod smesinto viability obviously go need government assistance. the problem big forcommercial bank handle alone. bi review 108/20004the government make effort improve technology, market management ofthe smes. how well do depend ask i really field thesmes well enough know generality people thinking.but financing, quite obvious smes npl get money someguarantees, one must come government. this happen one areawhere, various reasons, least progress. the new government must take look thisimmediately bite bullet adopt might well necessarily fairly costly solution.another important strategic sector economy probably tourism thailand well-situatedin air route world.but people don’t want spend 50 week year half life, whichever case, thenspend time inhospitable location. we clean up, especially visual environment ofbangkok, major historical site ayuthaya, sri satchanalai chiengmai. put theelectric power line city underground, instance, would expensive investment,but worthwhile, new government must immediately begin adopt long-term solution likethese.the last area private sector i would like talk today stock exchange ofthailand.the stock exchange thailand lack sophistication. it begin allow short selling,which essential allow liquidity control manner. derivative rare, isanother area need development reduce various risk associate market, ofcourse, one well know rules, personally i think limit extent,not extent beneficiary mainly intermediary might case reallylarge, sophisticate market.as scale market, i visit msci important player world. itreally quite easy improve market performance. presently, thai market requirement aredesigned fit thai requirements. requirement often self-destructive unrealleading u bubble 1997.the market stock exchange much change bubble days. it’s still doingthe thing, without bubble. realistically, rule change willcomply take advantage rather penalise international norms.in government, board investment (boi) probably crucial instrument. it’s good jobgiving privilege individual project basis. that limitation faults. it might wellsoon time make operate thailand generally viable.the original boi philosophy, project wouldn’t get didn’t give taxprivileges therefore tax loss costs, become untenable. generally,systems work good economy get big big moresophisticated; exemption project basis, except rare cases, soon hold u back.the new government take last hurdle make general system acceptable, even ifminimally low tax make improvement civil service performance, probably bymaking civil service remunerate output productivity rather tenure system atpresent.that lead comment long term initiative government might carry wouldhelp long run, i think main strategy real recovery take place. without goodlong run prospects, isn’t much hope well present.the government move private sector footing. this doesn’t mean justselling state enterprise things. but mean government unit retainedwould work incentive term output cost reduction to, general,compete private sector government budget. 5bis review 108/2000generally, private sector necessarily efficient government. the key thatthose don’t survive good one expand. this doesn’t happen governmentbecause inefficient ask budget, forcibly collected.in view, large complicate government unit probably possible thailand unless weget fantastic new government sophisticate last long time, say, 10 or20 years, prospect, presently one plan on. in case, one designgovernment unit small independent units, independently managed, government thatcome execute mandate budget allocation legislative change necessary.interestingly, world long time, concept civil servant lotof authority profit-oriented. one make sure tenure wellcompensated pension leave, otherwise might try stock asset theirlater life.the philosophy go opposite direction everywhere now. civil servant powerful andimportant therefore tenure. for reason one must make sure civilservants perform give limit term contracts, performresponsibly efficiently get new contract.i incline towards latter one never make sure hire promote rightperson, therefore one plan easy change personnel get best results.let make controversial statement platform various political party term ofspending tax less. we routinely run general equilibrium model inflationtargeting model well market imply model mime, technical word use try tofind thing people’s normal action could capture data system.we also, course, single equation estimate well pure intuition graph table andsuch things.our staff generally opinion increase expenditure tax reduction moderate amountswill destabilise economy.this predominantly economy still docile capacity utilisation stable forquite 58%. cost push inflation exchange rate oil price nowsubstantially absorb pass on, cost push also presently much factor.the important thing though make expenditure useful constructive long runwithout much leakage. the important thing make tax cut reasonable directedtowards area people benefit cut could utilise spate new investment.if happen debt gdp ratio might increase significantly due resultingincrease gdp long term.with abundant liquidity low interest rates, time general tax cut ownsake, program must design direct investment could best made. ina way, easy seems, generally invest greatovercapacity.but it’s also hard might look. there area really well, andbenefits cut could direct there. the problem make fairly just, notonly good player already benefit, new player bring allimportant areas.ladies gentlemen, i give think economy. think thatare spotty veer obviously somewhat financial aspects.the new government must much comprehensive. but since party platform butonly comment make apparent effect might happen next monthsin hope that, things, elucidation transparency make stable market, let metherefore bother think stop point. bi review 108/20006let u hope good new government, new idea bring thailand future andtake thailand important next level development, comfortable life, morestable growth. 1bis review 107/2000lars heikensten: monetary policy swedenspeech mr lars heikensten, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, autumnconference centre business policy studies, hold stockholm 17 november 2000.* * *thank invitation talk monetary policy. if memory serf right, thefifth autumn conference i address deputy central bank governor. for me, annualopportunity discuss monetary policy country’s lead economist andeconomic observer become enjoyable tradition.i shall begin, usual, brief account past year, take 1999’s october assessment mystarting point. even though appraisal inflation time relatively optimistic, theoutcome good foresaw. development past year raise question theeconomy’s inflation propensity. that topic already discussion last year’s conference,though reason several lead observer consider risk inflation beingunderestimated riksbank. a third matter i shall talk monetary policyguidelines. in past year criticise base repo rate decision appraisal aretoo narrow. finally, i shall look ahead comment view inflation comingyears.inflation past twelve monthsin third inflation report last year riksbank’s growth forecast sweden come yearswas revise upwards. this mainly mirror favourable outlook international activity; alsoseemed likely domestic demand would strong expect earlier. our overallgrowth forecast agree observers. some predictions, however, include evenstronger increase household consumption, reason rise asset price general thestock market boom particular judge lead markedly increase consumption propensity.our high growth forecast accompany little change assessment inflation hadpresented early year. thus, judge relationship growth inflation wouldbe favourable previously calculated. in respect differ many otherobservers occasion good deal discussion.the background forecast inflation’s path surprisingly favourable that,instead result occasional factors, fundamental feature theeconomy would continue influence inflation two-year horizon.here picture inflation assessment last october outcome (chart 1). i choose topresent term und1x indicator inflation monetary policy hasbeen focus past year. the chart also show price import indicator underlyingdomestic inflation, undinhx. a see, believe inflation would move gradually thewake rise activity. this would counter low, even falling, import price connection witha strong exchange rate, low oil price generally strong global competition.even inflation forecast evidently high side, least date. it perhaps even morenoteworthy underlie domestic inflation turn appreciably lower. this issomething observer swedish economy cannot ignore, particularly past decade hasprovided many surprise sort, though dramatic. the main point consider is, ofcourse, permanent change likely be. to extent abandon earlierrelationships commit continuation relationship apply recentyears? bi review 107/20002why inflation low?the first thing note development confine sweden. inflation manyother country also unexpectedly low. there, too, reason entirely clear.some piece puzzle identify enough make clear picture. asdecision-makers, however, cannot simply shrug shoulder say don’t know. decisionshave make would reasonable go act though nothing change untilsufficiently long time series available econometric analyses.recently i pleasure chair central bank seminar bi arrange theseissues. my impression prove difficult produce definite evidence structuralshift relationship govern inflation, various version phillips curve. in manycountries, include sweden, appraisal resource utilisation, example, optimistic.as doubt aware, past five year output gap estimate fact revise anumber times. one explanation i find fairly plausible profound crisis early1990s simply misjudge size gap. there also support possibility thatproductivity follow favourable trend expected, thereby reduce risk ofbottlenecks. total factor productivity, instance, rise trend since 1993. anotherpossibility that, various reasons, labour market function efficiently. oneindication rapidly fall unemployment recent year accompany byacute labour shortages. perhaps i mention also detect certain change ininflation relationships. in box one last year’s inflation reports, example, find theimpact inflation give output gap decreased; one explanation could dowith inflation expectation stable.at bi seminar, moreover, two paper provide indication change relationship behind theprices import goods. that agree picture form recent years. thepass-through inflation exchange rate movements, example, low before. this maybe connect strong competition various levels. it also seem clear permanent exchangerate adjustment price effect differ great elicit movementsthat natural part today’s flexible regime.in event, last year also unquestionably favourable effect thederegulation electricity telecom markets. even though similar change equal importance forthe rate price increase come year easy identify today, deregulation andgenerally grow competition presumably important feature picture inflation.another point worth make world monetary policy independentmandate focus low inflation grow number countries, low inflation 3bis review 107/2000presumably important factor. that really textbook teach u expect, theirstandard message inflation monetary phenomenon, determine precisely monetary policy.inflation expectation low stable clearly help combat inflation.but i believe low-inflation policy wide implications. it presumably one factor behind therecent improvement trend productivity sweden. firm today expose considerably strongerpressure change 1980s. the condition labour market negotiation havealso change way may well positive effect unit labour cost thereby inflation.another consequence measure strengthen competition suddenly become politicallyrelevant way case least i work question 1980s.deregulation enhancement competition positive effect directlyevident form low inflation thereby low interest rate high economic growth.moreover, division responsibility apply stabilisation policy, fiscal policy isfreer focus long-term issue structural matters.the riksbank’s way workingi like comment briefly riksbank work implementation ourso-called rule action. these matter feature general debate past year, presumablyjust inflation inflation forecast continue provide relatively weak argumentsfor raise repo rate even though activity strong.in simple terms, riksbank say formulate monetary policy basis inflation’sforecast rate, first place one two year ahead. if inflation expect 2%target time horizon, interest rate normally raise vice versa.this rule formulate view make policy intelligible, well toothers. we also believe rule kind would serve structure decision-making help toenhance confidence monetary policy. in opinion, rule serve purposes. it hascontributed, least, structure discussion monetary policy issue thereby adeeper understand choice make.have observe rule? judge chart, i would say (chart 2). the chart showsthe repo rate practice together path indicate riksbank’s inflation assessments. youwill see follow forecast fairly closely thus adhere rule action.deviations occurred, mainly early year inflation target; i believe werelargely connect concern exchange rate.the repo rate practice andthe rule

accordingly consider rule kind considerable value, i must underscore thatwe never intend implement mechanically. what matter secure objective thelonger run, really ever.we choose focus period twelve twenty-four month ahead number reasons.one reason short target horizon time lag apply interest rateadjustment normally affect economy inflation. but effect arise short run, forinstance via exchange rate. we pay le heed development two year ahead partlybecause forecast long term normally difficult. still, although monetary policy guidedmainly prospect one two year ahead, normally grind pay attention toforecasts come year period beyond two-year horizon.neither reasonable practice focus solely inflation. for one thing, riksbank alsoaccountable proper function payment system general, financial stability. foranother, without prejudice two objectives, antecedent riksbank act require u topromote economic policy goals, good economic growth increase employment. thisamounts practice try make decision avoid major shock fluctuation growth andemployment.highly respectable reason thus find deviate rule action. if decide doso, however, must good argument present particularly clearly. general talk offinancial imbalances, example, do. a i see it, must clear balance weare refer consider threaten economic future. another point bear mindis rule action two-year horizon normally give u sufficient time toadjust monetary stance.before turn last topic, i mention time time exhort morepragmatic le tie intellectual framework. it quite often suggest shouldfollow example federal reserve recent year alan greenspan. i find basicallynaive. policy principle le clear-cut, combine le transparency motif soon, would mean guarantee successful policy long run. just reverse, i wouldsay, light quite year vicinity decision-making economic policy.economic outlook come yearsa suitable start point discussion economic future october inflation report. ourassessment assume international economic activity tend slacken still remainrelatively strong. we count gdp growth oecd area 3.8% year, follow thenext two year 3.0 2.7%, respectively. inflation would remain relatively low, partly view ofstrong competition international markets.growth sweden judge 4% year, 3.7% next year 3.0% 2002. domesticdemand growth would relatively high consumption well investment. a damp wasexpected, however, appreciation krona. a gradual increase inflation predicted, sothat two year ahead rate would approximately line target.as usual, identify various risk forecast. one possibility oil price stay ata high level. we also consider exchange rate might weak economic fundamentalsin sweden would warrant long run. another risk high wage increases. it wasconceivable wage rise would even high annual rate 4% hadassumed come two years, due, example, far-reaching demand compensation andparity. the main downside risk - low inflation main scenario - lay favourable surprisesof kind see early relationship growth inflation.so picture october stand today? fairly well, opinion. 5bis review 107/2000price movement date broadly line forecast. and expected, havebeen sign international activity slackening. this evident unite state evensome slow growth europe seem likely come years.in sweden, too, indication activity become calmer. growth still seem highbut household well firm become le optimistic future. order book notgrowing drastically before. in general, line foresee october. but ofcourse keep close watch developments. a dramatic course cannot rule out,particularly unite states. the oil price remain high krona weakened. so theserespects, development line risk spectrum main scenario.share prices, know, volatile past six month fall date amajor cause concern. a i mention earlier, 1999

sonakul: inflation target - new monetary policyapproach thailandspeech mr mr chatu mongol sonakul, governor bank thailand, bank ofthailand’s international economic conference “practical experience inflation targeting” hold inbangkok 20 october 2000.* * *distinguished panelists,ladies gentlemen,this second seminar inflation target organize bank thailand. but thefirst seminar international level, highly distinguish speaker many famous centralbanks.to set right tone seminar, i want start question: general publicexpect central bank?people invariably want good life: high standard living, abundant good service toconsume. they also want political freedom, clean environment, many things, let usconcentrate economic aspect order keep relevant central banking.to give people good life, economy generate output high level, high levelin relation capacity. the economy also generate enough job accommodate thenew worker enter labor force yearly. for many asian country demographic slant isheavily towards young ages, number new worker enter labor force year issubstantial. therefore, level output grow provide adequate employment.the people rightly expect central bank important role this: give goodlife.but stop here. people also want good life continue, avoid excessive boom andbust cycle and, course, avoid unnecessary crises. they invariably want bettergoods services.this require economy simply produce high level, also make adequatecapital formation generate high growth rate. there many factor investment thataffect growth - thing like productivity, innovation education. but outside realm ofcentral banking. within area central banking, however, general public rightly expect thecentral bank provide environment conducive growth, without excessive boomand bust cycle avoid crisis whenever possible.what else people expect? people also expect fair distribution opportunity income.central bank generally direct hand provide equal distribution income, much lessopportunity. this responsibility generally lie overall machinery government.nevertheless, high inflation, exists, adverse effect real individuals’ income,especially low bracket le able renegotiate pay. therefore, thecentral bank direct power enforce fair distribution income, central bankfails job properly result high inflation, make situation worse.next, general public also want country’s export competitive. here talk aboutthe export good services, inbound tourism included. again, competitive edge businessdepends many factor outside scope central banking: market know-how, research anddevelopment, technology included. and one look competitive advantage firm theinternational level, thing like quotas, trade protection trade negotiation add complication tothe equation. bi review 106/20002but one factor cut across consideration inflation. if inflation rate acountry far exceed trade partners, erode country’s competitiveness time.therefore, central bank affect country’s export competitiveness, public rightlyexpect bank guard this.finally, people invariably want transparency. they want know central bank view thesituation, act hold accountable action. they also want seewhether central bank capable look ahead future.…how central bank emerge economy like thailand best deliver people theyexpect? my answer inflation targeting.the best environment central bank provide economy attain high level outputand steady growth one price stability. under inflation targeting, monetary policy board hasto look ahead 18-24 month adjust stance today influence outcome future. thiswill help minimize boom bust phenomenon. the float exchange rate regime also helpprevent imbalance build excessively, hence minimize risk major crises.in term transparency accountability, inflation target probably best tool ofcommunication. while general public may difficulty understand keep track ofmonetary growth targets, fully understand inflation, index calculate announcedby independent agency, case thailand ministry commerce. the regular publicationof inflation report also help inform educate public much good past.in case thailand, inflation target best tool ensure high output, sustainable growth,export competitiveness, prevention worsen income distribution transparent andaccountable central bank. the bank thailand last year announce explicit intention controlinflation, range 0 3.5% core inflation announce 23 may 2000. since thebeginning year, see yield 10-year bond drop 7.91% per annum 6.1%.while factor may help toward reduction long term borrow costs, i surethat public confidence commitment

although question possible trade-offbetween inflation growth debate long time, compromise seem thatmonetary policy conducive high employment growth price stability maintained.available evidence

south african reserve bank, business conferenceof bureau economic research, hold stellenbosch 17 november 2000.* * *1.introductionit well-known mission south african reserve bank achieve andmaintain stable financial condition country. this objective spell theconstitution republic south african reserve bank act. in act recognisedthat protect value currency balance sustainable economic growth beachieved. it believe bank, indeed country world, potential foreconomic growth create job opportunity fulfil stable financial conditions.by achieve primary objective reserve bank make contribution sustainable highereconomic growth south africa.some economist commentator monetary policy south africa seem think thereserve bank apply over-zealous monetary policy stance achieve primary objective ofprice stability. they argue bank obsess inflation expense economic growthand job creation. at current level inflation rate, imply inflation rate 8% toolow treat serious concern. the bank therefore provide liquidity moneymarket, allow interest rate repurchase transaction fall way encourage theeconomy grow rapidly. in bank believe would big mistake shift goalof monetary policy away control inflation promote economic growth.2.the determinant economic growtheconomic growth basically determine three factors, namely:(i) quantity capital labour available country;(ii) quality capital labour; and(iii) ingenuity people combine available production resource creation ofgoods services.output rise production resource put work, give supply labour andcapital utilise productively. nowhere aggregate stock money aggregateprice level form part determinant production model sustain long-term economicgrowth.government policies, include monetary policy, affect growth domestic output extentthat affect quantity productivity capital labour. for example, government policiesthat restrict commercial activity fear activity may cause undue environmental orecological damage, raise cost business make firm le productive. obviously theremay good reason policies, harm productive activity economicgrowth.monetary policy one element overall macroeconomic policy, affect theproduction process impact interest rates. there two main channel monetarypolicy. one effect interest rate change exchange rate currency, andthe effect interest rate change demand. therefore monetary policyhas impact economic activity growth work foreign domestic marketsfor good services. bi review 103/20002economic growth involve allocation production factor productive use allocation ofresources take place markets. in modern economic system, market good services, andfor production factors, function efficiently existence money medium ofexchange. without medium exchange, barter trade would take place modernmarket arrangement would simply cease exist. money allow market allocate economicresources sector economic activity highly efficient cost-effective way.in market economy, exchange value express term money price determinedby force supply demand. when good service short supply, demandincreases relative supply good service, price rise. this signal supplier thatthey must shift resource response change relative prices, buyer musteconomise purchases. the productive allocation resource need clear signal relativeprice changes.this monetary policy really come picture. sound monetary policy make pricesignals clearer. in environment overall price stability, much easy detect change inrelative prices. bad monetary policy cloud picture. when price always state flux, ishard make whether particular price change signal change relative scarcity orwhether simply part inflationary process price keep rising.the uncertainty inflation create make problem worse. the mere possibility inflationcreates uncertainty true mean change price individual good services.this uncertainty could lead misallocation resources, would reduce economic growth.this problem nowhere serious capital market. inflation uncertainty raise riskpremium investor require increase cost capital, thus low fix capital formation.lower investment mean low future growth le future income.if producer consumer feel confident average price level remain stable, bemore certain price change indicate true shift demand supply. obviously monetarypolicy maintain price stability improve efficient function markets. this promotesthe full productive employment resources. a alan greenspan stated, monetary policythat prevent inflation factor decision make business consumers, amonetary policy best promote economic growth.empirical evidence show high inflation negative correlation economic growth. incountries inflation high, economic growth normally low. many economist thereforeconvinced inflation undesirable avoid costs. recent economic researchhas cast doubt argument. in principle, likely reversal somewhere theinverse relationship inflation growth grind believe thatcontinuously decline prices, i.e. deflation, good growth.stanley fischer international monetary fund (imf) find inverse relationship wouldhold, even low rate inflation. another study barro confirm inverse relationship, butfound relatively weak. increase inflation 1% lead small reduction le than0.03% growth, accord barro. a range study find effect inflation ongrowth. sarel, researcher imf, come conclusion that: “when inflation low, nosignificant negative effect economic growth: effect may even positive. but inflation ishigh, powerful negative effect growth. the structural break estimate occur theaverage annual rate inflation 8%.”despite uncertainty negative correlation inflation growth inflation ratesbelow 8%, still evidence positive correlation inflation growth anylong period time. in case, inflation rate close 8%, still seem wise follow apolicy counter general increase prices, could easily move level 8% andaccelerate further.in south africa 1970s decade high inflation compare 1960s. inflation hadaveraged 2.6% per year 1960 1970. in 1974 inflation move high 10% andaveraged 10.2% per year 1970 1980. if inflation good growth, one would 3bis review 103/2000expected fast growth 1970s 1960s. this happen. quite contraryhappened. economic growth slow 5.7% per year 1960s 3.4% 1970s.there broadly similar slowdown growth acceleration inflation part theworld 1970s. in 1980s inflation south africa accelerate 14.6% per year, andgrowth fell back 1.5%. by contrast, advance country bring inflation undercontrol economic performance generally start improve. a strike example unitedstates, seem cruise along path strong sustain economic growth withlow inflation. in south africa inflation slow 7½% 1993 1999. althoughthere many factor conducive high economic growth period, seem bemore pure coincidence growth domestic production average 2½% per year.3.other major disadvantage inflationapart negative impact inflation growth wealth creation, inflation also affectsincome distribution worsen inequality number ways. inflation direct impact onincome distribution wage increase inflation rate marginal tax rate arenot adjust take account nominal adjustment wages. inflation indirectly also affectincome distribution slow output growth hence job opportunities. what more, rich caninvest surplus income asset real estate tradeable securities, many instancesbenefit non-taxed inflation-induced capital gains. the poor usually able andmay see save bank whittle away high inflation.a perhaps even important argument artificial stimulation economy thecreation money, low interest rate high inflation, globalise economicenvironment may lead withdrawal foreign capital. if non-residents start expect adepreciation country’s currency, probably immediately react withdraw fundsthat invest country. foreign investor easily world financialmarkets good integrated. if large amount capital withdraw could even lead anexchange rate crisis sharp rise inflation.inflation many disadvantage which, all, lead conclusion thecentral bank must always carefully monitor economic development maintain price financialstability. no country afford move line inflation rate rest world.4.monetary policy business cyclesif obvious excessive money creation contribute sustain economic growth,why hear supposedly well-informed opinion maker monetary policy tight andthat put lid real economic growth? my consider view thesecommentators often expect monetary policy deliver. they tend confuseshort-term acceleration output growth long-term sustainable economic growth.this confusion arise monetary policy affect aggregate domestic spending, certaincircumstances rise spend push output higher. such increase output show ingrowth short run high potential growth rate economy.such short-term growth acceleration attain under-utilisation resources.if great deal slack economy, increase spend raise level output.however, level growth rate production limit supply quality ofproductive resources. if employable resource poor quality, output cannot increaseunless strong increase productivity resource already used. at fullutilisation productive capacity, one recognise modern technology-driveneconomy resource simply employable short run, high spend lead tohigher price increase output. bi review 103/20004under circumstances, fast monetary growth low interest rate increase demand. thisin turn lead high sale output little change prices. under slightly differentconditions, increase demand lead inflation little boost output. the impact achange monetary policy spend production uncertain best. determiningwhether change would affect production instead inflation depend large extent thestage business cycle.everyone involve economic analysis immediately agree extremely difficult todetermine business cycle stance. the reserve bank compile business cycle indicator thispurpose, usually possible determine economy business cycle longtime event delay compilation statistics. moreover, clear trend areneeded information deduction make turn point business cycle.even able determine accurately business cycle stance extent theproduction capacity economy used, still doubtful monetary policy would beuseful active business-cycle management. change monetary policy instrument long andvariable lag effect economic conditions. these lag fact theirlength could change time prevent effective fine-tune real economic activity. to beeffective, change monetary policy would require forecast business cycle stance next18 24 months. if difficult determine current business cycle stance, one safely assumethat even difficult, impossible, forecast accurately whether surplusproduction capacity excessive demand condition economy two years’ time.monetary policy affect price impact change money stock onaggregate demand, also inflation expectations. a major advantage medium tolonger-term monetary policy approach credibility give action monetaryauthorities. by operate long time frame, create basis success itseffects inflation expectations. the active business-cycle management monetary policy usuallyless credible.5.monetary policy inflationso far i indicate low inflation make significant contribution growth prosperitythrough effect resource allocation market-based economic system. this conclusion doesnot mean much monetary policy cannot achieve maintain low inflation. fortunately, evidenceand opinion largely agree issue.one topic macroeconomist generally agree inflation first foremost amonetary phenomenon. inflation result long-term expansion money supply isgreater economy’s ability increase production good services. furthermore, thereis widespread agreement supply money determine long run central banks.thus, south african reserve bank regulate balance sheet growth moneysupply, achieve low inflation maintain it. in fact, bank expect that.an important indicator reserve bank available pursue objective pricestability estimate stock money supply time. to end, bank’s researchdepartment meticulously consolidate balance sheet bank end month. theconsolidated deposit liability banks, along value note coin circulation, aresummarised monetary aggregate label m1a, m1, m2 m3.in past, change broad monetary aggregate m3, relative pre-announced desire orguideline rate change, use policy making. this approach monetary policy make wasbased assumption fairly stable short-run relationship change m3and change nominal aggregate spending. unfortunately relationship become le reliable overtime. a result reserve bank start monitor wide variety economic indicator and, fromthe begin year, shift formal inflation targeting. at present, monetary policy decisionsare anchor directly achievement specify average inflation rate 3 6% in2002. 5bis review 103/2000it important note monetary policy decision make exact science, possibly neverwill be, even accurate macroeconomic measurement imaginable. this bankcannot base policy decision deviation rather uncertain inflation

werner, prime minister luxembourg, thecentral bank governor committee propose economic policy centre would controlnational budgets, regional, structural social policies. the whole process would crown thesingle currency.when bretton wood system collapse oil crisis erupted, national consideration put astop werner plan. with advent eu’s internal market 1990s, however, issueof common currency revived. national currency come see last major barrier theinternal market’s full impact, would pave way even great european integration.to large extent, drive force behind werner plan maastricht treaty

least monetary union eliminate psychological barrier thatdifferent currency raise try compare price different countries. the result greatertransparency strong price competition. price difference europe today twice large inthe unite states. the price small car, example, vary 50% eu memberstates.risk country get stephowever, road great cohesion necessarily smooth. in monetary union, force atwork may cause member state develop different direction instead converging.discussions emu often raise topic asymmetric shocks, technical term stand forsomething quite simple. the condition country involve differ initially regard theireconomic structures, example corporate sector, level technical development, wagebargaining system competitive pressure. economic shock therefore affect differently.problems may also arise economic policy one country markedly different generaldirection. in sweden, example, economic difference eu country 1970s and1980s large measure consequence self-imposed stabilisation problems.if shock hit single country, monetary union eliminate possibility mitigate itseffects adjust exchange rate. neither do implement national interestrate policy. instead, wage price need flexible possible adjust counter theimpact shock. wage formation accordingly major importance enable country ina monetary union harmonise business cycle without hit unemployment.another type problem monetary union come difference construction fiscalpolicy. a national currency interest rate long available clear indicator marketconfidence country’s economic policy. this mean part force previouslytended discipline pressure fiscal expansion counter unduly large budget deficit longeracts. that apply particular small countries, mistake concealed, least atime, overall development monetary union’s exchange rate interest rates. theopposite apply large country commit economic policy mistake - consequence liableto hit entire union.in theory, perhaps problem kind grave. if euro country’s budget ismarkedly underbalanced money distribute inhabitants, ought prudent enoughto set aside income cope strain bind come when, sooner later, thegovernment finance

pressure throughout euro area. all elseequal, end result ecb force tighten stance little more. in way, lessdisciplined policy one member state extent hit country union. inthe extreme case, conceivable country might deliberately refrain manage debtproblem and, crisis become acute, try shift payment onto countries.problems another type come fore past year’s weaken euro. when themood negative, every potential problem get air regardless weight practice.difficulties small countries, example connection inflation considerably high thanin core countries, present threat whole, consequence

institutionalrequirements concern formal central bank independence legal infrastructure financialsector also contribute consensus achieve i believe central forthe proper function emu.a remarkable degree economic convergence throughout eu achieve second half ofthe 1990s. if one exclude greece, gap high low rate inflation among eucountries narrow 10 percentage point 1990 1% point 1997. in 1995

finally, framework demand high degree transparency. for example, formaltarget monetary policy establish publish agreement. the bank oblige topublish formal statement lay monetary policy evolve why,

could discuss, hopefully ican shed perspective significant institutional choices.an independent central bank?inflation target central bank independence tend go hand hand although certainlypossible conceive structure case.the case central bank independence well understand well cover literature timeinconsistency. in essence, public, particularly elect representatives, likely faceincentives bias

independent central bank isinconsistent tradition democratic parliamentary structures. we normally expect theauthority state exercise elect representative rather central bankbureaucrats.so overcome inconsistency?in case, act parliament spell medium term objective centralbank language quite broad uncontentious. the reserve bank new zealand obligedto pursue “stability general level prices”.but mean “stability general level prices”? that define act. but theminister finance governor oblige agree operational target publish apolicy target agreement (pta) cover five-year term governor. in

government over-ride agreement feel good reason -perhaps situation crisis unusual shock. that provide for. but rule becomplied with. the over-ride must publish must table parliament debate. anysuch over-ride persist one year without subject parliamentaryscrutiny.as usual, alternative model available. in case, instrument independence - inother words, central bank wide discretion go achieve inflation target.but goal independence - establish target monetarypolicy way, instance, u federal reserve board european central bank areempowered do.we feel comfortable structure require active government participation establishingthe goal monetary policy. indeed, believe important provision reinforce legitimacyof central bank’s task. but clear model viable operate effectively theirparticular circumstances.before leave subject central bank independence, i touch one importantquestion - fund central bank. we, like central banks, traditionally generatedsubstantial profit

notsuitable since could provide direct route independence bank could bequickly undermined.2note rbnz act specifically oblige u operate inflation target regime. in principle, ptacould specify intermediate target, eg monetary aggregate, nominal gdp even, stretch, exchangerate. the significant constraint intermediate target choose must consistent reasonable definitionof “stability general

federal open marketcommittee, bank england’s new monetary policy committee, swedish riksbank’sexecutive board reserve bank australia’s board director provide alternativestructures.in new zealand case, single decision-maker model reflect concern retain clearaccountability - fault find decision central bank, nodoubt hold responsible.this one area currently review new zealand. professor lars svensson ofstockholm university appoint review number aspect monetary policy,including decision-making governance structures. (i note that, commission thisreview, government specifically rule change independence central bankor concept single, price stability target monetary policy.)in prepare submission svensson review, non-executive director board, arecharged monitor performance governor, look whether shouldrecommend adoption committee-based decision make structure place current singledecision-maker model.the potentially negative feature single decision-maker model include:• exposure single person risk.• decision-making may capture single train think result inferiordecisions.• a public perception may develop single individual, governor, excessivepower. if perception develop, “legitimacy” central bank’soperational independence may come question.• a single decision-maker may insufficiently touch actually happen inthe economy, may partial view developments, thus result inferiordecisions.after careful deliberation, non-executive director choose recommend retention thecurrent single decision-maker structure. their reason relate primarily preference thegreater clarity accountability inherent current structure. also important sense thesingle decision-maker facilitate great coherence consistency communication monetarypolicy issue likely committee structures, great effectiveness management ofthe organisation. also, felt risk current structure significantly mitigatedwithin framework provision as:• a rigorous process appoint governor minister finance must makethe appointment candidate nominate board. bi review 100/20006• constraint governor’s decision-making authority inherent rbnzact policy target agreement.• the monitor governor’s performance board ensure governor actsin collegial manner, proper regard wide range advice input isobtained source internal external bank.• the transparency provision ensure close external scrutiny governor’sdecisions including, importantly, financial markets.further, non-executive director recommend change intend strengthen theboard’s scrutiny decision-making process thereby reduce risk inherent thesingle decision-maker model.another consideration emerge consideration alternative decision-makingstructures relate concern potential conflict interest external appointee areinvolved monetary policy decision-making limit pool available expertise andexperience suit task small country like new zealand.overall, i doubt many general principle lesson international experience thatcan apply area. in many cases, seem formal difference singledecision-maker committee structure le obvious practice paper.moreover, seem interest approach committee structures, thatof bank england riksbank, still evolve settle down. for reason maybe soon draw firm conclusion prefer decision-making structures.single multiple goals?the new zealand framework quite deliberately explicitly direct monetary policy towards singleobjective - price stability. this approach stem understand that, medium-term,monetary policy affect price level;
