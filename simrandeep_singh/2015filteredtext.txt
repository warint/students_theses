 bi central bankers’ speech 1 stanley fischer: nonbank financial intermediation, financial stability, road forward speech mr stanley fischer, vice chair board governor federal reserve system, “central bank shadows: monetary policy financial stability postcrisis” 20th annual financial market conference, sponsor federal reserve bank atlanta, stone mountain, georgia, 30 march 2015. * * * it honor speak federal reserve bank atlanta’s 20th financial market conference, i grateful president lockhart organizer invite so.1 this even i would like take stock progress financial reform nonbank financial sector highlight principle approach prudential regulation sector strengthen financial stability. the nonbank sector include firm diverse business model practices, many differ greatly banks. even so, nonbank firm activity pose key vulnerability banks, include high leverage, excessive maturity transformation, complexity, lead financial instability. the reform undertake date reflect difference similarity nonbank bank sectors. while progress financial reform front, complacent stability financial system. regulation often create incentive activity move outside regulatory perimeter, market participant respond incentives. thus expect reform certainly need road. the nonbank sector important source vulnerability crisis a know, nonbank financial sector unite state larger, play important role, countries. in recent years, two-thirds nonfinancial credit market debt hold nonbanks, include market-based fund securitization vehicle mutual fund well institution insurance company finance companies. nonbanks involve many activity within financial system well, security lending. the nonbank sector produce material benefits: increase market liquidity, great diversity fund sources, – often claim – efficient allocation risk investors. however, threat stability overall financial system also increased, evident recent financial crisis. it eight year since major crack financial system lead global financial crisis first appear nonbank entity activities. while cause crisis complex, i start tell part tale nonbank distress transmit broad financial system. the story begin nonbank mortgage companies, important originator subprime prime mortgage loans, typically securitizing sell investment bank securitized. rumor trouble among firm circulate 2006 house price start decline, large firm file bankruptcy december 2006.2 then new century, one point second large subprime lender, file bankruptcy april 2007 fund disappear result fear losses. many follow 2007 2008. replacement nonbank lenders’ capacity process mortgage application fund mortgage loan occur partially slowly. 1 the view express necessarily others board, federal open market committee, federal reserve system. 2 ownit mortgage solutions, one top 20 subprime mortgage originator nationally, file bankruptcy december 28, 2006. virtually firm since either fail acquired. 2 bi central bankers’ speech next step: the distress mortgage market amplify broad financial system several ways, include something similar bank run instead occur asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) vehicles. these vehicle invest private-label mortgage securitizations long-term debt security fund short-term commercial paper. buyer commercial paper issue abcp vehicle withdraw fund start late summer 2007. the volume asset vehicle large, $700 billion, run, ability financial system fund credit many type asset-backed security become constrained.3 the run abcp also put considerable pressure bank system liquidity backstop bank provide vehicles.4 some guarantor also insure mortgage-backed securities, doubt arise ability guarantor pay claim mortgage-backed securities, credibility guarantee municipal security also reduced. municipality find difficult costly issue debt even though activity otherwise unrelated subprime mortgages.5 next, crisis spread nonbank finance companies, make substantial fraction consumer loan unite state – example, auto credit card loans. a crisis go on, ability lender fund securitizations commercial paper become increasingly constrained. for period failure lehman brothers, many investor unwilling buy commercial paper asset-backed security price, and, result, finance company face tight fund constraints. in turn, finance company cut credit availability, sharply depress purchase consumer durables, include automobiles. these example highlight five lessons. one recent crisis first manifest nonbank sector bad nonbank sector banks. almost example financial distress mention far occur stress commercial bank system become acute, case well before. for example, three commercial bank fail unite state 2007, commercial bank distress peak end 2008 later. a second lesson nonbank distress harm real economy. mortgages, auto loans, credit security issuance become hard obtain. some slack take commercial banks, credit contract sharply, million american suffered. third lesson: many problem nonbanks similar problem plague banks. these problem include insolvency, illiquidity (by i mean loss access fund even nonbank solvent), general loss confidence, counterparties kind become reluctant deal nonbanks. fourth lesson: the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) handle bank insolvency keep bank’s function run pay depositor find buyer bank’s assets. the federal reserve, central bank, address bank illiquidity use lender-of-last-resort authority. bank supervisory agency address loss confidence action stress test conduct spring 2009. however lack power nonbanks make much difficult authority address 3 see daniel covitz, nellie liang, gustavo suarez (2013), “the evolution financial crisis: collapse asset-backed commercial paper market,” journal finance, vol. 68 (june), pp. 815–48. 4 run repurchase agreement (repo) fund asset-backed security also troublesome bank nonbanks. see gary gorton andrew metrick (2012), “securitized bank run repo,” journal financial economics, vol. 104 (june), pp. 425–51. 5 moreover, state municipal borrower issue long-term debt pay short-term interest rate use structure variable-rate demand note (vrdns), give holder right put security back liquidity provider short notice. when money market fund investor hold vrdns become worry ability get money short notice, volume putbacks rose, development ultimately lead increase payment obligation municipalities. bi central bankers’ speech 3 distress nonbanks influence financial system. before crisis, authority policy lever provide liquidity resolve failure nonbanks way would avoid serious spillovers. liquidity ultimately provide nonbank markets, market security back consumer business assets, facility far simple take substantial time create implement.6 finally, nonbank distress transmit bank sector many channels, counterparty relationships, disruption fund markets, knock-on effect asset fire sales. the failure lehman provide good example. it nonbank, failure impose direct loss many type counterparties disrupt many market negative effect banks. principle prudential regulation nonbank intermediary activity it widely understand regulation nonbanks fit activity vulnerability pose, imply every nonbank financial institution activity necessarily need regulated. the two key principle prudential regulation nonbanks warranted, simple: first, attentive solvency liquidity; second, recognize financial system change time, thus close monitor analysis system essential. insolvency illiquidity classic financial stability concerns. and mentioned, common theme distress nonbanks observe crisis. thus, go far wrong begin consider promote solvency liquidity, take account unique structure activity type nonbank. liquidity challenge vary across nonbank firm activities. in some, issue whether firm fund distress situation. for example, broker-dealer rely heavily short-term wholesale fund may find fund evaporate first sign trouble – situation could force sale asset fire sale prices. one way mitigate problem direct restriction structure liabilities, duration use wholesale funding. analogously banks, one could also imagine require nonbanks maintain buff highly liquid asset size accord risk liability run quickly stress situation. in nonbanks, withdrawable liability part structure entity activity, vary degree mismatch liquidity asset liabilities. for example, open-ended mutual fund offer daily withdrawal privilege invest asset take long sell settle, give investor incentive withdraw quickly distress arises. the fire sale asset may result depress asset price increase volatility, knock-on effect institution markets. concern grow liquidity mismatch aggregate value le liquid asset fund grown. in part concern, december federal register notice last year, financial stability oversight council (fsoc) request public comment potential systemic risk pose asset manager activity products. to promote solvency, one could impose ratio-type capital requirements, leverage ratio requirement risk-based requirements. an alternative require firm perform regular stress test demonstrate remain solvent continue lend even stress. in fed’s case, choose impose requirement banks, requirement cannot simply applied, is, nonbanks. 6 see gorton metrick, “securitized banking,” note 4, op.cit.; jeremy stein (2012), “monetary policy financial stability regulation,” quarterly journal economics, vol. 127, pp. 57–95; robin greenwood, samuel hanson, jeremy stein (2014), “a comparative-advantage approach government debt maturity,” journal finance, vol. 65, pp. 993–1028. 4 bi central bankers’ speech it well know solvency liquidity difficult separate stress period fear solvency, even unfounded, prompt run. thus, one could also imagine promote solvency liquidity nonbanks impose restriction structure activity way reduce likelihood runs. an example recent change security exchange commission (sec) regulation prime money market mutual funds. start 2016, prime institutional money fund require publish float net asset value rather stable value $1 per unit. stable-value funds, saw crisis, vulnerable unexpected “break buck” event lead run. under new rules, fund also impose limitation withdrawal liability impose liability redemption fees. the sec consider require money market fund hold capital choose so. only time tell whether adopt reform intend run-damping effects, do, capital much le necessary. some may raise concern increase regulation nonbanks increase moral hazard increase risk system net. but moral hazard may already present. over past 20 year more, government sometimes act contain damage distress nonbanks economic damage might result failure act. we always mindful moral hazard incentive seek contain them, well-designed regulation might reduce rather increase moral hazard. in bank sector, bank regulator focus improve resolution plan bank enhance ability fdic manage resolution systemically important firm way mitigate spillover economy. for example, proposal consideration require large interconnect bank maintain buff debt could convert equity could otherwise absorb loss upon failure. such proposal could view form solvency regulation form loss-absorbing capital might appropriate large interconnect nonbanks well. in addition, nonbank intermediation often involve complex chain activity encompass many entity markets. such chain tend increase web interconnection financial system that, circumstances, increase likelihood severity systemic stress. for example, movement collateral value trigger margin call fire sale assets, thus activity depend market-valued collateral vulnerable. the financial stability board currently consider reform margin security finance transactions. other interconnection involve exposure counterparty default. the new regulatory regime derivatives, i discus moment, seek mitigate counterparty risk. it often say strong regulation bank sector cause activity move outside perimeter regulation. this evolution also could lead great complexity, long chain interconnections, make difficult market participant understand risk arise exposures. example migration already occur include movement many loan make large corporation bank collateralize loan obligations, securitization many credit card receivables, securitization mortgages. this kind migration make close monitor regulator particularly important. authority monitor change may arise response new regulation change economic financial conditions. they need information so, many nonbank entities, flow information currently nonexistent limit informal. another force evolution nonbank sector demand safe money-like assets. some argue demand private money creation prompt growth “shadow banking” prior crisis.7 indeed, whenever shortage develop, might expect nonbank 7 see gorton metrick, “securitized banking,” note 4; samuel g. hanson, andrei shleifer, jeremy c. stein, robert w. vishny (forthcoming), “banks patient fixed-income investors,” journal financial economics; zoltan pozsar, tobias adrian, adam ashcraft, hayley boesky (2010), “shadow banking,” staff report 458 (new york: federal reserve bank new york, july; revise february 2012). bi central bankers’ speech 5 financial system create asset appear safe could certain circumstance pose systemic risks. progress date we see progress improve regulation nonbank financial sector. let mention four area reform. the first dodd-frank act’s creation fsoc power give designate individual nonbank firm systemically important thus subject prudential regulation federal reserve. the fsoc designate four nonbank firm systemically important.8 the fsoc also useful venue regulator collaborate identify emerge threats. and important mechanism agency cooperate respond practice firm migrate outside traditional regulatory perimeters. second: securitization reform. a regulation process implementation require securitizers retain risk security create. that incentivize structure securitizations way good protect holder senior tranche credit risk, although qualify residential mortgage exempt requirement. a third area derivative reforms. to reduce complexity pro-cyclicality, reform include move standardize derivative central counterparties (ccps) require initial variation margin noncleared derivatives. relatedly, ccps gain prominence, regulator become focus concern resilience, recovery, resolution. in addition, regulator work improve quality standardization data report swap data repositories, actively participate international effort develop uniform identification standard facilitate aggregation data.9 a key issue understand extent market participant use derivative expose other. besides new money market mutual fund rule i already mentioned, fourth example additional data collection specific hold money funds, enhance stability provide investor information good evaluate risks. in addition, dodd-frank act mandate establishment office financial research order help promote financial stability measurement analysis risks, conduct essential research, collection standardization financial data. data collection begin hedge fund progress make collect data repurchase agreement security lending. nevertheless, nonbank firm activity – include concern volume us derivative – still opaque. to sum up, much do strengthen prudential regulation supervision nonbank financial system, need done. we must remain vigilant change system increase systemic risk, make appropriate change regulation structure regulation necessary. recent regulatory changes, include macroprudential approach part u.s. regulators, help u that.10 but never forget international monetary fund’s all-purpose warn whenever tempt give economy clean bill health: complacency must avoided. 8 the four firm designate fsoc systemically important american international group, inc.; prudential financial, inc.; general electric capital corporation, inc.; metlife, inc. 9 due critical nature overseas derivative data need standardize data regulatory analysis, cftc ofr 2014 form partnership standardize enhance quality data collect cftc-registered swap data repositories. important work standardize derivative data also way international level. 10 this change reflect set liscc – large institution supervision coordinate committee. bi central bankers’ speech 1 manuel sánchez: mexico’s reform progress economic outlook remark mr manuel sánchez, deputy governor bank mexico, 2015 institute international finance (iif) latin america economic forum, busan, republic korea, 28 march 2015. * * * i would like thank institute international finance invitation participate conference. it honor share panel distinguish speaker south korea, economy show extraordinarily rapid development last decades, achieve level industrialize nation amazingly short lapse time. mexico benefit greatly economic tie south korea. in particular, country second important source investment asia mexico, especially manufacturing, commerce mining, also significant trade partner. in talk, i would like touch first structural reform recently undertake mexico and, second, comment mexico’s economic outlook. a usual, view entirely necessarily reflect bank mexico govern board. mexico’s progress structural reform mexico embrace ample program structural reform encompass labor, education, financial system, telecommunications, energy, among areas. the general aim promote great market flexibility, investment human physical capital, competition, thereby boost total factor productivity growth, stagnation inhibit long-term overall economic expansion. legislative change necessary reform pass congress, country currently process implement them. challenge inherent task. a u know, effectiveness reform anywhere world rest heavily details. today, i would like bring date specifically telecommunication energy reforms, give essential role sector play overall economy consumer wellbeing. the telecommunication sector characterize limit access high cost. in telecom broadcast service competition scant, sector dominate one company. in particular, privatization government telephone operator two decade ago transfer exclusive fixed-line right one buyer, without adequate regulation favor serious competition. in follow years, new provider telecom service encounter play field level. while price reduction occur thank incipient competition, service remain expensive quality low international standards. the telecommunication reform seek remedy problem facilitate great competition and, acceptably competitive environment achieved, clamp restriction especially dominant players, define company market share great 50 percent telecom broadcasting, judge regulatory authority significant power specific market segments. to promote competition, barrier entry new player reduced. now, 100 percent foreign ownership permit telecom 49 percent broadcasting. also, license generally allow operator offer broad basket services, provide certain non-concentration requirement met. in broadcasting, two new national digital television network recently grant public bid process. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in case telecoms, new law eas customer mobility across operators. for example, unblock handset contract expire consumer pay equipment. also, operator must implement portability fix mobile telephone number within 24 hour receive request free charge. to regulate market power overall industry, several measure undertaken. first, new federal telecommunication institute authority include sphere competition. it help fact legal recourse previously use operator circumvent former authority’s resolution indefinitely long allowed. second, price restriction impose telephony operator form elimination national long distance fees, world digital network internet increasingly obsolete. third, asymmetric regime contain price activity cap apply dominant players, long continue deem such. notably, main fix mobile telecom provider cannot charge operator call text message terminate network. this mobile operator allow charge fee customer receive call outside local service areas, price discriminate customer call companies’ phone numbers. the dominant player must also allow sale resale mobile service concessionaries lease last-mile network. it cannot offer tv services. in broadcasting, dominant firm must allow competitor lease infrastructure cannot buy exclusivity audiovisual content consider significant. this broadcaster permit capital dominant telecom provider. this reform already yield benefits. a decline trend relative telecom price deepened, service provider increase variety package offered. in fact, competition operator focus increasingly speed quality data service provide fix mobile means. another encourage sign interest international player mexican market.1 to turn second focus, energy sector also suffer high price frequently, insufficient supply. crude oil production decline continuously since 2004. inadequate pipeline infrastructure limit lower-price gas imports, well lower-cost, efficient distribution. electricity price mexico remain well key trade partners.2 behind problem lie decade state control, little benefit outside participation. the energy reform seek confront reality allow private participation virtually aspect sector. this include public bid oil gas exploration production contracts, permit production oil product petrochemicals, transport, storage, distribution, sale hydrocarbon hydrocarbon products. also, permit grant generate sell electric power, well import electricity use mexico’s national electric system.3 the reform contemplate wholesale market purchase sale electricity, retail operation also possible. electricity transmission distribution remain hand state, outsource private contractor permitted. 1 for analysis recent price development telecom service sector, see banco de méxico (2015), informe trimestral, octubre-diciembre 2014, box 1, february. 2 the negative impact inadequate infrastructure gas pipeline system illustrate banco de méxico (2013), inflation report, july – september 2013, box 2, november. 3 the national electric system mainly compose national transmission general distribution networks, power plant deliver electricity national networks, equipment facility use control system itself. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a oil gas exploration extraction, four different type contract offer, namely licenses, profit-sharing, production-sharing, services. in first three, private company register value expect profit back contract books. in wake so-called round zero pemex apply certain field allocate them, first round public bid begun. two auction announced, one exploration production, another production only, shallow-water oil field production-sharing contracts. the auction allocation expect matter months. fiscal economic condition contract revise accord suggestion auction participants, accordance recent development oil markets. three additional phase round ensue, type extraction increase level difficulty cost. additionally, contract auction award deliver gas private pipelines, include pipe texas chihuahua another chihuahua durango. the first permit grant private agent import electricity power station connect exclusively national electric system also conceded. significant foreign domestic private investment could potentially materialize new environment. the change eventually allow efficient energy-sector production low domestic gasoline electricity price competitive markets. the economic outlook the mexican economy show sign moderate recovery slowdown 2012. the upturn drive industrial production, manufacture take lead, fuel export unite states. construction recently pick well, mine still faltering, due mainly oil production, decline since 2004. domestic spend also improve somewhat, private investment show strength, consumption gain unable obtain traction. analysts’ consensus forecast year next call economy gradually pick steam, pull positive u.s. performance.4downside risk growth outlook include continue stagnant consumer confidence, potential impact social unrest, possible reduction oil production platform. mexican financial market face two challenges. first, sharp fall crude oil price since last summer make country’s fiscal position weaker, since oil still account approximately one-third budget public-sector revenue. in view likely scenario oil price remain low time come decrease oil production trend, federal government recently send investor sign fiscal responsibility announce cut 2015 budget spending, amount 0.7 percent gdp, despite fact oil revenue year almost fully hedged.5 second, u.s. feed widely expect begin normalize monetary policy year. volatility hit mexican foreign exchange market, peso depreciate significantly, along world currencies. however, adjustment mexico orderly, abundant liquidity prevail market operations. furthermore, 2015, hold peso-denominated government bond nonresident remain stable. while somewhat high last year, interest rate continue relatively low terms. nevertheless, u.s. monetary policy normalization around 4 see blue chip economic indicators, march 2015, banco de méxico (2014), quarterly report, october-december 2014, summary, february. 5 see shcp (2015), “la shcp anuncia medidas de responsabilidad fiscal para mantener la estabilidad.” press release 007/2015, january. 4 bi central bankers’ speech corner, portfolio adjustment bout volatility cannot rule out. therefore, financial authority must remain watch. so far 2015, inflation return path convergence bank mexico’s 3 percent permanent target, year stray due temporary factor tax hike agricultural price pressures. the recent decline inflation support disappearance effect last year’s tax increase fade pressure agricultural prices, along low key telecom electricity prices. the good inflation performance must maintained. upside risk include significant pass-through weak peso road, well resurgence spike noncore inflation price eventual aggregate demand pressures. close monitor risk all-important view fact analysts’ long-term inflation expectation remain 3 percent target. sustain convergence target must consolidated. final remark mexico path help take resolution fundamental issue obstruct productivity long-term growth. in particular, recent telecom energy reform seek foment investment competition sectors, may boost efficiency economy. the degree success reform define term enhance economy’s potential. this depend heavily quality implementation, sense reform actually lead great market flexibility investment, generate substantially effective competition. moderate cyclical economic recovery mexico underway back strong u.s. performance. persistently low oil price upcoming u.s. monetary policy normalization pose challenge mexico’s economic upturn markets. further volatility cannot excluded, thus authority must remain alert. finally, inflation recently fall bank mexico’s target. however, convergence objective must consolidate become permanent phenomenon. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andrew g haldane: on microscope telescope speech mr andrew g haldane, executive director chief economist bank

va madouros simon whitaker comment contributions. accompany chart table find bank england’s website. at least since financial crisis, increase interest use complexity theory make sense dynamic economic financial system (newman (2011), arthur (2014)). particular attention focus use network theory understand non-linear behaviour financial system situation stress (gai kapadia (2011), haldane may (2011), gai, haldane kapadia (2011)). the language complexity theory – tip points, feedback, discontinuities, fat tail – enter financial regulatory lexicon. some progress also make use model help design calibrate post-crisis regulatory policy. a one example, epidemiological model use understand calibrate regulatory capital standard largest, interconnect bank – so-called “super-spreaders” (craig et al (2014)). they also use understand impact central clear derivative contracts, instability payment system policy set minimum collateral haircut security finance transaction (haldane (2009)). rather le attention far, however, place use complexity theory understand overall architecture public policy – various piece policy jigsaw fit together whole. this potentially promise avenue. the financial crisis lead fundamental reshape macro-financial policy architecture. in areas, regulatory foundation fortify – example, micro-prudential regulation individual financial firms. in others, whole new layer policy add – example, macro-prudential regulation safeguard financial system whole (hanson, kashyap stein (2010)). this new policy architecture largely untried, untested unmodelled. this spawn whole raft new, largely untouched, public policy questions. why need micro- macro-prudential policy layers? how regulatory layer interact monetary policy? and policy interact global level? answer question research agenda right. without answer questions, i wish argue complexity theory might useful lens begin explore them. the architecture complex system may powerful analytical device understand shape new architecture macro-financial policy. modern economic financial system classic complex, adaptive networks. rather, perhaps good characterise complex, adaptive “system systems” (gorod et al (2014)). in words, global economic financial system comprise nest set sub-systems, one complex web. understand complex sub-systems, interaction, crucial effective systemic risk monitor management. this “system systems” perspective new way understand multi-layered policy architecture emerge since crisis. regulate complex system system 2 bi central bankers’ speech call multiple set tool operate different level resolution: individual entity – microscopic micro-prudential layer; national financial system economy – macroscopic macro-prudential monetary policy layer; global financial economic system – telescopic global financial architecture layer. the architecture complex system system mean policy vary degree magnification necessary understand moderate fluctuations. it also mean take account interaction layer important gauge risk. for example, crisis lay bare cost ignore systemic risk set micro-prudential policy. it also highlight cost ignore role macro-prudential policy manage risks. that post-crisis policy architecture seek fill gaps. new institutional mean also find improve integration micro-prudential, macro-prudential, macro-economic global perspectives. in uk, first three house one roof bank england. in follows, i first set background dynamic complex system system use stylise examples. i discus stylise fact “system systems” today’s economic financial network. finally, i draw tentative conclusion future research policy follow view macro-financial system lens. the architecture complexity the literature complexity theory, implication system dynamics, deep rich (newman (2011)). although generally-accepted definition complexity, one contain herbert simon’s classic 1962 article architecture complexity – “one make large number part interact non-simple way” – continue capture well everyday essence (simon (1962)). in complex systems, whole behave differently sum parts. although single unify theory complexity, dynamic property complex system reasonably well-understood, base analytical experimental study network type – physical, natural, social, biological economic (ladyman et al (2013)). these dynamic property include non-linearity; discontinuity response shocks; amplify feedback effects; so-called “emergent” system-wide behaviour difficult predict behaviour one element. these property complex system typically give rise irregular, often highly non-normal, statistical distribution system time. this manifest much fat tail normal distribution would suggest. in words, system-wide interaction feedback generate much high probability catastrophic event gaussian distribution would imply (newman (2005), gabaix (2009)). they may also result distribution multi-modal, consistent model multiple equilibrium (bisin et al (2011)). the topology wire complex system appears, perhaps predictably, crucial bear resilience shocks. many complex network found, practice, exhibit “scale-free” property (barabasi albert (1999)). that say, comprise core set node large number connection large set peripheral node connections. there core-periphery, hub-and-spokes, network configuration. this scale-free property find everything food web world wide web, eco-systems economic systems, synapsis cities, social network financial network (jackson (2010)). these scale-free topology important, subtle, implication system resilience. for example, core-periphery model find robust, systemic level, random shocks. that shock likely fall peripheral node unconnected with, hence unlikely cascade through, system whole. but bi central bankers’ speech 3 system also vulnerable target attack core node – “super-spreaders” – whose hyper-connectivity risk generate systemic cascade (albert, jeong barabasi (2000)). another typical feature complex system tend organise hierarchy, well-defined structure system sub-systems (simon (1962, 1976)). herbert simon believe hierarchical structure particular type likely dominate, namely one “decomposable”. by mean organisational structure could partition resilience system whole reliant one sub-element.1 for evolutionary reason survival fittest, simon posit decomposable network resilient hence likely proliferate specie (simon (1962)).2 while simon’s evolutionary theory may reasonable long-run description real-world complex system – natural biological – may le good description evolution socio-economic systems. the efficiency many network rely hyper-connectivity. there are, language economics, significantly increase return scale scope network industry. these return increase network connectivity (goldin mariathason (2014)). think benefit global supply chain global interbank network trade financial risk-sharing. this provide powerful secular incentive non-decomposable socio-economic systems. moreover, hyper-connected network face systemic threat, often able adapt way avoid extinction. for example, risk social, economic financial disorder typically lead adaptation policy prevent systemic collapse. these adaptive policy response may preserve otherwise-fragile socio-economic topologies. they may even encourage growth connectivity complexity networks. for example, policy support “super-spreader” bank crisis may encourage become larger, complex, still time (haldane (2009)). the combination network economies, policy response failure, mean socio-economic system may le darwinian, hence decomposable, natural biological systems. it backdrop complex, socio-economic “system systems” may emerge. this define one comprise interlock set individually complex web ((gorod et al (2014)). the system system concept initially emerge engineer enterprise systems, involve multi-layered assembly component parts. but since find way number domain include military planning, ecological evolution, power grids, transport network neurological structure (gao et al (2014)). although still infancy, general property “system systems” perspective worth bring out. for example, kurant thiran (2006) look behaviour particular topology – layer complex network. specifically, focus behaviour transport network two-layer structure. simulation network suggest monitor risk layer-by-layer basis likely understate significantly risk face individual layer. layer complex network may also le robust failure might apparent assess resilience layer turn. in words, risk layer network strikingly different sum parts. the great complexity layer, strong correlation layers, great vulnerability (kurant 1 a example, early tv set build non-decomposable way, make vulnerable failure one element. later, tv sets, car complex gadget tend construct “decomposable” fashion improve resilience. 2 charles perrow’s concept “tightly coupled” – non-decomposable – system closely link (perrow (1984)). 4 bi central bankers’ speech thiran (2006)). in respects, counterpart simon’s “decomposability” hypothesis system system context. most recently, research focus controllability complex, layer network (liu, slotine barabasi (2011), gao, liu, d’souza barabasi (2014)). it tend find that, even dimensionality network large (a large number layers), effective control exercise act relatively small number key layer nodes. this particularly case network scale-free property – words, core-periphery-type topology. these point bring life use simulation statistical distribution simple set system systems. these construct mix together component distributions, proxy layer sub-systems. these layer may complex. this mix layers, distributions, do use assume distribution correlations, may non-normal complex. in words, multiple layer complexity system systems. the input simulation show table 1. chart 1 show set joint (system-wide) distribution simulations, line represent probability contour distribution.3 chart 1a baseline case. it involve mix two normal distribution low correlation coefficient (0.3) correlation normally distributed.4 this joint distribution represent two-layer system systems, neither layer complex (hence normal distribution each) correlation sub-systems weak regular. the result joint distribution slightly elliptical normal – mean great likelihood large positive negative outcome occur simultaneously – otherwise unexceptional.5 we add progressively great degree complexity base case ass impact distribution systemic risk. chart 1b raise correlation two layer 0.8; strong feedback sub-systems. it result notable elongation system-wide distribution even great probability good bad news strike simultaneously; become non-normal, close statistical property expect natural, biological social networks. if allow one layer cake exhibit property complex system, assume t- rather normally-distributed, system-wide distribution show chart 1c.6 the tail distribution widened. and allow non-normal distribution correlation sub-systems – assume correlation rise bad draw, crisis – low tail large still mass skew downwards (chart 1d). the final, perhaps interesting, case show chart 1e. this show three-layer network. two layer complex (they t-distributed) layer strongly correlate network tree. the result system-wide distribution highly irregular. it also heavily fat-tailed, mean catastrophically good bad outcome much probable normal distribution would suggest. it topology significantly complex individual layers. these simulations, although simple, provide insight likely behaviour complex system systems. for example, suggest view risk lens single layer likely provide significantly distort picture true risk distribution, 3 which base one million replication data generate process. 4 technically, do use so-called gaussian copula. 5 with zero correlation two distributions, chart 1a would set concentric circles. 6 the t-distribution fat tail normal. in simulations, assume 5 degree freedom. bi central bankers’ speech 5 probability tail event materially under-estimated. a example that, chart 1f look unconditional conditional distribution one sub-systems chart 1c. the conditional distribution condition outcome second layer lie low half distribution. a risk manager look unconditional distribution (a single layer perspective) would significantly under-estimate true tail risk facing. this direct parallel pre-crisis situation, action individual risk manager banks, individual supervisor banks, ignore role systemic risk gauge individual firm risk. this lead material under-estimation individual firm risk. the micro-prudential microscope wrongly focussed. ignore layer, sub-system, likely equally distorting. that see compare risk distribution chart 1d (two layers) 1e (three layers). if world involve three layer complexity, miss layer lead significant under-estimation risk. this, too, parallel pre-crisis situation macro-prudential layer essentially ignore micro-prudential macro-economic policymakers. this lead under-estimate policy risk faced. pull together, public policy implication follow complex system system perspective? first, underscore importance accurate data, timely mapping, layer system systems. this especially important layer complex. granular data need capture interaction within complex sub-systems. second, model layers, interaction layers, likely important, understand system risk dynamic calibrate potential policy response them. third, control risks, something akin tinbergen rule likely apply. there likely need least many policy instrument complex sub-components system system risk monitor manage effectively. put differently, under-identified complex system system likely result loss control, system-wide layers. the architecture macro-financial system how, then, theory relate real-world, macro-financial systems? these system likely contain many move parts. moreover, move part likely significantly tightly-coupled past result financial global integration. in words, global economic financial system may, recent decades, become “system systems”, multiple, interact layer complex system right. chart 2 provide stylise characterisation layers, decompose four ways. at high resolution – “micro-prudential” layer – individual financial firms. these are, like, atom financial system. like atoms, however, individual bank complex entities, many move interact business parts. at one low level resolution – “macro-prudential” layer – financial system. this comprise interaction financial firm network, might arise counterparty relationship interbank, repo derivative markets. this layer akin organ, like brain, whose behaviour result interaction complex neurological sub-components. at low level resolution still – “macro-economic” layer – national economy. this comprise complex interaction financial sector wide economy – flow fund intermediate money owner borrowers. it akin 6 bi central bankers’ speech physiology human, whose behaviour result complex interaction among organs, complex sub-components. finally, low level resolution – “telescopic” layer – global economic financial system. this involve cross-border trade financial interaction countries, flow goods, service information increase volume velocities. it akin interaction within social network across world wide web. at least principle, individual layer could complex. these layer also likely interact. for example, likely strong interaction financial system macro-economy individual national financial system global financial system. this couple sub-systems add degree complexity system whole. let present stylise fact layers, microscopic telescopic, illustrate characteristic complex sub-component. i also present evidence interaction sub-systems, mean genuine macro-financial system systems. (a) complexity among individual firm there off-the-shelf measure organisational complexity, whether within bank generally, number proxy recently constructed. for example, basel committee recently devise range complexity metric world’s so-called sifis – systemically important financial institutions.7 so far, 30 institution globally designate financial stability board (fsb) sifis, across range countries. chart 3 look set four complexity proxy designate sifis 2006, year financial crisis broke: total balance sheet size; notional value derivative portfolio; number legal entity group; trade assets. they show country incorporation. in 2006, average sifi balance sheet $1.35 trillion – roughly annual gdp small g7 country. the large sifi balance sheet total $3.0 trillion. this many multiply large non-financial firm. it also cover on-balance sheet positions. turn balance sheet positions, derivative portfolio average sifi total $19 trillion notional term 2006.8 for large sifi, $60 trillion. this, too, many multiple large non-financial firm’s position. these massive sifi balance sheet were, turn, spread across large array distinct legal entity within group. in 2006, average sifi around 328 legal entity within group. the large almost 900 distinct legal entities. most large global sifis number legal entity run four figures. by comparison, world’s large non-financial firm le half number legal affiliate (carmassi herring (2014)). a final complexity metric proportion so-called trade assets. this diagnostic diversity bank’s business model – whether engage investment well commercial banking. some trade asset also complex hence difficult price trade – so-called level 2 3 assets. a chart 3 shows, average sifi trade book around quarter asset 2006. for largest, close around 50% assets. 7 see bcbs (2014). 8 notional exposure likely poor proxy underlie risk portfolio, provide indication scale gross derivative positions. bi central bankers’ speech 7 since crisis, little evidence complexity reversed. chart 4 update four metric use end-2013 data. the balance sheet average sifi shrunk. in fact, rise around $1.8 trillion end-2013. for large sifi, around $4.0 trillion. the pattern even strike balance sheet. for average sifi, derivative book rise 50% $30 trillion 2013. for largest, rise $75 trillion. on complexity metrics, number legal entity average sifis essentially unchanged compare 2006 2013. and despite significant rise risk weights, modest slimming sifi trade book 2013, average share asset go 22% 19%. an alternative, micro-economic, approach gauge organisational complexity look internal structures. for example, collinson jay (2012) use five-way classification complexity: governance; internal structures; staff capabilities; role responsibilities; corporate culture. they use evaluate world’s large 200 companies, include 26 banks. financial service rank sixth overall industry complexity grounds. within this, however, strike diversity performance, number bank stand high level complexity low performance. chart 5 plot banks’ complexity performance, base study simplicity consult 2012.9 it show invert u-shaped pattern. while modest degree bank complexity good performance, beyond threshold complexity benefit go reverse performance worsens. this u-shaped pattern consistent micro-economic theory. it suggest economy scale scope bank give way diseconomies beyond threshold. there empirical evidence suggest diseconomies scale may operate sifis, consistent “too complex manage” (davies tracey (2014)). take together, evidence suggest world’s sifis are, remain, highly complex entity right. (b) complexity within financial system a individual banks, perfect metric financial system complexity. but map topology wire financial sector reveal strength, direction complexity counterparty link between, interaction among, financial firms. a one example, chart 6 look interbank connection uk bank 2013.10 this suggest wire interbank network messy dense. the network’s epicentre small set large bank large number connection – “super-spreader” banks. there are, addition, large number peripheral bank connections. in words, interbank system property classic scale-free network. chart 7 look pattern interbank fund exposure among uk banks. it, too, suggest complex web scale-free properties. network property prone failure among super-spreader nodes. since likely entity expose “too complex manage” problems, topology harbour potential systemic vulnerability, type expose 2008. 9 “true cost complexity bank sector”, simplicity consult (2012). 10 it take langfield, liu ota (2014). exposure comprise unsecured loans, marketable securities, cd sell minus cd bought, security lend repo derivative exposures. 8 bi central bankers’ speech complex interaction confine bank sector. the non-bank (“shadow” banking) sector become increasingly important recent years. in us, estimate suggest broadly equivalent scale bank run-up crisis. at global level, non-bank intermediation currently estimate around $75 trillion, around half asset global bank system. because many entity sit outside regulatory perimeter, data exposure interaction thin ground. but work u map interaction suggest dense complex (pozsar et al (2010)). chart 8 present stylise map shadow bank sector interaction bank sector. these interaction highly complex multi-layered. (c) complexity macro-financial interaction the link interaction financial sector wide economy are, respects, even le well map shadow bank sector. they, too, evolve significantly recent decade scale complexity. a example evolution, chart 9 look representation flow fund various sector uk – companies, households, rest world government. it also show role financial sector intermediate flow fund ultimate asset-owners (shown top) liability-holders (shown bottom). the intermediation sector decompose bank “other” financial intermediary pension, hedge fund insurance companies. the bank england’s also shown. these balance sheet scale relative gdp two dates, 1978 2011. the change time scale pattern intermediation striking. in 1978, uk bank system dominate foreign banks. banks’ asset sum little 100% gdp. non-bank intermediaries, meanwhile, account little 50% gdp dominate traditional real-money investors, pension fund insurance companies. the bank england’s balance sheet mere 6% gdp. fast forward 2011, flow fund picture transformed. the balance sheet ultimate asset-owners/liability-holders rise around 200% gdp around 600% gdp – threefold rise. the scale pattern intermediation sector also transformed. the bank sector also rise substantially period. uk universal bank dominate landscape, account 80% total bank assets. they new “super-spreaders” uk financial sector. non-bank intermediation also see dramatic scaling-up balance sheets, rise sixfold 300% gdp. within this, growth particularly strong within non-traditional sector (such hedge fund unauthorised funds) among new type vehicle (such etf private equity funds). these new strain potential “super-spreader”. the bank england’s balance sheet also grow rapidly, rise 25% gdp, largely courtesy qe. overall, picture much larger, much diverse potentially considerably complex set channel intermediation past. of course, stylise map offer cursory indication true degree complexity individual interaction within sectors. (d) complexity global macro-financial interaction a final dimension network complexity global one. there dramatic rise scale global trade and, particular, capital market integration past decades. both high level several century and, probably, ever (chart 10). bi central bankers’ speech 9 for global trade, chart 11 compare trade flow across 70 country constitute around 80% world export two date – 1995 2013. the size node reflect importance country world trade thickness link size trade flows. it clear wire international trade system become considerably dense complex period, reflect deepen lengthen global value chain (oecd (2013), de backer miroudet (2014)). this highly interconnect complex set global supply chain potential propagate disturbance much virulently past, two recent event illustrate. the first correlate collapse world trade financial crisis. between 2008q1 2009q1, real world trade fell almost 15%. correlation regional import volume rise close unity height crisis (chart 12). the strength length global supply chain cause synchronous collapse trade (bems et al (2012)). the second japanese earthquake tsunami 2011. because japan play central role global supply chain producer high-value intermediate goods, cascade effect global production. for example, japanese car producer cease production, foreign affiliate unable compensate depend input japan (oecd (2013)). deepen global supply chain mean large number country potential “super-spreaders” global trade contagion. the story similar, even dramatic scale, come global banking. chart 13 plot network cross-border bank lend flow across wide range countries, 1980 2007. a trade, wire international bank network become significantly dense complex (minoiu reyes (2013)).11 and domestic bank networks, clear core-periphery pattern network, small number nodal “super-spreader” bank sector serve international lender periphery banks. the global financial crisis provide tell illustration susceptibility network weakening, failure, core bank sector. a core sector come stress, cause significant cascade global interbank contagion. cross-border inter-bank lend flow fell around 20% 2008q2 2010q2. the large cross-border bank – “super-spreaders” – appear play central role instigate propagate global contagion (hills hoggarth (2013)). (e) correlation among sub-systems another dimension gauge risk macro-financial system correlation layer system. for correlation individual bank financial system whole, one metric provide look common component within joint distribution bank equity prices. for example, first principal component uk bank equity price account around 70% overall movement bank equities. at time financial crisis, common component rise near 90%. these correlation high highly crisis-sensitive, suggest close link individual systemic bank risk. the picture similar look correlation development financial system wide economy. for example, pairwise correlation financial non-financial component uk equity price high, around 0.8–0.9. the picture similar move national international level: first principal component international equity price account around 80–90% variation. each 11 this analysis us bank international settlement bilateral locational statistics. this capture flow periphery countries, risk overstate importance core. see minoiu reyes (2013) information 10 bi central bankers’ speech correlation is, way, rather imperfect metric cross-system interaction. nonetheless, suggest interaction are, general, important strong. a final, indirect reduced-form, piece evidence complexity macro-financial system come look statistical distribution behaviour systems. for complex systems, physical, natural, biological social systems, statistical distribution know highly non-normal (newman (2005)). indeed, many system find power-law distributed, much fat tail would expect normal distribution. to extent statistical property evident macro-economic financial time-series data? chart 14 look statistical distribution gdp growth, credit growth, equity price rice prices, use long time-series cover several hundred year. these density transform that, underlie distribution normal, dot trace straight line. any deviation extremity evidence fat-tailed distribution. it clear chart 14 four series exhibit significant degree fat-tailedness, considerably normal distribution. this consistent economic financial systems, locally globally, exhibit complex system system properties. for example, four-standard deviation event – true catastrophe – would normal distribution expect occur roughly every 15,000 years. under estimate distribution economic financial systems, event would occur every 10 15 years. implication policy design so might mean design policy architecture? let mention three area clear progress make since crisis, may need period ahead manage effectively complex, macro-financial system systems: data, model policy design. (a) data monitor risk system system require data sub-systems, often high level granularity. often response crisis, effort make time improve data economic financial systems. for example, successive wave improvement statistic international bank flows, start 1970s. in response late crisis, renew effort make fill data gap improve degree disclosure bank balance sheet position (fsb (2012)). a one example, data banks’ cross-border asset liability distinguish bank non-banks. in practice, rich sectoral decomposition data often desirable understand interaction different part financial sector wide economy (hills hoggarth (2013), lane (2014)). for example, dollar fund crisis face european bank 2011/12 involve complex string cross-border financing. fund raise u money market fund round-tripped back u purchase asset-backed security european banks. when u money fund withdraw dollar funding, chain go reverse gear cause dollar fund problem. understand link cross-border finance chain impossible without detail sectoral data. that train. yet remain significant data constraint ability map macro-financial system system detail necessary capture accurately interaction within across sub-systems. even among world’s large banks, data bilateral exposure one another remain partial patchy, especially balance sheet position security holdings. that mean large part core international bank map remain, essentially, uncharted territory. bi central bankers’ speech 11 these data gap even acute move beyond bank system. large part non-bank sector remain shadow data perspective. for example, reliable measure aggregate and/or individual leverage, maturity foreign currency mismatch position non-bank intermediary – key vulnerability metric – thin ground. the fsb agenda fill data gaps. more broadly, flow fund data, within financial sector wide economy, domestically internationally, present partial. chart 15 take uk flow fund map show early colour code accord one measure data availability. there remain number key area improvement, particularly within non-banks part intermediation chain, well among companies, household externally. in response this, bank uk’s office national statistic (ons) recently initiate project improve uk’s flow fund data. although early stage, aim provide granular picture sectoral (“who-to-whom”) flows. once complete, enable interaction within financial real sector uk economy good track modelled. this pattern data gap mirror globally. global flow fund data beyond bank patchy. data flows, particular stocks, cross-border portfolio foreign direct investment often low quality lack timeliness. for example, official data suggest uk net external liability position around 20–30% gdp. but foreign direct investment stock value market (rather book) prices, switch net asset position around amount (bank england (2014)). derivative position net foreign currency position also imperfectly capture global flow fund data, particularly companies. for example, recent year many emerge market company borrow cheaply dollar-denominated instruments. but gauge scale borrowing, whether hedge either derivative dollar income receipts, real data challenge. this significant gap unhedged dollar borrow one potential fault-line international financial system present (bis (2014)). (b) model once necessary data place, natural next question best use understand dynamic macro-financial system systems. there number potentially fruitful, fledgling, avenue research currently pursue front. in make sense macro-financial system, would desirable quantitative framework understand evaluate interaction within financial system wide economy. pre-crisis, model close non-existent. indeed, many mainstream macro-economic model even contain well-defined financial sector, much le interaction within (roger vleck (2011)). the bank england early pioneer approach place financial sector centre-stage, so-called ramsi (risk assessment model systemic institutions) model (burrows et al (2012)). a stylise overview ramsi give chart 16. ramsi embody interaction element individual banks’ balance sheet (the micro-prudential layer), individual bank (the macro-prudential layer) financial system economy (the macro-economic layer). a example, ramsi embody interbank network allow counterparty network contagion propagate. it also contain behavioural model fund market banks’ liquidity position generate liquidity crisis externality (aikman et al (2009)). there also explicit behavioural link macro-economic variable bank balance sheet (through arrears, defaults, loss give default etc). these complex, non-linear 12 bi central bankers’ speech channel risk propagation mean probability distribution generate ramsi fat-tailed (chart 17). these ingredients, rich interaction within across bank bank economy, mean ramsi useful framework undertake top-down stress-testing. alongside bottom-up granular models, bank use ramsi concurrent stress-testing uk bank end last year. because use draw probability distribution bank balance sheet measures, liquidity solvency, time may enable probabilistic “fan charts” bank strength constructed. these would akin fan chart inflation output produce bank’s inflation report monetary policy purposes. in broadly similar spirit, great level granularity, agent-based model (abm) natural vehicle model behavioural interaction within across macro-financial system (farmer foley (2009)). there progress towards develop abms, particular since financial crisis. for example, crisis (complexity research initiative systemic instabilities) project consortium eu universities, private firm policymaking institution build large-scale calibrate model capture sectoral behaviour, include economy financial system.12 at national level, promise progress also make develop abm model house market. for example, geanakoplos et al (2012) develop regional model u house market, much good job aggregate macro-economic model match house market patterns, run-up to, following, financial crisis. a part new research agenda, bank england work currently institute new economic think (inet) oxford try develop abm model uk house market.13 a geanakoplos et al (2012), aim provide calibrated, granular model good capture dynamic house market. it could also, potentially, use help evaluate efficacy macro-prudential intervention market – example, policy alter mortgage loan-to-income loan-to-value limits. a third promise area research concern interaction macro-prudential macro-economic layer system – is, interplay macro-prudential monetary policy tools. this another priority area bank’s new research agenda. although policy distinct primary objectives, transmission channel likely closely interwoven, affect risk-taking economic activity. this add additional complexity set monetary macro-prudential policies. it possible explore complex interplay use simulation model comprise nominal financial frictions. both need accommodate role monetary policy (whose effectiveness rely primarily nominal frictions) macro-prudential policy (whose effectiveness rely principally financial frictions). a number model recently develop core ingredient use explore monetary macro-prudential policy interaction (smets (2013), paustian de paoli (2013)). chart 18 show result simulation model develop two colleague bank (aikman nelson (2014)). this, too, embody nominal financial frictions. on ax plot two measure stability – macro-economic stability (as proxied variability nominal gdp) x-axis, financial stability (as proxied variance 12 more detail available www.crisis-economics.eu. 13 for bank’s research agenda, please see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/documents/onebank/discussion.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 13 credit spreads) y-axis. historically estimate level two variables, normalise one, show point a chart 18. if allow monetary policy play active role stabilise business cycle, optimal policy rule weight output inflation deviation target, move economy point b. this unambiguously prefer point a, great stability financial system and, particular, wide economy. but could good still monetary policy assume explicit responsibility safeguard financial stability? if augment monetary policy rule take account financial stability factors, interest rate respond credit spreads, move point c. this benefit improve financial stability relative conventional monetary policy case. but come cost destabilise somewhat macro-economy. it unclear whether point c dominate b welfare sense. in words, monetary policy meet macro-economic macro-prudential objective involve trade-off. once add explicit macro-prudential instrument equation, however, trade-off disappears, least lessened. in particular, let’s add regulatory-set counter-cyclical capital buff banks, like part basel iii. use tandem optimal monetary policy, move economy point d. this involve great macro-economic financial stability alternatives. on face least, welfare-improving. although model use specific, policy lesson appear general one. have two instrument (monetary macro-prudential) lead improvement macro-financial stability. two policy hand beat one two policy objectives. this sense underscore importance tinbergen’s augment policy rule – many policy tool complex sub-systems – manage complex system systems. none model far consider global spill-overs, either trade financial channels. generally-speaking, dearth macro-economic model take seriously international spillover analytically-coherent fashion. even model behaviour over-ambitious short-term, may merit improve monitor global flow finance time, give importance stability economy financial systems. elsewhere, i liken creation “global weather map”. this could use track map source, scale nature cross-border capital flow close real-time (haldane (2012, 2014) imf (2013)). plot complex, rapidly-adapting web would natural precursor use address “what if” questions. what, example, would impact rise u interest rate international flow funds? the imf would natural guardian surveillance-cum-stress-testing machine. (c) policy design significant change make macro-financial policy architecture since crisis. in general, framework move close towards meet tinbergen’s rule many distinct policy tool complex layer macro-financial system. these framework equip tool assess address risk range resolution – microscopic, macroscopic telescopic. and gap hole pre-crisis policy architecture – macro-prudential layer – filled. the institutional architecture macro-financial policy also adapt since crisis good enable interaction policy layer addressed. in uk, micro-prudential, macro-prudential monetary policy arm policy attach single body, bank england. each arm separate policy committee task 14 bi central bankers’ speech set policy. but policy committee share input information meet jointly discus area intersect policy responsibility (bank england (2014)). take arm policy turn, high level resolution micro-prudential policy framework significantly revise number country since crisis. often, aim refocus microscope systemic, well firm-specific, risk face banks. for world’s large banks, significant extra cushion loss-absorbing capacity required, together change banks’ organisational structure make credibly resolvable. in countries, include uk us, large banks’ activity separate ring-fenced. these initiative ought, time, low degree complexity inter-connectivity entities, make le virulent super-spreaders financial contagion. a second area progress stress-testing. a major step forward take last year concurrent stress-testing bank across europe. this follow successful practice first adopt u 2009. concurrent stress-testing whole bank sector allow top-down bottom-up perspective bring bear assess individual firms’ risks. this open possibility take seriously complex behavioural interactions, within financial sector wide economy. for example, capital-deficient firm might withdraw fund cause wide liquidity pressure banks. or sequence capital-deficient bank might contract lend credit crunch, thereby damage wide economy feed back negatively banks’ portfolio (haldane (2009)). yet remain early day development stress-testing technologies. a system system perspective could useful enable stress-testing technology good capture system-wide risks. for example, interaction feedback channel could usefully build future stress-testing framework use central banks, include bank england, federal reserve ecb. at next level policy resolution, key area progress post-crisis period develop macro-prudential framework instrument necessary execute (imf (2013)). many country internationally macro-prudential framework place. and international case law efficacy different macro-prudential tool build rapidly (imf (2013)). nonetheless, much go understand calibrate impact macro-prudential tools. a well country case studies, likely draw model explore micro-economic interaction shape macro-economic phenomena. for example, bank recently begin use product sale database (psd) compile uk’s financial conduct authority (fca). this cover almost uk mortgage transaction since 2006, contain around 13 million transactions. this large micro database use understand dynamic uk house market help calibrate macro-prudential intervention shape it. for example, chart 19 show regional distribution loan make loan-to-income multiple excess 4.5 two date – 2009q1 2014q2. cool colour signify small proportion loans. a seen, discernible warm uk house market 2014, least high loan-to-income loans. at around time, bank england’s financial policy committee (fpc) make macro-prudential intervention, constrain 15% proportion mortgage loan-to-income multiple excess 4.5. this first time macro-prudential measure take uk, though number country cap mortgage loan-to-income loan-to-value multiple (imf (2013)). this not, however, step dark fpc. the calibration intervention draw explicitly micro-evidence contain psd database. this give clear bi central bankers’ speech 15 idea many household bank might affect intervention much. this macro-prudential policy calibrate micro-prudential constituents. although first step, clearly go use micro-level data calibrate impact macro-prudential tool lender borrower behaviour. turn global economic financial system, exist policy architecture may present deficient. some go argue nothing present much resemble global financial architecture (de larosiere (2014), haldane (2014)). despite crisis first truly global one, reform global financial architecture slow. there many dimension reform global financial architecture. these include appropriate role resourcing imf, reserve currency role dollar appropriate role so-called capital flow management policy modulate fluctuation global flow fund (imf (2012)). each widely discuss debate many decades. on issues, progress. for example, imf endorse use capital flow management policy situations, contrast position year ago. but one area progress strengthen international financial architecture much slower. this best deal common shock global safe risky yields. one strike feature past year extremely high correlation among asset price globally, particular among advance economies. this true “safe” rate return government asset “risky” rate return private asset (chart 20). in either case, correlation extremely high, hover around 0.9. this beg number questions, research policy. what root cause correlations? one possibility portfolio shift global asset managers, allocate portfolio asset-by-asset basis. if so, implication carry national monetary macro-prudential policymakers, seek steer safe risky rate respectively? do high global correlation strengthen case international co-ordination monetary macro-prudential policies? there may great scope coordinate macro-prudential tools. one way develop macro-prudential instrument operate asset-class basis, rather national basis. this would recognition asset characteristics, rather national characteristics, may key determinant portfolio choice asset price movements, perhaps reflect rise role global asset managers. there already international progress towards develop asset market specific macro-prudential tools, specifically context security finance transaction minimum collateral requirement agree internationally (fsb (2014)). but may scope widen deepen set financial instrument cover prudential requirements, give rich array internationally-oriented macro-prudential tools. these would good able lean global fluctuation wide set asset markets. conclusion this time different: never world suffer genuinely global financial crisis, every country planet fall cliff-edge time. this fall lay bare inadequacy pre-crisis understand complexity financial system interaction wide economy, locally particular globally. it demonstrate global macro-financial network complex adaptive system, complex system systems. the crisis also reveal gap inadequacy exist policy frameworks. many gap since filled. micro-prudential microscope lens refocused. macro-prudential macroscopes (re)invented. and global telescope 16 bi central bankers’ speech strengthen lengthened. institutional arrangement also adapted, good enable co-ordination micro, macro global arm policy. so far, good. clearly, however, remain unfinished business. the data necessary understand model macro-financial system system still patchy. the model necessary make behavioural sense complexity remain fledgling. and policy framework necessary defuse evolve risk still embryonic. more need do – research policy-wise – prevent next time same. reference

øystein olsen, governor norge bank (central bank norway), lunch host danske bank markets, new york city, 27 march 2015. * * * accompany slide find norge bank’s website: slide (pdf). it’s great pleasure new york city honour invite give lunch presentation today. a norge bank, week ago, publish late monetary policy report, economic outlook consideration behind interest rate decision naturally warrant attention speech today. first, however, i would like give background information economic policy framework norway, focus sovereign wealth fund – government pension fund global – fiscal rule norge bank’s foreign exchange transfer fund. norway small, open, natural resource-rich economy. about quarter gdp relate oil gas extraction, large share petroleum production exported. the oil gas industry play vital role strong growth economy past 40 years. when first oil bring surface 1971, gdp per caput norway low average western economy. the picture reverse since then. we gradually catch wealthy nations. measure gdp per capita, norway rank close top. even disregard oil sector’s contribution growth moment, norway’s mainland economy show relatively robust developments. the ripple effect activity continental shelf wide economy wide-ranging. a grow number firm target oil industry. a state-of-the-art oil service industry emerged. for many firms, contract norwegian continental shelf springboard new export markets. although norway’s oil age begin 40 year ago, past 15 year stand out. from end 1990s 2013, price north sea oil rise usd 10 usd 100 per barrel. high oil price profitable petroleum production industry accompany record-high oil investment recent years. increase spend petroleum revenue fiscal budget provide growth impetus domestic demand. employment remain high unemployment low many years, even financial crisis hit 2008. it make clear early stage norway’s oil gas resource belong norwegian people manage behalf. the tax system private state-owned oil company framework condition petroleum industry design bulk large resource rent generate industry would accrue norwegian state. we avoid make public sector budget dependent volatile income. this mainly achieve establish sovereign wealth fund fiscal rule impose constraint oil revenue spending. the norwegian parliament pass act relate fund 1990. under act, net budget surplus, include oil revenues, transfer fund, invest international markets. the policy guideline clarify 2001 introduction fiscal rule. under guidelines, government spend oil revenue – measure non-oil budget 2 bi central bankers’ speech deficit – limit expect real return fund – estimate 4 percent annually. the idea leave capital fund untouched, save future generations. the fiscal rule provide gradual phase oil revenues. over time, would expect real krone exchange rate appreciate result. however, due fund mechanism fiscal rule, actual spend decouple current petroleum revenues. this curb appreciation krone thus reduce fluctuation exchange rate. compare resource-based economies, real krone exchange rate remain relatively stable, especially period substantial increase oil price (cf. diagram). let elaborate transaction actually take place. all revenue sale oil gas originally foreign currency. the oil company convert foreign exchange revenue krone order pay tax dividend government. in addition tax dividend revenue kroner, government large revenue foreign currency ownership share petroleum field norwegian continental shelf.1 a long government revenue krone petroleum sector exceed annual petroleum revenue spend budget, government leave surplus kroner. this situation 2014. norge bank convert surplus foreign currency, turn transfer fund. the amount krone convert foreign exchange partly offset amount krone previously buy oil companies. consequently, operation impact real exchange rate. in 2015, government spend petroleum revenue budget estimate high revenue receive kroner. government petroleum revenue spend budget increase time, pace increase size fund. and recently, government’s net cash flow petroleum sector start decline. a consequence, norge bank move position sell surplus krone sell foreign currency order finance petroleum revenue spending. however, effect real exchange rate still determine amount petroleum revenue spend fiscal budget. it norge bank’s intention influence krone exchange rate foreign exchange transactions. accordingly, purchase distribute evenly year. at end month, norge bank announce size daily purchase sale krone come month, base estimate oil revenue fiscal spending. the amount interpret best estimate remain month year. the economic outlook let turn outlook norwegian economy. we leave behind u 15 golden years. the norwegian economy make use favourable tailwind seize opportunity offered. the side coin economy become increasingly dependent oil, thereby vulnerable change oil price petroleum revenues. and know, oil price fall nearly 50 percent since last summer. the vulnerability manifest several ways. a large share business sector labour market link petroleum sector norway countries. 1 revenue receive state’s direct financial interest petroleum sector (sdfi). bi central bankers’ speech 3 petroleum investment, long important driver growth norwegian economy, expect fall year ahead. the fall oil price recent month accelerate amplify announce decline activity level norwegian continental shelf. low oil price reduce oil company cash flow reduce profitability new investments. field development project underway affected, although limit extent. in addition, new project may postpone cancelled. low demand good service petroleum sector spillover effect mainland economy, dampen effect labour demand. the fact activity petroleum sector decline mean oil age come end. nearly half know oil gas reserve norwegian continental shelf yet extracted. and large new discovery make past years. nonetheless, norwegian economy must adapt considerably low demand oil sector. we dependent growth sector support growth economy. another challenge norway’s high labour costs. the cost level business sector increase sharply relative trade partners. to underpin necessary transition towards non-oil industries, cost level norway must bring closely line trade partners. a necessary adjustment cost level norway occur mean low wage growth norway country depreciation krone exchange rate. in norway, monetary policy gear towards keep inflation low stable. the operational target monetary policy consumer price inflation close 2.5 percent time. the inflation target provide economy nominal anchor. when inflation expectation firmly anchored, monetary policy serf first line defence economy turn down. over time, monetary policy influence inflation. monetary policy cannot take primary responsibility deliver necessary structural change norwegian economy. but monetary policy help facilitate necessary restructure process via exchange rate channel. a long confidence inflation remain low stable time, pronounce depreciation krone go hand hand low key policy rate. the krone depreciate markedly since last september 10 percent weak average first half 2014. development krone exchange rate must see context low oil price weak growth prospect norwegian economy. the depreciation krone underpin inflation soften impact low oil price norwegian economy. a see diagram weak krone boost competitiveness norwegian firm face competition abroad. at time, wage growth moderate extent. there prospect real wage growth year low nearly 20 years. with improve competitiveness, export firm good position maintain market shares. a growth pick abroad, demand norwegian good service may also increase. at time, petroleum-related exports, account quarter mainland exports, likely decrease due decline global offshore investment. it likely take time effect low oil price mainland economy become fully visible. so far, unemployment show slight increase. a flexible labour market appear curb rise unemployment. employment growth also remain firm, although increase mismatch number unemployed job vacancy point towards slack labour market. in region sector closely link petroleum sector, unemployment increased. 4 bi central bankers’ speech weak growth prospect may reduce willingness mainland firm invest. on hand, improve competitiveness provide basis expand capacity sectors. in addition, house investment likely support overall investment activity. house price inflation remain high. growth household consumption moderate recent year household save reach high level, spite low interest rates. the pension reform uncertainty surround economic development probably induce household increase saving. overall, expect growth private consumption remain moderate ahead save ratio remain high level. debt-to-income ratio norwegian household high, reflect long period rapidly rise house prices. low interest rate loan household expect fuel house price inflation, prospect weak income growth somewhat high unemployment may dampen impact ahead. for time, base experience recent financial crisis, financial stability consideration extent influence monetary policy. put words: “leaning wind”. a small open economy, norway highly influence economic development abroad. many advance economy experience difficult time since global economy severely hit financial crisis. global growth expect pick up. the fall oil price positive factor world economy. but picture mixed. in us, recovery seem firm footing. development uk sweden, two norway’s major export markets, also positive, although inflation remain challenge. the situation euro area appear problematic. a large portion workforce unemployed production equipment stand idle. inflation worryingly low. through winter, number central bank undertake unconventional monetary policy easing, market expectation regard key rate trade partner country fall further. low interest rate abroad influence krone thereby prospect inflation, contribute low interest rate also norway. in december last year, norge bank cut key policy rate 0.25 percentage point 1.25 percent. in assessment, norge bank give weight weaken growth outlook norwegian economy attach importance counter risk pronounce downturn due low oil prices. last week, norge bank present late monetary policy report update projection development norwegian economy new assessment orientation monetary policy. development norwegian economy winter broadly line expectations. inflation remain close 2.5 percent unemployment remain stable. so far, effect fall oil price real economy relatively small. however, outlook norwegian economy weaken somewhat. oil price continue fall activity petroleum industry appear decline previously assumed. wage growth 2014 low project prospect wage growth also low ahead project earlier. this lead low inflation ahead. at time, house price continue rise rapidly. this may increase household vulnerability may trigger amplify economic downturn ahead. the executive board decide keep key policy rate unchanged 1.25 percent. if development economy ahead prove broadly projected, prospect key policy rate lowered. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the analysis report suggest key policy rate approximately 1 percent come years, follow gradual increase. the analysis suggest inflation increase somewhat come quarter edge lie slightly 2 percent late projection period. capacity utilisation mainland economy project decline further, return normal level. let summarise. after global financial crisis, norwegian economy quickly rebounded, support robust public finance strong growth petroleum sector. since last summer, oil price fallen. activity petroleum sector probably pass peak. so far, impact real economy modest. at time, norwegian economy face new challenges. vulnerability establish golden year must addressed. from unique economic position, norway head period restructuring. norway’s start point favourable. inflation well anchor krone function stabiliser. in addition, able transform oil grind financial wealth period oil price high. we significant fiscal leeway. but condition force necessary growth economy long run bring line countries. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stanley fischer: the importance nonbank financial sector speech mr stanley fischer, vice chair board governor federal reserve system, “debt financial stability – regulatory challenges” conference, organize bundesbank german ministry finance, frankfurt main, 27 march 2015. * * * it pleasure here. my subject important role nonbank financial sector play unite state financial system. a know, euro area financial system differ u.s. system term relative size role play bank compare nonbank financial institutions. accord recent report international monetary fund, bank euro area account roughly 75 percent total lend bank nonbanks part shadow bank system, whereas unite states, bank account half measure total lend 2013.1 the relatively large role play nonbank financial institution unite state bring economic benefit risk financial stability – risk could see clearly global financial crisis. the nonbank sector unite state always large. the u.s. financial system change significantly recent decades, nonbanks whole gain share also become interlink banks. this evolution produce material benefits: increase market liquidity, great diversity fund sources, – often claim – efficient allocation risk among investors. however, evolution also increase threat stability overall financial system, demonstrate recent financial crisis. to promote financial stability, tool monitoring, regulation, crisis management evolve recent years, need continue evolve year come. today i describe nonbank intermediation unite state changed, regulation place, reform way address risk financial stability associate growth nonbank sector. the lesson learn u.s. nonbank financial sector may interest regulator country promote react change composition finance – away bank toward nonbanks market-based intermediation. the role nonbank financial intermediation u.s. financial system i apologize start remind u material know. first, provision credit nonfinancial business household critical well-functioning economy. indeed, ben bernanke’s research great depression come conclusion collapse credit growth, rather slow growth money supply, primarily responsible financial crisis 1930s. second, basic business model bank straightforward: bank take deposit customer invest proceed economy via loan businesses, households, governments. therefore, bank’s balance sheet typically shorter-term, highly liquid deposit liability side longer-term, illiquid loan asset side. this maturity transformation make bank vulnerable runs. in recognition 1 note nonbank financial institution include international monetary fund definition shadow banks. in particular, insurance company pension fund excluded. see international monetary fund (2014), global financial stability report: risk taking, liquidity, shadow bank – curb excess promote growth (pdf) (washington: imf, october) p. 67. 2 bi central bankers’ speech vulnerability, bank deposit become insure lender last resort function extend deal bank runs. third, nonbank financial institution also act intermediaries. their importance lender increase dramatically past 35 years. data financial account unite state indicate 1980, bank account 60 percent total credit market asset hold domestic financial sector, nonbanks hold 40 percent.2, 3 certain nonbank financial institution long important credit providers; example, 1980, life insurance company vital corporate bond commercial real estate markets, account one-third debt outstanding two market combined. while insurance company remain important, type nonbank financial institutions, g (government-sponsored enterprises, primarily fannie mae freddie mac) mutual funds, rise prominence next decades, total credit market lend nonbanks greatly outpace lend bank 1980s 1990s. by late 1990s, nonbanks hold around two-thirds total credit market asset hold bank nonbanks. their share stay relatively stable since then. the nonbank financial system include diverse group entity insurance companies, finance companies, government-sponsored enterprises, hedge funds, security broke dealers, issuer asset-backed securities, mutual funds, money market funds. they provide credit market – example, purchase commercial paper bond – extend loan directly business households. these financial institution evolve alongside banks, activity many respect intertwine banks. indeed, every activity conduct bank – exception take government-insured deposit – nonbank financial institution likely conduct similar activity. in many cases, nonbanks engage maturity liquidity transformation levered, vulnerability similar banks, lack benefit access lender last resort. while bank may central payment system, nonbanks also involved. moreover, bank nonbanks interconnect many way – example, derivatives, line credit, service provide bank nonbanks – many market depend bank act dealer provide services. in addition, many nonbanks own bank hold companies, may provide capital liquidity guarantee nonbank subsidiaries. not surprisingly, growth nonbank sector tend increase complexity financial system. when bank provide loan directly household businesses, chain intermediation relatively short simple. with growth nonbank lending, intermediation chain lengthened, often involve bank nonbank 2 credit market asset include commercial paper, treasury securities, agency gse-backed securities, municipal securities, corporate foreign bonds, consumer credit, mortgages, type loan (issued depository institutions) well loan advances. bank nonbanks hold $37.9 trillion credit market asset 2014, nonbanks hold $25.1 trillion bank hold $12.8 trillion. for information, see board governor federal reserve system (2015), statistical release z.1, “financial account unite states“ (march 12). 3 the domestic financial sector define domestic bank nonbank financial institutions, exclude monetary authority. bank include u.s.-chartered depository institutions, foreign bank office unite states, bank u.s.-affiliated areas, credit unions, hold companies. nonbanks include property casualty insurance companies, life insurance companies, private pension funds, federal government retirement funds, state local government retirement funds, money market mutual funds, mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, government sponsor enterprise (gse), agency- gse-backed mortgage pools, issuer asset-backed securities, finance companies, real estate investment trusts, security broke dealers, fund corporations. bi central bankers’ speech 3 financial institutions. for example, old days, bank would originate mortgage hold portfolio. today, bank might originate mortgage, instead hold loan balance sheet, could securitize – effect, sell – result security might purchase help short-term fund provide money market mutual fund. and process might end there: next mortgage-backed security might sell repackaged several new securities, on. in examples, number institution might involve provision single mortgage credit easily go one (the originate bank) least five more. and long chain create additional point vulnerability financial system. nonbanks also increase amount maturity transformation conduct financial system without stability-enhancing backstop offer banks. although nonbanks eligible obtain advance federal home loan bank system, nonbanks back federal deposit insurance, direct access lender last resort stem run short-term liabilities. a result, fund dry rapidly counterparties begin believe nonbank financial distress. the failure nonbank financial institution could directly reduce availability credit could cause fire sale asset lead impair market functioning. in addition, many nonbanks connect banks, shock nonbank sector could turn threaten stability overall bank system – happen unfold global financial crisis. nonbanks start global financial crisis before discuss role non-banks global financial crisis, let briefly mention previous episode involve non-bank – failure long-term capital management (ltcm). the new york fed, leadership president william mcdonough, deal successfully ltcm problem. however episode scary warn problem could arise nonbank financial system spread wider. now global financial crisis: although many dimension financial crisis, poor performance subprime mortgage one triggers. the fact loss relatively small part mortgage market quickly spread rest financial system illustrate complex interconnection among bank nonbanks amplify shock significant unanticipated ways. some first crack nonbank sector appear april 2007, new century financial corporation, one point second-biggest subprime mortgage lender, file bankruptcy creditor pull back fear losses.4 a month later, subprime asset fall value, money market investor refuse roll asset-backed commercial paper fund many subprime assets. with market shrink dramatically, bank sector leave hook support entity bank sponsor provide form credit liquidity support. around time, bear stearns, one five large investment banks, liquidate two hedge fund invest mortgage-based securities, include collateralize debt obligations, another link chain transactions. in march 2008, creditor stop fund bear stearns, force asset sale put additional downward pressure asset prices. by dramatic month september 2008, chain interconnection help spread financial pain, broad range firm catch financial maelstrom. 4 new century financial corporation first failure link subprime crisis, one first large failures. for example, ownit mortgage solutions, california-based home lender partly own merrill lynch & co., fail december 2006. 4 bi central bankers’ speech fannie mae freddie mac enter conservatorship. lehman brother fail creditor run bear stearns. american international group, aig, bail primarily inability post enough collateral cover liability credit protection sell many entity (including lehman) lose fund security lend market. the reserve primary fund, money market mutual fund, “broke buck” result hold lehman securities. bank immune financial market stress period, far le involve unfold crisis nonbanks – phenomenon highlight importance nonbank sector vulnerability financial system distress. when nonbanks pull back, part system suffered. when nonbanks failed, part system failed. regulatory reform implement wake financial crisis a crisis deep global financial crisis bind produce widespread regulatory changes. it clearly necessary strengthen bank system good analyze understand importance link bank sector nonbank financial sector. with respect nonbank financial sector, clear need great transparency, le leverage, stable form liquidity transformation. one important change bank sector adoption macroprudential perspective supervision regulation.5 central banker bank supervisor unite state regulate supervise large complex bank standalone entities, also consideration action could affect firm activity highly connect financial system. within federal reserve, tangible manifestation macroprudential approach liscc – large institution supervision coordinate committee – create specifically coordinate supervision large bank systemically important institutions.6 other change bank system unite state include tight basel iii capital liquidity requirements, heighten prudential standard large bank firms, stress tests. account standard prudential regulation also change require bank recognize link nonbank entities, direct connection provision back-up support. heighten prudential standard require large interconnect bank meet capital surcharge strict risk-management standard banks. stress test evaluate banks’ ability remain solvent liquid severe macroeconomic stress incentivized good risk-management information system within banks. a variety reform help address risk nonbank sector well. i touch briefly three reforms. first, unite state unusually large number independent financial sector regulatory bodies. there accordingly especially great need efficient cooperation coordination among various regulator collectively oversee financial system. in response need, dodd frank act create 5 there appear two mean word “macroprudential.” at first, refer focus systemic interaction within financial system. it sense talk point. the second mean almost opposite: it relate regulatory monetary policy measure focus aspect financial system whose behavior give cause concern. 6 the large firm whose supervision coordinate large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc) american international group, inc.; bank america corporation; the bank new york mellon corporation; barclays plc; citigroup inc.; credit suisse group ag; deutsche bank ag; general electric capital corporation; the goldman sachs group, inc.; jp morgan chase & co.; metlife, inc.; morgan stanley; prudential financial, inc.; state street corporation; ubs ag; well fargo & company. for information, see liscc webpage board’s website. bi central bankers’ speech 5 financial stability oversight council (fsoc) help identify emerge risk vulnerability financial stability. the council’s annual report financial stability highlight risk vulnerability entire financial system reflect council’s diverse nature: only 3 10 vote member council bank sector supervisors, remainder supervise regulatory authority relate credit unions, broker-dealers, asset managers, derivative market participants. among decisions, fsoc designate four u.s. nonbank financial institution systemically important financial institutions, make subject consolidate supervision federal reserve board.7 in addition, dodd frank act mandate establishment office financial research order help promote financial stability measurement analysis risks, conduct essential research, collection standardization financial data. a second nonbank reform security exchange commission’s (sec) adoption new rule money market mutual funds. specifically, sec require prime money market fund sell institutional investor publish float net asset value restrict withdrawal system gate fees. these rules, yet untested, design reduce likelihood run prime money market funds. the third nonbank reform i want highlight relate securitization, i mention early one way part financial system become interconnected. an important rule, finalize late last year, require securitizers asset retain least 5 percent credit risk asset collateralize securities.8 with “skin game,” incentive cut corner extend loan reduced, entire chain create asset securitized stronger. transparency also enhance strong disclosure requirement securitizations. at stage recovery, sign reduce nonbank financial sector vulnerabilities. leverage quite low part sector appear moderate overall. leverage hedge funds, difficult measure, exception appear aggregate trend upward recent years. market-level information short-term wholesale fund – commercial paper repurchase agreement – indicate subdue activity level fell dramatically crisis. while issuance securitizations pick up, level remain moderate. the available data paint picture nonbank sector generally reduce vulnerability type shock saw crisis. however, nonbank sector evolve response new regulations, change investor preferences, multitude factor always influence financial system. for example, open-end mutual fund hold great share debt, derivative 7 the four nonbank institution designate fsoc metlife, inc.; american international group, inc.; general electric capital corporation, inc.; prudential financial, inc. for information access fsoc annual report, see fsoc’s webpage u.s. treasury’s website. 8 in october 2014, six federal agency – board governor federal reserve system, department house urban development, federal deposit insurance corporation, federal house finance agency, office comptroller currency, security exchange commission – approve final rule require sponsor securitization transaction retain risk transactions. the final rule generally require sponsor asset-backed security (abs) retain le five percent credit risk asset collateralize ab issuance. a require dodd-frank act, final rule define “qualified residential mortgage” (qrm) exempt securitizations qrms risk retention requirement. the final rule align qrm definition qualify mortgage define consumer financial protection bureau. the final rule also require retention securitizations commercial loans, commercial mortgages, automobile loan meet specific standard high quality underwriting. for information, see press release board’s website. 6 bi central bankers’ speech clear central counterparties. these development may ultimately prove stability enhancing, system evolves, must remain attentive possibility change may destabilizing. more need be do to say nonbank sector today appear le vulnerable global financial crisis, say authority unite state tame nonbank sector. indeed, progress substantial, area continue work remain, i briefly highlight three them. let start short-term wholesale fund markets. while improvement plumb money markets, many nonbank financial firms, include hedge fund broker-dealers, continue rely secure short-term fund finance activities, many involve longer-term illiquid assets. this maturity transformation remain key vulnerability. further, many firm rely maturity transformation highly lever thus vulnerable threat solvency. the propose international framework develop financial stability board margin security finance transaction may important tool limit pro-cyclicality sharp deleveraging occur markets. second, generally, need alert change trend financial system may pose risk financial stability, particularly stem area nonbank sector subject prudential supervision. for example, asset management industry grow evolve recent years. mutual fund exchange-traded fund track return index relatively illiquid asset mushroom size. example include fund track return leverage loans, credit default swaps, le liquid assets. these fund offer daily even intraday liquidity investor hold asset hard sell immediately, thus make fund vulnerable liquidity risk. recently, fsoc issue notice seek comment product activity asset management industry. third, also area nonbank financial system limit view. while data hedge fund improved, still need get complete picture scope size hedge fund activities. data coverage vast derivative market could also improved. the paucity information area limit ability supervisor regulator work effectively toward stability financial institution financial system. for example, outside bank system, limit information leverage maturity transformation rather precise estimate type nonbank entities. conclusion to conclude, u.s. financial system change great deal past several decades. one important change rapid growth nonbank sector. many reform adopt bank nonbank financial institutions. but regulation cat mouse game. regulator need respond exist regulatory gap keep pace changes. we hope succeed so. but know never able identify advance threat stability there, therefore critical maintain strengthen robustness financial institutions, financial system whole. bi central bankers’ speech 1 salvatore rossi: knowledge, innovation relaunching economy speech (lectio magistralis) mr salvatore

central bankers’ speech the global financial crisis 2007–08, follow european sovereign debt crisis 2010–11, inflict far great damage italy’s economy main advance countries. “why?” must ask ourselves. the first point make aggregate data hide significant disparities. the difference firm household increased. italy’s productive system, take include industry non-financial market services, distribute lopsided fashion along line determine size.3 the 25,000 firm locate 50-employee line produce almost half total value add sector consider use almost half payroll employees: 5 million worker total 11 million. some 4.3 million small firm employ, addition around 6 million permanent staff, 4 million self-employed workers, owner businesses. thus, per caput value add – say, productivity – low among small firms. labour cost also lower, much narrow gap, small firm generally le competitive medium-to-large ones. a expected, almost manufacture export medium-to-large firms. the size aspect also key shape investment decisions. large large firm continue increase stock capital recession years. many small firms, hand, stop investing, except replacement asset “survival”. then, last two years, numerous medium-size export firm profitable liquid also put investment plan hold global domestic economic outlook become clearer. view whole, contraction consumption seven year atypical respect past negative phase economic cycle. normally, one would expect consumer try maintain exist standard live recession despite drop disposable income, assume temporary. this time opposite happened: people tighten belt drop income warranted. thus, assume drop permanent, indeed would continue worsen, judge wise increase precautionary savings.4 do italian household take line? no, split them, time divide line generational. live standards, term quantity consume decision consume, fell sharply among young households, whose head unemployed: young payroll worker suffer widespread precariousness jobs, self-employed, especially head small micro businesses, use income solve firm’s problems. instead, high income brackets, include young households, increase spend luxury goods.5 get start move forward – be damage do seven years’ war permanent? well, certainly slip way far economic condition concern cannot get back lost. but make new start, albeit begin low position one occupy seven year ago. we might

london, unite kingdom, 26 march 2015. * * * i would like thank don coletti, stephen murchison, eric santor, scott kinnear jing yang help prepare speech. introduction i happy city opportunity speak afternoon. you feel pulse global financial system here, feel bite like irregular heartbeat me. the recovery great recession long, drawn-out affair, country emerge fast others. long-term interest rate extremely low, well central banks’ inflation targets. financial market volatility go across board, economy policy diverge prospect policy normalization become real. today, i would like consider mean central bank credibility, something care about. do low long-term interest rate recent increase financial market volatility represent erosion central bank credibility? it probably won’t come surprise i would say no. central bank job challenge setting. in time today, i talk learn low interest rate increase financial market volatility, well expect go process normalize monetary policy. long-term interest rate credibility let’s begin look extremely low borrow cost see many economies. consider, example, return one would receive 10-year bond issue g-7 government hold matured. investor would accept annual return would central bank’s inflation target – cases, well below. what tell u investor will receive low returns? central bank policy framework may differ, concept inflation control heart monetary policy economies. be low yield indication investor think unable bring inflation back target? to help answer question, let’s look canadian data. in recent paper, bank canada economist bruno feunou jean-sébastien fontaine use term structure model decompose yield 10-year government canada bond three components: long-term inflation expectations, expectation real short-term interest rate term premium. our analysis show canadian long-term inflation expectation stay quite close 2 per cent target since onset financial crisis. this message corroborate method measure longer-term inflation expectations. these include survey professional forecaster break-even inflation rate base compare nominal real return bonds. let pause stress point. why inflation expectation important? it’s well-anchored expectation help promote stability inflation output well financial system. solid inflation expectation also give central bank leeway respond temporary shocks, change energy price movement exchange rate. 2 bi central bankers’ speech evidence show that, part, central bank well keep expectation anchor challenge environment. measure way, clear credibility intact. but won’t take false comfort. vigilance required, long-term expectation shift away target, difficult re-anchor them. so, understand long-term interest rate low, need look two component – expectation real short-term interest rates, term premium. these component account drop long-term bond yield see since crisis. this relevant topic component also heavily influence central bank work meet inflation goal aftermath crisis. let make four point here. first, expectation real short-term interest rate depend level real neutral rate interest – rate generate enough save finance investment long run. the bank canada’s senior deputy governor, carolyn wilkins, give speech last year outline expect see low real neutral interest rate globally. the reason include slow labour force growth productivity growth develop economies, suggest drop demand investment, strong supply save many emerge economies. so must start think equilibrium interest rate low start point. second, top structural factors, we’ve see central bank react financial crisis subsequent great recession aggressively low policy rates. several central banks, include bank canada, also find constrain effective low bind interest rates. by issue forward guidance various forms, able reduce expectation future level policy rate. this add pressure expectation real short-term rates. third, central bank action forward guidance serve reduce uncertainty short-term policy interest rates, thus reduce term premium. fourth, quantitative ease program employ central bank include purchase long-dated bonds, reduce yield bonds. there strong evidence purchase even pull yield market quantitative easing, canada. to sum up, good reason long-term interest rate unusually low, de-anchoring inflation expectation central driver. rather, low long-term interest rate reflect combination decline neutral rate interest action take central bank foster strong growth pursuit inflation targets. ultimately, inflation expectations, inflation outcome support them, central bank’s performance judged. financial market volatility credibility but would judge central bank’s credibility wide range criteria, include level financial market volatility. in recent months, measure volatility rise wide variety asset class across number countries, u.s. treasuries, exchange rates, standard & poor’s 500, give examples. there many factor contribute increase, i won’t try list all. but i mention four. first, force act global economy powerful affect many economy differently. the post-crisis headwind growth, include widespread deleveraging linger uncertainty future, prove highly persistent. furthermore, sharp drop oil price significant effect, positive economy negative others. this shock surprise everyone, fact large happen quickly mean many u work hard fully grasp implications. bi central bankers’ speech 3 several central bank around world, include bank canada, react environment policy announcement weren’t fully anticipate investors. second, force lead divergence monetary policy path among big three central banks. the european central bank bank japan implement quantitative ease federal reserve begin process normalize policy. this divergence naturally lead significant adjustment outlook interest rate currencies, well high volatility bond foreign exchange markets. a third contributor financial market volatility relate global regulatory reform. the basel iii reform clearly make global financial system safer, job one. but also reduce incentive bank dealer hold inventory, act market-makers provide shock-absorber function time volatility high. fourth, financial market volatility compress recent year one-sided nature economic outlook. with many economy operate excess capacity, economic growth remain weak deflation real threat economies, interest rate expect stay low long time. this expectation reinforce forward guidance unconventional policy central banks. but expectation start shift. the global recovery, although uneven fragile, progressing, approach transition phase – take first step path toward normalization, will. eventually, global headwind dissipate central bank able transition away unconventional policy return conventional way conduct monetary policy. this mean return two-sided risks, interest rate could rise fall depend economy evolve. during transition toward normal, financial volatility expected. to me, seem legitimate reason expect high financial market volatility today. and volatility we’re see abnormally high? no. while market volatility rise recently, do historically low levels. it begin return close historical averages, abnormal levels. so, increase volatility actually negative development? no. above all, volatility relate unexpected economic development central bank necessarily respond order fulfill mandates. when shock economy occur, whether positive negative, high financial market volatility natural consequence, integral part economy’s equilibration process. such financial volatility neither inherently bad good. and reflect emerge possibility one-sided outlook experience several year finally become balanced, unambiguously good news. get back normal still, begin work process get back normal, question remains: explicit forward guidance suppress financial market volatility, keep use it? in context, i mean forward guidance explicit statement around future path interest rates. central bank inevitably talk future, statement construe form guidance markets. all form uses, right context. but i reserve term “forward guidance” mean specific comments, conditional commitments, around interest rates. there’s absolutely question forward guidance valuable part central bank tool kit. it clearly helpful canada elsewhere. but i say paper publish last year, bank canada believe statement explicitly guide 4 bi central bankers’ speech market expectation future path interest rate best reserve extraordinary times, policy rate effective low bound, period market stress. keep forward guidance reserve ensure great impact deployed. otherwise, become addictive lose impact – short, forward guidance free lunch, come costs. let elaborate stress point i make paper. forward guidance work take potential action central bank table. a commitment raise interest rate give period, certain economic condition met, flatten yield curve add stimulus economy. but so, commitment create skew bet investors. volatility falls, time being, market participant naturally position around bet, often use significant leverage so. so, happen circumstance change, inevitably do? what happen investor start consider possibility guidance change? the position stack around central bank’s guidance unwind, suppress volatility suddenly resurface financial markets, often level surpass historical averages. that’s pay price forward guidance. to sure, policy rate effective low bound, benefit forward guidance easily outweigh costs. at times, cost loom larger. indeed, normal times, economic financial risk clearly two-way, basic law economics work. volatility happens. it force nature. economist call underlie volatility “shocks” – unexplained shift consumer demand business behaviour, oil-price shocks, shock foreign economies, and, yes, financial market shocks. this volatility must go somewhere economy. central bank target inflation, mean stabilize inflation economic growth, interest rates. pursue mandate mean financial market carry natural volatility arises. to make point extreme form, consider hypothetical, all-seeing central bank would behave. that central bank would anticipate shock economy move interest rate offset them, inflation would always stay right target. look data afterward, might think interest rate financial market volatility unnecessary, inflation target whole time. in words, perfect policy make might look silly, simply people cannot see underlie shock – financial market volatility would natural consequence central bank’s effort achieve mandate. of course, haven’t normal time quite while. we take first tentative step toward normalization, road won’t always smooth, recent experience canada illustrates. late last year, saw encourage sign economic recovery broadening. strong export start reflect great business investment. however, approach january decision interest rates, consider unexpected plunge global oil prices. give importance oil economy, shock represent significant downside risk project inflation profile. it also pose risk financial stability reduction income implied. because low oil price mean low canadian income, shock would worsen debt-to-income ratio canadian households, even new borrow occurred. we think january would best act sooner rather later, give magnitude shock immediacy likely effects. indeed, oil price still falling, level assumption build forecast. accordingly, take insurance form 25-basis-point cut interest rates. the reaction cut across yield curve exchange rate would help cushion blow economy oil-price decline, bring u back sooner full capacity sustainable 2 per cent inflation. it would also help mitigate rise debt-to-income ratio reduce drop income, although debt level could rise margin. bi central bankers’ speech 5 we know financial market would surprise move january, generally prefer avoid surprises. but necessary fulfill inflation-targeting mandate. over follow weeks, saw inflation decline expected, output expand line projection. we saw financial condition ease, oil price stabilize range reasonably close january projection. this make u feel increasingly comfortable amount insurance already take out, lead decision keep rate unchanged early month. the negative effect low oil price begin appear; positive take long emerge. so need watch compete force play economy, january rate cut buy u time monitor situation evolves. some characterize move “data dependency.” i say i find bite strange. data always crucial determine economy progressing. even extraordinary times, central bank depend data help evaluate economy perform relative expectations. a economy gradually get back normal, continue speak business leader get perspectives. we continue watch data closely, always do, see number evolve relative forecasts. and look market participant keep watch data, form opinion mean. our communication focus explain expect economy unfold transparent risk central bank weighing. all else equal, help reduce chance surprise markets. still, normal circumstances, it’s natural would volatility economic surprise occur. but, think best volatility reflect price informed, well-functioning financial markets, rather artificially suppress forward guidance. conclusion allow conclude. a seen, well-anchored inflation expectation reflect unwavering pursuit inflation goals. they show market participant continue believe commitment ability return inflation target. unconventional monetary policy play key role, canada elsewhere, promote growth help meet inflation goals. a global economy shake great recession, era unconventional policy come end, return ultra-low level financial market volatility unlikely. bout increase volatility expect guidance-influenced position unwind market react shocks. a go normalization process, represent natural reaction financial market economic uncertainty return normal trade environment – erosion central bank credibility. the bank canada continue pursue fulfill inflation-targeting mandate. we continue follow policy necessary ensure timely return inflation target mindful financial stability considerations. this process take place uncertain world shock happen daily, behaviour shift repeatedly, analytical tool model offer rule thumb. in sense, monetary policy imprecise business – le like engineer like risk management. ultimately, credibility hinge well meet mandate extend period time. i’m confident continue get job done. bi central bankers’ speech 1 s s mundra: banker-borrower

“upbeat”. what happen euro area economy? after two recessions, first 2009 another 2010–2011 well abort recovery, stabilisation economic condition course 2013 improvement early 2014, late spring see slowdown already weak recovery. that’s decide number measure june september/october, so-called credit ease package. then, november, saw inflation remain weak and, spite measure taken, inflation expectation become seriously destabilised. we flag risk trap 1%/1% economy: 1% inflation, 1% growth. this would create vicious circle: everybody revise inflation growth expectation downwards would le investment debt overhang. that decide take measure january. in spite favourable condition create oil price, high risk benefit would save full effect positive supply shock would doubt. we always say low oil price ambiguous effect: positive, energy cheaper, negative reinforce deflationary behaviour economic agents. in january also think take measure sign turn point would give boost economy. we believe moment would put u back onto growth trajectory, reduce risk de-anchoring inflationary expectations. it’s combination circumstance hope help support economic recovery: low price oil, good financial condition include currency, neutral fiscal policy, also benefit structural reform countries. these effect visible ireland, spain portugal, – although painful – reform create basis solid recovery. you fairly big jump projection growth, 0.5% thereabouts 2015 2016, surprise people market also expect inflation pick substantially 2015 2016, go 0% 1.5%, 1.8% 2017. some regard optimistic. the pickup headline inflation largely due base effect, namely fact impact annual inflation drop price fuel good influence price oil disappear late year. the gradual increase price oil market expect see projection horizon form part assumption also give support headline inflation projections. the relevant question core inflation take price food energy out: 0.7%. it get close 2% 2017, converge headline inflation. the first element increase core inflation pass-through exchange rate, important impact. the second source indirect effect oil prices, instance transportation costs. then close output gap, might lead firm regain price power. most analyst discuss assumption close output gap end 2017. some people argue output gap cannot close high unemployment. but labour market tight spite massive unemployment observe unemployment structural nature. it’s difficult say today, think somewhat high wage increase 2017, spite still high jobless rate, 2 bi central bankers’ speech expect structural component unemployment remain large 2017. but key assumption give support project inflation vigorous pickup wage cost – fact go remain moderate – rather firm regain price power. in last year producer price negative. profit firm pressure volume also prices. central bank normally tend look oil prices. why act? a i said, uneasiness serious risk de-anchoring inflation expectations. maintain price stability core mandate ecb. in 2003 ecb announce that, order avoid risk deflation, inflation close enough 2% medium term. if ecb deliver pledge, point, create problem credibility. if risk increasing, give signal ready necessary counter it, give mandate. in january conclude confront risk fall deflation. the price protection deflation jumped. these dynamic reverse take forceful action. the switch projection reflect this: negative dynamics, people pessimistic long run. we try invert dynamic strong signal time favourable conditions. now, number people, include quite member govern council, argue condition improve anyway, oil price temporary phenomenon, quantitative ease (qe) wasn’t really justified. let clarify two points. first, large majority govern council. we try overly condition question risk-sharing. we make purely monetary policy decision, separate question fiscal policy back door. what important central bank signal willingness ability act, use instrument available. the discussion “wait see” fair one, collective judgement govern council time act. second, see projection – indeed give u grind comfort – robust recovery way – conditional full implementation announce january. where see risks, qe start seem strong impact, especially markets. the major risk risk complacency. take italy, example: yield 10-year government debt post-war lows, credit condition improve fast, fast pace euro area. it clear additional, substantial amount monetary accommodation bring lot relief economy. but productivity italy stop grow back mid-1990s, bad performer among large oecd countries, long crisis, italy already three recessions. it’s still challenge situation. the italian economy, already debilitate long-standing structural weaknesses, go accelerate downward trend underperform stress economies, ireland spain. this start understand see structural reforms. but implementation remain quite difficult. you communicate people sense urgency ambition: reform do quickly large scale. implementation key now. there long way go. monetary policy accommodation help make italy productive economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 so qe may remove urgency undertake reforms? on contrary. it’s window opportunity. monetary policy accommodation facilitate implementation reforms. it’s risk government look electoral cycle think benefit growth stop reforms. will structural reform depress demand again? that totally wrong. one careful select right structural interventions, prioritise measure take. there limit window carry reforms. be weak exchange rate main channel qe help italian economy? i would say it’s financial conditions, factor broad exchange rate. the italian bank system expose sub-prime, expose italian economy government debt. so there’s local exposure economy wasn’t grow even crisis. the financial sector enter crisis already weak, low profitability high costs. it withstand 2009 crisis, sovereign debt crisis hit mid-2011, interest rate government debt go 7%, sector’s large portfolio italian sovereign security depreciate rapidly. at point, expected, bank retrenched, tighten credit condition customers. financial condition become harsh real economy. it take long time improve. even one year ago, rate high economy grow year expect stagnate future. market discipline move soft harsh. it perhaps enough past become excessive. government take measure avoid pro-cyclical financial loop create instability. in italy lot people start think would good outside euro. italy join euro previous regime, i.e. fix exchange rate devalue occasionally, source uncertainty instability. market learn regime worked, therefore interest rate constantly high, create snowball effect bring italy high public debt burden now. the country’s problem enter monetary union high public debt government seize opportunity offer low interest rate reform economy. now low interest rate environment easy financial condition facilitate necessary reforms. it’s window. i think understood: reform pipeline. but i say it’s always matter implementation. what early assessment reforms, include labour market reform, italy? the so-called job act important build block bold reform agenda. in spain similar step take three year ago, key factor push spanish economy generally outperform rest euro area 2014. a see spain, job act reform make italy attractive location business. it create new employment opportunities, reabsorb unemployed give stable better-paid job seek work certainty. but, again, start point ambitious agenda economic reforms. it end efforts. the fall euro visible consequence qe. there disconnect state economy monetary policy, especially respect dollar. will feed “patient” rise dollar? currency reflect fundamental basically seen. i cannot comment exchange rate movements. from european point view, decline effective exchange rate relatively modest. 4 bi central bankers’ speech but accuse start currency war, give central bank respond qe? we receive lot international support recent measures. we domestic reasons. the imf tell u do faster, surprise anybody. we credit ease first, give renew incentive bank create credit real economy, term quantity sufficient. inflation expectation rebounding, take new set measures. have tltros obscure qe? a i said, positively surprise impact summer 2014 measure price credit even qe. what see bank participate first two operation september december last year cut price loan household company non-participating banks. they strong incentive generate loan advantageous borrow condition tltros conditional actual loan flows. also, third tender last week go quite well term volumes. so, tltros also play important role. bank claim try promote credit ease monetary policy, supervisory arm, single supervisory mechanism (ssm), constant change rule make difficult. the flood change regulation certain cyclical effect, compensate monetary accommodation. but contradiction. you need make bank safer, le leveraged, reduce liquidity risk. it caricature say squeeze bank provide liquidity. we want resilient banks. negative interest rate become widespread must pose risk interfere macro scenario. you could reach target sooner expected. i would cautious implication early day qe. you need give market time settle get use purchase €60 billion per month. when design policy want sustain path inflation towards be. it take time ass impact. the people say may deflationary spiral may people say it’s much. we’ll steady hand implementation stick fact steady improvement outlook price stability conditional u carry purchase least september 2016. be encourage excessive risk-taking therefore instability? we come situation risk financial instability come inflation permanently low, possibly deflation risk. a third recession would create huge financial stability problems. a shift investment pattern bank financial entity longer-dated risky exposure part policy qe. furthermore, country bank may excessive exposure sovereign. that create big correlation sovereign risk bank risk. therefore, bank country concern could decide reduce exposure sovereign. have say this, monitor financial market constantly extreme care detect pocket exuberance. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 23 march 2015. * * * mr chairman, honourable member econ committee, lady gentleman, i happy back committee first regular hear european parliament year 2015. a lot happen since last meet november last year. with lithuania, euro welcome 19th member. on 22 january announce intention extend asset purchase programme buy public sector securities; start purchase march 9. we also move new build officially inaugurate last week; unveil new 20 euro banknote; milestone towards even great transparency decision-making procedures, publish 19 february first time account monetary policy meet govern council ecb. i know always topic dear committee. in remainder remarks, i explain important aspect extend asset purchase programme present first assessment effects. i then, coordinator ask do, elaborate link price stability financial stability speak briefly macroprudential tool ecb disposal. economic outlook monetary policy the recent data survey evidence show growth gain momentum. the basis economic recovery euro area clearly strengthened. this due particular fall oil prices, gradual firm external demand, easy finance condition drive accomodative monetary policy, depreciation euro. these positive development also reflect recent ecb staff projections. compare projection december, outlook 2015 2016 visibly revise upwards 0.5 0.4 pp., respectively. we expect inflation euro area remain low negative month ahead, recent fall oil price continue influence figure late year. however, inflation rate expect start increase gradually towards end year. they support aggregate demand, impact low euro exchange rate recovery oil price current trough year ahead. the late ecb staff projection foresee average inflation 0.0% 2015, rise 1.5% 2016 1.8% 2017. a key factor full recovery euro area economy ensure inflation remain low long extra stimulus govern council decide introduce january ecb’s expand asset purchase program. this decision premise two considerations. first, momentum support economic recovery view weak fragile give u sufficient confidence inflation would return level close 2% policy relevant medium-term horizon. second, expansive potential monetary policy measure decide june october see uncertain. this largely 2 bi central bankers’ speech dependent banks’ decision borrow eurosystem fund lend customers. the cumulative uptake first two target long-term refinance operation stand around €212.4 billion. therefore, monetary impulse reinforce need quantitatively predictable controllable put economy outlook price stability firm footing. on 9 march, start purchase public-sector security part expand asset purchase programme, also comprise intervention ab cover bond markets. overall, asset purchase amount €60 billion per month. the pace purchase far put overall program track reach total €60 billion march. at point time see sign enough bond u purchase. feedback market participant far suggest implementation smooth market liquidity remain ample. our intervention accelerate trend evident since time. a steady process re-integration across financial market jurisdiction way since summer 2012. what new today, however, low interest rate capital market increasingly transmit entire financial intermediation chain. low fund cost bank start influence cost borrow household companies. a bank lend rate reduced, new investment project – previously consider unprofitable – become attractive. in short-run, sustain demand credit investment. indeed, bank cover bank lend survey confirm ease lend condition progress hand-in-hand resurgent demand credit finance business investment. in longer-term perspective, increase potential output. we intend carry purchase least end-september 2016, case see sustain adjustment path inflation consistent aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. the govern council take holistic perspective assess path inflation. it evaluate likelihood inflation converge level close 2%, also stabilize around level sufficient confidence thereafter. when assessment, govern council follow monetary policy strategy concentrate inflation trends, look surprise measure inflation (in either direction) judge transient implication medium term outlook price stability. the positive result new purchase programme distract stakeholder deliver contribution put economy back track. fiscal policy support economic growth, ensure debt sustainability. a full consistent implementation stability growth pact key confidence fiscal framework. moreover, structural reform implement promptly determination. the combination improve economic structure sound fiscal policy indeed potential make monetary policy effective encourage economic actor take advantage improve finance condition increase investment. price stability financial stability let turn, suggest econ coordinators, interaction price stability financial stability. price stability is, know, primary objective ecb eurosystem. and achieve price stability necessary condition financial stability. clearly, unstable inflation development distort wide variety macroeconomic financial fluctuations, extent distortion become harmful economy. for example, unstable inflation development could complicate price asset blur signal relative asset price adjustment detrimental effect resource allocation. bi central bankers’ speech 3 however, price stability sufficient condition financial stability. the last crisis prove financial stability risk even time price stability achieved. and monetary policy decision also affect expectation wide range asset prices. our monetary policy measure necessary achieve primary objective maintain price stability. but nevertheless aware may unintended side effect financial system. for example, asset price may increase level justify fundamentals, period low yield volatility may invite excessive risk take financial investors. in turn, development act amplify mechanism eventual financial instability. at time, financial stability precondition efficient conduct monetary policy. to successful deliver price stability, monetary policy rely effectiveness monetary transmission mechanism. in context, stable non-fragmented financial system important smooth transmission monetary policy signals. we monitor closely potential risk euro area financial stability, include excessive risk taking. currently risk contained. and emerge, macro-prudential policy would best suit address them. recently, indeed national authority euro area decide implement measure go direction prevent financial stability risk emerge national level. regard macro-prudential oversight bank euro area, share national authority ecb. the ecb may top-up specific national macro-prudential measure consider insufficient mitigate systemic risks. the ecb national authority disposal macro-prudential instrument bank sector, provide capital requirement directive regulation (crd iv/crr). these include capital buffers, countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buff capital surcharge systemic institutions. additional measure may also use improve bank capital liquidity position, limit large exposure increase capital requirement certain asset classes, interbank real estate exposures. to make effective use instrument strengthen stability financial system, ecb national authority regularly exchange information macro-prudential policies. process formal notification ecb national authority regard intend measure already activated. overall, ecb help identify potential financial stability risk foster coordinate stance macro-prudential policy among euro area member states. conclusion let conclude say i always much value exchange house exercise accountability obligation source inspiration. i therefore much look forward debate hope time discus matter time short plenary debate. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 koji ishida: economic activity price japan monetary policy speech mr koji ishida, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, kanagawa, 26 february 2015. * * * i. development economic activity price a. overseas i would like start remark look development economic activity prices, outside japan. on overseas economy – mainly advance economy – bank japan’s current assessment recovering, albeit lackluster performance still see part. the average real gdp growth rate major country regions, weight value export japan, post high growth, due mainly pick-up u.s. economy, decelerate 1.7 percent january-march quarter 2014. a outlook, projection global economic growth, release international monetary fund (imf), revise downward repeatedly, projection growth rate gradually accelerate toward 2016 unchanged. the bank likewise expect overall global economy moderately increase growth rate, advance economy continue enjoy recovery positive effect gradually spread emerge economies. take close look development region, u.s. economy continue see solid recovery, lead mainly private demand. accord u.s. employment statistic february 2015, number employee increase 200 thousand people seasonally adjust month-on-month basis eleven consecutive months, unemployment rate hover low level. in situation, consumer sentiment improve trend. although wage increase somewhat weak, economy likely continue see solid recovery, private consumption continue increase back improvement employment situation low gasoline prices. the euro area economy maintain moderate recovery, see fact real gdp growth rate positive seven consecutive quarters, slowdown growth momentum observe since spring 2014 come halt. a outlook, economy likely maintain recovery, albeit moderate pace, mainly depreciation euro monetary ease european central bank (ecb) likely contribute underpin economy, although close attention continue pay factor risk low inflation become protract effect situation ukraine russia. a chinese economy, year-on-year growth rate real gdp october-december quarter 2014 7.3 percent, unchanged previous quarter. the economy generally maintain stable growth, although momentum somewhat slow due downward pressure associate structural reforms. a outlook, chinese economy likely basically continue grow stably, although attention pay overhang supply capacity manufacture sector adjustment pressure real estate market, mainly local cities. emerge economy whole remain lackluster term growth. look development east asian region, closely tie japan’s economy, ny improve whole, mainly due pick-up domestic demand, asean economy lack growth momentum. a outlook, emerge 2 bi central bankers’ speech economy whole likely gradually increase growth rate advance economies, particularly unite states, positive effect them, trigger pick-up domestic demand. b. japan 1. current situation now i discus development economic activity price japan. the bank’s current assessment economy continue moderate recovery trend. the growth rate real gdp october-december quarter turn positive, register 2.2 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, follow negative growth two consecutive quarter consumption tax hike april 2014, mainly due decline demand follow front-loaded increase prior tax hike adverse weather conditions. a look development demand component show business fix investment moderate increase trend, export pick noticeably private consumption remain resilient situation effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase dissipating. give developments, i hold view that, emerge pause first half fiscal 2014, economy start show sign return moderate recovery path. although limit number economic indicator release regard development since begin 2015, real export january show clear pick-up 5.0 percent previous month, mainly due increase export automobile unite states. meanwhile, private consumption, number new passenger-car registration january decline slightly, indicator consumer sentiment, relatively weak since 2014, bottom recently. with regard prices, year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, around 0.5 percent. the rate increase recently slowing, mainly due fall price petroleum product cause decline crude oil prices. on basis exclude food energy, rate increase cpi slow marginally, mainly reflect weakness consumption summer 2014, december, unchanged previous month. 2. outlook japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend. on price front, year-on-year rate increase cpi likely slow time being, reflect decline energy prices. meanwhile, risk outlook include development emerge commodity-exporting economies, prospect regard debt problem risk low inflation rate protract europe, pace recovery u.s. economy. the bank compile release policy board members’ forecast economic activity price quarterly basis. look median members’ forecast release january 2015, real gdp growth rate project minus 0.5 percent fiscal 2014, 2.1 percent fiscal 2015, 1.6 percent fiscal 2016. the year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food), exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, project 0.9 percent fiscal 2014, 1.0 percent fiscal 2015, 2.2 percent fiscal 2016. compare forecast make october 2014, real gdp growth likely low fiscal 2014, high fiscal 2015 2016, due mainly positive effect substantial decline crude oil price government’s economic measures. with regard cpi, outlook underlie trend unchanged; year-on-year rate increase likely low toward fiscal 2015, due bi central bankers’ speech 3 significant decline crude oil prices, fiscal 2016 likely le unchanged 2 percent, due mainly wan downward pressure. 3. key assess outlook thus far, i briefly outline current situation outlook economic activity prices. in follows, i discus three key assess outlook. a. effect decline crude oil price the first effect decline crude oil price global economy prices. although crude oil price rise slightly recently, generally level substantially peak observe around june 2014. the follow factor point background substantial decline crude oil prices: oil supply factors, decision group major oil-exporting country maintain production level despite rise production oil, shale oil unite states; decline demand crude oil due economic deceleration emerge european economies, example. these factor combine likely impact decline crude oil prices. in term effect decline crude oil price japan’s economy, discuss widely, i believe net effect likely positive term economic activity, bring improvement corporate profit rise households’ real purchase power. on price front, price decline energy – include drop price crude oil – likely exert downward pressure general price short term. from relatively longer-term perspective, however, likely push general price improvement output gap. in words, i basically consider decline crude oil price bring positive effect economic activity price time, time, i also consider attention pay effect certain area economy. i mention early projection global economic growth release imf revise downward repeatedly, i consider suggest existence vulnerable area world economy despite global recovery trend. in situation, decline crude oil price likely exert adjustment pressure capital investment energy resource sector, say account approximately 40 percent investment global basis. attention pay possibility turn exert downward pressure orders, production, export japan’s capital goods, country competitive edge. b. development real wage the second key development real wages. since turn fiscal 2014, year-on-year rate change real wage negative, due part substantial increase rate change cpi include effect consumption tax hike. meanwhile, somewhat weak recovery consumption decline follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike. i believe decline real wages, addition effect irregular weather, largely account weak recovery. therefore, private consumption pick clearly maintain increasing, albeit moderate, trend fiscal 2015 beyond, i consider necessary nominal wage rise firmly wage real term – adjust inflation – start rise year-on-year basis. on point, let u look recent development japan’s economy. corporate profit whole increasing, difference observe business performance export firm – benefit yen’s depreciation – domestic demand-oriented firm – yen’s depreciation act headwind. in view continue tight employment situation development prices, consideration condition prepare wage start rise form increase base pay bonus payments. household income, i believe, great drive force 4 bi central bankers’ speech support virtuous cycle household sector fiscal 2015 if, result wage negotiation spring 2015, nominal wage improve extent bring rise real wages; however, attention pay effects, example, introduction macroeconomic slide formula pension system japan fiscal 2015. c. development export the third key development exports. real export sluggish despite substantial depreciation yen since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) april 2013. a range factor point regard slow emergence j-curve effects; namely, cyclical factor sluggishness emerge economy structural factor increase relocation production overseas japanese manufacturers. give circumstances, unlike past, become quite difficult export act drive force japan’s economy even amid situation yen’s depreciation. it must noted, however, real export start rise noticeably recently. moreover, increase number firm announce plan expand domestic business, manufacturer shift production back japan make import substitutions. amid situation yen’s depreciation, development yield virtuous cycle economy begin observe steadily, i believe continue gradually strengthen yen stabilizes. in determine outlook production exports, also necessary observe change corporate behavior. ii. the bank’s monetary policy a. expansion qqe next, i would like discus bank’s monetary policy. at monetary policy meet hold october 31, 2014, bank decide expand qqe, introduce april 2013. the specific measure expansion follows. first, bank decide accelerate pace increase monetary base provide “an annual pace 60–70 trillion yen” “an annual pace 80 trillion yen.” second, decide raise pace increase amount outstanding bank’s hold japanese government bond (jgbs) “an annual pace 50 trillion yen” “an annual pace 80 trillion yen.” at time, bank decide extend average remain maturity jgb purchase “about seven years” flexible range “about seven ten years.” and third, decide purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding would triple annual pace “about 3 trillion yen” “about 90 billion yen,” respectively. around time bank’s expansion qqe october 2014, somewhat weak development demand follow consumption tax hike substantial decline crude oil price exert downward pressure prices. the bank consider that, downward pressure remained, albeit short term, risk emergence deflationary mindset, progress steadily, might delayed. to preempt manifestation risk maintain improve momentum expectation formation, bank decide expansion qqe. b. enhancement fund-provisioning measure prior introduction qqe, bank establish – balance sheet – loan support program, aim make effect monetary ease permeate entire economy. the program consist two measure – namely, fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility) fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend bi central bankers’ speech 5 (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility) – provide support private financial institutions’ effort ends. in january 2015, bank decide extend application period program one year. it also decided, regard growth-supporting fund facility, increase maximum amount fund provide financial institution 1 trillion yen 2 trillion yen, also increase maximum amount outstanding fund-provisioning whole 7 trillion yen 10 trillion yen. moreover, bank enhance program introduce new framework enable financial institution current account bank use growth-supporting fund facility stimulate bank lend facility central organizations. the bank also decided, january 2015, extend application period funds-supplying operation support financial institution disaster area affect great east japan earthquake one year. through enhancement exist measures, bank promote financial institutions’ lending, well stimulate firms’ households’ demand credit continue support effort financial institution disaster area toward rebuilding. c. financial condition a i described, bank implement large-scale monetary ease various measures. in situation, interest rate financial market hover extremely low levels. yield 10-year jgbs currently range 0.3–0.4 percent, although relatively large fluctuation recently. while u.s. dollar/yen rate move within narrow range 115–120 yen, nikkei 225 stock average range 18,000–19,000 yen. financial condition continue accommodative. the average contract interest rate new loan discount issuance rate cp corporate bond low levels. firms’ perception financial institutions’ lend attitude financial position firms, include small firms, improving. d. future conduct monetary policy 1. the decline crude oil price conduct monetary policy next, i would like highlight two point regard bank’s future conduct monetary policy conclude remarks. the first relationship decline crude oil price conduct monetary policy. in bank’s interim assessment january 2015 october 2014 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report), forecast year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) revise downward toward fiscal 2015 present october 2014 outlook report. from somewhat longer-term perspective, decline crude oil price – main factor behind downward revision – exert upward pressure underlie trend price produce stimulus effect economy. in situation medium- long-term inflation expectation among household firm stable accord number surveys, long path year-on-year rate increase cpi rise toward around 2 percent sight, decline crude oil price pose particular concern term conduct monetary policy. in term grasp price developments, become difficult determine underlie trend cpi, due large fluctuation crude oil prices. the basic approach assess trend make comprehensive examination range indicator – particularly cpi item le fresh food. give current situation, appropriate time make assessment also take account contribution energy item year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food). the 6 bi central bankers’ speech bank’s decision release estimate contribution price outlook fiscal 2016 base thinking. on point, one view examine year-on-year rate increase cpi item le food energy, core-core cpi, particular. however, identify underlie trend prices, i personally consider also important examine price index include food, give food expenditure japan account large proportion household expenditure country – unite state – rise price daily necessity weigh consumer sentiment since 2014. furthermore, i place importance cpi item le impute rent, use calculation item real wages. impute rent expenditure actually pay market. it long decline trend, trend continues, exert strong downward pressure cpi items, particularly phase rate increase price good service accelerates. if turn case, various problem may arise gap rise price perceive household rise cpi, assess rate wage increase. 2. the continuation qqe the second point continuation qqe. almost two year pass since bank introduce qqe april 2013. so far, bank commit continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it also commit examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate. a bank’s outlook prices, look median policy board members’ forecasts, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) project remain 1.0 percent fiscal 2015 due substantial decline crude oil prices, reach 2.2 percent fiscal 2016. if economic activity price develop projected, achievement price stability target 2 percent become sight time. although premature discus exit strategy stage, year-on-year rate increase cpi accelerate accordance bank’s forecast i mentioned, bank point need gradually slow pace qqe current full-speed operation. from viewpoint, become important bank carefully grasp ass prevail economic development underlie trend prices, thereby accurately determine outlook, process prepare outlook report every april october, conduct interim assessment thereof every july january. with respect word “make adjustment appropriate” use describe bank’s monetary policy stance, understand adjustment make response to, longer-term perspective, heighten risk achieve sustainable economic growth price stability, emergence economic financial imbalances, make response change time achieve 2 percent price stability target pace target achieved. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stanley fischer: monetary policy lesson way ahead speech mr stanley fischer, vice chair board governor federal reserve system, economic club new york, new york city, 23 march 2015. * * * for six years, federal fund rate has, effectively, zero. however widely expect rate lift end year, normalization monetary policy get underway. the approach liftoff reflect significant progress make toward objective maximum employment price stability. the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation federal reserve undertake response crisis contribute importantly economic recovery, though recovery take long expected. the unemployment rate, 5.5 percent february, near estimate natural rate, expect inflation gradually rise toward fed’s target 2 percent. begin normalization policy significant step toward restoration economy’s normal dynamics, allow monetary policy respond shock without recourse unconventional tools. i would like take occasion look back lesson learn time effective low bind interest rate, also look forward.1 monetary policy since crisis let first take step back time. prior crisis, financial system fragile realized. key vulnerability include excessive leverage, overdependence short-term funding, deficiency credit ratings, underwrite standards, risk management. importantly, interconnection across financial institution heighten risk contagion cascade losses. some interconnection emerge use complicate financial instrument create seemingly safe liquid assets. at time, common say risk disperse allocate best able bear it. but rather distribute risk widely, instrument concentrate risk balance sheet relatively small number highly lever financial institutions. a result, subprime crisis developed, market participant pull back risk taking, lead deleveraging spiral fire sales.2 the damage spread across globe. follow collapse lehman brother september 15, international trade collapse panic financial connection transmit distress across borders.3 of course, economy’s vulnerability stem private sector alone: public sector, gap regulatory structure allow important financial institution escape comprehensive supervision, regulator insufficiently focus stability system whole. 1 the view i offer necessarily member federal open market committee committee itself. 2 for model fire sale arise uncertainty network cross-exposures among banks, see caballero simsek (2013). 3 the fallout crisis large even country experience acute financial crisis. a example, six asian countries, include china india, export fell 30 percent begin 2009, industrial production decline 10 percent. see discussion china, india, indonesia, malaysia, thailand, taiwan coulibaly, sapriza, zlate (2011). regard role credit condition collapse international trade, see chor manova (2012). 2 bi central bankers’ speech the federal reserve respond aggressively crisis.4 by end 2008, federal open market committee (fomc) reduce target federal fund rate 5–1/4 percent to, effectively, zero. the feed also act forcefully lender last resort – traditional role provide short-term liquidity depository institutions, also provide liquidity directly borrower investor key credit markets.5 in addition, worldwide scope crisis call concert international action. because global nature dollar fund markets, feed authorize dollar liquidity swap line major central banks, begin december 2007. in october 2008, central banker coordinate reduction policy rate group seven agree use available tool prevent failure systemically important financial institutions.6 the next month, group twenty announce broad common strategy, include fiscal expansion. these step likely prevent second great depression, sufficient avoid severe global contraction. in unite states, federal fund rate effective low bind end 2008, fomc judge could provide much additional accommodation via conventional tool – reduce federal fund rate.7 instead, fomc use two unconventional tools: large-scale asset purchase enhance forward guidance. to vary extents, foreign central bank also use tools. the fed’s asset purchase conventional aim increase reserve balance pull short-term rates.8 rather, purchase longer-term security low longer-term yield portfolio balance effects. the evolution asset purchase reflect learn process policymakers. in early programs, fomc specify expect quantity asset acquire define period. in contrast, qe3 (the recent round quantitative easing, implement september 2012 october 2014), fomc announce would continue purchase security certain monthly pace outlook labor market improve substantially context price stability. later, fomc note pace purchase also data dependent, allow pace revise base assessment progress toward long-run objectives. 4 a key trigger crisis decline house prices, begin 2006 lead uncertainty mortgage investments. in summer 2007, two large financial institution – the bear stearns companies, inc., bnp paribas group – suspend redemption certain investment funds, perhaps mark begin financial crisis. in 2008, crisis intensify near collapse bear stearns march bankruptcy lehman brother hold september; full-scale financial panic ensue across much global financial system. 5 in role lender last resort, work closely treasury department federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic). for example, stem run money market funds, treasury provide temporary guarantee feed create backstop liquidity program. in addition, fdic establish temporary liquidity guarantee program guarantee certain unsecured liability depository institution bank hold companies. 6 on october 8, 2008, federal reserve five major central bank jointly announce reduction policy interest rates. see bank canada others (2008). 7 a handful central bank europe recently set certain policy rate zero. specifically, danmark nationalbank, european central bank, sverige riksbank, swiss national bank set negative policy rates. in unite states, federal reserve seek provide accommodation despite federal fund rate being, essentially, zero, choose use negative rates, judge time small additional support aggregate demand worth accompany risk u.s. money market intermediation credit. 8 indeed, maturity extension program – also know operation twist – increase reserve all. bi central bankers’ speech 3 with federal fund rate near zero feed create adjust new asset purchase programs, become difficult public anticipate fomc would likely conduct monetary policy respond change economic conditions. thus, fomc begin rely heavily enhance forward guidance communicate intentions. forward guidance work part also constrain flexibility decisionmakers time come make future decisions.9 nonetheless, number potential cost might associate unconventional tools. when interest rate extremely low, risk financial stability might grow. in addition, elevate security hold could reduce fed’s income remittance u.s. treasury rate eventually rise.10 further, fed’s quantitative ease appear significantly affect foreign asset markets, contribute surge capital inflow emerging-market economy (emes).11 our asset purchase program even call “currency war.” however, eventually, emes seem glad receive flows. interestingly, asset purchase recently announce european central bank (ecb) appear put downward pressure longer-term interest rate unite states. in addition, ecb’s policy increase growth europe, beneficial u.s. exports. although benefit may offset recent appreciation dollar, much increase likely reflect factor include relatively strong performance u.s. economy. look back, ample evidence support view fed’s asset purchase contribute strong u.s. recovery, raise price asset purchase close substitutes, well risky assets.12 our experience also show forward guidance help good align market expectation feed policy committee’s policy intentions.13 in brief, unconventional policy help bring long-term yield reduce term premia low expect path future short-term rates. 9 there long literature monetary economics time inconsistency. time inconsistency notion that, achieve good outcomes, central bank may need make commitment act future – commitment must credible that, ex post, central bank might find hard follow on. for canonical papers, see kydland prescott (1977) lucas stokey (1983); see also fischer (1980). the early literature focus inability central banks, normal times, commit high future interest rate low inflation. interestingly, zero low bound, central bank may face nearly opposite commitment problem: to escape liquidity trap, central bank may want commit keep interest rate low accommodate output boom even headwind crisis dissipated. see, example, eggertsson (2006) werning (2012). for additional discussion federal reserve communications, see yellen (2012) stein (2014). 10 for discussion federal reserve’s remittances, see yellen (2013). though likely remittance treasury decline late decade interest rate increase, development would impair federal reserve’s conduct monetary policy, highly likely average annual remittance period affect asset purchase high pre-crisis norms. in addition, asset purchase also affect treasury revenue lift economic activity thereby tax revenue, well low interest rate thereby debt service costs. 11 regard effect foreign asset markets, see neely (2011); fratzscher, lo duca, straub (2013); rogers, scotti, wright (2014). regard effect emes, appear conventional unconventional policy unite state – among factor – drive capital flow emes. see, example, ahmed zlate (2014) bowman, londono, sapriza (2014). 12 see, example, d’amico king (2013); gagnon others (2011); gilchrist, lópez-salido, zakrajšek (2014); hamilton wu (2012). 13 see, example, yellen (2011). 4 bi central bankers’ speech the recovery financial crisis despite monetary stimulus, recovery financial crisis even sluggish expected. the slow recovery provide evidence severe financial crisis long-lived effects, reinhart rogoff, others, documented.14 the gradual pace recovery likely reflect demand supply factors. with respect aggregate demand, economy face several important headwinds: effort household business rebuild balance sheets, persistently tight credit conditions, extreme weakness house sector, significant drag fiscal policy year 2011 2013, growth slowdown europe part world. turn aggregate supply, appear productivity growth slowed.15 one notable manifestation slow productivity growth last year, unemployment fell significantly anticipate start year – pattern occur prior four year well – whereas gross domestic product growth fell short expectations, three four prior years. however, productivity extremely difficult predict. for part, i believe enormous gain human welfare information technology explosion seem generate likely continue, perhaps eventually return measure productivity growth long-run historical pace. condition liftoff although recovery slow, significant cumulative progress. an increase target federal fund range likely warrant end year. liftoff occur expect return raise interest rate outweigh expect cost so. in decide time come, continue monitor wide range information regard labor market conditions, inflation, financial international developments. we anticipate appropriate raise target range improvement labor market reasonably confident inflation move back 2 percent objective medium term. policy normalization full normalization monetary policy would allow feed rely traditional policy framework adjustment federal fund rate. however, long balance sheet remain sizable, able implement monetary policy traditional tool repurchases. it important that, change rate first time long time, certain operational tool control federal fund rate – and, accordingly, develop test new operational tool control federal fund rate. a discuss fomc’s statement title policy normalization principle plans, publish follow september 2014 fomc meeting, use rate interest excess reserve (ioer) primary tool control federal fund rate.16 we also plan use overnight reverse repurchase agreement (on rrp) facility, needed. in on rrp operation, counterparties may invest fund feed give rate, 14 see cerra saxena (2008); reinhart rogoff (2009); schularick taylor (2012); bordo haubrich (2012); howard, martin, wilson (2011). 15 the slowdown productivity growth may predate recession may exacerbate it. see reifschneider, wascher, wilcox (2013) fernald (2014). 16 see board governor (2014a). bi central bankers’ speech 5 possibly subject cap aggregate amount invested. because on rrp counterparties include many money market participant eligible receive ioer, facility powerful tool control money market interest rates. indeed, test date new york feed suggest on rrp operation generally establish soft floor rates.17 however, on rrp program also certain risks. for example, large persistent program could unanticipated adverse effect structure money markets. in addition, time stress, demand safety liquidity on rrps central bank might increase sharply, potentially exacerbate disruptive flight-to-quality flows.18 to mitigate risks, fomc agree use on rrp facility extent necessary phase long needed. in addition, feed discuss test supplementary tools, term reverse repurchase agreement term deposits, use tool need help support money market rates. with regard balance sheet normalization, fomc indicate anticipate sell agency mortgage-backed securities. when time comes, plan normalize balance sheet primarily cease reinvestment principal payment exist holdings. when fomc choose cease reinvestments, balance sheet naturally contract, correspond reduction reserve balances. this runoff security hold also gradually remove accommodation, effect need take account set stance policy. during normalization, will, doubt, learn different tool make adjustment operate framework. in part adaptability, i confident use ioer and, needed, supplementary tools, able raise short-term interest rate become appropriate. monetary policy liftoff the focus great bulk discussion monetary policy last years, liftoff – circumstance fomc choose raise federal fund rate, date happen, effect fed’s large portfolio manage liftoff process. those question natural six year federal fund rate hold effective low bound. but liftoff approaches, need think also happen next. for liftoff start process normalization, and, go forward, fomc change federal fund rate necessary, down. accordingly, discussion monetary policy need begin shift future path interest rates, thus basis fomc set interest rate follow liftoff. there lively discussion one element future path federal fund rate: whether liftoff sooner gradual rise rate, whether liftoff occur late follow steep path rate.19 these discussion useful 17 policymakers discuss benefit cost on rrp facility. for discussion topic, see, example, fomc minute june 2014, july 2014, january 2015; see board governor (2014b, 2014c, 2015). 18 see frost others (2015). a author note, on rrp facility also potentially contribute financial stability crowd risky short-term borrow financial institution businesses. 19 for discussion tradeoff risk would associate depart either early late effective low bound, see, example, fomc minute january 2015; see board governor (2015). 6 bi central bankers’ speech consider appropriate time first increase federal fund rate. but come first increase? standard interest rate projection might incline one believe path federal fund rate liftoff consist steady rate increase zero longer-run normal nominal federal fund rate, equal natural real rate interest plus 2 percent inflation goal. one might even look back period 2004 2007 conclude fomc raise federal fund rate 25 basis point every meeting, every second meeting, every third meeting, depend date liftoff. i know plan fomc behave way. why not? isn’t calculation optimal control path shows? yes. but smooth path upward federal fund rate almost certainly realized, because, inevitably, economy encounter shock – shock like unexpected decline price oil, geopolitical development may major budgetary confidence implications, burst great productivity growth, feed deal mid-1990s. when shock happen, do, policymakers respond least them. accordingly considerable uncertainty level future interest rate – degree uncertainty estimate statistically, take account market participant recognize fomc discus future level interest rates. the uncertainty future level federal fund rate represent “fan chart” – is, figure show expect path federal fund rate well range represent degree uncertainty around path.20 the two sure element forward guidance fomc able offer liftoff monetary policy continue aim foster committee’s dual objectives, data driven. a move away zero low bound, data respond drive le le financial crisis great recession, increasingly post-liftoff economic developments. whatever state economy, federal fund rate set fomc meet basis member fomc believe best enable u meet dual goal maximum employment price stability course time. a fomc respond incoming information, continue absolutely transparent explain decision contribute meet legally mandate dual goal monetary policy. that transparency serf three purposes: first, require accountable public; second, best way ensure monetary policy decisionmakers continue follow sensible rational policies; third, best way inform private sector basis monetary policy decision make continue made. with respect forward guidance: role continue important long period eventual liftoff key interest rate decision confront fomc focus market expectations. however, monetary policy normalized, interest rate sometimes increased, sometimes decreased. market participant able form expectation future interest rate basis three elements: first, policy record fomc, might approximate reaction function; second, analysis current economic financial situation outlook; and, third, whatever guidance fomc provide see monetary policy decision likely unfold give economic situation outlook. it likely explicit long-term forward 20 for example, sverige riksbank publish fan chart display forecast policy repurchase agreement (or repo) rate, along uncertainty band base historical forecast errors, show range repo rate forecast fall 50 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent confidence. for chart, see sverige riksbank (2015). bi central bankers’ speech 7 guidance play le role monetary policy liftoff past years. policymakers’ behavior sometimes summarize reaction function, algebraic description interest rate set – instance, taylor-type rule federal fund rate react simultaneously rate inflation expectation inflation well rate unemployment expect change level unemployment.21 however, simple rule sort will, necessity, leave many factor appropriately influence monetary policy, financial developments, temporary divergence relationship different measure economic activity inflation, like. a simple rule provide start point decision make fomc, reach interest rate decision, member committee always use judgment identify special circumstance confront economy, react them. to ensure monetary policy operate stabilize way possible, fomc continue set out, clearly can, basis every decision makes, provide guidance expectation future decisions. and basis information provide fomc, understand historical record feed policy decisions, analysis expectation state economy and, particularly, financial markets, market participant make best decision can. reference ahmed, shaghil, andrei zlate (2014). “capital flow

central bank well ecb establish excellent network contacts. they thus draw expertise many 2 bi central bankers’ speech national central bank actively participate number initiative region. our institutional relation central bank montenegro, central bank western balkan generally, go beyond technical cooperation. in november last year, i please welcome governor dakić vice governor fabris

bank’s monetary policy decision assessment economic situation introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, zurich, 19 march 2015. * * * lady gentleman it give great pleasure welcome news conference. follow discontinuation minimum exchange rate, decide hold extraordinary news conference quarterly assessment march, addition traditional six-monthly news conference take place june december. in presentation, i explain govern board’s monetary policy decision outline assessment economic situation. afterwards, colleague i disposal answer questions. monetary policy decision i begin monetary policy decision. the snb decide leave target range three-month libor unchanged –1.25% –0.25%. interest sight deposit snb remain –0.75% exemption threshold remain unchanged. negative interest help make le attractive hold investment swiss francs. overall, swiss franc significantly overvalue continue weaken time. the snb continue take account exchange rate situation, impact inflation economic developments, formulate monetary policy. it therefore remain active foreign exchange market, necessary, order influence monetary conditions. since last monetary policy assessment, exchange rate interest rate condition change substantially. this considerable repercussion inflation growth outlook switzerland. global economic outlook i present assessment global economy. the international economic environment develop largely line previous expectations. the global economic recovery continuing. in fourth quarter 2014, growth u remain potential. the favourable momentum economy also reflect sound growth employment. the economy pick somewhat euro area. this primarily due strong quarterly growth germany. in japan, too, demand increased. by contrast, economic development major emerge economy mixed. consumer price inflation edge worldwide due low oil prices. in many advance economies, inflation move negative territory begin 2015. during course year, growth global economy likely firm gradually. several factor support growth. first, significant decline oil price help increase demand. second, monetary policy advance economy remain expansionary. the euro area, particular, likely benefit decline interest rate well mark depreciation euro. recently, ease european banks’ lend conditions, restrictive, also observed. 2 bi central bankers’ speech despite favourable developments, outlook global economy still uncertain. overall, substantial risk remain, focus issue relate economic outlook greece ukraine conflict. assessment exchange rate situation i would like look exchange rate situation. in recent quarters, mainly drive diverge development u euro area. the direction monetary policy major currency area drift ever apart. while u start monetary policy normalisation sight, european central bank (ecb) launch substantial ease monetary policy – quantitative ease programme. since first indication quantitative ease ecb spring last year, euro depreciate sharply u dollar. in may 2014, euro still cost almost usd 1.40. at monetary policy assessment december, eur/usd exchange rate 1.25. when discontinue minimum exchange rate 15 january, euro already fall usd 1.18; now, march, trade usd 1.05. in words, short period since monetary policy assessment december, euro lose around 15% u dollar; since may 2014, much 25%. give situation, clear minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 euro long sustainable. in week 15 january, level intervention need maintain eur/chf minimum exchange rate foreign exchange market already high climb rapidly. the depreciation euro dollar 15 january, follow ecb’s decision quantitative ease shortly afterwards, impressive illustration enormous additional pressure would maintain minimum exchange rate. have delay discontinuation minimum exchange rate, would expense uncontrollable expansion snb balance sheet – hundred billion swiss francs, potentially several time swiss gdp. such expansion would severely impair snb’s future ability conduct monetary policy substantially jeopardise fulfilment mandate long term. moreover, give fact minimum exchange rate long sustainable, intervention would pointless, magnitude associate loss could justified. follow discontinuation minimum exchange rate, swiss franc initially appreciate sharply currencies, weaken somewhat recent weeks. overall, swiss franc still significantly overvalued. we expect correct time. we aware new situation present swiss economy great challenges. nevertheless, cannot compare condition introduction minimum exchange rate. at time, global economy still deal immediate effect financial crisis, swiss franc significantly overvalue currencies. the international economic environment much positive. inflation economic outlook switzerland the change exchange rate situation also alter assessment inflation economic outlook switzerland, i outline now. a result discontinuation minimum exchange rate, inflation outlook decline significantly. for current year, reduce inflation forecast –0.1% –1.1%. together sharp fall oil prices, appreciation swiss franc since discontinuation minimum exchange rate temporarily move inflation negative territory. inflation reach low point third quarter 2015, –1.2%. bi central bankers’ speech 3 thereafter, forecast inflation rise rapidly december forecast, due interest rate reduction since last monetary policy assessment. nevertheless, 2016, inflation amount –0.5%, 0.8 percentage point low december forecast. not 2017 inflation move positive territory again, 0.4%. the conditional forecast assume three-month libor remain –0.75% entire forecast horizon, swiss franc weakens. the inflation forecast show period negative inflation temporary. sustain negative inflation, even deflationary spiral, expected. this line survey inflation expectations. although survey respondent anticipate inflation significantly lower, expectation remain positive territory medium term. with new exchange rate situation, condition swiss economy become difficult. in past, entrepreneur employee always find way deal strong swiss franc, thereby demonstrating, time again, great flexibility. nevertheless, every appreciation represent fresh challenge uncertain outcome. therefore great respect difficult task economy faces. in regard, i would like say word economic situation switzerland. in fourth quarter, swiss economy grow fast expected. on output side, growth relatively broad-based, manufacture main driver. value add also rise significantly bank industry public sector. on demand side, consumption equipment investment record favourable developments. by contrast, export good service stagnated. in december, snb expect annual growth 2% 2015. with appreciation swiss franc since mid-january, forecast revised. a noticeable weaken economy may expected, particularly first half year. for year whole, snb expect real gdp increase 1%. give weakening, appreciable underutilisation production capacity may expect short term. unemployment likely increase moderately. the anticipate strengthen global recovery supportive effect. negative interest rate i would like turn negative interest rates. follow interest rate reduction since last monetary policy assessment, reference interest rate negative first time history snb. this situation new, therefore discuss detail public arena. i would like emphasise low interest sight deposit snb negative territory necessary monetary policy measure. negative interest make hold investment swiss franc le attractive swiss foreign investors. this create incentive reduce inflow franc, reinvest switzerland’s traditional current account surplus abroad. negative interest thus contribute weaken swiss franc. the interest rate reduction rapid effect. a expected, negative interest rate impose bank snb transmit entire spectrum money capital market interest rates. however, low negative interest rate limit switzerland. low interest rate global phenomenon countries, especially euro area, also negative rates. switzerland cannot disassociate developments. with interest rate reduction switzerland, interest rate differential major currency areas, decline virtually zero recent years, increase again. clearly, give swiss franc significantly overvalued, earn outlook swiss franc investment compare currency considerably reduced. 4 bi central bankers’ speech there widespread discussion negative interest rates, part institutional investors, pension fund particular, could incur cost hold liquidity. however, current environment, real alternative measure. negative interest help reduce overvaluation swiss franc. if swiss franc even stronger, would direct indirect effect everyone economy: companies, household public sector. with concern negative interest important remember inflation negative, real interest rate high nominal interest rates. in past, inflation rate often high nominal rate interest. in words, term real returns, time save le worthwhile now, indeed, time save balance actually lose value real terms. moreover, current situation, effort circumvent negative interest rate obtain exemption shift cash switzerland’s general interest, since undermine monetary policy intentions. it remembered, respect, hold cash also entail substantial cost subject high level risk. we retain current interest rate level time being. it continue support weaken swiss franc. conclude remark in closing, i would like return decision 15 january. discontinue minimum exchange rate reduce interest rate monetary policy measure good alternatives. a i outline previously, since introduction minimum exchange rate september 2011, international currency relationship change fundamentally. in view development, minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro long sustainable. over long term, adhere minimum exchange rate would jeopardise snb’s ability conduct monetary policy fulfil mandate future. this would saddle swiss economy longer-term cost would proportion benefit continue enforce minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. with international low interest rate environment, monetary policy face big challenges. overall, swiss franc significantly overvalued. negative interest help make investment swiss franc le attractive thereby correct overvaluation time. the snb continue take account exchange rate situation, impact inflation economic developments, formulate monetary policy. it therefore remain active foreign exchange market, necessary, order influence monetary conditions. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 chris salmon: financial market volatility liquidity – cautionary note speech mr chris salmon, executive director market bank england, national asset-liability management europe symposium, london, 13 march 2015. * * * i would like thank andrew butcher, jonathan rand, allison parent, joseph noss, olga cielinska, liam crowley-reidy, sebastian vismara, lu liu yuliya baranova comment contributions. a executive director market bank england job manage balance sheet, implement various policy decision bank makes. i also responsible ensure bank extract much “market intelligence” financial market development possible inform decisions. but it’s job set policy. give that, remark focus key insight draw financial market development past year so, context quite dynamic period monetary policy. but i speculate future course policy bank england central bank, likely effectiveness different strategy employ central bank achieve targets. and punch line reveal central banker i am: reason cautious. in particular, recent period financial market volatility suggest reason cautious robustness liquidity core financial markets. to set scene let return middle last summer, volatility exceptionally low across range financial markets; compare period heighten volatility saw crisis year period precede it. that see spider chart show measure short-term imply volatility number asset relative two periods. anything le zero le volatile past, opposite true positive plot (chart 1). our market intelligence suggest number factor contribute stable outcomes. there relatively low level uncertainty macroeconomic outlook. the extraordinary policy ease central bank depress imply realise volatility. forward guidance, well repeat round quantitative ease also lead market participant take comfort mantra “low-for-long”. this turn incentivised investor “search yield”, course intend consequence monetary stance, depress volatility compress risk premia self-reinforcing cycle. since last summer volatility many financial market pick number short-lived episode extreme volatility impair market liquidity. imply volatility rise number case i show early return around pre-crisis level (chart 1). moreover, longer-term measure volatility generally increase alongside shorter-term measures, chart plot 2-year imply volatility alongside 3-month volatility suggest (chart 2). we also witness large move financial market past six-months. here i go draw two example – 15 october increase u treasury yield follow publication unexpectedly weak u retail sale data, 15 january appreciation swiss franc follow snb’s decision remove peg euro. the event different drivers, common theme i would like draw out. what unite 15 october 15 january episode immediate intra-day reaction news unprecedented. the intra-day change 10-year u bond yield 37 bps, move happen within hour data release. the intraday range represent nearly eight standard deviations, exceed price move 2 bi central bankers’ speech happen immediately follow collapse lehman brothers. on 15 january, swiss franc appreciate 14%. the intraday range several time number, market participant continue debate high trade value franc day. such event could imply number major asset market may become sensitive news, give shock cause great volatility. a number recent statistical study also imply conclusion, suggest recent episode part broad pattern, even exceptional scale. the follow chart, use output model estimate bank staff, representative statistical analysis refer to1. the chart compare estimate impact uk equity corporate debt asset price volatility give price shock post-crisis period relative pre-crisis period (chart 3). post crisis, corporate debt volatility equity market volatility appear become responsive give price shock. this pattern also apparent model apply number important asset markets, include example us-listed equities. liquidity clearly affect 15 october 15 january. measure trade volumes, provide one metric liquidity, reportedly high day affect markets. but ability market participant trade without affect prices, cases, trade all, clearly limit various point days. the intra-day loss liquidity probably even stark 15 january, tell, widespread feedback foreign exchange trade platform stop quote swiss franc period time, liquidity swiss fix income market lose day remain impair days. the performance u treasury market also materially affect days, much small trade normal move prices. but case stabilise force mean volatility subside liquidity return relatively quickly. in case 15 october event, crowd trade push far price view “justified” fundamental market participant will provide support market. similarly re-appraisal fundamentally justify level swiss franc day follow removal peg, follow public comment snb. volatility declined, way back pre-news level, relatively quickly follow initial spikes. this true 15 october episode: imply volatility 10-year interest rate swap retrace half upward move two days, back pre-october 15th level within two weeks. this quick stabilisation help limit contagion markets. neither increase “baseline” volatility, recent episode i described, materially affect stability unite kingdom. for u then, question become lesson learn? why volatility liquidity evolve way? and important “so what?” start “why?”, market intelligence suggest uncertainty surround global outlook one factor; small part consequence unexpected rough halve price oil since last summer. this uncertainty see recent increase dispersion economists’ forecast inflation us, uk euro area 2015. central bank react change global outlook monetary policy maker active recent months. indeed, far year 24 central bank cut policy rates. moreover, decision ecb three central bank since 1 an egarch model fit ftse all-share daily return return sterling-denominated investment-grade corporate bond flat price index. the egarch model allow conditional volatility react differently negative positive shock returns. the model fit return data split two sub-samples approximately equal length: pre-crisis (jan 2001 – jun 2007) post-crisis (apr 2009 – jan 2015). bi central bankers’ speech 3 last summer set negative policy rate raise question low bind monetary policy exists. clearly answer long simple zero central banks. and decision raise question market work negative rate persist several year yield curve (chart 4). the combination macroeconomic news central bank action mean assume know “low-for-long” (but positive) policy rate market participant could cite little year ago replace le certain landscape, help explain “baseline” volatility pick since last summer. but increase macroeconomic uncertainty central bank activity explain general increase level volatility, cannot explain severity event 15 october 15 january. to explain event probably need look elsewhere. the obvious place turn market structure, give ficc markets, rely intermediary make market warehouse risk, go considerable change. here i want highlight two important contribute theme note market participant fair effective market review, relate provision liquidity. first, market maker become reluctant commit capital warehouse risk. during market intelligence conversation suggest reflect combination reduce risk tolerance since financial crisis, impact regulation design improve resilience financial system. this reduction market make capacity associate increase concentration many ficc markets, firm discriminate market make, client serve. and trend go hand-in-hand growth asset management buy-side community. the combination serve amplify implication reduce risk warehouse capacity intermediary sector relative provision liquidity market maker time market stress relative past. that said, i would hesitate draw much comparison market liquidity today pre-crisis. you don’t need long memory recall impact under-pricing liquidity risk highly leverage market makers. return situation would misplace aspiration. the second theme i want draw evolution market micro-structure. electronic platform increasingly use across various ficc markets. in case regulation cause others, foreign exchange markets, firm number year increasingly embrace electronic form trading. this include use “request-for-quote” platform automate process previously carry phone. electronic platform effective pool liquidity “normal” time may potential, least currently calibrate give today’s level competition, contribute discontinuous price period stress circuit-breakers result platform shut down. there much commentary temporary unavailability number electronic trade platform immediate aftermath removal swiss franc peg. a contrarian view, i ascribe to, would explanation required. the argument would apparent change ability market digest news mirage: statistical analysis would prove capture transient trend, intermediary never prepare stand way large market moves, good time bad. on view, reduction balance sheet move towards electronic structure correlate with, cause of, event seen. and fact spike volatility visible equity well bond markets, market structure undergo profound change ficc markets, would take support evidence. this view would caution over-interpreting isolate case studies, excessive market conviction – next move u rate would 4 bi central bankers’ speech definitely up; swiss peg immutable – lead highly crowd trade accentuate price move impact volatility. but interpretation i lean towards. not least hear market participant that, far bite extreme circumstances, issue ficc business grapple daily basis. an eight standard deviation move u treasuries, weaker-than expect u retail data, lie outside bind could consider transient trend. consolidation electronification plausibly combine accentuate sharp move see last autumn january. the apparent increase incidence spike recent month may “comforting cloak” “low-for-long” le factor suppress volatility precede months. turn “so what?”, definitely rise volatility concern per se: anything, policymakers long concern potential financial stability risk associate long period low volatility. even recent rises, volatility asset class close average level pre-crisis period; period fact prove associate under-pricing risk suppress market volatility. nor necessarily case decline liquidity financial market would concern: correct answer always maximal liquidity i note earlier. we unlikely return pre-crisis world see aspiration. but, accept hypothesis market’s ability digest significant news change sudden increase volatility loss liquidity likely, concern stabilise factor dampen impact event recent month may always kick-in. in circumstance period market dislocation could become persistent, increase scope spillover across financial markets, potentially significant impact financial stability. put another way, recent month show potential short, sharp shocks. but financial market may truly test ability absorb price move flow persist prolong period, wide spillover markets. a such, “so what?” market participant need take note recent period volatility illiquidity remain aware possibility event occur frequently, potential persistent effects. a bank’s december financial stability report concluded, “adjustments disruptive investors’ price liquidity risk fully reflect structural change market liquidity.” in conclusion, financial market condition change quite noticeably past year so. in part conjunctural: macroeconomic outlook change perhaps become le certain. central bank reacted, case push innovation envelope further. unsurprisingly development associate volatile financial markets. give policy-makers previously concern persistently tranquil financial market could encourage excessive risk-taking, development necessarily unwelcome development. but recent month also see number short episode sharply-higher volatility coincide period much impair market liquidity. there good reason believe severity event accentuate structural change ficc markets. there must risk future shock could persistent widespread impact across financial market case recent past. one tool available central banker address concern raise awareness, trader appropriately price risk. and fit proper finish cautionary note: market participant take heed. bi central bankers’ speech 5 appendix chart 1 option-implied volatility across select asset class sources: bank england, barclays live, bloomberg

financial rehabilitation insolvency regime philippine – progress remain challenge speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp, central bank philippines), sharephil’s seminar “all you need know about financial rehabilitation insolvency act”, manila, 17 march 2015. * * * good afternoon lady gentlemen. let begin thank organizer privilege share think bsp important legislative initiative – financial rehabilitation insolvency act (also know fria). we know fria become law 2010. what perhaps u know is: senator juan edgardo j. angara sponsor bill senate floor 2009, 100th year anniversary insolvency act 1909, precursor law. talk long gestation! it therefore surprise good senator clamor passage, argue could long postponed. but length time since precursor law, prevail mood global financial insecurity demand enactment. the mood global financial insecurity still prevail today, albeit less extent. while rest world continue grapple global financial crisis aftermath, philippine good place. thank economic reform undertake thus far. however, time sit back rest laurels. indeed, need remain proactive adopt reform would allow u withstand inevitable challenge grow economy faces. when former senator angara speak senate 2009, note that, country, chance claimant recover investment fail enterprise nightmarish 4.4%. in sharp contrast, recovery rate japan fail enterprise whop 92.5%. where now? with passage fria fr rule 2013, however, recovery rate stand 21.2%. furthermore, world bank group june 2014 do business report rank philippine #50 resolve insolvency index pool 189 countries. not bad may think, clearly still quite long way go. beyond metrics, lady gentlemen, focus real goal: reap advantage effective insolvency regime. the fria major reform design promote investor confidence contribute financial stability sustain growth economy. however, passage fria really jump-off point achieve goal. what benefit effective insolvency regime? to say presence effective insolvency regime pillar market confidence seem contradictory, doesn’t it? especially expect real investor embark business economic endeavor failure mind. however, part sound business plan know – include would happen investment, business turn sour. indeed, market exit (even “forced upon you”) integral part business life cycle. the principle – investor (and banks) know clear rule govern recovery, become will take new venture businesses. 2 bi central bankers’ speech when extend principle across many current potential investor across markets, become intuitive easy appreciate sound insolvency regime build confidence economic growth-enhancing. in addition, also support financial stability. let illustrate. from point view investor, effective insolvency regime provide framework term will prepare lend. more particularly, predictability confidence loan recovery upon default give investor specific parameters, include price points, lending. in several cases, lead increase credit availability, low cost credit, time. the experience brazil show broad bankruptcy reform 2005 establish great protection credit lead significant increase total amount total debt (a report 10-17 percent increase) total amount long-term debt (23 74 percent increase). in words, also lengthen debt maturities. the study also report 7 17 percent reduction cost debt finance brazilian firms. from broad macro point view, clear insolvency regime encourage entrepreneurship, provide safety net entrepreneurs, especially commit personal asset start business personally guarantee loan new venture. a 2008 study compare self-employment 15 country europe north america 1990 2005 find forgive personal bankruptcy law combine ready access limit liability protections, enhance entrepreneurial activity. furthermore, law also provide well-managed redeployment asset productive firms, job preserved. a corporate reorganization code colombia enact 1999 dramatically improve efficiency reorganization proceedings, duration fell average 34 month 12 months. effective reorganization country colombia allow company’s workforce remain employ productive. from financial stability perspective, effective insolvency law help reduce market disruption. in chile, instance, introduction economic insolvency advisor – task first determine viability firm financial distress basis insolvency proceed commence – lay foundation smooth process insolvency proceedings. it allow chile improve recovery rate distress firms’ creditor 19 cent dollar 2004 30 cent 2013. what relevance fria central banking? some may wonder – central bank governor speak seminar insolvency recovery. particularly give that, resolution process bank cover another set law regulations, fria. i ask president, atty. lim question invite me. he remind ardent support bsp deliberation law. i guess, answer question therefore – francis i agree – fria important bsp well, you. in fact, deliberation congress fria on-going, bsp parallel work formally adopt financial stability policy objective. you may ask, financial stability relate fria? i submit [as i allude earlier] that, fria well implemented, help promote advance financial stability country. there textbook definition financial stability. but bsp, define financial stability desirable state achieve governance framework market financial infrastructure enable ensure smooth function financial system conducive sustainable equitable economic growth. effective insolvency regimes, save struggle firm possible, reallocate asset fail firm productively, contribute smooth function financial system. they help minimize market disruptions. bank investor also will lend know recover least investment business bi central bankers’ speech 3 fail. entrepreneurs, particularly involve small medium scale enterprises, will enter market put entire personal resource risk. effective insolvency regime enable transact party take calculate risk investment decisions. i sure agree i say empowerment take calculate risk fuel innovation. in turn, innovation heart economic growth. the current philippine growth trajectory uptrend. to sustain this, need investments, especially real money fund abroad accompany new technology innovation. while help country rat two notch investment grade territory, mindful alone won’t bring investors. good growth prospect high credit rat undoubtedly important contributor improve investment environment. but may enough entice full range investor come in, build business create job filipinos. we always recognize investment decision highly influence investors’ confidence domestic legal system, quality law govern private property sector effective law uphold enforced. investor look consistency predictability commercial affairs. they would want maximize preserve value asset ensure claim upheld, prioritize equally treat become creditor insolvent debtors. it confidence legal system encourage make use court process rehabilitation insolvency issue confront them. the fria provide u menu remedy distress debtor new approach rehabilitation insolvency. and expressly adopt uncitral model law cross-border insolvency accordingly, fria give foreign creditor liquidation rehabilitation proceed direct access philippine courts. thus, opportunity cooperation domestic foreign court domestic foreign insolvency administrator cross-border insolvency restructure available. what need done? over past 15 minute so, i go laundry list benefit effective insolvency regime. clearly, appreciate fria take point reap benefits. however, 2013 forum asian insolvency reform philippine government host bangko sentral ng pilipinas, one session exhaustively deliberate proposition that, implementation insolvency regimes, fix insolvency statute sufficient create well-functioning insolvency regime. i cannot agree more. recent study show critical success factor effective insolvency regime globally is: continuation reform law enacted. the failure insolvency system country already modernize law due inadequate implementation. the implementation law important law itself. our distinguish audience know well successful implementation fria come clear understand consistent application fria fr rule judge insolvency administrators. give special technical competence require liquidation rehabilitation processes, suitable sufficient capacity build necessary component. thus, cannot stress enough benefit specialize train member judiciary, industry practitioners, stakeholders. this include basic business account training, especially neither. with grow internationalization finance businesses, anticipate application insolvency law rule international corporation business country. our court therefore continually call upon dynamic responsive economic financial developments. we hopeful confident response 4 bi central bankers’ speech judiciary call, give spirit expeditious rehabilitation proceed mandate fria fr. this help ensure delay derail implementation rehabilitation plans. conclusion lady gentlemen, core it, challenge u help sustain business confidence country achieve financial stability. this actively play role create environment adequate function legal framework, law rule clear well-defined, thereby enable consistent application member judiciary. it evident fria cornerstone effective insolvency regime. we build foundation ensure advantage insolvency regime achieved. a i close, let congratulate sharephil let president, atty. francis lim, chairperson, ms. evelyn singson, organize important seminar. i urge everyone continue take full advantage learn opportunity, validate his/her knowledge rehabilitation insolvency matters, share insight experiences, even challenge idea concern financial rehabilitation insolvency. let u make forum venue learn also place think new way effectively contribute move rapidly effective rehabilitation insolvency regime financially stable philippine economy. lady gentlemen, know end-goal. let’s wait another century get there. good afternoon i wish seminar great success. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel mminele: ten year inclusion south african rand cl remark mr daniel

last year low interest rate sluggish uneven economic recovery country euro area. fortunately, however, despite continuation sovereign debt crisis, period major tension financial markets, occur 2012, example. on contrary: spread sovereign bond – words, risk premium frequently perceive barometer sovereign debt crisis – go back member state severely affect crisis, exception greece obvious reasons. moreover, interest sovereign debt fall all-time lows. the government italy, spain portugal obtain fund favourably time since introduction euro. an extremely accommodative monetary policy well continue progress adjustment country among factor play part this. despite difference term far country already implement reform steps, measure far take nevertheless mostly point right direction. price competitiveness improved, although partly due depreciation euro. large public deficit reduce current account deficit massively cut back. it important squander progress make far. last success achieve budgetary consolidation improvement competitiveness stay consistently top political agenda. the favourable condition government finance must delude government think reform unnecessary. that naturally apply country affect crisis, also large economy france italy. there, too, central government ultimately recognise reform push background long – something also reflect low rate growth. what crucial importance regard announce reforms, however, implemented. in end, way measure whether reform effort 2 bi central bankers’ speech effect. and that, turn, enormously important stability single currency area, two country key part shaping. latterly, however, greece focus public attention. although newly elect greek government take critical view assistance programme far agree reforms, three week ago apply exist programme extended. the eurogroup numerous parliament accede wish basis exist agreement extend current programme four months, without take additional financial risk begin with. for exist programme extended, greek government commit series economic reforms, spell then, importantly, also implemented. only identifiable progress road sound public finances, competitive economic structure functional political system allow greece regain investors’ confidence fund independently. until then, country depend assistance; i see greece achieve independent access capital market mid-year. but let say one thing clearly. a i see it, decision financial resource greece belong unequivocally field politics. while fiscal policy approve financial assistance month now, eurosystem make considerable financial resource available – precise, lend greek bank double €100 billion. massive outflow capital greece financed, greek bank cut capital market dependent fund eurosystem, predominantly form emergency liquidity assistance (ela) bank greece – which, however, temporary liquidity problem bridged. liquidity assistance, well eurosystem fund quite generally, grant solvent banks. this something mario draghi stress press conference last meet govern council ecb. since bank central government greece closely intertwined, however, situation bank depend heavily whether greek government solvent. the eurosystem pay careful attention whether greek bank worsen liquidity position acquire greek government bond de facto still market. otherwise, might arise suspicion eurosystem take prohibition monetary finance seriously. that something mario draghi clearly point out, too. give government’s banks’ lack market access, finance greek government via bank that, turn, avail monetary policy finance opportunity grant ela bank greece, also raise obvious concern regard prohibition monetary financing. in specific situation, government parliament must decide whether prepare go extend greek risk cover fund need greek government despite tangible uncertainty regard government’s reform. i see le ever task within remit eurosystem. first foremost, course, onus greek government. by mean credible also quantifiable reform commitments, must lay foundation continuation support provide available assistance mechanisms. in respect, lot confidence lose recently. allow make one thing absolutely clear. the composition euro area political decision. every country join monetary union also bear responsibility bi central bankers’ speech 3 contribute stability single currency policy compliance rules. this also matter general public’s confidence single currency institution and, end day, promise monetary union community stability. 3. liability principle commitment fiscal rule lady gentlemen, current situation greece sovereign debt crisis whole demonstrate quickly situation develop eurosystem come pressure take fiscal risks. in order protect monetary policy risks, euro area’s founder rely sound public finances, ensure adoption fiscal rules, amongst things. unfortunately, neither rule implementation strict enough past. and currently, much suggest thing improve future. quite opposite, fact. the point observe limit budgetary rules’ sake, place constraint government authority push austerity programmes. it ensure public finance sustainability restore confidence sound government budgets. this important requirement stable single currency ensure monetary policy risk draw fiscal policy maelstrom long free itself. budgetary rule anchor trust. they tend adopt importance stress trust urgently required. when monetary union established, focus create trust new currency. the decision commit common currency permanent basis was, return, accompany reliable prospect sound public finances. at height crisis, focus obtain approval large-scale joint liability via newly create european support funds. trust also build here. in return joint liability, strict fiscal rule promised. the tough fiscal rule also intend help restore confidence capital market, attempt curb increase risk premiums. a time go on, risk premium fact fall. but probably also monetary policymakers assume significant fiscal risk – security market programme (smp), example – announce prepare necessary – here, i refer outright monetary transaction (omt). with pressure reduce via capital market give security gain sizeable fiscal support funds, motivation decrease deficit debt evidently also declined. call “flexibility” fiscal rule grow louder, european commission eventually give political pressure. the commission take advantage strong position regard rules, actually ensure strict implementation them, interpret rule great political leeway take soft approach implementation. a result, rule flexible political today ever before. they become extremely complex hardly logic them. much scope allow discretion exemptions, mean bind effect rule weak crisis. the recent development france’s excessive deficit procedure pose problem regard bind effect fiscal policy agreements. it also weaken coordination procedure certainly provide reason expand euro-area joint liability element 4 bi central bankers’ speech further, often call for. liability without sufficient control undermine stability foundation monetary union. 4. monetary policy stance ease purchase programme early 2015 lady gentlemen, i would like turn topic monetary policy. inflationary pressure euro area exceedingly low, especially since second half 2014. the ecb govern council respond implement number measure design loosen still already expansionary monetary policy stance. public attention particularly draw expand asset purchase programme adopt january year. you don’t need tell i qualm decision. but ecb govern council face tricky monetary policy situation – inflation rate right far medium-term target. indeed, measure long-term inflation expectation even diminish distinctly recent months. but that’s case euro area; advance economy already engage large-scale bond purchase also find boat. find right monetary policy response predicament anything easy. the way policymakers interpret driver fuel current low inflation rate naturally important consideration. my prefer response would “look through” spell low interest rates, rather like central bank advance economy done. i say slack price pressure euro area primarily outcome drop energy prices. this decrease ought distinctly boost growth euro area member state net importer oil. another point available survey suggest long-term inflation expectation still well anchored. and drop market-based expectation don’t automatically mean inflation expectation contracted. rather, also dictate extent inflation risk liquidity premiums. this assessment mean, say, bundesbank consistent declare primary objective safeguard price stability. and certainly mean make objective play second fiddle considerations, instance. what mean face challenge monetary policy situation, reweighted economic factor development well risks, continue weight factor differently majority ecb govern council members. you doubt know ecb staff project inflation rate zero year, rise 1.5% 1.8% next two years. they also forecast growth climb 1.5% year 1.9% 2016 2.1% 2017. this assessment is, part, also reflection expectation place transmission monetary policy decisions. but read late data projection endorsement restrain monetary policy response. a i see it, project path inflation clearly illustrate spell low even negative inflation rate temporal phenomenon. the effect low oil price play particularly important role regard, also significantly eas financial strain enterprise households. this turn stimulate consumption investment activity, contribute expect economic recovery. and also reduce threat prolong phase low inflation rate possibly spark self-reinforcing downward spiral fallig prices, wages, production employment. incidentally, i see sign second round effects. the collective labour agreement metal-working industry largely line expectation negotiate wage rate bi central bankers’ speech 5 germany climb roughly 3% year. and euro-area countries, too, nothing moment suggest european commission’s projection 1.3% increase euro-area employee compensation year untenable. i deny announcement bond purchase reduce likelihood deflation. that, least, data inflation option seem suggest. but likelihood deflation rather remote even measure announced. that’s why, whole, i don’t think would necessary ease monetary policy roll broadly base government bond purchase programme. all so, give purchase sovereign bond euro area harbour specific risks, make monetary policy instrument unlike other. but least worth note decision largely rule risk-sharing part bond purchase programme counteract direct threat sovereign credit risk mutualised. that also diminish legal risk involve kind programme. but fact remain purchase cause fiscal policy monetary policy become even strongly intertwined. for purchase come end, sovereign able finance substantial portion debt cheaply without finance cost differentiate way accord risk sovereign question. if member state become accustom fund terms, might become le incline embrace consolidation reform measures. together commission’s unambitious approach enforce fiscal rules, confluence different factor might fact turn complicate effort resolve euro area’s structural problems. and might make life difficult, road, u look achieve target price stability. 5. german economy overcome weak growth lady gentlemen, get good start 2014, german economy perform strongly second half year originally expected. nevertheless, economy appear emerge sluggish phase fast many believe possible given, amongst things, germany’s buoyant economic growth towards end last year. the economic upturn currently drive recovery industrial activity well as, all, decidedly positive consumer climate. the high level employment, favourable income prospects, drastic fall oil price low interest rate promote households’ propensity spend. in 2014, negotiate wage employee go 3% – increase see almost 20 years. in light low inflation rate, real disposable incomes, too, increase considerably result. enterprise benefit low oil price favourable fund conditions, also depreciation euro gradual recovery international sale markets. a result, enterprise increase output balance. employment, too, continue expand unemployment level fell. give economic environment likely remain favourable, reduction unemployment expect continue year. hence, german economy remain good shape. overall, many factor point growth rate 2015 high bundesbank publish december projection. a thing stand, rate 1.5% germany recently provide european commission fairly realistic. 6 bi central bankers’ speech public finances, too, show positive picture present. in 2014, germany’s general government budget record slight surplus. while government expenditure fuel sharp rise pension healthcare costs, government interest payment contract significantly, chiefly thank favourable fund conditions. the fiscal balance could deteriorate somewhat current year. amongst things, likely result fast expenditure growth due, least, rise social payment result pension benefit package adopt mid-2014. however, slight general government surplus record year. regardless good situation overall favourable economic outlook, continue risk economic development germany must neglected. this include geopolitical tensions, amongst things. what more, economic recovery get underway euro area remain fragile. the bottom line room germany complacency economic policy matters. in particular, unfavourable demographic outlook weigh heavily german economy medium term. by 2060, population shrink 20% labour force around 30%. to make matter worse, policy measure early retirement full pension 63 already constrain labour supply, thereby erode growth opportunities. 6. european bank union lady gentlemen, single supervisory mechanism (or ssm), base ecb, run since 4 november 2014. in parallel introduction ssm, policymakers press ahead effort create regime orderly recovery resolution bank 2014 without jeopardise financial stability use taxpayers’ money, possible. this project second pillar european bank union. in context, eu regulation establish single resolution mechanism (srm) create two element pillar: one hand, european resolution board other, single bank-financed resolution fund. the srm, enter force 2016, apply liability principle bank well. freedom take entrepreneurial decision responsibility consequence inextricably link here, – means, bad come worst, resolve therefore close bank. assume involve all, taxpayer last foot bill, even certain conditions. however, new joint responsibility resolution bank also mean risk respective national private sector might shift community. this could form legislative measure deteriorate risk position bank favour national debtors. for example, change insolvency laws, discuss euro-area countries, could significant impact. i therefore believe bank union require policy coordination go beyond level discuss far. overall, however, srm undoubtedly key step along road stable bank system. but neither ssm srm solve fundamental problem the, cases, close tie bank member-state government euro area. this lead potentially threaten interaction crisis event. during crisis, distress bank system country mean governments, too, face considerable financial difficulty account necessary public rescue commitments. however, hazardous “doom loop” bank sovereign also mean sovereigns, turn, negative impact banks. bank bi central bankers’ speech 7 hold large portfolio bond issue government risk insolvency expose considerable strain even drag along them. that’s i repeatedly point that, medium term, current regulatory preferential treatment lend sovereign need end least substantially scale back. the aim must loosen sovereign-bank nexus medium term. the conference “debt financial stability – regulatory challenges” hold bundesbank federal ministry finance end month therefore address issue, too. one possible future approach could bank back claim sovereign borrower capital commensurate risk subject large exposure limits. 7. privilege regulatory treatment lend sovereign lady gentlemen, problem cause interdependency government bank take special form current regulatory framework european monetary union. this reflected, amongst things, fact often little diversification european banks’ loan sovereign debtors. on contrary, many cases, vast majority government bond hold euro-area bank issue one sovereign – domestic government. for example, december 2014, 98% loan greek bank euro-area sovereign debtor grant greek government. be clear case tie close, doubt concern government solvency direct negative impact bank system. it particular context devote first main article year’s annual report topic sovereign-bank nexus. in particular, article examine would happen sovereign loan back capital, one hand, large exposure subject limits, other. because potentially significant consequences, especially application large exposure limit, reform would require certain transitional period. however, macroeconomic effect new rule would doubt positive. financial stability would enhanced, incentive pursue type fiscal policy would increase lend private borrower would become attractive which, turn, might boost capital stock economies’ growth potential. it would therefore important lose time. this article see contribution debate. against backdrop, welcome development basel committee add regulatory treatment lend sovereign agenda. furthermore, european systemic risk board publish report topic day yesterday. in foreword report, mario draghi quite rightly say discussion topic long overdue. if possible reach consensus international level eliminate privilege treatment loan sovereigns, push ahead european solution order make important contribution long-term stability euro area. a well focus major issue relate stability-oriented regulatory framework, bundesbank also take look big picture, including, example, topic payment transactions. the second main article year’s annual report therefore examine digital structural change payment services. 8 bi central bankers’ speech 8. bundesbank profit risk provision lady gentlemen, finally i would like come annual account hence also year’s bundesbank profit. the profit loss account 2014 financial year close annual surplus €2.95 billion. the annual surplus 2014 therefore €1.6 billion previous year. the profit low mainly significant decline interest income last year. net interest income come €3.14 billion last year, €2.42 billion 2013. this decline due, particular, low key interest rates, two-thirds low annual average. with regard risk provisions, note risk monetary policy operation grow considerably recent year wake financial crisis. the bundesbank already react and, 2010 2012, purpose risk provision increase provision general risk three step total €12.4 billion. the executive board also review requisite level risk provision 2014 – case year – and, so, take account current risk situation bundesbank available financial resources. a result review, risk provision remain unchanged €14.4 billion (as previous year). there two main reason run risk provisions. on one hand, risk bundesbank risk-weighted assets, attention hitherto focussed, decline somewhat, since volume refinance loan eurosystem security security market programme (smp) decreased. on hand, additional credit risk arise next two years. these due decision ecb govern council purchase programmes. these chiefly refer asset-backed security purchase programme (abspp) september 2014, cover bond purchase programme (cbpp3). the large-scale government bond purchase programme (pspp) adopt january year negligible impact credit risks. after all, bundesbank primarily purchase federal bonds. at time, cut key interest rate june september 2014 lead decline anticipate annual result 2015 bundesbank’s available financial resources. in net terms, base overall review 2014, change risk provision necessary. we transfer annual surplus full federal government today. the federal government’s budget act 2015 stipulate €2.5 billion bundesbank’s profit use budgetary financing, excess amount use debt repayment. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: speech president sz finance day 2015 speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, sz (süddeutsche zeitung) finance day 2015, frankfurt main, 16 march 2015. * * * summary europe need accelerate way economic institutional convergence. due fall oil prices, accommodative monetary policy successful structural reforms, optimistic economic outlook. the nascent recovery use window opportunity go ahead reform make euro area le fragile vulnerable shocks. economic convergence reach structural reform lead alignment productivity levels. on institutional side, need move system rule guideline national economic policy make system sovereignty share within common institutions. a part process, need strengthen democratic accountability europe towards citizens. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure even able address conference. we meet backdrop steadily recover economic situation euro area. most indicator suggest sustain recovery take hold. confidence among firm consumer rising. growth forecast revise upwards. and bank lend improve demand supply sides. these improvement reflect come together several external internal factors. first, term trade gain firm household arise fall oil prices. second, monetary policy measure take ecb since middle last year, lead significant ease finance condition protect euro area second round effect oil price drop, thus amplify benefits. and third, successful structural reform implement several country recent years, start produce results. these effect look set persist time, mean rightly optimistic outlook. but mean rest laurels. on contrary, nascent recovery provide u window opportunity – condition press ahead reform make euro area le fragile vulnerable shocks. these vulnerability disappear cycle turning. they stem fact union remain incomplete along two dimensions. neither economy institution converge enough. this whenever serious shock part euro area, question sustainability union still arise. so current upturn economic conditions, ecb help generate, must used. it provide favourable environment address once-and-for-all source fragility root – ensure cyclical recovery turn structural one. to achieve this, need press ahead two stream policy. first, need move integration convergence structural reforms. and second, need move rule institution governance reforms. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 1. from integration convergence in euro area structural reform policy choice. they necessity follow special way monetary union constructed. let explain why. monetary union automatically create economic integration financial trade connection deepen. but integration automatically lead economic convergence, i mean gradual alignment productivity levels. this necessarily matter monetary union sort fiscal transfer foreseen. then, growth cluster certain regions, cohesion union maintain transfer rich region poor ones. in us, example, $1 decrease per caput income state/region associate roughly 20–40 cent net transfer federal government residents, bulk adjustment occur tax system. but lack convergence matter fiscal transfer foreseen. in case, cohesion depend every state produce enough growth support citizens’ welfare. otherwise, citizen poor region start question whether might good outside union. and create self-fulfilling fragmentation, repercussion across union country ultimately suffer. the euro area fall squarely second category monetary unions. it create permanent creditor debtors. it create expectation country would able stand two feet, without continuous help others. therefore, convergence union sustainable – every economy need able meet high standard term competitiveness, employment growth. this imperative always understand principle euro area. but always follow practice, see divergence euro area today. this create uncertain half-way position. we integrate much even entertain reverse process – economy far intertwined. but yet converge enough dispel doubt cohesion union guarantee long-term stability. so one answer: make economy convergent today. and context structural reform important. only reform create condition every country allocate resource efficiently, exploit comparative advantage grow. and i say theory, experience. we already see euro area convergence cannot sustain structurally anchored. we rapid convergence nominal gdp level crisis, drive demand without underlie alignment productivity levels. when cycle turned, nominal gain largely reversed. moreover, see convergence gradually restart right structural policy place. those country undertake reform recent year start see positive effect come through. for example, oecd estimate 2012 labour market reform – particular decentralisation wage bargain – responsible 3.2% decline labour cost business sector second quarter 2013, period spain also able gain large export market shares. in portugal, well target efficient active labour market policy able explain one-third employment recovery. and fact extremely accommodative monetary policy disincentive country continue reforms. for example, italy introduce major labour bi central bankers’ speech 3 market reform since ecb announce recent measures. in fact, monetary policy create incentive reform. any country structural reform today see benefit materialise faster, reform strengthen impact monetary policy economy, particular pent-up investment demand. and turn make structural reform easier, strong economy short-term cost reform low – instance transition job fast le risk hysteresis effects. 2. from rule institution still, add fragility union fact that, despite crucial importance structural reforms, remain almost entirely national responsibility. from moment country enter monetary union way guarantee stay fit enough thrive within it. in view change. because cohesion euro area depend country prospering, happen within one national interest, collective interest. every member euro area vital interest ensure partner meet membership requirement – point entry, continuously. indeed, sometimes ask differentiate euro area fix exchange rate regime, answer precisely point. in fix exchange rate regime issue economic integration deal foreign affairs. in monetary union, domestic issue all. and follow need high degree institutional convergence structural domain well. so mean practice? up now, employ two different method economic governance eu. in areas, give european institution executive power. this include ecb monetary policy, ssm (within ecb) financial policy, commission competition policy. in areas, executive power remain national level, policy align system rule enforce commission. this case fiscal economic policies. there course good reason different method applied. but reflect honestly, would say successful? i think would deny european institution invest executive power, use well. competition policy effective large company large countries. monetary policy achieve high degree policy credibility. and ssm perhaps early judge, though i certain would rigorous clean-up bank sector without it. if look rules-based approach, however, difficult reach positive conclusion. the fiscal rule repeatedly break trust country strained. and economic policy try introduce new rules-based approach – macroeconomic imbalance procedure – far gain much traction national decision-making processes. the discrepancy two method arise inherent difference quality european national authorities. it arise inherent difference rule institution monetary union. and two reason i think, go forward, institution-based approach would work good governance structural reforms. first, institution facilitate credible flexible policymaking. 4 bi central bankers’ speech rule really credible apply little discretion. otherwise soon actually bind, country find reason follow them. but discretion also optimal, circumstance always arise rule foresee. there thus inevitable trade-off credibility flexibility. indeed, often end difficult balance act europe – try flexible rule short-term reflect circumstances, rigid rule medium-term build credibility. and ultimately run risk create inconsistency countries, turn weaken trust. by contrast, european institution trade-off less. their policy credible bind mandate. but time use discretion meet mandate, allow flexibility respond events. this “constrained discretion” describe exactly ecb’s response unprecedented low inflation: discretion whether meet mandate, exercise so. i recognise structural reform analogy monetary policy perfect. preference align across country would possible complete delegation powers. but i confident european institution could help two fronts. make easy agree aim structural reform align best practice. and make easy implement use european law bypass vest interests. it clear, however, european governance extend area economic policies, need strong democratic participation accountability european level. there fundamental distributional question stake structural reform cannot simply delegate technocratic bodies. and second reason institutional approach come – institution executive power create clear direct accountability. in euro area government commission principle accountable implement rules. but practice often case government claim little ownership process, divert responsibility outcome commission. yet time commission limit power domain. with effective european institutions, however, possible make direct link decision responsibility. precisely institution invest define powers, citizen hold accountable mandate. and fact, strengthen channel democratic participation vital euro area today. it exactly impression little accountability europe populist party often exploit. in sum, conclusion must quantum leap institutional convergence. we need move system rule guideline national economic policy making, system sovereignty share within common institutions. and part process need strengthen democratic accountability europe towards citizens, would automatically deepen political union. let however clear: absence institutions, rule act crucial anchor confidence. so question rule ignore institution would better. on contrary, fully respect make transition future. we build trust today show agree to, honour. and take next step forward credible partner other. conclusion let conclude. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the euro area advance long way monetary union. we begin single market, single currency single monetary policy. we single supervisor resolution authority. and soon single capital market. but yet advance far enough put question future bed. we need remove linger doubt resurface whenever shock hits. and accelerate economic institutional convergence. our monetary policy help make possible create improve cyclical environment. but government seize opportunity make improvement permanent. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 már guðmundsson: recent economic financial development iceland speech mr már guðmundsson, governor central bank iceland, 54th annual general meet central bank iceland, reykjavík, 26 march 2015. * * * mr. president; speaker parliament, minister finance economic affairs, minister interior, directors, ambassadors; lady gentlemen: we come together today 54th annual general meet central bank iceland. when meet bank’s annual meet five year ago, icelandic economy bottom economic recession follow financial crisis 2008. the future highly uncertain. have economy hit bottom? how strong would upswing be? how much would unemployment rate fall? would able bring inflation back target keep there? how would sizeable debt owe iceland’s central government, households, firms, national economy evolve? how would newly establish domestic-oriented bank fare? wa iceland’s external position sustainable? when would manage lift comprehensive capital control prove necessary crisis? in speech meet five year ago, i list three challenge that, view, icelandic authority face condition prevailing. what i say this: first, critical allow economy adjust without allow inflation unemployment become entrenched. the goal situation economic slack disappeared, economic growth line growth potential output, inflation target, external position economy sustainable. second, must establish financial system serf icelandic household domestic business activity efficient relatively secure. the third challenge re-establishing confidence abroad iceland’s institutional framework, economy, financial system; repair connection foreign financial markets; ensure icelandic government icelandic company access foreign credit market again. the economic recovery begin 2010 meet held. it gain enough momentum that, five years’ time, return pre-crisis gdp level eliminate virtually spare capacity economy. at time, unemployment rate fall sharply close equilibrium value. structural reform could reduce equilibrium unemployment rate still future, however. inflation inflation target present, inflation expectation subside target turn year. treasury debt decline steadily since 2011, outlook trend continue year come. household corporate debt level also decline markedly. the ratio household debt disposable income roughly 2005 levels, ratio corporate debt gdp low since mid-2004. iceland’s external position prove sustainable. the trade surplus around 8% gdp since 2009. this long continuous period surplus 5 % gdp history data, extend back 1875. the current account balance whole average 5.5% gdp per year; is, exclude effect fail bank factor reflect iceland’s financial burden. the current account balance reduce iceland’s debt, cut underlie net external debt almost half since year-end 2008, 45% gdp end 2014. but change fact iceland still face balance payment problem, reflect fact large share debt short-term, part debt take form possibly volatile isk asset hold non-residents. this situation could put substantial pressure 2 bi central bankers’ speech exchange rate central bank’s foreign exchange reserve isk asset free exit country. the three new commercial bank also perform well number areas, see various indicators, include capital ratios, rise 2009 average 16% last year’s average nearly 29%. the initial foreign currency mismatch balance sheet reduce within limit provide central bank rules, domestic foreign liquidity position improved. but bank operate shelter capital controls, look ahead, question concern size efficiency remain extent unanswered. many factor favourable u spite global headwinds, initially reflect mark deterioration term trade still reflect weak economic recovery among trade partners. look back three challenge i mention moment ago, say broad term macroeconomic goal meet thus far. the financial system stand much solid ground. it primarily connection third challenge, reintegrate iceland international capital markets, work need done. but even area make significant progress. gdp growth, balance economy, treasury surplus, central bank’s foreign currency purchase create good condition liberalisation capital controls. the credit rat sovereign commercial bank improved. the sovereign regain access foreign credit market time ago, bank open crack door. but even though make significant progress, game yet won. debt level high, render borrower vulnerable shocks, capital control still place. iceland’s macroeconomic balance good, fragile. on score, face three relatively important risks: first, interaction labour market unrest turnaround output slack positive output gap could undermine price stability turn current account surplus deficit; second, lift capital control could turn badly, negative implication exchange rate stability, inflation, financial system stability; third, global economic situation could turn us. therefore, must avoid complacency, must vigilant safeguard recently achieve stability face three challenge i mention now. in respects, formulate monetary policy complex present, time past. the central bank’s interest rate low 0.75 percentage point final two month 2014, response rapidly fall inflation decline inflation expectation target. since then, inflation drop still further, fall 1% december, trigger submittal report government inflation deviation threshold. even though inflation 1%, central bank’s key interest rate unchanged 4.5% far year. there number reason this. first all, extremely low inflation rate due partly abrupt drop global oil commodity price second half 2014. this drop could prove temporary, even not, beyond scope domestic monetary policy. furthermore, assume real wage rise decline oil price prof long-lived, impact inflation taper off. second, inflation outlook cloud various domestic uncertainties. the slack economy turn around positive output gap. there far unrest labour market might expect view overall macroeconomic condition supply demand labour market. in regard inflation outlook, important factor group demand extremely large pay increase would set inflation motion call strong monetary policy response extend labour market whole. the third reason inflation expectations, subside target begin year, rise recent weeks, probably due unrest labour market. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the labour market situation thought-provoking source concern. wage pressure jeopardise inflation target generally interpret sign positive output gap excess labour demand, call tight monetary stance. yet number factor indicate main explanation current situation. instead, appear consensus wage differential weaken time open labour market vis-à-vis abroad put pressure wage differential – cases, direction opposite demand labour market organisations. a monetary policy committee member gylfi zoëga point recently, great sense cohesion wage distribution society, low unemployment rate consistent low stable inflation. conversely, weak sense cohesion, le individual worker group will participate create public good price stability, high equilibrium unemployment rate be. this theory base partly work ezio tarantelli, one italy’s lead economist second half twentieth century, show u experience far unique. if theory apply current situation iceland – number factor indicate – increase cohesion sense could create condition low unemployment low interest rates, without lose control inflation. whatever reason, situation give rise risk outcome bad society whole, although group may gain others’ expense. in words, situation many others, cooperative solution usually good whole conflict solution. therefore, extremely important party involve – particularly social partner government – make every effort push matter direction. it important decision take wage negotiation next several month base correct information. the report publish jointly social partner last month, entitle in prelude wage negotiations, contain cogent information wage development recent years. accord report, emphasis place low wage recent year bear fruit, least part. for example, office workers’ general labourers’ wage rise period 2006 2014, rise excess general wage index. the report also confirm previously reported, wage productivity per hour work relatively low comparison trade partner country icelandic worker compensate somewhat long work hours. this highlight fact that, long run, increase productivity premise high real wages. in context, weak productivity growth recent year could give cause concern. on hand, also reflect growth labour-intensive sector tourism, support low real exchange rate facilitate rapid decline unemployment would otherwise possible. it also explain part unemployment among young people – fortunately – much low iceland many trade partners. when full employment achieved, productivity growth become important, however. if attempt ease tension labour market unsuccessful wage rise far consistent inflation target, unavoidable respond tighten monetary stance; i.e., raise interest rates. even inflation rise early on, monetary policy committee tool need bring back target medium term. high interest rate negative effect gdp growth employment time, however. real wage real exchange rate rise interaction rise nominal wage tight monetary stance. in addition, firm would probably respond slow recruitment – perhaps even cut back staff. there risk turn event would harmful labour-intensive sector worker whose position labour market weakest. it therefore important find way channel desire improve standard live towards measure 4 bi central bankers’ speech likely generate last result without jeopardise stability economic recovery bring u far. honour guests: the time decisive step towards lift capital control rapidly approaching. some may think step come rather late. this quite understandable. and reason soft-pedal fact capital control harmful icelandic economy. it difficult make sufficiently accurate estimate magnitude negative effects, i sure assessment make thus far would stand close examination. one thing know, however: detrimental effect escalate time passes. but must understand nature scope problem make reasonably fair assessment time pass quickly control lifted. in context, i find helpful explain foreign observer collective collapse iceland’s three large bank think third-largest bankruptcy history. the lehman bankruptcy larger, settlement complete. our settlement take place one small country world associate severe balance payment problem, whereas case lehman, balance payment problem relatively little relevance. another point i make estates’ króna-denominated asset add current stock offshore krónur, combine stock would increase half gdp. of course, let happen, did, new “overhang” would much large proportional term uk’s post-war sterling overhang, total nearly third gdp. it take british four decade lift capital control impose partly reason. the usual way describe problem consider capital likely seek exit soon control lifted. this include fail banks’ estates, potentially volatile isk asset hold non-residents – usually call offshore krónur – possible outflow icelandic resident well. in context, best equip predict would happen control lift estate without mitigate measures, map estate infinitesimal detail. there great uncertainty offshore krónur. follow bank’s foreign currency auction past years, remain capital could hold patient investors, party behind swear faithfully is. but safe verify secure open exit door wide, way it. the great uncertainty centre potential outflow residents. to degree, possible estimate resident investors’ need increase share foreign asset portfolios, naturally, may undertake foreign investment vary tempos. the important factor either way level confidence iceland financial system time control lifted, obviously unknown point. it also major determinant potential inflow non-residents time. it precisely one key factor prepare liberalisation facilitate recognition iceland sound, trustworthy investment option, resident investor – sovereign – access foreign credit market sustainable terms. under current conditions, mean need economy grow equilibrium, internally externally. we need treasury surplus, need reduce treasury debt ratio. we need strong enough national save support normal investment level. give current outlook investment, mean must surplus current account balance payments. we need large enough foreign exchange reserve sustain confidence foreign lenders, maintain credit ratings, cushion u volatility. we need bank system solid resilient. a i mention earlier, well many areas, condition exist improvement current year. the extension maturity landsbankinn’s debt old bank (lbi), finally negotiate towards end last year, improve situation. it enhance possibility expand foreign bi central bankers’ speech 5 exchange reserve increase portion fund foreign credit. in 2014, bank net purchaser foreign currency amount 111 b.kr. so far year, buy currency 30 b.kr., oppose 21 b.kr. period 2014. if maintain pace, buy currency 2015 2014. a result, reserve exceed outstanding foreign-denominated loan take finance – 65 b.kr. end february. but mustn’t rest laurels; need sizeable reserve prepare lift capital controls. i mention uncertainty surround estimation potential fx outflow control lifted. but one thing certain: fail banks’ estate give green light tomorrow could convert krónur foreign currency, happen offshore overhang, way could safeguard stability, let alone bolster confidence, except perhaps long time elapsed. the central bank iceland design model intend ass impact various development balance payment long horizon, include capital account liberalisation measures. when apply instance, model reveal entire foreign exchange reserve would wipe – besides – use shore exchange rate. this would never done, course, therefore currency would depreciate sharply. it clear resident free exit time, would participate run currency, confidence would evaporate quickly, leave u new currency crisis grapple with. of course, extreme scenario respects, estates’ isk assets, instance, liquid point time, portion offshore krónur could patient capital. but give indication kind problem deal with. therefore, need solution safeguard stability prevent additional burden place sovereign icelandic people. such solution exist, large group expert – foreign consultants; task force capital account liberalisation, work steer committee capital controls; expert central bank ministry finance economic affair – work hard develop recent months. i would like take moment thank people tireless effort excellent work. it would premature publicise solution today’s meeting. moreover, within purview own. the liberalisation capital control collaborative project undertake central bank government, actually mean elect representative last word action take – particularly tool use bank’s toolbox. honour guests: i speak length monetary policy labour market, one hand, capital controls, other. but i do purpose, far great economic challenge face u moment. yet central bank’s sphere activity include many function well, least centre structure stability financial system. let u hope that, convene year central bank iceland’s 55th annual general meeting, resolve successfully

work group sterling risk-free reference rates, london, 18 march 2015. * * * over past two half years, bank england firmly commit benchmark reform. much already achieve regulators, administrator market participants. those achievement include wheatley review libor, development iosco principle financial benchmarks, fsb’s recommendation interest rate benchmark reform, recently extension uk regulatory

interest rate benchmarks”. that report recommend “multi-rate” approach involve strengthen exist “ibor” rate (such libor) using, great extent possible, transaction data; develop alternative near risk-free reference rate (rfrs) use derivative contracts. the fsb’s recommendation develop alternative reference rate alongside libor recognise are, broadly speaking, two main application benchmark interest rates: (i) reference rate credit products, include bank loans, thereby help bank hedge unsecured fund costs; (ii) reference rate derivative contracts, whose user likely seek hedge exposure

market event, zurich, 26 march 2015. * * * the speaker would like thank dirk faltin valuable support prepare speech. he also thank marco huwiler peter kuster helpful comments. accompany chart find end speech. lady gentleman a warm welcome traditional money market event zurich. we delight many accept invitation attend. a year ago gathering, i speak swiss national bank’s (snb) investment policy. at time, i touch peripherally monetary policy minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. it come surprise year i decide devote talk exclusively monetary policy. on 15 january year, snb discontinue minimum exchange rate euro. this step attract good deal attention around globe trigger dramatic price movement financial market short time. it significant implication large section switzerland’s economy. for snb, too, decision discontinue minimum exchange rate momentous one. i would like take opportunity explain rationale discontinue minimum exchange rate detail. in so, i shall also outline consequence decision economic outlook price development switzerland. let start remind circumstance surround introduction minimum exchange rate september 2011. after presentation, colleague dewet moser brief u late chapter monetary policy implementation. from financial crisis minimum exchange rate the international financial crisis start almost eight year ago. in august 2007, extreme tension become evident money market. central bank advance economy counter development low key interest rate expand liquidity supply interbank markets. a bank crisis increasingly broaden wide financial economic crisis, demand safe investment – hence also swiss franc – increase rapidly. from end year, franc come substantial upward pressure (cf. chart 1). follow collapse lehman brother autumn 2008, central bank quickly reduce short-term interest rate unprecedented lows. at begin 2009, snb low target range three-month libor 0% 0.75%. the one-week repo rate, use steer libor, already close zero since end 2008. conventional monetary policy – say, steer economy via short-term interest rate – thus come limits. however, fear monetary policy run option unfounded. central bank advance economy increasingly begin resort unconventional instruments. at snb, include long-term repos, purchase swiss franc-denominated bond issue domestic, private-sector borrower intervention foreign exchange market. it worth note snb intervene rarely foreign exchange market early 1980s 2009. and occasion had, snb’s intervention typically small-scale coordinate group ten central banks. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this change march 2009, when, reduce short-term interest rate near zero, snb begin purchase foreign exchange effort counter upward pressure swiss franc prevent undesirable tighten monetary conditions. the first escalation euro area debt crisis spring 2010 require snb make extensive foreign currency purchases; provisionally halt june 2010 economic recovery gain foothold. in first half 2011, situation euro area take another turn worse. other euro area country drag crisis. the global economic outlook deteriorate uncertainty financial market compound u budget dispute. upward pressure swiss franc immense time. in august 2011, real export-weighted swiss franc exchange rate 40% long-term average (cf. chart 2). in august 2011, attempt counter exceptionally strong swiss franc, snb narrow target range libor 0.0% 0.25%, aim keep close zero possible. it also take step expand banks’ sight deposit significantly.1 these measure successful point, however light ongoing uncertainty financial market bad news euro area, upward pressure swiss franc remain high become intense still begin september 2011. the snb therefore decide provide foreign exchange market clear guidance form minimum exchange rate franc euro. on 6 september 2011, announce would long tolerate eur/chf exchange rate chf 1.20. this exceptional measure enable snb take stand acute threat swiss economy counter risk deflationary trend emanate massive overvaluation swiss franc. the minimum exchange rate introduce temporary, emergency measure time extreme turbulence. the franc remain high period followed, yet deflation risk hold check. moreover, minimum exchange rate buy swiss company – especially exporter industry face competition import – time plan next step difficult operate environment. discontinuation minimum exchange rate the minimum exchange rate undoubtedly serve switzerland well exceptional period. however, old adage popular among economist – “there’s thing free lunch” – hold true monetary policy well. the snb govern board well aware introduction minimum exchange rate would entail certain risk – consistently allude these. that snb would make large foreign currency purchase expand currency reserve order enforce minimum exchange rate thus expected. the snb must will bear risk necessary fulfilment legal mandate, risk justify give chance success. we enforce minimum exchange rate consistently three year (6 september 2011 15 january 2015). at peak euro crisis 2012, snb purchase chf 188 billion foreign currency. add purchase prior year reveal snb’s currency reserve rise chf 50.5 billion 2007 1 in august 2011, snb announce would significantly increase supply liquidity swiss franc money market expand banks’ sight deposit snb chf 30 billion chf 80 billion within days. shortly afterwards, snb decide increase banks’ sight deposit substantially, chf 120 billion; step follow – final – increase, time chf 200 billion. bi central bankers’ speech 3 chf 432.2 billion end 2012 (cf. chart 3), prove beyond doubt snb will accept balance sheet risk order enforce monetary policy. last year, snb’s shareholders, confederation canton learn risk real consequences. for year 2013, first time history, snb unable pay dividend distribute profit, fall gold price exchange rate-related loss lead negative annual result. a might expect, decision greet rapturous applause. however, critical point principle snb’s profit distribution agreement call question. people generally recognise accept fact large balance sheet go hand hand high potential loss. despite successfully enforce minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro several years, january 2015 snb conclude measure become untenable therefore long justify monetary policy point view. what lead far-reaching reassessment? let u briefly re-wind 2014. while u expectation interest rate rise mounting, sign monetary policy ease euro area mid-year onwards. the euro subsequently weaken significantly u dollar. this turn affect eur/chf rate, already close minimum exchange rate time. a result, swiss franc largely follow euro downwards. nevertheless, mid-december monetary policy assessment, still convince minimum exchange rate right instrument ensure appropriate monetary conditions. shortly thereafter, however, euro depreciation gather pace sharply, pressure franc increase dramatically. it become clear minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro long tenable. only sustain currency market intervention rapidly increase magnitude would allow snb uphold policy. face fundamental change international conditions, come conclusion minimum exchange rate could maintain uncontrollable expansion balance sheet, potentially even level several time high swiss gdp. the risk associate balance sheet expansion would proportion benefit economy. an uncontrollable expansion balance sheet would severely impair snb’s ability conduct monetary policy future jeopardise fulfilment mandate long term. on one hand, future use currency intervention would severely constrained. on hand, reabsorb huge volume liquidity monetary policy begin normalise would difficult extremely costly. communication time discontinuation the discontinuation minimum exchange rate take financial market surprise price reaction foreign exchange equity market correspondingly strong. in age transparency openness monetary policy matter rid high, decision exit minimum exchange rate policy abruptly bewilder many observers. however, transparency end itself; part monetary policy. traditionally, monetary policy steer via short-term interest rates. these fee exchange rate long-term interest rates, thereby influence – albeit time lag – demand good service and, ultimately, wage price economy. by communicate intention transparently credibly, snb influence expectation (e.g. financial markets), thereby render monetary policy effective. fundamentally, keen avoid surprise economy trigger major price movement financial market monetary policy measures. in context conventional interest rate policy, thus advantageous keep gap financial market participants’ expectation snb’s actual interest rate adjustment within reasonable limits. normally, therefore, contradiction notion transparent communication monetary policy intentions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech but exceptions, discontinuation minimum exchange rate – measure directly link foreign exchange market – one exception. an announcement, even slight hint imminent decision dispense minimum exchange rate, would trigger massive speculation snb. we would force to, was, subsidise speculation via foreign currency purchases. incidentally, argument also explain gradual exit minimum exchange rate “gentle” transition policy involve form explicit exchange rate linkage (e.g. peg swiss franc basket currencies) impractical. such policy would likewise open floodgate speculators. there thus reasonable alternative exit minimum exchange rate suddenly completely. we discuss would best time communicate decision. our choice morning 15 january design allow market participant start level play field adapt undoubtedly challenge new situation. by discontinue minimum exchange rate weekday market participation high, minimise risk bank customer put disadvantage, individual participant gain advantage. at time, would possible establish market access channels, via electronic trade platform phone link trade desk main currency trade firms, widely use – although bottleneck immediately announcement. by contrast, announce move weekend, instance, would cause uncertainty trade condition foreign exchange market open sunday even (swiss time). australia, normally account around 1% daily turnover swiss franc forex operations, would overwhelm volume trade business hours. you easily imagine turbulence australian market would far great observe morning 15 january, contagion potentially spread entire financial market. we want avoid this. monetary policy minimum exchange rate so minimum exchange rate discontinuation mean monetary policy switzerland? first, let emphasise exit minimum exchange rate mean simply passive observer foreign exchange market future. the snb continue take account exchange rate situation formulate monetary policy intervene foreign exchange market necessary order influence monetary conditions. nonetheless, end minimum exchange rate mean interest rate steer take prominent role. in december last year, snb decide first time charge negative interest (–0.25%) banks’ financial market participants’ sight deposit snb. on 15 january – concurrently discontinuation minimum exchange rate – low interest rate again, time –0.75%. this mark interest rate reduction intend cushion blow swiss franc appreciation counter tighten monetary conditions, make significantly expensive hold swiss franc compare currencies. negative interest rate stimulate lively public debate. this hardly surprise give that, form, instrument something novelty central bank deployed.2 apart snb, national bank denmark, sweden’s riksbank 2 switzerland see negative interest rate before: 1970s, negative interest briefly charge form commission foreign fund hold commercial banks. in contrast period, today’s negative interest rate affect sight deposit hold snb bank financial market participants. bi central bankers’ speech 5 european central bank make use negative interest rate date. experience instrument thus relatively limited. today, two month negative interest rate introduced, see measure work desire effect money capital markets. the three-month libor negative territory since announcement, drop low –0.96%; currently roughly middle target range (cf. chart 4). long-term interest rate also fallen, exchange rate pull back extreme value observe immediately follow discontinuation announcement. in trade-weighted terms, swiss franc still least 10% high begin year. overall, swiss franc significantly overvalue weaken time. when discuss structure instrument, deliberation focus interest rate level, also particular exemption threshold negative interest charged. we ultimately conclude threshold calculate accord minimum reserve bank legally oblige hold. this method firmly anchor law clear rule exist. a result, bank large swiss franc hold snb relative size balance sheet bear heavy burden bank low sight deposit balances. the fact bank face differ burden criticise certain quarters. some argued, instance, negative interest rate distort competition. this certainly intention. negative interest monetary policy measure – like form interest rate change – affect different industry company different ways. negative interest intend make le attractive hold large amount liquidity swiss francs. it thus logical monetary policy perspective bank hold large quantity swiss franc liquidity relative size balance sheet shoulder heavy burden. a already mentioned, introduction negative interest rate sight deposit snb also cause longer-term interest rate fall. and yet, live period exceptionally low interest rate around six year already, even long-term investment bear virtually interest. the swiss nation saver many people concern low interest rates. i understand this, however forget really count saver nominal real (i.e. inflation-adjusted) interest rate. for time now, inflation low even negative. if inflation negative, real interest rate high nominal interest rate. a chart 5 shows, often period past real interest rate even low today. during challenge phase swiss economy, important negative interest rate allow take effect help bring weaken swiss franc. effort circumvent negative interest rate obtain exemption shift cash interest switzerland whole current climate. interest rate exchange rate development recent week suggest monetary policy measure gradually gain traction. economic outlook by introduce minimum exchange rate, snb moderate risk adjustment cost swiss economy expose buy time adjust strong franc. we aware discontinuation minimum exchange rate mean switzerland difficult time ahead. the high swiss franc exchange rate – especially speed swiss franc appreciation since discontinuation minimum exchange rate – particularly challenge exporter industry face competition imports. 6 bi central bankers’ speech in 2014, swiss economy record year-on-year growth 2%. this increase slightly long-term potential growth reflect robust state economy. the exit minimum exchange rate lead deterioration economic conditions. we thus expect much modest expansion real economic output year 1%. a noticeable weaken economy may expected, particularly first half year. in short term, significant underutilisation production capacity may expect unemployment likely increase moderately. there course particularly high degree uncertainty attach forecasts. for one thing, depend swiss franc exchange rate evolve come months. for another, certain international condition develop. the u economy robust today 2011. the late gdp figure euro area reassuring, although situation remain difficult. in addition, substantial fall oil price ease effect. despite this, risk – notably debt dispute greece rest euro area, well crisis ukraine – inconsiderable. in long term, i confident economy able cope swiss franc appreciation. the currency strong past, tendency appreciate. while strong currency expression sound economy, also present company major challenges, appreciate franc mean high price foreign customer buy swiss firms. in order remain competitive, disadvantage continuously offset adaptability, quality innovation. various competitiveness innovation indicator suggest swiss company successful score past; country regularly rank among leader category (cf. chart 6). these find inspire optimism, however important remember two things. first, deal average here. when come manage new currency landscape, option available individual industry company vary greatly; so, turn, impact swiss franc strength.3 second, extent recent swiss franc appreciation present switzerland’s economy exceptional challenge certainly underestimated. but one thing clear: entrepreneurial think remain important. we utmost respect entrepreneurialism employee call upon support adjustments. inflation outlook let turn inflation outlook. the snb’s mandate ensure price stability medium term, take due account economic developments. we remain commit maintain price stability decision exit minimum exchange rate alter mandate way. last year, inflation rate – measure consumer price index (cpi) – hover around zero. this year, inflation decline well negative territory. this first foremost due two factors: swiss franc appreciation since discontinuation minimum exchange rate sharp fall oil prices. last year, oil price fell 40% swiss francs. accord economist’s rule thumb, translate decline cpi inflation almost 1 percentage point. the low inflation witness thus large part attributable collapse oil prices. the important thing remember effect swiss franc appreciation oil price drop temporary. they jeopardise price stability. 3 cf. bäuerle, g. e. steiner (2013): “how individual sector respond macroeconomic shocks? a structural dynamic factor approach apply swiss data”, snb work paper no. 9, 2013, drechsel, d. et al. (2015): “how firm affect exchange rate shocks? evidence survey base impulse responses”, kof work paper no. 371, january 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 7 we revise forecast downwards current year, –0.1% –1.1%. inflation expect reach low point third quarter 2015, –1.2%. we anticipate inflation –0.5% 2016. a see chart 7, inflation move back positive territory start 2017. these forecast assume three-month libor remain –0.75% entire forecast horizon, swiss franc weakens. our forecast show period negative inflation temporary. the snb’s monetary policy strategy provide positive inflation rate 2% medium term. so long inflation rate return range medium term, price stability threatened. the important thing medium-term inflation expectation remain within range compatible price stability. while inflation expectation decline substantially, still positive territory. this confirm regular survey third-party providers, well conversation snb’s delegate regional economic relation company representative sector economy. sustain negative inflation, even deflationary spiral – negative feedback loop involve economic downtrend fall price level – thus expected. close remark in conclusion, let reiterate minimum exchange rate introduce exceptional temporary measure period unprecedented turmoil financial market global economy. it serve switzerland well three years, partially correct massive overvaluation swiss franc. last year, monetary policy euro area switzerland increasingly begin diverge. this reflect sharp depreciation euro u dollar. a minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro thus long sustainable. the high rise volume currency intervention would necessary maintain minimum exchange rate would result uncontrollable expansion snb’s balance sheet. in long term, would severely restrict room manoeuvre monetary policy matters, turn ability fulfil mandate. give prevail international conditions, negative interest rate – willingness intervene foreign exchange market necessary – give u tool ensure price stability medium term. see current perspective, too, threat price stability medium long term. the impact appreciation consumer price temporary, although may linger time. a regard economic developments, aware discontinuation minimum exchange rate mean difficult time ahead switzerland. we every confidence switzerland’s economy economic agent rise challenge adjust strong swiss franc. the last year provide impressive illustration exceptionally adaptable country’s entrepreneur are. the swiss franc significantly overvalue expect weaken time, does, substantial – abrupt – appreciation currency present considerable challenges. i repeat: my colleague govern board i great respect business community whose task make difficult adjustments. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: welcome remark – bundesbank conference debt financial stability welcome remark dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, bundesbank conference debt financial stability, frankfurt main, 27 march 2015. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman i welcome bundesbank conference debt financial stability. it pleasure here. the financial crisis euro-area sovereign debt crisis certainly taint notion debt. listen discussion economic effect debt, one could get impression debt shorthand “destroying economy big time”. and certainly, notion debt dangerous cannot dismissed. leverage seem crucial ingredient financial crisis – matter financial stability may size bubble, funded. seminal work kiyotaki moore1 well bernanke, gertler gilchrist2 1990s shed light credit amplify shock economy. in downturn, deteriorate balance sheet borrower lender constrict new lending, turn curtail investment hence worsen downturn. so, much debt dangerous. but remain equally true debt indispensable. it allow someone idea without capital follow idea, thereby enable wealth creation otherwise would happened. many study show financial development growth go hand hand.3 do away debt option. rather, debt, like many economic issues, question “yes” “no”, question “how” “how much” – goldilocks issue. or, former bi chief economist stephen cecchetti colleague madhusudan mohanty fabrizio zampolli put it: “debt two-edged sword. use wisely moderation, clearly improve welfare. but, use imprudently excess, result disaster.” the question naturally arises: how much “just right”, say word goldilocks? cecchetti, mohanty zampolli4 come concrete numbers. they find household debt go beyond 85% gdp, become drag growth. the threshold apply government debt, figure corporate debt slightly high 90%. accord estimates, euro area already danger zone – least regard public debt stand 91% corporate debt 105%. household debt currently stand 62%. some caveat order here, though. correlation necessarily equal causation. doe debt slow growth, slowdown growth cause 1 n kiyotaki j moore (1997). “credit cycles.” journal political economy 105 (2), 211–248. 2 b bernanke, m gertler s gilchrist (1996). “the financial accelerator flight quality”, review economics statistic 78 (1): 1–15. 3

effect debt.” bi work paper no 352. 2 bi central bankers’ speech debt-gdp ratio rise? the policy implication would different, depend really drive what. and identify turn point econometric model notoriously tricky business. the threshold present bi researcher probably take precise estimate growth fall cliff, rather one piece grow body evidence much debt harmful growth little. this growth slowdown either take form gradual tectonic shift, high level debt weigh new investment. or take form explosive eruption, witness global financial crisis. and form raise serious question policymakers, mainly latter today’s conference address, since financial stability part central banks’ remit. for reason i outlined, would probably futile undertake try pinpoint exactly debt start subtract rather add economic welfare. in end, amount form financial intermediation determine market forces. it therefore important market process function efficiently possible. and regulator come in. it job make sure regulatory treatment debt give rise incentive endanger financial stability. and job make sure that, thing still go wrong, financial sector still deliver important service real economy. a financial crisis euro-area sovereign debt crisis shown, ample room improvement here. in particular, need ensure actor bear responsibility respective decisions. to me, three issue special relevance regard: question bail-in vs. bail-out, regulatory treatment sovereign debt, tax preference debt equity. 2. bail-in vs. bail-out let start question debate heatedly since crisis break out: issue bail-in vs. bail-out. the financial sector unique malfunction sector impair function sector economy. and crisis serve stark reminder malfunction cannot rule out. some form protection therefore call – otherwise, innocent bystander real economy inevitably get hurt. depend kind malfunctioning, central bank might able provide protection. if issue temporary dry-up liquidity, act lender last resort supply necessary fund – interim basis. but issue one solvency, central bank role play, taxpayers’ money might ultimately stake. rather, politician decide whether let bank fail not. provide insurance form bail-out come obvious moral hazard problems. if bank know big fail, tempt make insurance take excessive risks, expense society large. a bank england’s chief economist andy haldane put it: “only bank control right incentive wrong combine uncomfortably.” instead public provide cost-free insurance banks, onus bank insure failure. only risk reward align way serf public good. or, predecessor axel weber like say: “we need put market back financial markets.” bi central bankers’ speech 3 two aspect crucial here: loss-absorbing capacity bank – is, capital – resolvability. with regard capital, lot already done. basel iii increase considerably demand both: quantity quality bank capital. but enough? second, capital rule bind today risk-weighted. a general rule, make sense: otherwise, bank incentive invest risky assets. but risk-weighting also mean potentially two way sufficiently high capital ratio may come about: high equity low risk weights. if meet requirement base latter, capital buff might prove mirage push come shove. this supplement risk-weighted approach unweighted capital ratio: leverage ratio. from year on, bank require disclose leverage ratio. but transparency alone enough. now, need make sure final calibration, leverage ratio become bind pillar 1 requirement 2018. but capital shield loss point. and case, business model long viable, bank must allow fail – otherwise, incentive stunt bank manager exercise prudence improve efficiency. regard development resolution regimes, progress made, although country others. one crucial issue still need resolved: establishment common standard bail-inable capital, so-called total loss absorb capacity, tlac. here, imperative insurance really call upon needed. and mean bank discourage hold bail-in debt another bank, event system-wide financial crisis, insurance provide less-leveraged market participants. otherwise, crisis might spread instead contained. 3. the treatment sovereign debt the importance realign risk return come fore regard yet another issue: regulatory treatment sovereign debt, second financial stability facet debt i would like touch upon. currently, proposal end preferential treatment sovereign debt deal way physical exercise is. everybody agree it’s good thing theory. but practice, it’s hard get couch. hence, now, sovereign debt denominate advance country’s currency still consider risk-free. danièle nouy recently grasp nettle point out: “sovereigns risk-free assets. that demonstrated, react.” i wholeheartedly concur repeatedly ask put issue regulatory agenda. sovereign debt need back capital, exposure single sovereign must capped, case private debtor. i welcome regulatory treatment sovereign debt discuss basel committee. but discussion fail produce agreement, need move forward european solution. in contrast jurisdictions, eurosystem good reason forbid act lender last resort governments. the risk profile euro-area sovereign debt therefore different. 4. the tax deductibility interest a benjamin franklin famously said, nothing certain except death taxes. but actually, timeless quip apply debt. interest expense tax-deductible, equity disbursement not. 4 bi central bankers’ speech how sensitive bank difference tax treatment? a study5 imf economist suggest sensitive firm. what imply leverage banks? the imf economist estimate abolish preferential tax treatment debt would raise average unweighted bank equity 2.2 4.2 percentage points. even though author caution effect likely low big banks, number sizable measure, especially consider propose basel iii leverage ratio 3%. do away preferential tax treatment debt could therefore provide major boon financial stability. 5. conclusion lady gentlemen, debt like oxygen: indispensable economic life, overdose it, first get high, faint. air quality regulation make great stride last decades, least advance countries. i hope replicate regulatory progress regard debt well. and i confident today’s conference contribute process. 5 r a de mooij, m keen m oriharai (2013). “taxation, bank leverage, financial crises”. imf work paper no. 13/48. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben broadbent: the economics deflation speech mr ben broadbent, deputy governor monetary policy bank england, imperial college business school, london, 27 march 2015. * * * the cpi february year high february 2014. this first time uk fail record positive annual inflation 50 years. inflation briefly negative late 1959 early 1960. before then, go back early 1930s, agony great depression, find period uk consumer price fell sustain period (chart 1 plot three-year roll average inflation). because depth economic downturn time, recent stagnation japan, weakness price inflation today raise fear quarter risk sustain deflation country. the mpc’s objective simply prevent price falling: ensure rise target rate 2% year. because attention it’s getting, however, i’m go focus today negative inflation specifically. i’ll divide substance remark two. one part discus basic economics – matter price decline protract period – other, frequency implication deflation historical data. chart 1 deflation last see 1930s within first section two point i’ll try get across. one distinction price buy (consumer prices) price sell (mainly wages). for moment it’s first that’s fall second: drop inflation drive largely something significantly boost real income (the sharp decline commodity prices). it term “good” deflation and, unlikely go long, positive, negative, demand output. there risk fall price become generalise sustained. if – second point economics – matter deflation per se capacity monetary policy respond it. source: ons hills,thomas, dimsdale (2010). there circumstances, particular appropriate “neutral” real interest rate clearly positive, it’s entirely unexpected, mild deflation wouldn’t pose problem. i think britain precisely position much classical gold standard period, second half 19th century (you see chart 1 period deflation common time; shall see, didn’t appear especially damage output growth). deflation become problem if, conjunction zero low bind nominal interest rates, prevent monetary authority set real short rate that’s sufficiently low ensure stable growth. 2 bi central bankers’ speech follow financial crisis, course, develop world exactly position: neutral real rate interest extremely depressed, official interest rate push zero low bind central bank employ unconventional mean ease monetary policy. be occur right now, sustain deflation would therefore pose risk time neutral real rate higher. but, view, risk nonetheless relatively contained. for one thing i think evidence suggest unconventional policy effective: even don’t circumvent entirely, asset purchase help soften constraint zero low bound. second, financial system gradually improve guess neutral real rate interest likely rise fall next couple years. third, importantly, i think chance sustain widespread deflation case low. that’s certainly international experience suggests. that experience substantial: annual cpi data since 1960 70 countries, total 3,000 data points. in 70 case (barely 2% sample) consumer price actually fall majority inflation positive follow year. of 24 instance price fall one year, four – two japan, two bahrain – occur develop country peg exchange rates. in fact, there’s general tendency change inflation persistent exchange rate fixed. at least policy degree credibility, deviation inflation tend peter relatively rapidly country independent monetary policies. in part may reflect precisely freedom ease policy that, it’s rule exchange rate peg, may nonetheless compromise zero low bound. at least begin conduct qe, almost decade economy begin turn down, japan clearly position. but i suspect it’s also because, there’s independent credible policy, risk inflation expectation become “de-anchored” target low begin with. a i say, u target 2%, zero. even current undershoot due mostly effect level cpi sharp drop commodity prices, therefore pass effect rate growth, central expectation inflation still target year’s time. all else equal, probably need see stable price commodity tradable good we’re meet target reasonable horizon, acceleration domestic cost well. while that’s central forecast february inflation report entails, mpc obviously watchful, meantime, sign “good” deflation turn something worse. but over-state risks. the cost deflation: income interest rate matter something one hear quite often deflation problem “because encourage people postpone consumption”. deflation – precisely expectation price fall – therefore weaken demand, said, lead vicious circle price depress further. a far go truth it. but it’s best partial description problem, bad bite misleading. it leaf two important considerations. one nominal income. suppose you’re tell price fall next year value income remain unchanged. all else equal, prospect fall price give incentive save income (i.e. postpone bite consumption). at time, real value income prospectively risen. on bi central bankers’ speech 3 estimate various sensitivity second effect dominate first consumption actually rise1, even price cut actually arrive. conversely, price fall simultaneously, include price labour (the nominal wage), there’s boost real income offset increase tendency save. not that, fall nominal income would also expose economy potentially much serious risk, namely rise burden debt. because principal fix nominal terms, shortfall cash income make debt hard service, increase risk financial instability pressure debtor cut back spending. it’s “debt deflation” channel, emphasise originally irving fisher study depth ben bernanke, amongst others, think main cost fall price wage great depression. it’s therefore important understand whether “deflation” happen simply there’s sharp drop price something buy – oil, say – whether it’s generalise phenomenon nominal income falling. the important factor interest rates. the incentive save depend inflation expectation per se (ex ante) real rate interest. a long nominal interest rate high inflation – that’s case history, often – forego £1 spend today buy £1’s worth spend tomorrow. so “postponement” effect doesn’t suddenly appear expect inflation dip zero: it’s always there, vary degrees, depend extent expect inflation lie nominal rate interest, i.e. real interest rate. indeed, it’s partly tweak incentive save, via short-term real rate, monetary policy theory suppose work. if confidence future suddenly declines, example – something would tend push rate save – central bank tend react low interest rate push back opposite direction, order sustain demand. the appropriate real interest rate therefore change time. and relevant question, context, much whether people expect sort deflation, whether expect pace exceed whatever appropriate real interest rate time2. if happen, policy would run zero low bind nominal rate central bank find reach unconventional policy tools. similarly, debt dynamic drive nominal income growth isolation growth compare nominal interest rates3. if two fall rise fall together – extent nominal interest rate accommodate movement nominal income growth – there’s impact debt accumulation: whatever proportion income need service debt beforehand sufficient fact. it’s income growth fall lot 1 economist call sensitivity consumption change relative price time “inter-temporal elasticity”. that coefficient poorly measure data usually find relatively small significantly le one. at time, permanent gain real income should, even it’s expect arrive year now, prompt immediate almost one-for-one response spend today. so, least principle, positive “income effect” prospective drop price – hold fix nominal pay – expect outstrip negative “inter-temporal substitution effect”. 2 if appropriate real rate r* central bank would ideally want set nominal rate r*+ πe, second term inflation expectations. but nominal rate can’t low zero – whatever number, close zero, constitute effective low bind – r*+ πe < 0 actual real rate high be. note happen either πe well zero if, case since crisis, happen r*. 3 if b ratio debt income growth rate give r−g−s/b, r ex post interest rate, g growth rate income proportion income use pay debt. so g fall r either debt start rise fast income debtor must save more; r g change magnitude b don’t to. 4 bi central bankers’ speech interest rate, therefore service debt require much income people expected, problem arise4. when (mild) deflation doesn’t matter: high neutral real rate i think see importance consideration uk, recent history and, happens, much distant period. in second half 19th century, first world war, britain much advance world gold standard: price gold fix £3.83/oz. deflation commonplace. discovery gold occur intermittently, global economy – therefore demand currency – generally expanding, real price often come upward pressure. with nominal price fixed, way could happen denominator real price – price good service – declined. thus uk consumer price fell significantly 1840s, example, late 1850s; also fell 1880s (chart 2). and although real pay tend grow time, deflation sometimes severe enough mean nominal wage declined. chart 2 deflation common gold standard however, there’s evidence especially severe effect economy. to sure, low inflation associate weak gdp growth, low wage growth high unemployment (charts 3 4). but doesn’t look anything particularly bad negative inflation: far one tell, economic cost move zero –1% (say), whether price wage space, wasn’t bad involve go 5% 4% (for example5). one reason may people adapt regime – use idea prices, even nominal wages, occasionally declined, thing therefore flexible, didn’t take especially severe recession get happen. source: ons hills,thomas, dimsdale (2010). 4 the low bind nominal interest rate may relevant context too: unite state wage growth average -13% 1929

standard allow significant degree monetary autonomy: might number explanation pro-cyclicality real short-term interest rate not, large, matter free choice central bank (obstfeld et al (2005); recent interest discussion, see also morys (2012)). my point that, low neutral real rate, gold standard would deliver bad outcome coordinate downturn low bind may constraint. 6 bi central bankers’ speech perhaps authority time lucky run zero low bound. but i think episode illustrate even protract decline price needn’t especially costly if, whatever reason, appropriate real interest rate relatively

deflation rare, especially country float currency that doesn’t mean rest entirely easy. in particular, would wrong blithely assume positive nominal income growth continue, come may. deflation start somewhere risk fall price beget yet weak even negative wage growth – today’s “good” deflation metastasise something good deal worse. bordo classify “bad” disinflation coincide recessions, “ugly” episode steep generalise fall nominal quantities, ugly presence large gross debts. however, view chance outcome relatively low. i say partly base effect naturally give big positive impetus annual inflation early 2016. “core” inflation still run 1% and, bar another steep decline food energy price next year, headline inflation likely rise quite steeply early 2016. i’m also strike rarity persistent deflation past15, particularly amongst country independent monetary policy. a we’ve seen, long period fall price perfectly common gold standard. that’s inevitable commodity peg if, period time, commodity fix supply. the true country time and, infamously, great depression. it britain come gold, 1931, nominal income start accelerate16. and since second world war, abandonment commodity

rates, bahrain – somewhat famously – japan experience protract deflations, twice (chart 12b). this common occurrence. a credible monetary policy reduce persistence movement inflation why might deflation rare country float exchange rates, emerge economies, provide reassurance today? yes, i think – degree. one plausible reason pattern country fix exchange rate give autonomy control rate inflation. instead, domestic inflation determine (i) inflation country exchange rate fix (most often us) (ii) force affect real exchange rate. those force often important emerge markets: term trade move around also subject volatile financial flow develop countries. shock would tend depress nominal exchange rate, free fall – drop term trade, example, heighten risk aversion capital flight – instead show negative inflation18. it’s volatility that’s higher, however: turn shock inflation also persistent country fix exchange rate (chart 13; see also monacelli gali (2005)). and may simply reflect particular disturbance affect equilibrium real exchange rate – perhaps play time – it’s also possible persistence inflation owe something lack stable domestic objective monetary policy. in theories, wage price-setting forward looking: high (low) expectation inflation future drag (depress) actual inflation today. that’s precisely central bank concern stability inflation expectations. it’s also credible inflation target degree self-regulating. if people expect inflation generally target, medium term, central bank le actively ensure it. notably, persistence movement uk inflation

away nominal interest rate, i.e. real interest rate. by measure – even use near-term household survey measure inflation expectation – real rate extremely low, still negative (chart 15). the extensive empirical evidence “inter-temporal substitution” channel case relatively weak – governor point recently, important threat, particularly develop economy large balance sheets, debt deflation. and regard, it’s gap interest rate nominal income growth matters. notably, nominal income growth decline late. real interest rate still need low. our inflation target 2% zero: make current position “good” low inflation per se fact that, particular instance, it’s cause something (a drop oil prices) improve real incomes. even though direct effect decline drop annual comparison late year early 2016,

policy response might appropriate insurance downside risks. one insurance device come specification inflation target itself. even risk inflation asymmetric, central banks’ inflation target typically not. this reduce risk monetary policy impart “deflationary bias”. the mpc’s mandate crystal clear: deviation 2% inflation target treat symmetrically. in open letter chancellor early year, mpc make clear would act symmetrically meet inflation target.15 a second insurance policy downside inflation risk come clearly specify horizon inflation expect return target follow deviation. provide horizon credible, reduce risk inflationary expectation become dislodge target persistent basis. in uk, inflation-targeting regime require mpc specify horizon expect inflation return target deviate one percentage point. in open letter early year, mpc state judge appropriate set policy inflation would likely return target within two years. that intend provide clear horizon mpc’s action anchor inflation expectations.16 a third potential source policy insurance come make clear that, necessary inflationary grind two-year horizon, monetary policy could ease further. if monetary policy perceive constrain downside – example, zero low bind interest rate – could affect agents’ perception distribution inflation risk, would skew downside. at time open letter, mpc state variety tool available ease

adoption); (3) october 2014 (the late month publication biannual outlook economic activity prices); (4) january 2015 (the late forecast point). a median forecast often regard mostly reflect bank’s baseline scenario, i proceed explanation bank’s baseline scenario base median. 2 bi central bankers’ speech if one review bank’s medium-term forecast economic activity prices, evident rather large downward revision period (chart 2). the also true medium-term relatively cautious forecasts, consistently low median real gdp growth core cpi inflation since introduction qqe april 2013. it natural central bank revise forecast give change assumption respect domestic external conditions. nevertheless, since revision large, i feel necessary provide clear explanation developments. thus, i provide view area follow sections. b. revision bank’s outlook economic activity downward revision growth forecast fiscal 2014 in chart 2, one feature may attract attention large revision make economic growth fiscal 2014 – 1.4 percent april 2013 forecast point minus 0.5 percent recently. four main reason may give here. first, downward revision take place mainly owe greater-than-expected decline private spend cause consumption tax hike april 2014 well weaker-than-expected subsequent recovery pace. the decline private consumption (especially durable goods) residential investment attributable reaction front-loaded increase prior tax hike decline real (disposable) income, mainly associate tax hike. the adverse impact tax hike turn great project – perhaps difficult grasp structural change economic social structure occur previous tax hike 1997. those change include following: (1) increase number pensioner temporary cut pension benefit fiscal 2013–15 (owing dissolution special level pension benefits); (2) continue decline resultant low level per-capita nominal income prevalent even wage increase since fiscal 2014 (as result grow number nonregular worker long spell restrain wage growth regular workers). in regard, i repeatedly emphasize bank recognize pace improvement employment income situation downside risk. it clear risk materialize play major role downward revision bank’s outlook. in words, decline domestic demand result real income drop (the keynesian effect) appear exceed increase domestic demand drive improve sentiment toward sustainability fiscal balance social security system (the non-keynesian effect). in addition, bad weather condition adversely affect private consumption july-october 2014. thereafter, however, private consumption start recover gradually adverse impact tax hike waned. residential investment also appear le bottom out. second, sharp depreciation yen bring limit gain export volume, thus fail offset substantial decline domestic demand cause tax hike. the tepid export performance due following: (1) shift overseas production, accelerate phase yen’s sharp appreciation; (2) loss price competitiveness manufacture sectors; (3) weak recovery global demand. the limit growth export volume produce benefit manufacture small medium-sized enterprise (smes), generally operate supplier part intermediate good large domestic manufacture firms; latter gain profit partly drive valuation effect. since second half 2014, meanwhile, export volume begin rise moderately, reflect gain price competitiveness relatively strong economic recovery unite states. third, two factor major reason downward revisions, business fix investment also rise much projected. this partly end support widely-used software program tighten gas emission bi central bankers’ speech 3 regulation apply construction machinery produce front-loaded increase purchase personal computer construction machinery april 2014; follow subsequent decline purchases. moreover, firm postpone plan expand business fix investment owe greater-than-expected accumulate inventory (especially consumer durable goods). currently, however, investment continue recover, inventory stock begin fall, industrial production start rise. fourth, potential economic growth rate trend downward historically, still remain 0.5 percent despite moderate recent increase (chart 3). this may one reason accord various opinion surveys, many household felt sign economic recovery. that could contribute sluggish pace domestic demand recovery. the decrease potential economic growth consider consequence demographics, deceleration total factor productivity (tfp) growth, decline capital stock (driven delay investment). moreover, unemployment rate already drop around 3 percent – level close natural unemployment rate – along decline working-age population, labor shortage increasingly evident. the labor shortage favorably contribute creation new employment nominal income growth; however, also incur constraint economic growth allow mainly smes firm nonmetropolitan area lose opportunity expand continue businesses. for example, owe severe shortage skilled worker engineers, construction sector prevent adequately expand volume build construction start response front-loaded order placement public investment april-june 2014. instead, sector face rapid increase unit operate price cause rise personnel expense cost construction materials. regard residential investment, decline real interest rate generate qqe help stimulate potential demand mortgage loans. conversely, increase house price cause rise construction cost partially discourage residential investment ordinary households. nonetheless, let stress economic growth rate fiscal 2014 could even low without qqe. corporate profit well employment income situation might le favorable current level. qqe bring negative real interest rate promote following: (1) wealth effect, example stock real estate; (2) diversification finance source firms; (3) correction yen’s excessive appreciation (chart 4). these effects, turn, give rise various positive development activate firms’ fix investment price behavior, financial institutions’ lend investment behavior, individual investors’ incentive manage financial assets, inbound tourism. therefore, although downward revision bank’s economic outlook, i believe effectiveness qqe questioned. upward revision growth forecast fiscal 2015 2016 by contrast, bank’s forecast economic growth fiscal 2015 adjust upward significantly 1.5 percent april 2013 forecast point 2.1 percent recent forecast. the upward revision natural since reflect adjustment process return bigger-than-expected decline previous year. in addition, reason degree upward revision particularly large late january 2015 forecast, i personally view follow four factor incorporated: (1) improvement corporate profit resultant great active business fix investment (owing crude oil price drop lag impact yen’s depreciation since november 2014); (2) gradual recovery overseas (owing crude oil price drop) resultant positive effect export japan; (3) increase real income resultant expansion private consumption (driven crude oil price drop postponement second round consumption tax hike); (4) expect positive effect government’s economic measure base supplementary budget fiscal 2014. the recent 4 bi central bankers’ speech forecast economic growth fiscal 2016 also revise upward 1.6 percent, partly shift front-loaded increase spend fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016 result postponement second round tax hike. i project potential growth rate rise gradually toward somewhat 1 percent end fiscal 2016. this occur mainly accumulation capital stock, improvement tfp growth, reallocation labor force – corporate sector restructure great focus high value-added good services. it also expect government make great effort implement growth strategy reform aim promote great labor participation female elderly persons. c. revision bank’s outlook price let address bank’s outlook prices. the bank’s forecast rate increase core cpi fiscal 2014 revise downward 1.4 percent april 2013 forecast point 0.9 percent recent forecast (chart 2). the downward revision due following: (1) greater-than-expected base effect; (2) delay improvement output gap, see unexpected deterioration two consecutive quarter since april-june 2014, although around zero percent (chart 3); (3) slower-than-expected increase inflation expectations; (4) decline crude oil price since around july 2014. these factor delay time rate inflation resume rise trend fiscal 2014 latter half fiscal 2015. the adjustment fiscal 2014 also contribute forecast rate inflation fiscal 2015, revise downward significantly 1.9 percent april 2013 forecast point 1 percent recent forecast – primarily decline crude oil prices. the bank currently estimate contribution energy item range minus 0.7 percent minus 0.8 percent core cpi. it project downward pressure price cause crude oil price drop diminish gradually toward middle fiscal 2015. subsequently, rate inflation project accelerate sharply around second half fiscal 2015 approach close around 2 percent end fiscal year several reasons. first, pace improvement output gap great envisage april 2013 forecast point due upward revision economic growth forecast. second, lag impact yen’s depreciation november 2014. third, pace increase inflation expectation also great initially projected, resume rise trend. in words, forecast fiscal 2014 2015 reflect bank’s view underlie price development remain intact. first, though effect decline crude oil price consider temporary, positive support economic activity result improvement output gap, thereby eventually reinforce longer-term upward pressure core cpi inflation. second, inflation expectation infer market data exhibit decrease recent months, unite state europe, inflation expectation infer various survey remain roughly constant. third, spring wage negotiation fiscal 2015 currently ongoing. the japan trade union confederation demand 2 percent increase base salary, japan federation economic organization express willingness make great effort raise wages. these positive development may sign firms’ households’ price perception relate economic behavior gradually adjust moderately inflationary environment. it expect force generate sufficient upward pressure price rate inflation accelerate around 2 percent end fiscal 2015. this bank maintain view rate likely reach 2 percent around middle projection period, is, around fiscal 2015. the forecast fiscal 2016 thus remain largely unchanged rate increase core cpi exceed 2 percent. bi central bankers’ speech 5 d. risk factor relate bank’s baseline scenario next, let explain view upside downside risk important factor may affect bank’s late outlook. regard risk relate bank’s outlook economic activity, i pay particular attention external factors, include unstable financial commodity market economic development abroad, may work upside downside risks. in europe, uncertainty regard impact drop crude oil prices, debt problems, low inflation, geopolitical issue business fix investment employment conditions. in unite states, economic recovery solid. the normalization process monetary policy federal reserve notable, especially regard effect domestic economy markets, well global capital flow economies. the continue economic recovery unite state smooth implementation exit policy moderate increase crude oil price likely generate upside risks. regard risk associate domestic factors, i believe high degree uncertainty respect extent increase business fix investment domestic consumption response high corporate profit real income growth. first, may take time improve significantly sentiment household face difficulty follow sharp drop real income fiscal 2014. second, household may allocate high portion increase income save regard temporary windfall gain expect future permanent income growth. third, households’ firms’ economic growth expectation may rise unless government’s growth strategy make progress. concern sustainability social security system fiscal balance may undermine households’ firms’ incentive spending. in respect, local governments, firms, financial institution gradually take advantage accommodative financial environment generate qqe government’s economic policy structural reform energize local economy firms’ competitiveness innovation. whether remarkable progress make remain uncertain – term upside downside risks. turn view risk relate bank’s outlook prices, i pay particular attention follow three type risks. first, crude oil price decline may low price directly reduction import energy prices, may also low price indirectly, decrease overall import price cause global disinflation. second, though rise income (nominal real) resultant improvement households’ sentiment may make easy firm charge high sale prices, firm may low contain sale price acquire great market share presence fierce domestic competition. third, inflation expectation may remain sluggish throughout fiscal 2015 time expectation resume rise may delayed. alternatively, expectation could become unstable household particular heavily affect actual price movement daily necessity gasoline, i indicate later. finally, view, give qqe already expand october 2014, temporary reduction core cpi inflation acceptable long underlie price development recovery process domestic demand continue. nonetheless, time rate inflation approach around 2 percent entail great uncertainty, include possible delay bank’s late forecast. iii. overview inflation expectation japan a. underlie price development earlier, i mention bank regard underlie price development remain unchanged despite fall actual inflation rate. here, i first explain clearly bank mean underlie price developments. generally, underlie price development assess output gap medium- long-term inflation expectations, typically monitor core cpi – assess 6 bi central bankers’ speech exclude volatile item (that is, fresh food case bank). of course, relationship reflect trend income growth firms’ price-setting behavior. however, core cpi indicator monitored. the bank look wide range price indicators, include 10 percent trim mean, laspeyres chain index, ratio item whose price rise core cpi item (the rising-cpi item ratio), breakdown item cpi. producer price index, service producer price index, commodity price also closely monitored. the core cpi, 10 percent trim mean, laspeyres chain index show decline since middle 2014. by contrast, rising-cpi item ratio remain unchanged (chart 5). in practice, whether underlie price development remain unchanged could assess observe whether (1) price wide range item increasing, (2) rise persistent, (3) medium- long-term inflation expectation whole increase least remain stable. currently, rising-cpi item ratio indicate persistent increase price widely observe 60 percent item cover core cpi. on medium- long-term inflation expectations, market-based indicator – break-even inflation (bei) inflation swap rate – decline past months, become constant begin rise recently (chart 6). moreover, survey-based indicator firms, households, economist remain le stable, note early (chart 7). b. medium- long-term inflation expectation major central bank clear inflation target conduct monetary policy achieve around 2 percent medium term. under so-called flexible inflation-targeting framework, temporary deviation actual inflation target accepted. this permissible long natural tendency actual inflation converge around 2 percent. in assess whether tendency prevails, medium- long-term inflation expectation play essential role. if expectation remain stable (or “anchored”) around 2 percent, actual inflation likely converge around 2 percent – even actual inflation fluctuate around target. in environment, wage negotiation firms’ price-setting behavior likely determine base expectation approximately 2 percent inflation. such economy could refer achieve price stability. in case japan, mild deflation persist long period, inflation expectation anchored. moreover, inflation expectation volatile around 1 percent. thus, one bank’s challenge raise anchor expectation toward around 2 percent. a central bank generally make judgment movement medium- long-term inflation expectation use several indicators; level inflation expectation direction movement often differ. this reflect fact (1) indicator entail various, specific biases, (2) indicator target different price indexes. with (1), example, households’ inflation expectation tend upward-biased since household always expect price level increase, discuss later. by contrast, large firms’ expectation sale price tend downward-biased tend make cautious management plans. with (2), example, opinion survey general public’s view behavior compile bank ask respondent price outlook refer “overall price good service respondent purchase.” by contrast, bank’s tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) explicitly refer cpi ask firm outlook general prices. moreover, bei inflation swap rate target core cpi, include inflation expectation various premiums. chart 8 provide basic information survey base indicator short-term (one year less) medium- long-term (over one year) inflation expectations. bi central bankers’ speech 7 in achieve price stability, matter inflation expectation firm households, well associate economic behavior. i therefore concentrate inflation expectation here. c. development inflation expectation firm the bank’s quarterly tankan ask 10,000 firm least 20 million yen capital outlook regard sale price (rate price change relative current level) general price (annual percentage rate changes) three projection periods: one year, three years, five year ahead. these questionnaire incorporate since march 2014 survey, currently four forecast point available: march, june, september, december 2014. since amount data acquire yet sufficient, caution require interpret results. the respondent also decompose four group (large manufacturing, large nonmanufacturing, small manufacturing, small nonmanufacturing). i share follow section preliminary observation survey results. since find i describe remain largely unchanged across forecast points, i focus late (december 2014) forecast. inflation expectation sale price (one, three, five year ahead) the outlook sale price choose ten option “around plus 20 percent higher” “around minus 20 percent lower” (categorized 5 percent increments) “don’t know.” the average inflation outlook sale price “all firms, industries” 1 percent one year, 1.7 percent three years, 2 percent five year ahead, show rise trend relative current level. it note figure refer rate change relative current level, annual percentage rate change. thus, take difference intertemporal figure give 0.7 percent increase three year relative one year ahead 0.3 percent increase five year relative three year ahead. namely, scale sale price increase tend fall projection period move one five year ahead. another caution average outlook figure obtain sample pool exclude “don’t know” respondents. so average outlook figure base limit number respondent – especially outlook three five year ahead. • first, large manufacture firm expect average sale price remain unchanged current level three years’ time (plus 0.1 percent) fall current level five years’ time (minus 0.2 percent). this show sharp contrast three groups, expect rise sale price level current level (chart 9). in large manufacturing, decline price expectation evident five year ahead, especially among process sectors, electrical transportation machinery. give sector face fierce competition, large firm sector likely formulate business plan conservatively envision future sale price without increase. • second, regardless scale firms, nonmanufacturing firm tend expect future sale price high manufacture ones. among large nonmanufacturing firms, relatively high sale price expect construction & real estate sector three year ahead construction & real estate, retailing, accommodation & eat & drink service sector five year ahead. with small nonmanufacturing firms, relatively high sale price expect construction & real estate accommodation & eat & drink service sector three year ahead construction & real estate, wholesale & retailing, accommodation & eat & drink services, transport & postal activity sector five year ahead. some sector already face labor shortage, high real estate price large cities, rise construction materials. 8 bi central bankers’ speech these two observation suggest sale price project rise nonmanufacturing – rather manufacture – labor-intensive sectors. next, i examine three large response – “around plus 5 percent,” “around 0 percent,” “don’t know” – among aforementioned ten options. the follow additional point observed: • third, “all firms, industries,” response one year ahead tend concentrate “around 0 percent” (from current level); account 60 percent responses. the next-largest response relate “around plus 5 percent,” account 20 percent. by contrast, response three year ahead widely spread among various options. the large response “around 0 percent” (accounting 30 percent), next two large response “around plus 5 percent” “don’t know” (accounting 20 percent each). those three option account 80 percent responses. regard response five year ahead, large response relate “don’t know” (accounting 35 percent); proportion “around 0 percent” response drop 20 percent “around plus 5 percent” response remain 20 percent (chart 10-1). • fourth, four-group classification indicate great difference large small firm rather manufacture nonmanufacturing. for large small firms, “don’t know” response grow projection period increase one year five year ahead. however, proportion “don’t know” response great among large among small firm projection period. small firm tend choose “around plus 5 percent” option frequently large one (charts 10–2, 10–3, 10-4). in light responses, may say small manufacture firm find easy form expectation sale price large ones. this probably small manufacture firm tend project future sale price supplier-transaction relationship large firm also deal limit kind part intermediate goods. meanwhile, small nonmanufacturing firm form expectation sale price take account expect increase production cost consider relevant market price influence mainly large nonmanufacturing firms. this may reflect fact small nonmanufacturing firm relatively labor intensive large one already face labor shortage. inflation expectation general price (one, three, five year ahead) let u examine outlook general prices, measure cpi. the response choose ten options, range “around plus 6 percent higher” “around minus 3 percent lower” (categorized 1 percent increments), “don’t clear views” three sub-categories (on general prices). the average inflation outlook “all firms, industries” 1.4 percent one year, 1.6 percent three years, 1.7 percent five year ahead, show rise trend projection period increase one five year ahead (chart 7). i elaborate three observation results. • first, four-group classification reveal difference project inflation level great large small firm manufacture nonmanufacturing. large firm project average 1.1 percent one year ahead 1.2 percent three five year ahead; small firm average report 1.7 percent one year, 1.8 percent three years, 1.9 percent five year ahead. so basically project rise trend, small firm high level inflation expectation (chart 11). bi central bankers’ speech 9 by focus four large response – “around plus 2 percent,” “around plus 1 percent,” “around 0 percent,” “don’t clear views” – among aforementioned options, follow point observed: • second, among “all firms, industries,” general price outlook one year ahead relatively widespread among option compare sale price outlook. the large “around plus 1 percent” response account 30 percent total responses, follow “around plus 2 percent” “around 0 percent” response (accounting 20 percent each). the “don’t clear views” response account approximately 15 percent total responses. on outlook three year ahead, “don’t clear views” response increase 30 percent. the next-largest response “around plus 1 percent” “around plus 2 percent” (each account 20 percent). this pattern become apparent outlook five year ahead. the proportion “don’t clear views” response rise approximately 40 percent; “around plus 1 percent” “around plus 2 percent” response drop 15 percent. from one five year ahead, proportion “don’t clear views” response great “don’t know” response sale price outlook (chart 12–1). • third, four-group classification reveal “don’t clear views” response great among large among small firms. the response account 40 percent outlook three year ahead 50 percent five years. a small firms, proportion “around plus 2 percent” response great large firm outlook one, three five year ahead (charts 12–2, 12–3, 12–4). summary observation relate inflation expectation firm base aforementioned results, i summarize combine observation sale price- general price-related inflation expectation firms. 1. the average outlook general price among “all firms, industries” indicate 1.4 percent one year, 1.6 percent three years, 1.7 percent five year ahead. however, outlook among large firm remain largely unchanged projection period. this imply rise trend outlook appear largely reflect outlook among small firms. large firm also appear make conservative, low projection sale price small firms. 2. for general sale prices, “don’t clear views” “don’t know” response great among large small firms. large firm likely face great degree uncertainty outlook type price – probably direct exposure fierce global domestic competition final-product markets. by contrast, small firm tend expect high general sale price labor shortage high input cost labor intensity relatively low profit margins. 3. large firm project conservative, low sale price small firms. this may turn affect sale price small firm transaction relationships. a result, small firm may find difficult pas rise production cost onto sale prices, thereby squeeze margin profitability. this suggest small firm need make great effort improve margin shift high value-added business models. 4. because large firm often play role price setters, aggregate sale price outlooks, especially process industry whose product close final goods, likely result true outlook general price inflation, cpi inflation. if large firm maintain conservative, low price behavior 10 bi central bankers’ speech respect sale prices, level actual inflation general price may turn low level suggest average inflation expectation “all firms, industries.” 5. finally, general sale prices, “don’t clear views” “don’t know” response account 20 percent-40 percent projection three year ahead 30 percent-50 percent five years. moreover, great dispersion among response observe projection period increases. in term level general price inflation, even average projection small firm five year (whose average highest) 1.9 percent. in regard, may say firms’ medium- long-term inflation expectation yet anchor bank pass halfway point path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target. d. development inflation expectation household the bank conduct opinion survey general public’s view behavior sample 4,000 people (a little half provide valid responses). the quarterly survey result currently available consistent base since june 2006 late december 2014 survey. there two indicator relate inflation expectations: one year (the outlook price level one year ahead); five year (the outlook annual average change price level next five years). in addition, relevant price-related indicator calculate use survey data include perception diffusion index (di) present price level (the difference perceive increase perceive decrease response compare one year earlier) price rise tolerance di (the difference rather favorable rather unfavorable response price rise). i explain feature obtain indicator relevant information derive survey (such income, spending, employment condition dis), start present short-term development proceed medium- long-term inflation expectations. attitude price rise (price rise tolerance) • the perception di present price level appear inversely relate price rise tolerance di (chart 13). namely, whenever household believe present price level increase compare one year earlier, price rise tolerance di tend drop attitude price rise become negative. the price rise tolerance di rise late 2009 early 2010, actual cpi perception di drop middle global financial crisis. this suggest household accept price rise favorably find price drop unfavorably – probably price hike per se grow concern recession reflect actual price decline. • compare two observation year – 2008 2014 – comparable rise occur cpi inflation, price rise tolerance di great 2014 2008. this may associate good employment income condition 2014 2008. indeed, present income di, one-year-ahead income di, employment condition di high 2014 2008 (chart 14). expectation one-year inflation relation income spend • the indicator one-year inflation expectation average remain positive – even phase deflation. this suggest household always believe price level one year ahead higher. conversely, present income di one-year-ahead income di remain negative. this suggest household always consider present income decline compare one year early income one year ahead decrease compare present. this bi central bankers’ speech 11 imply household always expect real income one year ahead decline (chart 15). • meanwhile, present spend di remain positive, whereas one-year-ahead spend di remain negative (chart 15). namely, household increase present level spend compare one year earlier, plan reduce spend level one year now. moreover, household tend regard rise live expense main reason increase current spend level present spend di grows. take feature account, may say household plan reduce spend one year ahead expect real income decline then. generally speaking, rise one-year-ahead inflation expectations, household tend frontload spend today reduce future spend smooth intertemporal budgetary constraint. in regard, increase present spend di associate increase one-year-ahead inflation expectation could understand sign defensive action future price hikes. present price perception inflation expectation (one five years) • like one-year inflation expectations, indicator five-year inflation expectation average remain positive. this mean household expect price level rise next five year – even time deflation (chart 16). • among follow – (1) perception present inflation (based year-on-year percentage price change), (2) one-year inflation expectations, (3) five-year inflation expectation – fluctuation (1) greatest, follow (2). chart 16 reveal perception indicator grow sharply 2008 compare one- five-year inflation expectations. this suggest although household find present price increase sharply 2008 compare one year earlier, believe extreme price hike would eventually contained. by contrast, three indicator remain stable 2014, average value around 4 percent-5 percent. • the opinion survey begin biannual questionnaire information source households’ price view september 2013. accord recent (september 2014) survey present price level five-year inflation expectations, “developments price frequently-purchased item foodstuffs” choose applicable source, follow “developments gasoline prices.” over 50 percent respondent regard two option relevant information source (chart 17). • the indicator five-year inflation expectation remain stable. at first glance, adopt 2 percent price stability target qqe 2013 appear exert significant effect inflation expectations. however, i return issue. e. summary households’ inflation expectation relation firm let know sum observation households’ inflation expectation relate expectation firms. 1. households’ five-year inflation expectation average appear remain stable around 4 percent first glance. however, survey reveal basis five-year inflation expectation largely depend price frequently-purchased item gasoline – much monetary policy. thus, stable movement inflation expectation necessarily mean medium- long-term inflation expectation anchored. 12 bi central bankers’ speech 2. one interest feature household rely heavily general price-related information various source respect five-year inflation expectation compare perception present price levels. for example, rely relatively heavily “media report individual price good service price general” “developments foreign exchange rates” (chart 17). 3. in addition, indicator one- five-year inflation expectation remain largely unchanged adopt 2 percent price stability target qqe. it might appear first glance effect monetary policy limited. however, survey response know report biases: outlier extreme numbers; downward rigidity tendency avoid negative number – even respondent expect deflation; many response integers, especially multiple five. after take bias account, modify distribution one- five-year inflation expectation display notable change since 2013. namely, skew deflationary side diminish inflation expectations. the right tail inflationary side five-year inflation expectation contracted. a result, spike around 2 percent become sharp inflation expectations, show households’ inflation expectation concentrate around 2 percent (chart 18). this may suggest change bank’s monetary policy 2013 positively affect households’ inflation expectations, lead great concentration response 2 percent.1 4. households’ inflation expectation high firms, suggest presence upward bias. this may two possible reasons. one household firm envisage different price respond survey questionnaire. household ask respond “overall price good service respondent purchase,” whereas firm ask respond general price measure cpi. the reason household ask manner respondent unfamiliar cpi, make difficult form outlook base upon it. 5. the possible reason upward bias household tend perceive expect high price level corollary long-standing sluggish income growth, result anticipate tighten household budgets. by contrast, firm tend form conservative inflation expectation base surround economic environment information obtain transaction firms. give firm appear weigh macro information perceive price development base input price also sale prices, inflation expectation whole likely low household closely approximate rate actual cpi inflation. the important find household expect price rise one year ahead increase next five years; expect price rise regard rather unfavorable associate expect decline future real income. partly reflect limit tolerance price rise households, large firm (manufacturing nonmanufacturing) may tend project relatively conservative, low increase general price sale price small firms. households’ poor tolerance price rise reflect perception present income level decline compare one year early also income level one year ahead increase much. to achieve 2 percent price stability target sustainable increase private spending, necessary price rise widely accept 1 see shunsaku nishiguchi, jouchi nakajima, kei imakubo, “disagreement households’ inflation expectation it evolution,” bank japan review series 2014-e-1, march 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 13 households. this require improvement current employment income condition well increase expectation future income growth. in respect, i closely monitor favorable development income (nominal real) project fiscal 2015 beyond important step toward achieve price stability target. iv. conclude remark the bank adopt 2 percent price stability target follow reasons: (1) need maintain sufficient buff inflation owe upward-bias problem inherent cpi statistics; (2) need leave sufficient room conduct flexible monetary policy achieve certain level inflation recessionary phases; (3) need set target around 2 percent global standard term price stability target avoid reemergence excessive appreciation yen. in addition, 2 percent target essential realize normal economic conditions, positive rate nominal gdp growth occur sustainable basis. however, household tend regard price level rise unfavorable. it easy promote understand bank’s price stability target – especially since real income drop sharply fiscal 2014. nonetheless, income (nominal real) likely rise fiscal 2015. therefore, essential bank boost effectiveness communication strategy explain clearly aim achieve 2 percent target improve people’s life medium long term. i continue make effort regard. in addition, even though bank’s economic growth outlook 2014 revise sharply downward, clear japan’s economy currently far good shape introduction qqe. a virtuous cycle income spending, drive force economy, maintain household corporate sectors. thus, crucial bank continue support current recovery process. i sincerely hope entity take full advantage opportunity afford highly accommodative financial environment generate qqe expand effort toward enhance innovation productivity – concert economic growth strategy structural reform implement government. thank much kind attention. 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 15 16 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 17 18 bi central bankers’

i begin remark high-level overview progress make recent year address significant risk face industry follow financial crisis. i go discus one area i see big challenge road ahead. a industry continue adapt implement necessary regulatory changes, also adapt leverage technology changes: technology change offer excite opportunity complex risk – i think – prepare for. progress come financial crisis,

stocktaking important 2 bi central bankers’ speech ensure collectively understand “new” financial system operating. firm supervisor continue face challenge compete demand press, month year ahead, implement necessary change assess “new” financial system. what future hold one topic i feel compete for, deserve, lot attention foreseeable future cybersecurity. i often ask list “things keep awake night,” i think it’s fair say cybersecurity top list – i’m sure many room. in fact, i think cybersecurity one topic everyone’s list – senior manager board directors, way line managers. cybersecurity topic issue information technology staff cio address; risk isn’t exclusive who, targets. • it risk difficult clearly define. • it risk constantly evolving. • it risk limit one source. • it risk face every single financial firm, regardless size complexity. • in fact, risk face every business, organization, school, church group us technology. in words, company immune (unless, course, operate cash business brick mortar store keep earn mattress – something see lot today’s world). the financial sector, particular, unprecedented attack broad spectrum intent attack method complex, widely distributed, increasingly interconnected. these highly dynamic system give rise “new normal” – system design architecture need support rapid compartmentalize change. so, begin look risk magnitude? and, get arm around many associate risk surround it? let begin not. cybersecurity “information technology” issue. it risk address simply strong it team place. it risk affect firm’s technology – affect business itself, every aspect – bottom line, reputation, processes, much more. however, information technology cybersecurity intrinsically linked. i’d like cover issue remain remark focus several underlie issue need addressed. information technology legacy issue the first dimension legacy: still great deal “clean-up” fix longstanding technology data issue build years. the investment necessary long-term fixes, many cases, take multiple year execute. the range issue include: system process manual fully automated; asset management tool drastically insufficient; business process model build without security requirements, name few. a firm address challenges, must also flexible agile enough keep change environment incorporate new development arise. while number firm sound program place address longstanding issues, strong bi central bankers’ speech 3 project management tenacity crucial see through. in addition, continue prioritization commitment resources, well support firm’s senior management board directors, critical. i see commitment basic “blocking tackling” essential financial institutions’ continue competitive – relevant – digital world. while legacy issue need address near-term quickly, can’t hold address vast number issue around cyber – since cyber upon u now. information technology cybersecurity the area i spend time discuss today cybersecurity. suffice say i think kind risk might cause next crisis, cybersecurity one worry most. while i focus remark financial sector, concern limit financial sector. this much big bank financial institutions; include many sector well. a relate financial industry particular, interconnectedness firm continue pose particular risk financial stability; trade system settlement activities, risk major disruption financial stability. during last financial crisis, begin get glimpse challenge face result interconnectedness systemic failures. year later, still face challenges, limit view true complexity behind firm linked, connected, ultimately intertwine form fabric financial industry. while begin address area systemic risk, i feel industry whole begin scratch surface potential system-wide impact significant cyber-attack. this risk refer “single point failure.” what this? these area that, despite work already carry out, significantly vulnerable others. we need identify focus combine effort understand systemic impact address them. i want clear here. i don’t think isn’t regular topic conversation among directors, executive manager – fact, base discussion i’ve many you, i know it’s quite opposite. there lot discussion within firm topic – there’s quite bite activity broadly suggest many different people talk cyber. there conference cybersecurity every week. consultancy firm work industry protect attacks. law enforcement agency investigate crack attack behind them. everyone talk this! and, i think that’s appropriate necessary – everyone’s issue. a engage discussion subject flesh plan address risk, number topic key keep mind. before i go list, i want provide overview we, federal reserve bank new york, process. while cybersecurity agenda quite time, dedicate resource assess large complex firm set expectation small firms, elevate effort recent month form dedicate team focus strengthen overall supervisory approach cybersecurity. a i mention beginning, i think we’ve do reasonable job develop rule regulation ensure firm prepare withstand type shock experience past. but, cyber add element plan next crisis go beyond additional capital liquidity, example, provide system. the newly-formed team, lead roy thetford, former information security officer bank, work examination team establish new risk-based cybersecurity assessment framework, base best practice field, well explore additional standard might set supervise institutions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in addition, strengthen build program, collaborate critical stakeholders, include expert security cybersecurity; financial institutions, include bank non-banks; critical third-party service providers; domestic regulatory bodies; enforcement agencies; international supervisors. a move forward develop framework standards, review current emerge laws, regulation guidance; research best practices; identify gap current assessment efforts. a this, identify set issue top mind: 1. this it issue a i mention earlier, cyber isn’t it issue. i don’t think i say enough. it business issue first foremost need tackle such. cyber need own business leader firm – partner expert course. there need foundational shift think top house: need regular topic agenda board directors; need top priority list senior management firm; need mind every employee, extent. it need part everyone’s vocabulary recognize valid threat every level. 2. good risk management foundation good risk management good it practice set foundation solid program address cyber-related risk. it’s hard imagine firm doesn’t manage it risk well ever go able manage cyber risk well. in fact, two area recently review require attention include basic it asset management strengthen patch vulnerability management practices. these necessary hygiene step fundamental sound cyber security defense program. a part good risk management, firm also need start consider ass cost cyber connect price cyber risk businesses. you must ask “what cyber exposure?” and, need think price it, cyber priced, may get attention needs. 3. it’s bank cyber isn’t bank – it’s entire financial sector, well connection financial sector sector like utilities, retail, others. we know every area industry interconnected; it’s financial firms. a old say goes, strong weak link. in financial system, weak link could weak firm, weak vendor, weak point vulnerability payment clear system, etc. a weakness area expose entire system, interconnection mean link other, non-financial firms, every system support operation structure industry. the additional risk keep mind grow number unregulated firm operate compete arena. a industry move overcome risk associate cybersecurity, consider additional vulnerability expose non-regulated entity subject guidance standards. the big question lie you, industry, ensure ‘industry whole’ safe, regulate entities. 4. one size fit just firm diverse size, complexity product offerings, technologies, process systems. while firm house technology work internally, others outsource entire function significant part third-party vendors. in addition variety system use approach information security within firms, i say earlier, entire subsystem support financial sector ultimately connect every firm extent. in response this, work bi central bankers’ speech 5 assumption one-size-fits-all solution approach take need comprehensive flexible enough adopt type firms. 5. we together cybersecurity area i believe interest align share goal two-fold. in addition want see firm adequately protect cyber-attacks prepare respond occur, equally concern overall safety soundness financial system – whole. no one firm agency go come one permanent solution protection cyber-attacks. i see approach cybersecurity similar approach y2k – i’m sure remember that. • we need approach everyone agree adopt. • we need see public/private partnership development approach. • we need come together identify vulnerability share need done. • we need agree path forward test it. • we need acknowledge that, unlike y2k, expiration date. cybersecurity “new normal.” it go become part vocabulary nearly every exam conduct, conversation senior management, conversation future financial services. to successful, agree common goals; although approach different angle think creatively solutions, work toward understand threat facing. the threat landscape shift constantly, responsible keep change adapt control accordingly. this include firms, system support industry, third party vendors, consultants, regulators, law enforcement. 6. we need leverage best practice leverage common set best practice across industry important first step close gap current vulnerabilities. unlike approach take supervisor address cybersecurity concerns, initial focus area good understand vulnerabilities, firm address them, progress make firm assess industry stand whole. yes, want address weaknesses, lot big weakness identify one firm. we look firm leverage guidance around best practice identify weaknesses, want firm bring forward issues, concern vulnerability encounter so. we need identify, industry, risk truly lie them. there lot work do area experts, include nist, fbiic, finra, pra, ffiec, ncua, etc. – list go on. and, number set best practice already published. we aware firm look guidance approach take framework adopt. a review publish guidance, ass broad volume research already come consensus evaluation framework, encourage firm look fundamental commonality across best practice build ongoing/current activities. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 7. assess threat to fully ass threat risk firm, must first understand risk lies, affects, defined, associate cost are. in case assess risk impact cyber-attacks, i believe firm need cognizant every business decision, every process, every change firm make ultimately cyber-related element it. to add complexity this, firm’s self-awareness must extend beyond four wall company must also take account impact critical service provider firm. you outsource service, risk. everyone use threat intelligence go day-to-day activity – use potential cyber-attack another filter view every decision. a think variable consider decision-making process, must build potential create weaknesses, vulnerability opportunity cyber-attacks, aware associate costs. i fear assign financial consequence cyber risks, ensure staff take account make decisions, get commitment need every level organization adequately address problem. a long decision make action take without type assessment, go see weakness exposed. these vulnerability necessarily new, exposure increasingly make available attackers. for instance, weak patch management process come risk system may take long patch (or patch all!) result much large target window opportunity attackers. a ass potential impact, also important remember protect attack half solution – particularly because, infosec colleague like say: “it’s matter if get hacked; it’s matter when.” a strong cyber resiliency program good start point address this, also need focus limit impact follow attack address fundamental structure within organization – safe system, compartmentalize core area technology, ability isolate threat. 8. need address communication finally, successfully address risk unify front, must develop approach enhance communication around cyber threat events, revisit supervisory guidance area. silence fear share intelligence area could detrimental effort address vulnerability systematically. we know breach occur continue occur industry good equip ahead attackers, play catch up. right interest learn breach use intelligence garner get ahead game. there lot think here. with mind, i end part remark reminder see key component solution design address cybersecurity. it must: • be comprehensive, risk-based threat-informed; • be joint effort public private sectors; • be flexible enough evolve technology advances; – automate – scalable • support information sharing; • leverage best practices; bi central bankers’ speech 7 • include industry – regardless size process (internal system external providers); • delve deep one step surface. conclusion we live ever-changing environment speed agility essence. demand customer change, expectation shareholder fluctuate regulatory landscape work within continue evolve keep pace. constant change – commitment evolution – choice. it way survive, stay competitive stay safe complex vulnerable world. a relate cybersecurity, i believe pivotal moment: know issue; work fully understand scope breadth risk; pragmatic add value; look holistically; goal come set next step benefit us, include protect financial system u.s. economy whole. we need address cybersecurity see catastrophic event, analyze afterwards. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: sustain economy’s growth saga 3ps policymaking – proactive, pre-emptive, prudent speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp, central bank philippines), euromoney philippine investment forum, manila, 24 march 2015. * * * i see conference agenda already cover critical topic morning. our place asean economic community, prospect mass market infrastructure certainly key issue philippine today. before take capital market issue rest forum topics, i think would help discussion sectoral issues, i would spend time allot speak broad economy operate in. in particular, i would like speak briefly risk macroeconomy bsp see horizon, we, monetary bank policy framework, intend address these. first, risks: the risk face come mainly external side. here i mean interplay three key factors: (1) uneven global economic growth; (2) uncertainty oil price path ambiguity underlie driver oil price decline; (3) result divergence monetary policy stance among major advance economies. in last year half, factor manifest movement global capital u asset (away core europe emerge markets), appreciate trend u dollar decline global long-term interest rates. the rebalancing global portfolios, fund search good yields, surface domestic financial market volatility peso/dollar exchange rate, local bond equity markets. go forward, uneven global growth scenario persist, may see translate pronounce change trade patterns. monetary policy thrusts: in response, bsp opt use mix monetary policy tool last year. these action include increase reserve requirement bank deposits, upward adjustment policy interest rates, strategic presence fx market, alongside clear communication plan, macroprudential measures. the bsp allow to: 1) good manage credit liquidity growth, 2) anchor inflation expectations, 3) ward potential build excess segment market may overly-reliant historically low interest rate growth exuberance. the bsp continue strategy use deem appropriate whole range tool available enhance tool kit. i believe domestic market come understand this. they appreciate bsp’s approach respond challenge really pro-active, pre-emptive prudent. three p’s. bank reforms: give central role bank transmission monetary policy, bsp also strategic ensure resiliency bank system. we repeatedly say handle bank system premise strike balance need prudential limit ability bank make sound 2 bi central bankers’ speech business decision base idiosyncrasy operation reality market. in practice, translate specific action two facets. 1) regulatory framework, 2) access financial products. the first facet craft regulatory environment encourage innovation adequately mitigate unwarranted financial risks. i want clear though basel 3, although consider basel 3 primary safety net. there much apprehension surround adoption capital requirement basel 3. in fact, i note one topic discussion session follow talk whether capital regulatory reform affect banks’ ability lend. not preempt late discussion, let share that, initial fear implementation basel 3 framework unfounded. today, universal commercial bank continue capital level withstand credit stress test 20 50 percent write-offs. in addition, credit continue grow healthy levels. equally worth note quality loan improving, npls continue fall. it interest find perspective conference issue. i won’t attempt list regulatory reforms, illustrate, let cite couple. we amend credit risk framework bank align global best practice highlight factor go sound credit decision, without rely collateral pledge credit. we also streamline minimum capital requirement bank tiered extent branch network. at time, liberalization bank branch undertake bank good make business decision wish serve target constituents. to round out, likewise pursue longstanding objective develop capital markets. recent amendment regulation address gaps, particularly arrive market rate purpose marking-to-market. these new interest rate benchmarking regulation make price bond capital build-up transparent. all do objective make regulatory environment open business decision service product providers. they broaden achieve within bank industry without unduly compromise regulatory oversight risk conflict interest. this dovetail second facet strike balance prudential limit banks’ decision-making ability. this – liberalize access bank market. it critical market “financially inclusive” give structure philippine archipelago. this mean access, product policy generate desire synergy equally respond need traditionally underserved underbanked. this key advocacy bsp, could easily devote another forum. even i limit today traditional bank market, much already happen late. with enactment republic act 10641, increase ownership ceiling foreign bank 100 percent 60 percent, liberalize branch requirement allow foreign bank participate foreclosure proceed real estate properties. with capital infusion market presence, expectation law would bolster local bank industry great competition, benefit transfer skill technology. this liberalization entry foreign financial institution position u well asean bank integration framework. but abif, pursue support legislative initiative competitive globally-oriented bank industry essential portal foreign investments. this, turn, fee investment grade rat obtain international credit rat agencies. bi central bankers’ speech 3 while liberalization advantages, recognize may potential issue relaxation credit standard pursuit large market share, risk contagion volatile capital flows. financial stability lens: lady gentlemen, bsp consider effect potential risks, merely look impact individual firms. rather, lens financial stability, concern become big picture, examine interaction among institutions, transactions, product markets. it new prudential norm address contagion risks, include may potentially arise liberalization initiative. outlook: against monetary bank sector policy backdrop light risk anticipate, see operate environment go forward? very broadly, see country continue grow stable inflationary environment. we believe liquidity sufficiently calibrate would support broad-based growth without fuel inflation monitor particularly view policy normalization us. more specifically, government’s target 7–8 percent attainable domestic demand condition remain firm support improve production efficiency robust labor market dynamics. meantime, inflation expectation remain well-anchored. late inflation forecasts, base survey bsp consensus economics, remain close mid-point target band 2–4 percent 2015–2016. on bank side, see remain reliable intermediator funds. give reform agenda, system continue characterize solid asset growth, improve quality loan assets, strong capitalization, good risk management practices. we see external current account remain surplus exchange inflow overseas filipino (ofs) remittances, business process outsource (bpo) revenues, well tourism receipt see continue grow. finally, lady gentlemen, give positive alignment inflation growth, augment government resource result fiscal consolidation, monetary financial sector sufficient room make policy adjustments, may warranted. conclusion: you may ask, philippine economy able sustain successive year strong growth performance medium term? i believe so. apart country’s strong fundamentals, government’s commitment toward sustain structural reform agenda would lend critical support achieve growth potential. the bsp share commitment. after all, follow framework three p’s. i confident able attain goal upward economic growth trajectory, environment price financial stability remain proactive policy dialogue stakeholder yourselves. pre-emptive put place forward look policies, prudent adopt reforms. lady gentlemen, even outlook remain favorable, time complacency. a genius behind intel, andy grove, said, “only paranoid survive.” i wish therefore conference would pepper right amount paranoia balance enough openness find suitable solutions. good afternoon thank attention.

market: need do – reaffirmation inaugural address mr r gandhi, deputy governor reserve bank india, “care rat debt market summit – 2015”, mumbai, 23 march 2015. * * * assistance provide m anupam sonal gratefully acknowledged. good morning lady gentlemen! 2. i would like thank care rat take initiative hold summit corporate debt market. a i see, seminar quite exhaustive content excellent speaker represent various segment industry hence interest hear views. a regulator, reserve bank approach development market, hear market participant always important u debate issue come workable solution. i sure lot pick deliberation take place today. corporate bond market india – current status 3. indian corporate debt market see growth recent years, term number issue amount. the outstanding issue 12,155 end march 2011 increase 18,664 end dec 2014. during period, amount outstanding increase ₹ 8,895 billion ₹ 16,485 billion. while type issue include fix rate bonds, float rate bonds, structure note types, fix rate bond predominant number value. another characteristic issuance almost issuance financial sector entities. yet another peculiar feature corporate bond market private placement norm. the public issuance ₹ 94.51 billion 2010–11 increase ₹ 423.83 billion 2013–14, though fell back ₹ 90.49 billion current year till feb 2015. the private placement ₹ 2187.85 billion 2010–11, ₹ 2612.82 billion 2011–12, ₹ 3614.62 billion 2012–13, ₹ 2760.54 billion 2013–14 ₹ 2692.45 billion current year till dec 2014. the secondary market trade ₹ 6053 billion 2010–11, ₹ 5938 billion 2011–12, ₹ 7386 billion 2012–13, ₹ 9708 billion 2013–14 ₹ 10043 billion current year till feb 2015. 4. though mention figure indicate healthy growth number volume corporate bond market activity, comparison government bond market, corporate bond market dwarfed. a comparative position government bond corporate bond march 2013 proportion gdp among major asian country table (page 2), reflect india low position vi vi major asian countries. indian corporate debt market – an enigma 5. thus corporate debt market india quite enigma. we keep talk issue way progress solution could address them. yet, limit movement area despite several attempt kind gravity keep u down. we r h patil committee report corporate bond securitization 2005 serve reference point us. however, progress growth corporate debt segment satisfactory evidently press requirement revisit subject. there several suggestion make – implement mix success. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 6. yet, note earlier, debt market remain confine largely financial institutions, corporates much picture. even within limit perimeter, public issue le frequent preference private placement debt paper. this start point puzzle need analyze. 7. another part puzzle relate achievement. we experience close double digit gdp growth fy08 investment ratio 38.1% year- finance issue come way. on face one may tend conclude erroneously need get worry absence development corporate debt market. after all, get investment rate 38.1%? the reason problem appear magnify work well potential. we realize paucity long term resource severely come way investment. therefore, question ask long carry situation. 8. we fairly large number require finance industrial growth 8–10% next five year fund require infrastructure development. presently industrial growth phase stagnation infrastructure well satisfactory level due vary set factor around policy action, demand fund really reach expect levels. evidently give rise complacency work period build structure grow corporate debt market. need develop corporate debt market 9. the government limitation chip fiscal responsibility target leave little scope find funds. though commercial bank cater bi central bankers’ speech 3 investment need corporate infrastructure sectors, also reach limitations. we get support fdi external borrowings, pace size. external borrow good way global interest rate low. but, repercussion external debt significant, permit ecbs various sectors, external debt level rise service implications. intuitively see capital market become progressively relevant process garner long term funds. 10. economist contend absence adequately size corporate debt market lead oversized bank system economy. it also result large portion lend market excessively regulated, without subject free market forces. such imbalance desirable, become perfect breed grind crony capitalism, sloppy lend bank careless investment corporates. finance resource corporate bond rather bank finance instill great sense credit discipline among borrower default event capture immediately place public domain. the disclosure requirement act big disincentive default delay payment. it observe borrower take regulatory norm 90 day period default recognise non-performing asset leeway withhold payment till 89th day due date. on hand, even single day default issuer corporate bond recognise default market information default publicly available. further, information / risk also reflect external credit rat trade credit derivative real time basis. price credit also get dilute bank finance credit facility extend basis credit worthiness borrower also relationship bank borrowers. finance corporate bond might remove distortion large extent investor demand high coupon issue low credit worthiness, borrower strong fundamental sound business get reward low cost financing. thus many advantage efficient, well develop liquid corporate debt market. 11. the importance develop debt market viz., corporate debt market country like india, huge ever grow capital fund requirement widely acknowledge although various measure regulatory policy front introduce recent times, concert effort market participant require develop grow largely untapped potential country’s corporate debt markets. expert committee 12. in india, progressively, number committee group set rbi study bank finance / fund pattern vi vi corporate fund requirements. prominent among tandon committee, chore committee, etc. the committee uniformly recommend corporate reliance bank finance short term recur expense need bring down. chore committee specifically recommend need reduce over-dependence medium large borrower – public private sector bank finance. 13. more recently, high level expert committee corporate bond set chairmanship shri r. h patil submit report december 2005 make several recommendation include need rationalisation stamp duty structure issuance costs, tax deduct source, encourage securitization, repos cd corporate bonds, enhance issuer investor base, simplify issuance procedures, etc. 14. in year 2009, committee financial sector reform (cfsr) (chairman: dr. raghuram g. rajan) also look issue inhibit corporate debt market make several recommendation similar lines. some highlight bring trade relate regulation within purview sebi, improve coordination various concern agency multiple regulator share concern, set work group 4 bi central bankers’ speech financial sector reform finance minister chairman, committee, recommend sequence approach corporate finance, entail develop number miss market well complementary development sector economy healthy development corporate bond market. current issue 15. there key issue corporate debt market faces. they need tackle facilitate improvement growth segment. foremost among follows: a) the abysmal liquidity consequent lack depth corporate debt markets. the absence liquid corporate bond market act deterrent investor participation. trade indian bond market characterize trade certain maturity tendency investor ‘buy hold’ instruments, inhibit liquidity. here role institutional investor pension funds, provident fund insurance company must reassessed. they need take initiative aggressive actively manage portfolios. their investment horizon confine aa only. this add lot buoyancy market. b) low investor base – the investor base corporate debt market confine banks, insurance companies, pfs, pension fund primary dealers. retail participation remain low due absence knowledge understand bond asset class. it imperative consider innovative way expand investor base. the fund management industry contribute significantly attract retail investor corporate debt. c) preference public debt – the huge supply government paper country one major impediment growth corporate bond markets. government borrow thereby supply government paper see grow unabated year year. we see government progressively try rein deficit absolute level put le pressure market. also move reserve bank gradually low slr also positive corporate bond market. d) limit instrument product – there need wide array instrument product available market would meet diverse need participants. there lack indian context turn inhibit development markets. cd irfs instrument come late expect grow. of late, element buoyancy irf market good sign. securitization corporate debt instrument would provide big fillip market would improve risk transference diversification provide liquidity issuers. e) market infrastructure also find mention factor affect corporate bond market trade thereby transparency vibrancy market. infrastructure facility screen base automate order matching, central clear settlement, negotiate deal system, etc. line available government security market would certainly facilitate encourage secondary market trading, enhance market transparency liquidity well develop scientific risk pricing. we need improve credit rat mechanism corporate bond encourage market low grade rat inhibit market. f) ease issuance – bond issuance view costly cumbersome compare bank lending. for attractive issuer approach corporate debt market, ease cost issuance improve. the list bi central bankers’ speech 5 disclosure requirement procedure simple le complicated. the size, scale tenure issue must improve need make attractive encourage public offer instead current preference private placements. it expect consolidation bond issue reissuance/s would improve liquidity encourage secondary market transactions. however, care would need take prevent excessive batch redemption consequent liquidity stress. g) market make – the growth development market dependent market maker provide buy sell quotes. although prevalent government security markets, lack corporate bond segment. market maker assume risk, add diversity markets. therefore, need develop class underwriter market maker corporate debt bond line primary dealer government security market. policy initiative 16. what tackle issue affect corporate bond market? several measure undertake policy level address these. some recent initiative government, reserve bank, sebi agency direction develop corporate debt market follows: a) trade report platform: for improve transparency, report platform otc trade corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificate deposits, non-convertible debenture securitized debt set up. till recently, report trade corporate bond do three different place (fimmda’s ftrac, report platform nse bse). though multiple report platform available, majority trade report fimmda platform clear one clear house stock exchanges. the report secondary market trade corporate bond securitised debt rbi regulate entity shift stock exchange effect april 1, 2014. b) pool account: clear house stock exchange permit pool fund account rbi facilitate dvp-i base settlement trade corporate bonds. c) repo corporate bond: in 2010, repos corporate bond permit regulate rbi permit entities. guideline relax term reduction minimum haircut requirement expand list eligible collateral permit short term instrument like cp, cd ncds original maturity le 1 year. schedule urban cooperative bank (ucbs) also permit participate repo market subject adherence condition prescribed. d) credit default swap (cds) corporate bonds: cd corporate bond permit facilitate hedge credit risk associate hold corporate bonds. base market feedback, short term instrument like cp, cd & ncds unlisted rat corporate bond also permit eligible reference obligations. e) encourage participation bank pd corporate bonds: i. in july 2014, bank permit issue long-term bond minimum maturity seven year raise resource lend (a) long term project infrastructure sub-sectors, (b) affordable housing. these bond exempt computation net demand time liability (ndtl) well adjust net bank credit (anbc) therefore subject crr / slr priority sector lend requirements. 6 bi central bankers’ speech ii. the reserve bank issue instruction ask bank consider raise tier ii capital public issuance retail investors. iii. in order encourage active participation standalone pd corporate debt, investment norm relax allow invest fund borrow call money market subject certain limits, enhance investment limit tier ii bond pd / bank / fis 5% 10% nof increase inter corporate deposit (icd) borrow limit 75% 150% nof. iv. bank standalone pd allow become direct member stock exchange undertake proprietary trade corporate bonds. v. credit enhancement bank – a per recent policy announcement made, propose permit bank offer partial credit enhancement corporate bond way provide fund un-funded credit facility infrastructure project way guarantee. the final instruction expect issue shortly. f) foreign portfolio investor (fpis): i. rationalisation investment limits: fpi investment limit rationalised, whereby exist limit subdivision merge two broad category – government security corporate bonds. the sub-limits fpis government security ($10 billion) date security ($15 billion) category merge retain overall cap $25 billion. in case corporate bonds, ceiling $1 billion qualify foreign investor (qfis), $25 billion fpis $25 billion fpis long-term infra bonds, merge – retain overall cap corporate bond $51 billion. ii. rationalization allocation debt limits: method allocation debt limit corporate bond market auction changed. a per revise scheme, fiis invest corporate debt without purchase debt limit till overall investment reach 90% auction mechanism would initiate allocation remain limits. consequent changes, restriction re-investment fpis, shall long apply respect limit hold / investment make fiis corporate debt category, till limit available tap. iii. withhold tax rate: the rate withhold tax interest payment borrow infrastructure debt fund (idf), investment make non-resident rupee denominate long-term infrastructure bond interest fiis’ investment make bond issue indian company government security reduce 20 per cent 5 per cent. iv. new foreign portfolio investor (fpi) regulations: recently, sebi notify new fpi regulation put place easy registration process operate framework overseas entity seek invest indian capital markets. the new regulation replace exist sebi regulation fiis new class investors, fpis, would encompass fiis, sub-accounts qfis. v. the budget 2015–16 propose extend period applicability reduce rate tax 5% respect income foreign investor (fiis qfis) corporate bond government securities, 31.5.2015 30.06.2017. g) credit enhancement iifcl: it mention union budget 2013–14 iifcl provide partial credit guarantee enhance rat bond issues, enable bi central bankers’ speech 7 channelization long-term fund infrastructure projects. iifcl presently undertake pilot transaction credit enhancement initiative. h) introduction rupee link offshore bond international finance corporation (ifc): with objective signal confidence indian economy encourage inflow usd india, ifc permit float rupee link bond overseas amount usd 1 billion. ifc receive good response limit fully utilize ifc. i) domestic issuance bond ifc: approval also give ifc issue bond india worth ₹ 15000 crore infrastructure financing. this also facilitate development benchmark yield long term corporate bonds. way forward 17. go forward, expect special impetus growth corporate debt market guidance bank issue long term bond support infrastructure house projects. further, order meet capital requirement basel iii framework, bank tap market additional tier 1 bonds, besides tier 2 bonds.

bi central bankers’ speech 1 s s mundra: defeat poverty – issue challenge keynote address mr s s mundra, deputy governor reserve bank india, 39th skoch summit, new delhi, 20 march 2015. * * * 1. mr. same kochhar, chairman, skoch group; dignitary dais audience; delegate summit; member print electronic media; lady gentlemen! it pleasure privilege present today inaugural session 39th skoch summit theme “defeating poverty”. the theme conference extremely relevant current juncture groundwork link household bank sector mission mode pmjdy near completion. i congratulate skoch choose particular theme summit. 2. the ilo declaration philadelphia, 1944 state “poverty anywhere threat prosperity everywhere.” poverty, therefore, implication global stability well appreciate policy maker world over. a across globe, policy maker india i.e. goi financial sector regulators, particularly rbi also endeavor ensure poverty tackle form benefit economic growth reach poor exclude group society. 3. franklin d. roosevelt say “the test progress whether add abundance much; whether provide enough little.” if apply yardstick measure progress, would consider fail miserably. even nearly sixty eight year since achieve independence, poverty remain one india’s large press problems. there gainsay nation cannot become great life million citizen benight poor nutrition, limit poor learn opportunity shrivel gender discrimination. what poverty? 4. the merriam webster dictionary define poverty “the state one lack usual socially acceptable amount money material possessions.” however, poverty simply characterize lack adequate income. it far reach implications. people suffer poverty experience number deprivation restrictions. it manifestation include hunger malnutrition, limit access education basic services, social discrimination exclusion, well lack participation decision-making civil, social cultural life. one important thing note poverty cannot defeat charity. empower people mean sustain long term solution defeat poverty. 5. unemployment center poverty. for poor, labour often asset use improve life wellbeing. it crucial empower poor potential often lack opportunity shape lives. bidirectional cause-effect relationship financial exclusion poverty 6. a i say earlier, poverty generally associate low level income. this income primarily direct towards consumption thereby leave little saving/investment. a low level save obviate need bank account thereby create financial exclusion lack investment opportunities. this create barrier financial inclusion demand perspective. conversely, financial exclusion deprive people benefit incentive offer financial system. poverty can, therefore, self-fuelling generation generations. 2 bi central bankers’ speech how break vicious circle? 7. i economist. many eminent speaker would dwell issue day. however, i wish put forward perspective i see them. let begin measurement poverty. i whether spend rs. 32 rural area rs. 47 urban area (as define rangarajan committee) rs. 27 rs. 33 respectively fix tendulkar panel earlier, consider poor. my question whether income level across country state (even adjust purchase power parity) comparable without take account availability, quality cost basic amenity health care, education, transport, sanitation etc. would composite index (if one devised) two element would true indicator real poverty level? this elaborate several measurable example time limit permit so. 8. extend argument further, would mean could two way address challenge defeat poverty? a. state ensure availability quality amenity i mention early needy citizen – question is, whether feasible? b. empower facilitate citizen earn level income buy service open market. issue contemplate whether do short term even medium term. 9. then would fair assume combination two would realistic goal pursue quite time come consider dimension work involved? would also fair assume pursue one even vary emphasis would serve purpose? 10. leave broad issue wide discussion, let turn various initiative take past year respect poverty alleviation /financial inclusion /employment generation etc. priority sector lend 11. effort also underway reorient priority sector lend guideline serve today’s growth inclusion agenda. an internal work group rbi revisit exist guideline suggest revision ensure channel credit segment get crowd absence specific targets. these include small marginal farmers, micro enterprise weak section broaden scope include underserved category national priority, agriculture infrastructure, social infrastructure, renewable energy, export medium size enterprises. financial inclusion plan 12. let briefly highlight rbi mainstreaming marginalize section society ensure equitable growth country. rbi relentless pursuit achieve universal financial inclusion follow structure plan approach. a i mention earlier, focus ensure access financial service product also take effort address issue emanate demand side financial literacy initiatives. phase ii financial inclusion plan currently operation seek connect 600,000 plus village country bank either brick mortar branch bc agent end year. pmjdy 13. to say government’s pmjdy scheme success would massive understatement. one must admire vision intent behind program. lot effort bi central bankers’ speech 3 go open bank account household connect formal financial system. the need hour ensure service easily accessible account holders, cost-effective service efficient & importantly account remain active. for account remain active, holder would need income benefit flow them. focus also place inculcate save habit among people. once save habit take root, people would look investments. only massive exercise would meaningful. direct benefit transfer 14. in order new bank account holder continue remain engage formal financial system, government’s dbt program expect play big role. it would ensure benefit transfer directly target population leakage avoided. license payment small finance bank 15. with objective further financial inclusion supply credit small business units, small marginal farmers, micro small industry unorganized sector entity rbi decide license number small finance banks. also, license payment bank envisage provide payments/remittance service migrant labour workforce, low income households, small businesses, unorganized sector entity users. promote entrepreneurship self-employment 16. prepare poor people self-employment perhaps last solution poverty alleviation. the role entrepreneurship key driver economic growth development alleviate poverty unemployment well research document develop develop countries. entrepreneurship promote innovation, create competitive advantage economic prosperity help create wealth job opportunity thereby improve standard live individuals, family communities. empowerment microfinance 17. microfinance influential mean empowerment poor vulnerable help extricate poverty misery. it basically work premise good teach someone fish rather simply give fish. it give poor necessary tools, skills, resource help engage productive activity grow way poverty. shg bank linkage model 18. shg (self help group) bank linkage programme pilot nabard 1992 500 shgs rural poor transform world’s large microfinance initiative 7.4 million shgs represent 97 million rural household become part movement. this predominant form lend woman 84% shgs woman shgs march 31, 2014. the scale programme huge give save woman shgs bank stand r 80 billion march 31, 2014 bank loan outstanding woman shgs r 360 billion march 31, 2014. the emphasis shgf program shift towards livelihood opportunity shg member apart expand outreach across country. 4 bi central bankers’ speech role msmes poverty alleviation 19. promote growth micro, small, medium enterprise (msmes) critical perspective job creation recognize prime mover development agenda india. msmes sector contribute 45% total industrial output, 40% export 8% gdp. also, sector employ large amount workforce agriculture promote balance regional development. in term recommendation prime minister’s task force msmes, bank advise achieve 20 per cent year-on-year growth credit micro small enterprise 10 per cent annual growth number micro enterprise accounts. it also mandate 60 per cent mse advance go micro enterprise keep view large scale exclusion micro enterprise formal bank system. focus skill development 20. globally, student complete class 12th consider ready job education system prepare vocation choice. in india, however, lack employment opportunity get basic education necessarily result two outcome – one disillusionment education system second, keep pursue high education want job. 21. dearth formal vocational education, high school dropout rates, inadequate skill train capacity, negative perception towards skilling, lack industry ready skill even professional courses, continue stand major cause poor skill level lack entrepreneurship india’s workforce. there press need scale skill unorganized workforce within sector well msme employer train inputs. integrate skill development initiative secondary intermediate level education would address challenge low education level also provide school dropout employability skills. 22. it hearten note government commit encourage entrepreneurship country revision national skill development policy 2009 scheme different ministry rout newly form skill ministry. this would vital consider current government’s thrust “make in india.” conclusion 23. before i conclude, let raise concern detrimental consolidation furtherance significant work do area financial inclusion poverty alleviation recent past. • be much demand place bank system resources? the bank presently almost alone expect identify & enrol new customers, educate them, conduct aadhaar registration, carry administration link life/non-insurance scheme & pension product on. the issue whether would encroach upon obligation credit dispensation, maintain asset quality, maintain service standard etc. • loan waiver scheme employment result creation social infrastructure /productive asset raise risk broad work culture/credit culture country • non-adherence basic economic discipline state eg. fix minimum support price counterproductive long run • weaken governance multiplicity regulation

poverty alleviation • don’t need new model enhance productivity & stop fragmentation already small land hold – be dbt/interest subvention long-term answer problems? • migration rural india rapid urbanization reality social, infrastructural, employment inclusion dimension – adequately prepare deal them? 24. it must thus appreciate poverty alleviation long draw process need support quarter – government, policy makers, medium society large. each one need his/her bite ensure poverty defeat prosperity thrives. an ecosystem need create fight poverty manifestations. i thank mr. kochhar skoch

stevens: remark american chamber commerce australia (amcham) remark mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, american chamber commerce australia (amcham), melbourne, 20 march 2015. * * * thank invitation join today. in audience business leader expose american australian business scenes, i might expect attempt comparison two economies. so i offer follow snapshot. • in america, growth improve past year, much slow policy maker would like quite years, deep recession 2008–09. real gdp per head 2¾ per cent previous peak december 2007. • in australia economy growing, somewhat slow would like while. we haven’t deep downturn twenty years. real gdp per head 5½ per cent high december 2007. • in america, unemployment rate peak 10 per cent october 2009 5½ per cent. the average rate new century date (ie since 2000) 6½ per cent. • in australia unemployment rate october 2009 5½ per cent. it fell, gradually rise 6¼ per cent now. the average new century date 5½ per cent. • in america, inflation low asset value rising. interest rate extremely low, central bank talk raise them. • in australia, inflation low asset value rising. interest rate low, central bank talk low further. • in america, international competitiveness decline due rise u dollar. • in australia, international competitiveness improving, due decline australian dollar. • in america, political partisanship across range issues, budget stalemate. • in australia, political partisanship across range issue and, past year, budget stalemate. the result? american business household seem get optimistic future. but australian business household seem get le optimistic future. it would interest lunch conversation talk fact lead two differ conclusion future. admittedly, global backdrop respect le supportive australia year ago. our term trade falling. they 3½ years. it always understand would occur, even accurate predict time (we predict way early) extent: key resource price initially fell little slowly, recently good deal quickly, either official private consensus forecast assumed. nonetheless, actual 2 bi central bankers’ speech event get much attention. the various ramification – decline mine investment, effect income government revenue – subject daily news. in respects, lot change lately. china continue grow size importance open up. much make china “missing” 2014 growth target, one tenth percentage point. (let u australia hope target miss size.) much also make low target set 2015, always go occur, successive growth objective likely get progressively low year ahead. an economy large china unlikely sustain sort growth rate see early years. no one grow 10 per cent forever. even growth bite year’s objective would still considerable impetus global demand output. that said, outworking excess early period rapid growth, especially period financial crisis 2008, remain work progress source risk. but ways, one could argue global backdrop improved. a i noted, u economy – still world’s large innovative – gain momentum past year, look temporary up down data. for china’s great importance australia days, healthy u economy underestimate driver business think trend-setter financial markets. in addition, fall oil prices, mostly result oil available use case, mainly bullish development global economy short term, problem producer state notwithstanding. it bonus american consumer certainly. it expect federal reserve will, time year, lift federal fund rate accelerator floor. if happen doubt disruption, always, first feed tighten nine year ecb ease policy time. so likely turbulence asset foreign exchange markets. on whole, though, i think regard fed’s likely action positive development. feed policy still likely quite expansionary time. the punch bowl isn’t take away, content make little le potent. while go economy continue adjustment end investment phase “mining boom”. the massive run-up resource sector capital spend natural response early high price reversing, cause drag demand. so hope source demand speed help make difference. some are, though seamlessly u would like. i’ve talk lot i won’t labour point. it major transition. we hope assist it, reserve bank that, continue lend support can, within limit power consistent mandate. the decline exchange rate assist transition (as assist absorb early phase mine boom). but always say cannot hope fine-tune transition, however much may wish otherwise. look back history episodes, past century more, come term trade event neither major outbreak inflation upswing major crash downswing, even period sub-average growth process, do far, far good previous event kind, let alone one magnitude. i still think likely outcome. even so, low term trade mean that, thing equal, path future income high might look year ago. even allow fact knew, intellectually, least part boom permanent, human tendency project see (good bad) future. eventually reality intrude re-evaluate. that happen countless time again, doubt. it mean attention need give thing help economy work deliver need even low term trade. these sort thing make bi central bankers’ speech 3 difference mine boom. they field expertise. i simply observe thing as: • open, competitive markets; • education skill building; • flexibility adaptability; • quality public infrastructure; • strong public institutions, pragmatic, balance regulatory arrangements; • reward entrepreneurial risk-taking likely give u best chance kind prosperity seek. public policy contribution foster environment, business (large small) individual make choice ultimately deliver whatever success capable of. haruhiko kuroda: quantitative qualitative monetary ease – theory practice speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, foreign correspondents’ club japan, tokyo, 20 march 2015. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it great honor opportunity speak today foreign correspondents’ club japan. with european central bank (ecb) start asset purchase program, major central banks, include federal reserve bank england (boe), adopt quantitative ease (qe). if i may borrow word professor takatoshi ito, friend someone i greatly respect, “we qe-sians now.” that said, economic price situation qe introduced, well policy transmission mechanism assumed, differ among country regions. today, i would like clarify characteristic bank japan’s current quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) focus similarity difference qe introduce central banks. i explain qqe produce intend effects. i. the theory behind qqe similarity difference qe qqe i mention “we qe-sians now.” what bring u situation global financial crisis 2008. the u.s. european economy deteriorate considerably due global financial crisis unemployment increase substantially, central bank stimulate economy monetary easing. initially, central bank europe unite state respond crisis use traditional policy tool low short-term interest rates, since economy deteriorate quite significantly, rate soon approach zero low bind (chart 1). face zero low bind short-term nominal interest rates, central bank therefore confront question proceed monetary easing. the federal reserve’s boe’s answer introduce qe. qe mainly aim stimulate economy low long-term interest rates, still room fall, massive purchase government bond central bank. the bank’s qqe similar qe aim encourage long-term interest rate decline massive purchase government bonds. qqe, however, another element: drastically change deflationary mindset take hold amid prolong deflation. in order understand point, necessary correctly diagnose problem ail japan’s economy identify appropriate remedies. japan’s economy suffer deflation since mid-1990s, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) zero slightly negative. a key feature deflation japan mild persistent: average year-on-year rate change cpi fiscal 1998 fiscal 2012 minus 0.3 percent, deflationary situation last decade half (chart 2). japan get mire deflation due variety factors, include balance sheet adjustment firm financial institution follow burst asset price bubble, inflow low-priced good emerge economies, excessive appreciation yen. bi central bankers’ speech 1 whatever reason may be, key problem arise that, price continue fall due factor prolong period, deflationary mindset take hold among public – is, belief become entrench price would increase continue steadily decline. once deflationary mindset take hold, people engage economic activity assume deflation would continue. a result, economy fell vicious cycle decline prices, decline sale profits, stagnant wage consumption, decline prices. moreover, deflation, real value cash deposit increase decline prices. therefore, hoard cash deposit become relatively good investment strategy actual investment, discourage firm take risk invest business facility research development launch new businesses. in way, deflation japan perpetuate self-fulfilling manner growth potential continue decline. in order overcome situation, necessary change entrench view “prices rise” achieve state firm household act base assumption “prices rise moderately every year.” in economic jargon, people’s view price develop future call inflation expectations. and although inflation rate tend fluctuate – reflect business cycle also temporary factor change commodity price – likely around level inflation expectation average, medium- long-term inflation expectation anchor certain level. a numerical definition central bank consider price stability base specific price index 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi; become global standard recent years. while i go detail due time constraints, figure – 2 percent – take account upward bias cpi, is, tendency index overstate inflation, provide buff allow sufficiently low real interest rate economy deteriorate. for japan’s economy overcome deflation, necessary dispel deflationary mindset raise inflation expectation – decline 0 percent – 2 percent re-anchor expectation level. change people’s expectation main aim qqe. the theory behind qqe attempt change people’s mindset perception monetary policy without historical precedent. for example, direction desire change opposite japan, federal reserve chairman paul volcker successful late 1970s early 1980s substantially low inflation expectations, ratchet upward, powerful monetary tighten (chart 3). since unemployment inflation surge time, stringent monetary tighten create political social challenges. despite difficulties, however, quite clear chairman volcker policy step take low inflation expectations: pursue strong monetary tighten substantially raise short-term interest rate contain inflation. on hand, qqe would aggravate unemployment, face another problem, namely tool monetary ease limited, give short-term interest rate close zero low bound. the think behind qqe follows. first all, i discuss earlier, give short-term interest rate decline zero, bank, like federal reserve boe, decide put downward pressure long-term interest rate massive purchase government bonds. the bank focus fact influence economic activity nominal real interest rates, is, interest rate level obtain subtract inflation expectation nominal interest rates. in regard, fact inflation expectation japan well price stability target 2 percent provide way break 2 bi central bankers’ speech deflationary mindset: bank could raise inflation expectations, real interest rate would fall, stimulate economic activity firm households. in sense, raise inflation expectation objective qqe and, time, key implement qqe transmission mechanism overcome deflation. this raise question people’s deflationary mindset change inflation expectation raised. for firm household deflationary mindset start think “from now, act base assumption price rise 2 percent every year,” necessary central bank fully commit achieve 2 percent inflation. base considerations, bank commit achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, time horizon two years, maintain target stable manner. and mean end, bank introduce large-scale monetary ease form qqe. a decline real interest rate expect stimulate private demand business fix investment, private consumption, house investment. such increase private demand turn reduce output gap, is, amount slack economy whole, thereby put upward pressure prices. and people actually experience inflation, boost confidence bank’s commitment, lead rise inflation expectation reinforce aforementioned processes, form virtuous cycle. this mechanism qqe aim raise inflation inflation expectation 2 percent. ii. the practice qqe effect qqe so far, i talk theory qqe, extent policy actually exert effects? first all, result bank’s massive purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), long-term interest rate declined. ten-year jgb yield recently around 0.4 percent (chart 4). moreover, average interest rate new loan decline historic low 0.9 percent. in addition, people’s perception inflation clearly changed. various indicator medium- long-term inflation expectation show clear increase since introduction qqe. for example, figure present consensus forecast 0.8 percent october 2012 rise 1.5 percent late. therefore, real interest rates, include longer-term ones, become clearly negative. also, people business feel that, daily life, inflation environment change substantially. let cite two noteworthy examples. first, year-on-year rate change cpi positive 20 month since june 2013. this first time since 1998 people experience inflation long period. it mean first time ever people 20 young experience rise prices. second, since last year, nominal wage rising. of particular note annual wage negotiation last spring, so-called spring offensive, base pay rise first time 20 years, rise base pay likely see increasingly many firm year. both example represent landmark change japan, experience deflation long period. while word “deflation” – defure japanese – become part everyday conversation, recently term rarely heard. furthermore, momentum toward overcome deflationary mindset continue even amid decline cpi inflation reflect effect fall crude oil prices. look indicator inflation expectations, market-based indicator break-even inflation rate – europe unite state – declined, various survey bi central bankers’ speech 3 economist household suggest medium- long-term inflation expectation continue upward trend. we believe bank’s expansion qqe last october – undertake preemptive response risk fall crude oil price could affect wage negotiation price-setting low inflation expectation – effective. a i explained, qqe exert intend effect seem safe say qqe work theory practice. the bank belief achieve price stability target 2 percent continue steadily pursue qqe go forward. in following, i offer view economic price situation detail, explain i think qqe lead realization price stability target 2 percent. economic price situation let start economic activity. the corporate sector buoyant. profit continue improve reach new peak (chart 5). the decline crude oil price benefit sector reduce costs. in addition, export production pick up. in situation, firm maintain positive investment stance demand labor remain strong. against backdrop strong demand labor corporate sector, labor market condition remain tight japan close full employment. specifically, unemployment rate decline around 3.5 percent, roughly level structural unemployment rate (chart 6). the tightness labor market condition exert upward pressure nominal wages, expect continue rising. against backdrop steady improvement employment income situation, private consumption whole firm. in situation, downward pressure stem decline demand follow consumption tax hike waning. the decline crude oil price also favorable effect private consumption. give various tailwind economic activity, bank expect japan’s real gdp growth fiscal 2015 2 percent. in bank’s january interim assessment october 2014 outlook report economic activity prices, real gdp growth rate project 2.1 percent fiscal 2015 1.6 percent fiscal 2016 (chart 7). in current improve economic situation, output gap improve substantially mainly due tighten labor market. it become 0 percent, is, close long-term average. go forward, japan’s economy continue grow potential growth rate, estimate around 0.5 percent lower, output gap expect improve. in addition, mention earlier, medium- long-term inflation expectation remain uptrend. the underlie trend inflation increase two determinants, namely, output gap medium- long-term inflation expectations, improving. however, term year-on-year rate increase cpi exclude fresh food strip direct effect consumption tax hike, inflation slow since last summer due mainly substantial decline crude oil price register 0.2 percent january (chart 8). go forward, rate increase expect 0 percent due effect decline energy price likely remain level time being. however, underlie trend inflation expect continue steadily increase future. therefore, effect fall crude oil price year-on-year rate change, is, base effect, dissipate, cpi inflation accelerate achieve 2 percent cpi inflation come sight. base assumption crude oil price rise moderately recent levels, cpi inflation expect reach 2 percent around fiscal 2015 (chart 7). the time could somewhat sooner late envisage depend development crude oil prices. however, clear time 2 percent target achieve depend mainly fluctuation 4 bi central bankers’ speech energy prices, market participant draw unwarranted conclusion regard monetary policy, know base effect cause change energy price eventually disappear. needle say, bank maintain policy stance make adjustment necessary without hesitation, change underlie trend inflation, especially development inflation expectations, order achieve price stability target early possible time. iii. the government’s growth strategy bank’s monetary policy to conclude speech, i would like talk strengthen growth potential japan’s economy. japan’s potential growth rate decline trend since 1990s (chart 9). reason include demographic trend decline working-age population well regulatory institutional factor hind corporate activity impede competition. in order raise growth potential, necessary remove factor hamper private entities’ proactive economic activities. consequently, encourage various regulatory institutional reform steadily implement government’s growth strategy. in context, i would like highlight overcome deflation contribute raise japan’s growth potential. investment innovation private sector key economic growth, role government’s growth strategy create environment firm thoroughly pursue business opportunities. in addition, overcome deflation achieve economy society economic entity take action assumption 2 percent inflation revive firms’ households’ animal spirits. if happens, people start take risk invest new ventures, turn likely give rise innovations. with firm household become proactive, become even clear regulatory institutional aspect hamper growth. i think one reason progress make regulatory institutional reform momentum toward reform lack private entity sufficiently proactive. the emergence real need reform major drive force push ahead regulatory institutional reforms. under qqe, deflationary mindset steadily dispelled. the bank aim contribute strengthen growth potential japan’s economy continue effort qqe achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. conclude remark today, i talk challenge face japan’s economy characteristic qqe remedy challenges. the great lesson japan’s experience best fall deflation first place, since danger that, economy fall it, deflation become protracted. if risk deflation, policy authority make every effort prevent economy fall it. have say that, even economy become trap deflation, possible overcome deflation innovative monetary policy. by succeed get economy deflation qqe, bank hope provide case point. if bank show even economy fall deflation, policy measure escape it, strengthen confidence central banks’ ability achieve price stability targets, reinforce ability anchor inflation expectations. well-anchored inflation expectations, turn, help prevent economy fall become trap deflation first place. in regard, success bank’s qqe important implication japan’s economy also monetary policy around globe. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi

colombia, 9 march 2015. * * * thank invitation speak today. it pleasure attend conference, opportunity exchange view many you. my remark today focus potential effect u.s. outlook policy emerge market economies. i make three main points. • the u.s. economy appear likely make progress toward federal open market committee’s (fomc) objective maximum sustainable employment price stability. this actual prospective improvement underlie market expectation fomc begin raise federal fund rate sometime late year. • emerge market economy (emes) generally perform well u.s. tighten cycles, especially policy shift support effective communication context u.s. growth. • there notable progress improve safety soundness international u.s. financial systems, good support financial stability economic growth. before i turn specifics, let remind i say today reflect views, necessarily federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system. since end great recession almost six year ago, u.s. growth average somewhat disappoint 2.3 percent. but growth pick recently, late blue chip forecast growth average slightly 3 percent next year. there good reason think period strong growth sustained. • household balance sheet much improve condition, total household liability well 2008 peak, debt service burden low share disposable income 30 years. moreover, consumer benefit positive wealth effect high house equity prices. • labor market improvement pick pace, payroll gain last several month strong since mid-1990s. worker finally begin see least modest real wage gains. and u.s. unemployment rate fall low level since mid-2008. • the recent drop oil price provide significant boost household spend power nearly percentage point increase real disposable incomes. • the house sector much good balance. the inventory-sales ratio home near, even slightly below, level typically consider “normal,” significant drop fraction household carry mortgage balance excess value homes. • the fiscal restraint hold back growth recent year give way neutral posture. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • the non-financial corporate sector remain generally healthy condition, high profit margin high ratio liquid asset current liabilities. of course, important risk growth outlook including: whether household behave cautiously relative fundamental give experience great recession; extent impact oil produce sector low oil prices, direction business cycle abroad. the fomc’s view january statement risk u.s. growth nearly balanced. there also risk direction inflation outlook. headline inflation fall quite low due drop oil prices. these effect likely transitory. measure underlie inflation core pce deflator run somewhat short fomc’s 2 percent objective time. moreover, market-based measure medium-term inflation compensation fall somewhat objective recent months, even survey measure expectation hold essentially steady. there also upside risk inflation. the unemployment rate decline wage growth firm remain slack diminishes. moreover, u.s. economy’s productivity performance relatively unimpressive recent quarters. if continued, could also begin push inflation higher. it context committee begin consider appropriate time pace remove extraordinary accommodation. the committee state january “it patient begin normalize stance monetary policy,” time policy shift data dependent, base ongoing careful evaluation progress towards committee’s goal maximum employment 2 percent inflation.1 emerge market official market participant express concern feed liftoff might spark undue tighten global financial conditions, create new growth headwind emerge market economies. these concern understandable. the federal fund rate near zero low bind six years. the taper tantrum spring summer 2013 provide ready reminder potential volatility around actual perceive news concern feed policy. like central banks, fed’s monetary policy mandate define domestic terms. yet feed take potential international implication policy quite seriously. in part, come sense special responsibility give international reserve currency status dollar. an outward-looking perspective also warrant international effect feed

account deficits, heavy reliance portfolio inflows, high above-target inflation rates. market respond favorably eme authority shift toward clear, consistent policy focus inflation objective external sustainability, away policy multiple sometimes compete objectives. let add think ongoing financial reform efforts. the complexity, severity speed global financial crisis require forceful wide-ranging international regulatory response. this include high capital liquidity standards, strong recovery resolution regime supervise institutions, great transparency standardization derivative markets. these effort number positive effects, although may lead change bank business model strategy u.s. internationally. in u.s., effort make bank system much strong today crisis. in aggregate, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio among u.s. bank hold company increase 13 percent, increase almost 45 percent relative pre-crisis levels, quality capital improved. bank hold company balance sheet also significantly liquid, liquid asset increase 26 percent total asset end-2006 38 percent end-2014. core deposit fund 44 percent total assets, 10 percentage point increase pre-crisis levels. a strong u.s. bank system good protect future shocks, provide solid foundation growth, therefore also enhance prospect growth financial stability abroad. 3 “international capital flows: reliable fickle?” world economic outlook, april 2011, chapter 4. 4 bi central bankers’ speech basel iii implementation proceed comparable basis advance emerge market countries. the financial stability board monitor unintended effect reform eme bank emes report significant adverse effects.4 however, potential difference reform implementation across jurisdiction could create challenges, particularly country foreign bank active. this underscore importance continue home host coordination. i would like briefly touch two u.s.-specific financial regulatory issue international implications, namely enhance prudential standard foreign banks, include intermediate hold company requirement large institutions, issue surround correspondent banking, u.s. anti-money launder rules, “de-risking”. of these, latter may relevance emes broadly. the adoption enhance prudential standard foreign bank organization (fbos) key element u.s. regulatory reforms, significant change supervision fbos.5 the large fbos (with u.s. non-branch asset great $50 billion) must hold u.s. subsidiary intermediate hold company (ihc), meet various capital, leverage, liquidity, stress testing, risk management corporate governance requirements. these requirement respond mandate dodd-frank act enhance standard large domestic foreign banks. the significant requirement expect fall large fbos advance economy – also adopt tight local requirement foreign bank – contribute importantly safe sound u.s. international financial system. correspondent bank relationship also receive heighten attention context serious violation anti-money launder know-your-customer standard banks, substantial fines. it imperative firmly deal illegal, unsafe unsound bank practices, include money launder transaction u.s.-sanctioned countries. it also important look-out potential unintended consequence externalities, widespread de-risking correspondent bank access shut compliant counter party legal flows, economic cost excessively increased, flow migrate avenue subject le oversight transparency. the scope, scale, impact de-risking need good understood. dialogue market participant official sector ongoing, multilaterally bilaterally. let conclude. the u.s. economy financial system strengthen notably recent year mutually reinforce way. u.s. monetary regulatory policy need tailor domestic conditions. the feed also mindful international effect policies, give central place u.s. global financial system, potential spillbacks u.s. economy financial system. effective communication market participant policymakers important. the opportunity dialogue make conference one valuable. thank much. 4 “monitoring effect agree regulatory reform emerge market develop economies”, financial stability board, november 12, 2014. 5 enhance prudential standard bank hold company foreign bank organizations, federal register, vol. 79 no. 59, march 27, 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 1 arjuna mahendran: role central bank sri lankan context speech mr arjuna mahendran, governor central bank sri lanka, sri lanka legal summit 2015 “governance, regulation investment – the way forward“, colombo, 5 march 2015. * * * lady gentlemen, i greatly privilege address distinguish audience topic i reasonably conversant. the central bank sri lanka today talk point among public. further, world over, central bank public eye due specific role star global financial crisis, cause mini depression 2009. the central bank sri lanka probably single state authority enormous influence economy economic welfare general public. this influence come power function confer upon central bank number statute lead monetary law act (mla) 1949. in view, compare statute govern central bank countries, mla single piece legislation provide time invariant power function central bank. the law work reasonably well last 65 year without major amendments. the draft law 1949 supervise renowned economist mr. john exter federal reserve bank new york also recognition stellar effort first governor central bank. in report submit government establishment central bank, state follows. i quote “the broad power give central bank ceylon draft bill part ii report commensurate magnitude responsibility. the bank hamper rigid limitation might prevent fulfil purpose. when new central bank establish impossible predict course development. this depend upon environment within work upon who, determine policies. many power may go unused long periods, design particular situations, may never arise. others intend use crisis forestall crisis, prudence dictate include now, hand case need. it would foolhardy assume, record war – depression – induce economic crisis last 30 year plainly us, ceylon economy somehow escape crisis future. the safe assumption one underlie draft present bill: good uncertain economic world prepare eventuality. many feature draft bill develop western hemisphere. others find one form another central bank legislation within commonwealth. the basic pattern suit country introduce central bank system first time contain certain signpost warn signal prove useful administrator long establish tradition year personal experience upon rely. it also provide legal structure flexible adaptable change economic conditions. within structure ample room development policy appropriate times. good central bank le good law good practice. the central bank ceylon may make influence felt effectively development day-to-day relation confidence understand various bank institution exercise power give bill. such influence know textbook “moral suasion” especially important small country 2 bi central bankers’ speech possible develop close relation central bank fairly limit number bank institutions…..” have work economist central bank banker investment banker global financial environment, i perfectly understand mr. exter meant. i invite read exter report interest know type institution central bank is? i would pray you, read exter report, may complain central bank do enough sri lanka economy economic welfare public term mandate give public. the central bank’s power function center around two objectives. those secure economic price stability financial system stability view encourage promote development productive resource sri lanka. this forum define technically objective single accept definition. however, objective nutshell mean secure stability economy. economic price stability mean economy run sustainable growth path supportive low rate inflation. financial system stability mean financial institution market operate without bubble contagious failure trust public financial system maintained, stability economy, price financial system inter-dependent. the stability economy help public make keep plan future ultimately encourage promote development productive resource sri lanka. this promote live standard public increase production, employment real income. this mla empower central bank do. thus, may understand enormous national interest entrust central bank. for secure objectives, central bank grant authority administration, supervision regulation monetary, financial payment system sri lanka action authorize mla. therefore, must clearly understand scope mandate. the central bank cannot directly undertake business provide employment create income construct build promote financial business centers. the central bank’s scope mandate stability sri lanka economy essentially regulation supervision monetary, financial payment system sri lanka. accordingly, function activity central bank carry normal operation issue currency legal tender, implementation monetary policy, supervision bank financial institutions, management international reserve, operation payment system financial relate service government government agent. how central bank carry function help nearly 1,500 staff complex technical subject. the judiciary legal community present today may recall number court case hear judgment deliver past connect certain operation central bank, either central bank procedure prudent safeguard public trust public ignore scope mandate central bank get involve financial sector developments. for example, central bank respondent court case recently file connection unauthorized fail investment scheme petitioner view central bank responsible loss investors’ money. let therefore elaborate central bank functions. first, issue currency central bank concept originate issue currency. in evolution money, private bank start issue bank notes, initially base gold hold late liabilities. the bank public place high trust start operate central bank market. late history, legislation bring empower central bank print bank note currency function intermediary economic transactions. currency issue present sri lanka bi central bankers’ speech 3 rs. 422 billion liability central bank, even asset rest us. the central bank prepare pay currency note value legal tender prefer public. the central bank maintain cash counter this. in order protect public trust currency, central bank primarily undertake two actions. first, attempt issue currency note intrinsic material security make difficult counterfeit design choose facilitate easy recognition different currency note people include blind. still, world currency counterfeit design concern prevail irrespective modern technology. second, attempt protect real value currency maintain inflation low level monetary policy. if price inflation rise day day, value currency term good service buy get le le people tend dispense currency money tend use international currency prefer medium exchange. in events, currency system collapse existence central bank questioned. this happen germany 1920 zimbabwe recent years. second, conduct monetary policy monetary policy contain measure regulate supply, availability, cost international exchange country’s money. accordingly, level interest rates, exchange rate credit economy control central bank. these economic variable determine almost economic activity public investments, savings, international transactions, production employment. their change first affect expenditure (what call aggregate demand) impact production, income employment. this course effect term monetary policy transmission mechanism. a variable part parcel day-to-day life effect vary different segment people, world central bank get fair share praise blame whatever ensue economy. saver criticize central bank low interest rate whereas producer fund production activity bank loan appreciate low interest regime. the central bank also routinely criticize various segment policy manage exchange rate. ultimately, central bank manage monetary policy suit mandate secure objective priorities, give economic knowledge authorize officer monetary board members. it monetary policy determine much money central bank print facilitate economy. under mla, central bank power print money acquire several kind assets. those asset provisional advance government, purchase government securities, purchase foreign exchange lend banks. in conduct monetary policy, central bank determine annual growth money desirable economy take consideration price inflation production growth. in line desirable growth money, central bank maintain asset growth facilitate new money required. in u euro area last six years, central bank expand asset many time print money economy flood money invest production create employment keep interest rate rear zero levels. third, regulation supervision bank financial institution banking, finance lease business fall within purview central bank mla relevant statutes. state supervision accord global literature three specific dimensions. i.e., prudential aspect, conduct sound business consumer protection. prudential supervision promote safety soundness institution risk management. conduct sound business supervision cover fair orderly conduct businesses. consumer protection cover safeguard interest consumers. the central bank’s supervision mainly cover prudential supervision three areas, i.e., issue regulations, examination problem resolution. issue regulation cover maximum limit business limit risks, minimum requirement risk mitigation instrument 4 bi central bankers’ speech minimum capital, liquidity, loan loss provision governance. periodical examination cover assessment risk management capacity early warn impend problem take early remedial actions. problem resolution cover solution institution crisis distress restructuring, bail liquidation. this supervision two perspective micro macro levels. micro supervision mean deal individual institutions. macro supervision mean action protect system stability. although differentiation two barely understand many, central banks’ supervisory action clearly understand central bank act crisis times. the best example permit failure small ail institution bail systemically important institutions. however, customer ail institution want central bank bail out, despite risky behaviour customer institutions. the central bank mandate bail institution repay investments. similarly, central bank cannot reasonably hold responsible institution person engage banking, finance lease business without authority. such unauthorized institution attract investment offer unusual products. the person associate institution usually prey greed, bypass many license institution country. they oppose central bank investigated, start blame central bank start failing. the central bank traditionally strive away intervene fail unauthorized institutions. however, response public pressure, bank may take interventionist approach, henceforth. fourth, maintenance foreign reserve this responsibility monetary board. international reserve authorize mla consist gold liquid foreign currency asset foreign currency notes, foreign government securities, deposit international bank international fund transfer instrument greek bonds. such reserve 70% – 80% asset central bank. there misunderstand even among staff central bank foreign reserve manage like asset portfolio prefer risk- return balance business profit. this wrong. international reserve mla reserve, trade portfolio, hold purpose meet foreseeable deficit international balance payment country thereby support great exchange rate stability free use sri lanka rupee current international transactions. therefore, international reserve comprise highly liquid reserve without know estimate risk-taking. these days, people concern fall international reserve. some complain reserve contain fund mobilize government foreign borrow net receipt trade. those view subject various technical arguments. what central bank is; buy excess foreign exchange market sell reserve meet deficit market order maintain exchange rate desirable level, give relevant economic circumstances. if reserve fall short desire level, central bank standard arrangement replenish it. this reserve us$ 7 billion present adequate pay four month import 70% country’s short-term foreign borrow necessity arises. the reserve use rainy days, show imaginary visit country live within means. fifth, supply payment settlement service economic transaction essentially receipt payment make cash non-cash methods. non-cash payment cheque fund transfer need system ensure payment receive due receivers. the central bank maintain cheque clear lankaclear system. that get cheque realize day, deposit 12.00 noon. further, fund transfer among bank clear settle central bank’s rtgs system. in rtgs, central bank provide intra-day fund deficit bank settle payments. such payment service bi central bankers’ speech 5 make payment safe faster. payment circulation money life blood economy. sixth, agent government this function lead lot criticism independence central bank. six important agency function management public debt, fiscal agent, official depository, financial adviser, management employees’ provident fund administration exchange control act. the important agency function central bank financial/economic adviser government. in regard, central bank responsible monetary policy entire scope escalation. conventionally central bank responsibility advise government fiscal operation extent impinge economy advise best course policy action economy. give nature central banks’ functions, advance access macroeconomic financial information expertise, central bank close economic adviser government. the central bank statutorily submit number report central bank annual report part advice. in addition, central bank provide advice various policy matter on-going basis government. however, central bank world blame provide constructive impartial advice independence issue. i talk central bank independence moment. a manager public debt, central bank raise local foreign debt meet expenditure approve consolidate fund, maintain loan record service loan fund government account central bank. the popular criticism monetization budget deficit central bank funds. the central bank’s purchase treasury bill cause criticism. the central bank purchase treasury bill order use regulation domestic market liquidity (open market operations) permit mla lend government. further, mla, central bank authorize provide provisional advance government 10% estimate government revenue current financial year, subject recovery advance within 6 months, advance meet expenditure authorize consolidate fund. manage public debt central bank beneficial country since central bank raise public debt line interest rate structure envisage monetary policy. if debt management undertake separate government office, may attempt raise debt without regard market interest rate monetary policy cause immense conflict current monetary policy. the opposite view central bank manage public debt, monetary policy constrain need attempt raise maintain public debt low cost. the central bank banker government maintain account general treasury government institution agencies. the treasury account, know dst account, main transaction account handle public debt flows. in term mla, government government institution agency must obtain advice monetary board implication borrow monetary condition raise debts. this ensure government borrow make concurrence monetary board line monetary policy. two important agency function management employees’ provident fund administration exchange control act, evolve controversy. in case employees’ provident fund, monetary board empower manage fund include investment surplus fund security monetary board consider fit. i know hear enough epf investment make recent past. give nature epf responsibility government, epf fund are, i would submit mean safe investments. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the exchange control act regulate manage foreign exchange flow country essentially part macroeconomic management. in economics, exchange control regulation quantity volume foreign exchange market. conversely, central bank regulate price exchange rate market mla. therefore, provision exchange control act strengthen macro-economic policy hand central bank. in nutshell, implementation exchange control act focus nowadays facilitate finance investment – save gap country foreign resource essential development country. at present, foreign exchange transaction involve trade, services, travel foreigners’ investment largely free capital transaction resident subject controls. you appreciate that, exchange control liberalization since 1977, country’s economic development live standard would achieve present level. consequence previous regulatory intervention there success story consequence previous regulatory intervention market. this common central bank. i wish brief issue challenge confront past way forward. the central bank’s intervention 1988/89 finance company crisis could bailout depositor extent get new law pass regulate finance companies. however, central bank lose public fund amount rs. 6 billion (need check.) cope still complain central bank able recover money. again 10 years, finance company crisis hit another form depositor lose save fail company central bank unable resolve crisis even six years. in line new government’s announce policy, central bank give priority due justice depositors. we need fix finance company sector risky business model strong regulation market discipline. otherwise, sector pose risk financial system stability next 10 years. another regulatory intervention create immense macro economic consequence attempt appreciate maintain currency highly over-valued period 2009 – 2012 around rs. 109 – 110 per u dollar. for purpose, central bank lose us$ 3.5 billion foreign reserve lead foreign exchange crisis. finally, crisis manage raise loan us$ 2.6 billion imf restore international reserve allow sharp depreciation currency around rs. 134 per us$ june 2012. this intervention lead raise interest rate, control credit raise fuel price dampen impact growth economy reduce 6.3% 2012. in regard, although raise concern current intervention exchange rate, comfortable current level international reserve, pending already arrange inflow foreign resource strengthen reserve. another case point pramuka bank failure 2002 – 2004. the central bank’s decision liquidate bank challenge court appeal quash central bank decision grind central bank follow due procedure give bank act. finally, government part political decision interest depositor bail bank vest bank new state bank set purpose. if central bank conscious responsibilities, could resort different path resolve bank early stage. world over, central bank blame delay action, effective resolve problems. world over, regulator fall behind market although expect correct market. regulator burden laws, procedure bureaucracy lack late market information. they work office hours. however, market participant work 24 hour innovative regulatory arbitrage. the human greed support moral hazard regulation create bubble cyclically lead financial economic crisis time time. the regulator politician create new laws, fail prevent next bubble. a person regulator markets, i lot work address bi central bankers’ speech 7 universal issue hopefully. however, financial regulator cannot control greed, financial bubble crisis happen. finally, central bank independence confuse technical subject. no central bank divine. central bank also state institutions, great functional independence provide respective statute due specific nature operation involve print money conduct monetary policies. the simple reason central bank independence government cannot one hand spend fiscal policy hand print money finance expenditure monetary policy. therefore, clear separation treasury central bank necessary, otherwise, economy monetary system collapse sooner later. therefore, central bank independence close co-operation central bank treasury highly recognized. i wish quote exter report matter best piece literature. i quote “….there are, however, many important problem monetary policy, especially relate fiscal policy, central bank must necessarily work close harmony government. on problems, experience many country show central bank degree independence government proper make economic analysis hold view detach objective government department. many government learn value use sort independent objective advice monetary aspect economic policy central bank able give. on matter vital interest state, however, must recognize even absence formula british australian, would impossible central bank adopt policy pursue course action contrary policy government day. no agency creature government entirely independent government. while government may prepare give independent regulatory agency rather wide discretion field money, gain-saying last analysis government must assume responsibility monetary policy policies. the governor appoint member monetary board cannot help acutely conscious fact that, since parliament bind successors, independence tenure office propose legislation limit ultimate power government change law. the exact degree independence central bank likely vary time time. for example, central bank ordinarily act independently stable, peace-time economic condition time war national emergency. they also tend take strong stand issue primarily monetary character relate issue may simply monetary repercussions. the ideal hop propose law achieve one continuous constructive co-operation monetary board government. the principal instrument achieve co-operation permanent secretary ministry finance whose membership board ensure time minister’s view make know member board. the effectiveness co-operation co-ordination board government depend upon men occupy key position particular time upon legal formula, matter carefully elaborately might work out. a relationship complex, sometimes delicate, one certain be, cannot establish full-blown piece legislation. it must result, countries, year experience slow growth political conventions. one point well worth making. there clear need ceylon sort economic council cabinet level achieve improve co-ordination government economic policies. if future council set suggest governor central bank place upon it……” 8 bi central bankers’ speech finally, officer central bank god know problem advance give 100% solutions. we human be make mistakes. but need thing accountable manner use statutory discretion credibly protect public trust us. for need maintain credible procedure decision-making public court scrutinize judge whether make decision fair manner consider available information. in regard, central bank long way go. my initial day office spend put place procedure line mandate nature public interest. i know easy change thing long time. a lot sacrifice necessary. lady gentlemen, i know i state confuse enough. however, i sure technical insight central bank. i doubt appreciate central bank heart economy many state so. thank much listen me. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel k tarullo: application enhance prudential standard bank hold company testimony mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 19 march 2015. * * * chairman shelby, rank member brown, member committee, i appreciate opportunity testify threshold section 165 dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act (dodd-frank act) application enhance prudential standard bank hold companies. in testimony morning i try provide, regulator’s perspective, context committee’s consideration subject explain federal reserve differentially implement prudential regulation base size, scope, range activity bank organizations, well organize supervisory portfolios. in supervisory regulatory practices, pursue tiered approach prudential oversight. regulatory differentiation dodd-frank act traditionally, statute create prudential regulatory requirement authority generally take might term unitary approach. that is, statute simply make particular requirement authority applicable bank bank organization generally, clear distinction base characteristic regulate entities. the federal bank agency adopt regulation requirement apply large institutions. and, i describe bite later, supervisory practice administer statutory requirement differently base size bank scope activities. but start point le similar set statutory requirements. the dodd-frank act explicitly break traditional approach create prudential requirement vary size systemic importance bank organizations. of particular importance dodd-frank act emphasis financial stability, market generally respect large financial firms, associate market perception big fail. the law create new authority financial regulator instruct regulator use authority already put place regulation contain systemic risk. a regulation applicable individual firms, dodd-frank act create threshold various prudential regulation asset size $1 billion, $10 billion, $50 billion. of special note section 165 dodd-frank act require federal reserve establish enhance prudential standard bank hold company total asset $50 billion financial firm designate systemically important financial stability oversight council. among areas, standard include capital, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, single-counterparty credit limits. of particular significance section 165 requirement enhance standard increase stringency depend size, interconnectedness, role credit intermediation, factor specify law. in addition enhanced, graduate standards, section 165 require firm great $50 billion asset subject annual supervisory stress tests. the federal reserve implement section 165 requirement graduate stringency enhance prudential standard create are, effect, three category within universe bank organization $50 billion assets. a require statute, firm within universe subject basic enhance standards. firm asset $50 billion $250 billion subject basic enhance standards. firm least $250 billion asset $10 billion on-balance-sheet foreign asset also subject stringent requirements, include advance approach risk-based 2 bi central bankers’ speech capital requirements, supplementary leverage ratio, countercyclical capital buffer, full-scope liquidity coverage ratio. finally, eight u.s. bank hold company designate global systemically important bank organization subject additional set regulatory requirements. an enhance supplementary leverage ratio, equally applicable eight firms, already adopted. we also work two requirement vary stringency even among eight firms, base relative systemic importance. one set risk-based capital surcharge issue notice propose rulemaking late last year. the other, anticipate issue notice propose rulemaking come months, long-term debt requirement design support effective orderly resolution processes. in sum, stringency federal reserve’s prudential regulation increase proportion systemic importance bank organizations. with tiered approach regulation, federal reserve aim achieve dodd-frank act goal mitigate risk u.s. financial stability, manner limit regulatory cost expenditure supervisory resource need promote safety, soundness, financial stability. tiered regulatory supervisory experience the federal reserve also take tiered approach supervision. we organize firm supervise portfolio base predominately, although exclusively, asset size. we four groups: (1) community bank organizations, generally $10 billion le total assets; (2) regional bank organizations, total asset $10 billion $50 billion; (3) large bank organizations, total asset $50 billion among large complex bank organizations; (4) firm oversee large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc), large complex bank organizations.1 a tiered regulation, tiered supervision intend take account difference business models, risks, relative regulatory burdens, salient considerations. where specific regulatory goal different portfolio vary, supervisory program reflect differences. and even goal similar across portfolios, supervisory program nevertheless take account difference among firm four portfolios. in general, shape supervisory expectation portfolio consider increase safety soundness likely achieve specific practice requirement, light regulatory cost bank organization portfolio impact stress failure institution would likely credit intermediation, deposit insurance fund, financial stability. so, example, heighten expectation regard corporate governance large bank organization apply regional community bank organizations. among areas, federal reserve expect board director large firm set direction oversight revenue profit generation, risk management, control functions; ensure senior management expertise level involvement require manage core business lines, critical operations, bank offices, material entities; maintain corporate culture emphasize importance compliance laws, regulation, consumer protection. while strong corporate governance important bank organizations, vital large bank organizations, give system operation typically much broad 1 for information liscc, see http://federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm. bi central bankers’ speech 3 complex smaller-scale localize regional community bank organizations. while asset size principal determinant general supervisory program bank organization, factor take account appropriate. for example, regional bank organization become involve activity typically undertake large bank organizations, might add firm’s supervision expectation practice draw large bank organization portfolio. moreover, determine bank organization belong liscc portfolio, federal reserve focus risk financial system pose individual firm – size dispositive factor. for example, three large bank organization portfolio, even though large balance sheet processing- custody-focused bank hold company liscc portfolio. the stress failure large, essentially regional bank organization could serious effect credit intermediation across significant part country and, situation generalize stress, might consequence financial system whole. however, judge function two processing- custody-focused liscc firm implicate systemic concern great extent substantial balance sheet large regionals. the role statutory threshold a i hope apparent, federal reserve do considerable work tailor supervision bank organization reference size, business model, systemic importance. similarly, use statutory discretion grant us, frequently cooperation regulatory agencies, also tailor application certain statutory requirement different group banks. the question statutory threshold thus fairly narrow one: doe threshold specify cut-off point appropriate mandatory application particular regulatory requirement, take account whatever discretion give implement regulatory agencies? in answer question, first worth note case establish statutory thresholds. in past, congress time simply give bank agency authority engage particular form prudential regulation, require so. capital regulation prompt correction action two examples. not coincidentally, i think, congressional action follow bank crisis reveal possible shortcoming regulatory supervisory structure exist precede crisis. in require certain kind prudential regulation, congress effect protect memory problem fade consequent possibility supervisory relaxation, might allow recurrence similar bank problem future. the creation mandatory threshold certain enhance prudential standard important advance traditional congressional role specify set mandatory regulations. this statutory structure recognize substantially divergent risk present economy financial system potential stress failure bank organization different size different activities, preserve considerable discretion bank agency implement regulations. here again, statutory enactment mandatory measure bank organization certain size systemic importance serf form safeguard erosion prudential oversight could occur predominant reliance place detail firm-specific supervision, sometimes hard public discern. removal change thresholds, generally applicable prudential requirements, thus require congressional action occasion consider public debate merit change. experience date, however, suggest statutory threshold might bear reexamination. one pertain applicability dodd-frank act provision community banks. for example, volcker rule incentive compensation 4 bi central bankers’ speech requirement section 956 dodd-frank act direct concern generally present large institutions, volcker rule term apply bank organizations, incentive compensation provision apply term bank organization $1 billion assets. the bank agency do best tailor application rule small bank and, indeed, make clear limit extent affect banks. however, compliance effort rule still need community banks. raise asset threshold two requirement $10 billion would eliminate compliance burden, cost probably worth whatever incremental prudential benefit might gain small banks. even relatively unusual circumstance practice small bank might raise safety soundness concerns, supervisory process would remain available rectify problems. the second threshold worth discuss $50 billion level establish section 165 dodd-frank act. a note earlier, import threshold require enhance prudential standard supervisory stress test bank organization whose asset exceed amount. a also noted, federal reserve tailor standard accordance increase stringency requirement section 165, flexible institution close $50 billion threshold demand eight firm global systemic importance. it somewhat difficult customize supervisory stress testing. while element test, market shock single-counterparty default scenarios, apply large firms, basic requirement aggregation report data conform supervisory model firm run scenario model entail substantial expenditure out-of-pocket human resources. this considerable challenge $60 billion $70 billion bank. on side ledger, derive supervisory benefit inclusion bank toward low end range supervisory stress tests, benefit relatively modest, believe could probably realize supervisory means. these factor lay behind suggestion last year might worth think level threshold, i understand purpose today’s hearing. that said, i want emphasize points. first, consideration potential increase threshold mandatory prudential measure remove discretion bank agency require additional measure – include thing capital liquidity – specific firm group firm appropriate circumstances. that is, sensible limit mandatory measure class firm bank class unlikely present particular kind risk, would ill-advised preclude supervisor require measure firm risk may become concern. second, consideration raise threshold take account factor i mention early extend removal application enhance standard rule large bank organizations. a senator regulator discuss many time committee, task combat reality perception big fail, vulnerability broad financial markets, crucial ongoing. conclusion the innovation dodd-frank act require tiered regulation central share goal protect financial stability ensure availability credit. small bank pose risk financial stability, though suffer collateral damage stress build throughout financial system. and, enhance prudential standard important ensure large bank continue provide credit even period stress, enhancement could actually inhibit credit extension render reasonable business model middle-sized small bank unprofitable. the federal reserve continue use statutory authority calibrate regulation supervision risk pose different class banks, avoid one-size-fits-all approach. we bi central bankers’ speech 5 and, i believe, many others commit dual goal protect systemic stability foster efficient intermediation credit overwhelm majority american bank pose systemic far-reaching risks. thank you. i would please take question may have. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: what capital market deliver? speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, ilf (institute law finance) conference “the european capital market union, viable concept real goal?”, frankfurt main, 18 march 2015. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman thank much invite speak year’s ilf conference. the topic conference well chosen, i therefore grateful opportunity speak today’s event share think european capital market union. but let’s begin take step back. a know, i spend ten year life work jp morgan. the legend go one day, old john pierpont morgan approach young man ask secret stock market. john pierpont morgan look young man replied: “it fluctuates”. in view, important thing know inner nature capital markets, certainly know. my short intervention today therefore address different question: capital market deliver? give current discussion european capital market union, seem expect quite lot capital markets. let’s take close look discus whether expectation justified. 2. diversification – strengthen capital market in essence, european capital market union two objectives. the first objective increase share capital market fund mix real economy. the second objective integrate capital market closely across borders. some people relate first objective question whether capital markets-based financial system superior bank-based financial system. well, sum empirical evidence: impossible tell. there certainly evidence indicate capital markets-based finance might increase pro-cyclicality.1 nevertheless, recent crisis shed light issue another angle. a system real economy rely single source fund certainly run trouble source dry – regardless whether bank fund capital market funding. therefore, question “either/or”. the objective european capital market union abandon bank-based fund supplement capital markets-based funding. and europe place ample room so. the european stock market 60% size u stock market measure relation gdp. 1 adrian, t; shin, h s (2010), liquidity leverage. in: journal financial intermediation, vol 19 (3), pp 418–437. leroy, a (2014), credit procyclicality financial structure eu”. available ssrn: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2568112 http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2568112. 2 bi central bankers’ speech likewise, european market venture capital 20% size u market, securitisation percentage even lower.2 in end, come uncontested argument diversification. increase share capital market improve broaden access fund particularly small medium-sized enterprises. at time, improve match investor financial risk, thereby increase efficiency financial system. a result, financial system able good support sustainable economic growth. 3. integration – form single capital market the second objective european capital market union improve integration capital market entire european union. what integrate capital market deliver? one main argument improve private risk sharing. the technical question is: degree shock economy affect consumption? empirical study unite state show integrate capital market cushion around 40% cyclical fluctuation among u federal states. a share around 25% smooth via credit markets, fiscal policy cushion 10–20% shocks. altogether, around 80% give economic shock absorb affect consumption3 study canada yield similar results.4 in europe, picture look different. here, mainly credit market cushion economic shock – effective so. altogether, around 40% give shock absorb affect consumption.5 increase share capital market integrate across border would therefore help improve risk share europe reduce volatility consumption. 4. how get increase share capital market fund mix real economy contribute economic growth. at time, integrate capital market across border help improve private risk share within europe. the bundesbank therefore belief european capital market union goal worth pursuing. but get there? the argument capital market union straightforward, implementation much le so. the capital market union complex undertake touch upon many different areas. consequently, european commission’s green paper subject6 include wide variety suggestion step taken. with regard objective increase share capital markets, focus equity markets. against backdrop, let emphasise issue taxes. currently, tax treatment still favour debt finance equity financing.

finance growth – guideline financial sector reform speech prof claudia buch, deputy president deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt finance summit 2015: “the last word”, frankfurt main, 17 march 2015. * * * lady gentleman it pleasure share think end year’s frankfurt finance summit. give challenge lie ahead, summit’s key question: “how foster growth new regulatory framework?” could timely. at moment, economy worldwide still struggle adverse effect financial crisis. the average loss potential output result financial crisis estimate 8.4%. and output effect persistent. crisis reduce economy’s capital stock – catch-up process via investment take time. constrain credit supply time financial crisis lead inefficient capital allocation. investment innovation postponed.this shrink potential output productivity, thereby slow long-run growth. in order weaken negative effect financial crisis growth, many new regulation designed. in europe, bank union and, recently, capital market union feature prominently. at international level, regulation globally significant financial institution core. overall, reform head right direction. yet concern raise regulatory system become complex thus le transparent. this make necessary focus key principle regulatory reform. in next 15 minutes, i would like step back ask • what relationship finance economic growth? • and “double dividend” sense financial system conducive growth also stable? to answer questions, draw large body empirical (and theoretical) evidence give u guidance financial sector reform. let start evidence link financial development growth. 1. financial development growth in 1990s, widespread consensus financial development foster economic growth. develop financial sector stimulate entrepreneurship, innovation, investment, productivity. many beneficial feature financial market arise equity finance. through venture capital finance, instance, new start-ups obtain financial resource also management expertise. yet, much academic policy debates, “financial development” associate share credit intermediate bank system. and empirical research fact support view country large bank system also grow faster. however, financial crisis raise critical question. be turn point additional financial sector growth long spurs, perhaps even hind economic growth? or put differently: bank credit bite like water much good thing? water certainly need life, much water, also fatal water overdose lead water intoxication. and financial 2 bi central bankers’ speech sector grow beyond limit good economic health, implication reform agenda? recent empirical evidence indeed show link finance growth non-linear. in middle-income countries, financial sector development positive effect economic growth. in high-income countries, additional growth financial sector may even negative effect growth. hence, “optimal” size financial sector. this important u policymakers. it show aim provide right institutional framework incentive financial sector. the goal prevent excessive leverage risk taking. but discuss regulatory implications, let shed light mechanism work. in 2009, paul krugman coin term “boring banking” describe bank focus core business – take household deposit conservative give corporate loans. bank fulfil role finance entrepreneurship firm entry, lead positive firm dynamic innovation. this raise question why, point, bank sector fail support economic growth. a first explanation relate structure banks’ activities. in bank sector grow fast, business tend shift towards non-interest income generate activities. bank tend rely wholesale instead deposit funding. bank long fulfil traditional role take deposit provide credit real economy. when market sentiment shifts, bank high share wholesale fund affect cut back credit great extent. a second explanation distinguish household corporate credit. in general, corporate credit closely align finance investment innovation. yet, country develop reach productivity frontier, become difficult stimulate growth further. often, bank credit shift corporate household sector, negative implication growth. a third explanation base structure employment financial sector. in us, financial sector relatively high-skill high-wage industry begin 20th century well past 30 years. in interim period, thefinancial sector lose high human capital position wage premium relative rest private sector. this raise question whether highly develop financial sector attract high-skilled labour – whether labour might employ efficiently sector economy. all factor – change structure bank funding, bank assets, skill composition banker – help explain financial sector may point become detach real economy. these explanation would remain incomplete, however, without stress role regulation role public safety net. regulation encourage high leverage public sector safety net subsidise risk take leave financial sector vulnerable shocks. systemic financial crises, impose large cost society, result. in short: financial system build equity rather debt inherently stable. a relate question is: balance bank-based market-based finance conducive growth? this question new. in early 1990s, instance, eastern european country decide whether opt bank-based market-based financial system. both system indeed advantages, depend stage economic development stage business cycle. a country develop, growth-enhancing effect bank sector development decrease beneficial effect capital market become important. a individual firms, “pecking order finance”: early stage development, internal fund external work capital loan dominate. a firm (or markets) mature, external bi central bankers’ speech 3 fund raise bond equity market become important. also, market-based system help alleviate recession financial crises, bank-based system effective smooth impact “normal” business cycle fluctuations. 2. financial structure financial stability the structure finance important discuss implication finance growth. rather, structure finance also important implication stability financial system. the high share debt finance, large “financial accelerator” effect – seemingly small shock large systemic implications. economic fluctuation magnify threaten stability entire financial system. the channel transmission run consumption investment. • high level household debt affect output stability adjustment consumption. evidence u show household high level real estate debt cut back consumption response shock asset prices, thus amplify cycle. • firm high level debt cannot smooth investment adverse shock hits. • high level public sector debt destabilising. a well government spend cannot cushion effect financial crisis public debt level already high. these effect magnify households, firms, government borrow bank sector insufficiently capitalised. adverse shock set motion downward spiral asset valuation price ultimately threaten solvency financial institutions. the destabilise effect debt arise contractual features. standard debt contract insensitive borrower’s situation. after risk materialise adjustment shock occur new lend haircut exist loans. in contrast, value equity adjust situation borrower change equity provide risk share mechanism. in words, equity claim real asset stabilise feature compare debt claim nominal assets. the stabilise feature equity contract also visible european debt crisis. in europe, debt finance prone capital flight equity finance. furthermore, diversify cross-border equity hold help detach consumption business cycle fluctuations. cross-border equity allow effective cross-border risk share consumption smoothing. increase reliance equity finance would particularly beneficial european monetary union, exchange rate cannot adjust cope regional macroeconomic shocks. 3. what policy implications? financial system rely equity rather debt finance conducive growth, tend resilient shocks. this suggest might indeed “double dividend” – financial sector reform contribute financial stability also promote growth. view light, couple takeaway policymakers regulators. the first develop financial system basis economic growth. however, reform effort aim mere size growth financial sector. instead, must ensure financial sector fulfil intermediation role process information efficiently. microprudential regulation improve banks’ risk assessment ensure application common rule crucial regard. the 4 bi central bankers’ speech bank union key step forward, specifically aim establish common supervisory standard europe. second, macroprudential policy necessary complement microprudential regulation. there might risk stability entire financial system microprudential supervision cannot detect. for instance, increase household debt might threaten stability impact consumption – individual bank may remain sound. third, post-crisis private sector deleveraging much low euro area us. this could partly explain slow economic recovery europe. reduce debt level threaten stability require efficient mechanism deal distress financial institutions. bank recovery resolution regime provide important tool restructure banks’ balance sheets. this second pillar bank union – single resolution mechanism – play key role. through bail-in tool facilitates, importantly, increase private sector risk sharing. fourth, bank union need complement reform strengthen development integration equity markets. the capital market union offer great opportunity. many initiative currently discuss aim integrate european market debt instruments, securitisations cover bonds. the capital market union indeed contribute improve function debt markets. to facilitate debt restructuring, reform insolvency regime need countries. the goal allow quick recovery liquidation predictable transparent manner. yet, capital market union ought put emphasis development integration european equity markets. improve access venture capital, share information local market important regard. the capital market union also take opportunity remove preferential tax treatment debt versus equity. these measure would strengthen banks’ firms’ loss-absorbing equity buff stabilise growth europe. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: celebrate freedom responsibility speech mr amando m

yves mersch: on european unity – economic institutional challenge face europe speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, discussant prof. hannah scobie, chairman, european

asset depreciate rapidly, communication ongoing, enhance accountability, must two-way process well”. a central banker, i fully concur assessment. to explain monetary policy measure – defend challenge – become state art contemporary central bank communication. the exchange academia, financial market participant general public litmus test succeed manage expectations. this hold particular time heighten uncertainty complexity. that i consider seminar like one important part professional duty – provide opportunity explain action european central bank (ecb), answer question also ask question you, order benefit wealth experience. the euro area particular face many question since inception – one foremost euro area institution – ecb increasingly draw debate go beyond narrow definition monetary policy. a result, criticism sometimes level u spend much time talk policy outside mandate – namely structural reform euro area governance – little time focus actually deliver mandate, i.e. return inflation current low level back towards below, close 2%. you surprise i share view. but fact persist quarter suggest need explain position clearly. namely, underline ecb act way response low inflation, insist others act domain responsibility well, national level european levels. this i would like remark today. there three point particular i would like address. implement large-scale asset purchase the first point relate monetary policy decision enter app january. while quarter see excessive activism, others – often side channel – see excessively hesitant. the argument price stability-oriented central bank symmetric mandate, follow major central bank deploy asset purchase sooner push inflation back objective. if one look step take base data available period, become clear act base evolve medium-term outlook take account balance risk moment – responsible policymaker should. the process 2014 lead launch app illustrate well point. 2 bi central bankers’ speech at start 2014 confronted, one hand, consistent broad-based downward trend past inflation, fall 3% end 2011 le 1% begin 2014. but other, sentiment economic outlook relatively positive year, nearly forecaster expect recovery strengthen year progressed. in context, felt relatively comfortable medium-term inflation outlook secure. while alert risk outlook, clear justification strong expansion monetary policy stance time. moreover, use large-scale asset purchase unprecedented euro area come concern exist advance economies. there uncertainty strength relative transmission channel give euro area’s financial structures; concern possible side-effects redistributive effect hold large amount government bond monetary union fiscal union. all create reason patient. in view, deploy asset purchase ultima ratio decision. we see clear evidence heighten deflationary risk either realise inflation data movement inflation expectations. that evidence start appear summer 2014 macroeconomic situation worsen unexpectedly underlie impetus saw early year faded. this remove important driver behind reflation scenario expected. the sharp fall-off oil price begin late summer add disinflationary pressures, feed also core inflation. the result that, january 2015, euro area experience negative headline inflation rates. crucially, also material sign inflation expectation become unanchored, increase likelihood inflation would stay objective even oil price effect faded. these data, especially measure inflation expectations, sufficiently decisive warrant shift large-scale asset purchase january year. the prevail macroeconomic outlook mean benefit deploy instrument term deliver mandate clearly outweigh cost term potential side effects. but wait adequate evidence, end “behind curve” counteract disinflationary trend? in view answer clearly no. first, take series expansionary measure throughout 2014 response incoming data, include cut main refinance rate effective low bound; introduce negative rate deposit facility; launch target long-term refinance operation (tltros); and, importantly, september 2014, decision begin purchase ab cover bonds. second, communicate clearly condition would use large-scale asset purchase – so-called reaction function – already initiate gradual ease financial condition market anticipate measures. long-term nominal interest rate fell around 100 bps mid-2014 january 2015. because predictable credible, policy take effect actually announce january. third, even though measure partly priced-in, launch initial impact strong many expect response macroeconomic indicator quicker. we see strong signal effects, reflect rise inflation expectations, rebound consumer business confidence high equity prices. and also see evidence significant portfolio rebalancing effects, across asset class (i.e. towards risky assets) across jurisdictions, produce fall effective exchange rate. a result, economic recovery broaden june ecb staff projection envisage inflation average 0.3% 2015, 1.5% 2016 1.8% 2017. our action prove timely provide us, far, comfort medium-term inflation outlook secure. both output inflation forecast broadly balanced. bi central bankers’ speech 3 these forecast however contingent upon full implementation programme. we intend carry public sector purchase end-september 2016 and, case, see sustain adjustment path inflation. only see convince evidence inflation return sustainably level line objective able declare success. monetary policy structural reform but beg question: measure work well, put much focus policies? this second point i would like address – structural reform relevant monetary policy legitimate that, central bank, take view them. in nutshell, euro area, divergent economy become term structural conditions, hard ultimately become achieve price stability euro area level. first, structural reform direct link inflation, inflation expectation real interest rate effect adjustment process. when country hit shock, output le affect relative price adjust quickly, recovery output fast economy able reallocate resource efficient way. this depend critically structural feature economy – example, labour market adjust (i.e. relative contribution wage employment adjustment), whether product market competitive allow entry growth new firms, quickly labour capital redeploy productive uses. this relate issue strength insolvency regime effectiveness active labour market policies. how adjustment take place turn implication euro area price stability. a fast price adjustment cause inflation fall steeply initially, agent expect rise again. this ensure firm anchor medium-term inflation expectation affect perception real interest rate go forward. a slow employment adjustment, contrast, create prolong downward pressure inflation, likely weigh inflation expectations. this turn lead high expect real interest rate exacerbate effect shock, thus complicate achievement price stability euro area level. second, structural factor compound adjustment difficulty affect transmission effectiveness monetary policy across different countries. that economy recover slowly shocks, likely produce financial fragmentation impair transmission monetary policy areas. for example, prolong downturn high unemployment tend create high loan-losses banks, impair bank lend channel transmission bank force rebuild capital. such economic slump also likely worsen fiscal position government, exacerbate fragmentation via bank-sovereign nexus. moreover, even transmission work smoothly supply side, structural reform also affect demand side: willingness entrepreneur take credit new investment. insofar structural factor create unattractive investment environment, impede credit demand thereby hamper effectiveness monetary policy. by token, structural reform accommodative monetary policy complementary boost investment. that would include, micro level, open protect sector pent-up investment demand reduce administrative burden entrepreneurship; macro level, lift expectation future growth hence “animal spirits”, especially firm constrain debt overhang. this psychological dimension reform particularly important euro area give 5 year ahead growth expectation among forecaster fall continuously since 2001, around 2.7% 1.4% today. 4 bi central bankers’ speech third, due structural factor shock leave deep scar economies, affect long-term cohesion union. divergence structural unemployment likely become entrench across union, course cannot offset, like federations, fiscal transfer constituent members. and extent weaken political rationale monetary union – member good time inside union would outside – also weaken long-term cohesion. this undermine integrity currency union. the ecb’s interest structural reform therefore two dimensions: achieve efficient implementation monetary policy short-term, maintain integrity currency longer-term. both fee euro area price stability. however, interest country implement reforms. this national question different model work monetary union. our interest whether succeed so, implication whole euro area. it context ecb recently call strong common governance area. this call reflect fact original expectation monetary union would function have, i think, clearly show over-optimistic. in particular, maastricht treaty signed, evident policymakers monetary union would ultimately need accompany integration policy area too. but widely expect that, follow functionalist logic, share single currency would automatically trigger integration. we know happen. and role common institutions, rule procedure increased, institutional equilibrium euro area still fragile. institutional response economic challenge so third point need reflect seriously key feature well-functioning monetary union, progress towards establish them. a lot progress already make strengthen rule institutional architecture. we reinforce fiscal rule improve coordination economic policies. and make huge institutional leap bank union, establish single supervisory mechanism (ssm) within ecb single resolution mechanism (srm). but know architecture emu yet complete, 5 presidents’ report publish monday describe take process next level. though like rome complete emu cannot build day, i believe ambitious short long term. we show build bridge towards stable prosperous union. this report does. it flesh number quick-wins implement first stage without treaty change. the commission come forward concrete proposal still year. and set priority fundamental change monetary union operate future. the ecb fully support process continue actively contribute it. let highlight see two crucial aspect report. first, report make strong case complete bank union. it call find swift agreement bridge finance permanent backstop single resolution mechanism (srf), esm identify natural institution act backstop srf, remain fiscally neutral. these measure would help sever bank-sovereign nexus, would turn complement function monetary union – reinforce singleness money within euro area, support even monetary policy transmission across jurisdictions. second, report advocate long-term sovereignty shift economic fiscal policy – ‘move rule institutions’. most importantly, report call new economic convergence process make euro area resilient shocks, would turn make share sovereignty fiscal domain possible. it also propose eventually establish euro-area treasury take decision jointly certain element national bi central bankers’ speech 5 budgets. this certainly tomorrow, direction economic monetary union ultimately need move in. in order maintain momentum, process need start now. it european leader reflect proposal carry forward. a matter fact, discuss report european council meet tonight tomorrow. i trust wide context lose discussions. conclusion let conclude. our forceful monetary policy measure first, necessary, second, timely, and, third, effective. the economic recovery proceed moderate pace. and see encourage sign broadening. monetary policy accommodation necessary condition recovery keep track. this imply deliver announced. but sufficient condition. member state part. structural reform need strengthen supply side help economy regain competitive edge globalize economy. and increase growth potential cyclical recovery become sustained, structural recovery. neither monetary policy economic policy take place institutional vacuum. the institutional refurbishment european house far achieve lot. but ambition often drive urgency crisis. and bad may lie behind us, keep momentum integration. the 5 presidents’ report useful roadmap way ahead. a strong commitment complete bank union ease finance condition enterprise sustainably, increase resilience europe’s financial landscape view also hem contagion. likewise, long-term sovereignty shift economic fiscal policy stimulate convergence towards similarly resilient economic structures, base common standards. not everything achieve today, country agree way forward key element high confidence last end crisis. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: the swiss

speech 1 luis m linde: brief comment interaction monetary policy macroeconomic adjustment speech mr luis m linde, governor bank spain, xxxi conferencia del círculo de economía, sitges, 30 may 2015. * * * let first thank antón costas, president círculo de economía, invitation participate final session xxxi conference, classic schedule economic meet conferences. many thanks, too, andreu mas-colell accompany u session, join vice president ecb, vitor constancio, honour give floor immediately address. first, way introduction, i like make brief comment interaction monetary policy macroeconomic adjustments, one major matter raise euro area monetary policy framework recent years. long period low inflation pose risk medium-term price stability, economic activity financial stability. the first risk de-anchoring inflation expectation level consistent price stability which, know, ecb define expect inflation rate close 2% medium term. be proximity deflation dynamic may encourage postponement spend decision household firms. moreover, although nominal interest rate may low levels, inflation continue falling, real interest rate trend upwards, contribute reduce consumption investment. secondly, economy post high level public private debt, both, high rise real interest rate may exacerbate difficulty bring reduction household, corporate public-sector debt, reason stock debt, though hold constant nominal terms, rise real terms. the macro adjustment highly indebted economy environment low inflation or, indeed, deflation, thus become difficult complex. and, thirdly, relation financial stability, event see recent year indicate asset price bubble misallocation financial resource may coexist alongside low inflation. if situation low inflation extend time draw close deflation, arrive low even negative interest rates, entail additional risk institutional investors, allocation resource sound function financial system. this experience euro area second half last year. what role monetary policy play scenario? in september 2014, ecb decide expand tool available monetary policy add private asset purchase programme followed, january year, public-sector public debt purchases. ecb policy interest rate already low bound, practically zero, negative rate deposit facility. at time, liquidity provision ecb regular open market operation longer-term operation follow on-demand principle, grant liquidity request banks; indeed, several year policy pursue which, interest-rate mark monetary policy operations, ecb ration volume liquidity provide banks. after months’ experience, state asset purchase clearly contribute re-anchoring inflation expectations, line medium-term objective and, importantly, check reverse rise real interest rates. their effect also manifest portfolio re-balancing, encourage investor shift hold risk- 2 bi central bankers’ speech free low-risk security risky ones, thereby reduce cost finance consumer investors. the second aspect i would like mention role economic policy country set correct deep-seated imbalance build expansion end onset crisis 2007–2008. i would refer policy aim improve competitiveness good market reduce labour market inefficiencies, significant country high unemployment, particular case high indebtness constraint possibility implement demand-boosting policies. reform conducive wage moderation containment inflation rate, potential initially dampen domestic demand owe low wages, increase real value debt and, cases, increase real interest rates. however, initial adverse effect could offset and, experience shows, exceed gain competitiveness, increase export gain confidence positively affect consumption investment decision generate employment growth. another matter highlight synergy structural reform monetary policy. the spanish economy good example positive interaction fact that, least occasionally, reform policy mutually reinforcing. after period euro area considerable stress combine mark segmentation credit markets, despite ecb’s increasingly loose monetary policy, interaction structural reform strongly expansionary monetary policy finally begin felt late 2013 and, naturally, 2014, event spain. unquestionably, reform launch 2012–2013 contribute relieve stress financial market owing, all, contribution improve confidence. the improvement public finance governance euro area doubt play key role enhance confidence. naturally, may well ask happen scenario economy witness loss competitiveness compare country implement reforms, example affect labour market provided, along factors, so-called internal devaluation. in case, relative loss competitiveness offset monetary policy stimulus impact national demand external sector. the depreciation euro accompany policy has, doubt, partly one consequences, improve competitiveness area whole, stimulate export overall activity. here recall euro area whole run significant surplus transaction non-euro countries. both excessive deficit large surplus entail risk costs. accordingly, believe justification behind call several international institution euro area country leeway implement policy conducive expansion domestic demand. i shall sum two ideas. first, de-anchoring medium-term inflation expectation entail serious risk financial stability growth, risk may exacerbate country follow process macroeconomic adjustment deleveraging. second, monetary policy structural reforms, simultaneously applied, may lead highly positive synergies. and word make way address much-respected dear friend vitor constancio. a well pursue brilliant academic career, vitor constancio command height portuguese politics economic government. constancio member parliament, minister economy finance, governor banco de portugal two occasions, second 2000

constancio play important role steer design ecb’s policies. he representative i would define “flexible orthodoxy”, i.e. rigorous point view ecb’s task priorities, one flee rigidity never forget common sense come complex often difficult decisions, technical political sense, ecb adopt. i give floor vitor constancio. bi central bankers’ speech 1 rodrigo vergara: the monetary policy report financial stability report presentation mr rodrigo vergara, governor central bank chile, finance commission honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 3 june 2015. * * * accompany chart find central bank chile's website. the monetary policy report june 2015 financial stability report first half 2015 find http://www.bcentral.cl. introduction mr. president finance committee senate, senator andrés zaldívar, senator member committee, lady gentlemen. thank invite share vision board central bank chile recent macroeconomic financial developments, prospect implication monetary financial policy making. this vision contain detail monetary policy report june 2015 financial stability report first half 2015. the macroeconomic scenario show minor change respect forecast march. annual inflation decline february april, remain 4%. output demand continue grow moderate pace, first quarter good expected, incoming data suggest remainder year somewhat le dynamic previously estimated. in global economy, growth outlook show major change either. the weak u figure early year consolidation good prospect europe worth mentioning. the dollar lose strength gain first month year, market push back expectation regard begin u monetary tighten process. nevertheless, long-term rate rise us, develop markets. the price commodity rose, especially oil. in context, board hold monetary policy rate (mpr) 3 percent, maintain significantly expansionary monetary policy stance. let describe baseline scenario main risk identify two report i present today. macroeconomic scenario in recent months, core inflation (i.e. cpiefe, exclude price energy foodstuffs) bring major surprise behavior continue largely determine effect peso depreciation usual indexation economy. however, annual cpi cpiefe inflation still 4% and, march, baseline scenario monetary policy report assume hover around 4% months. after publication previous report, private inflation expectation year increase line report remain high level since then. at one two years’ term, expectation remain around 3%, target set central bank (figure 1). in first quarter, domestic output demand grow slightly annual term expect march. this visible private public consumption, investment construction works, result increase growth construction, trade services. however, march figure incoming indicator suggest recovery 2 bi central bankers’ speech growth remainder year somewhat slow expected. this reflect several indicators, retail sales, import consumer good business consumer expectations. particularly worrisome possibility consumer business confidence remain clearly pessimistic territory, situation that, reversed, hind recovery growth second half year (figure 3). the evolution credit also reflect weak private spending. annual growth consumer commercial loan still bounded, despite low interest rates. job creation private sector also line economic slowdown. hire cycle-sensitive sectors, manufacture construction, post negative y-o-y rate variation, however moderate recent months. nevertheless, strong increase employment agriculture services, especially link public sector, lead total employment grow 1% annually. the unemployment rate remain low, slow employment growth match also slow growth labor force (figure 4). nominal wage continue grow strongly, slightly 7 percent. the empirical evidence suggest owe mainly indexation high past inflation. although phenomenon intense past decades, still significant. there still risk, however, wage remain high, convergence inflation may take longer. another risk evolution wage may reflect narrow output gap respect baseline scenario and, therefore, increase inflationary pressures. world economic data show low growth u strengthen positive outlook eurozone. although worsen u data first quarter believe mostly temporary, i said, moment market expect feed begin adjust policy rate postponed. nevertheless, long-term interest rate risen, although reversal recent days, yield curve steepen u several economy (figure 5). this phenomenon partly relate change macroeconomic outlook-the recovery process develop world high inflation-, also decompression low term premium associate portfolio reallocations. still, external finance condition remain favorable historic standards. in chile, up downs, peso appreciate nominal real terms. the peso/dollar parity around 615 close monetary policy report, rise little 620 peso dollar since. this, surpass clp 640 march stand near clp 600 may. at time, real exchange rate (rer) fall around 97 february value near last fifteen years’ average recently (figure 6). long-term nominal interest rate fluctuate le external counterpart have. in emerge economies, growth outlook different one foresee month ago, confirm slowdown china. latin america remain region suffer profound continuous deterioration, particularly intense brazil. inflation remain low large part world, latin america still high. moreover, price commodities, although fluctuations, high include march report. copper, trade around us$2.9 per pound days, move close us$2.8 statistical cutoff date (although recently approach 2.7), wti oil trade near $60 per barrel. this contrast decline food prices. i note two important trend observe world, imply great convergence growth. on one hand, u expect continue grow fast europe, gap two region narrowing. on hand, emerge market continue outgrow develop economies, gap also closing. turn estimates, baseline scenario foresee year gdp grow 2.25% 3.25%, range somewhat low estimate last report bi central bankers’ speech 3 (table 3). this projection consider flood north country one-time effect important mine reduce mine growth estimate, downward incidence estimate annual gdp growth one tenth one point compare march forecast. meanwhile, since partial data recent month show weak private expenditure, foresee recovery expect second half occur slow pace project march. the business perception report last may confirm bound expectation regard performance business investment 2015. moreover, cbc’s survey continue point fall value project year compare 2014 (table 1). on external front, projection assume trade partners’ growth drop one tenth point 2015 2016, 3.3% 3.7%, respectively. this adjustment respond largely reduce projection us. in eurozone, prospect remain unchanged first quarter data bring surprise difference within region. growth revise china latin america, actual first-quarter data weak prospects. a term trade, estimate continue assume improvement 2014, although big expect before. in baseline scenario, 2015 2016 copper oil expect trade somewhat high price think march (table 2). the chilean economy make major adjustment recent quarters, improve external position lay foundation recovery without imbalances. this projection assume monetary policy remain significantly expansionary fiscal policy continue contribute expenditure growth accordance fiscal rule objective set administration. it also consider exchange rate depreciation accumulate since 2013 continue boost tradable sector sensitive exchange rate. in addition, price fuels, run average previous years, continue help reduce business cost improve household income, even effect small expect month ago. a inflation, baseline scenario cpi hover around 4 percent annually still months, stabilize near 3 percent 2016. the cpiefe expect post annual variation close 3 percent 2016 stay near figure end projection horizon, time second quarter 2017 (figure 7). this trajectory consider transmission price peso depreciation accumulate past year line historical patterns; real wage adjust function productivity; output gap remain projection horizon. for rer, methodological assumption use that, now, fluctuate upper part range believe consistent long-term fundamentals. a mpr, work assumption gradual withdrawal monetary impulse similar suggest survey one-year horizon, mean monetary policy start normalize turn next year (figure 8). the baseline scenario reflect event believe likely occur information hand close report. there risks, however, which, materialized, may reshape macroeconomic outlook and, therefore, may alter course monetary policy. abroad, main source risk remain, moderate. the possibility specific event generate episode high volatility global financial market persists, affect fund costs, exchange rate short-term inflation outlook. on one hand, surprise regard time pace feed increase benchmark rate cause fluctuation asset prices. on other, remain risk default greece impact global financial market gdp growth eurozone. while still significant risks, ability large 4 bi central bankers’ speech central bank handle situation improved, reduce extent intensity negative impact events. this say associate risk persistence long would less effects. a positive note consolidate growth eurozone, help configure balance global economic scenario. in emerge economies, still significant risks. while risk commodity price drop seem eased, latin american economy weak long expected. this occur context high fiscal current account deficit persist many economies, make necessary adjustment expensive difficult implement. the risk slow growth china implication copper price remains, although chinese authority give proof ability desire avoid abrupt correction economy. domestically, economic recovery second half year accompany significant improvement confidence indicators, far happened. to extent situation continues, possible domestic output expenditure fail show great dynamism expect baseline scenario. conversely, scenario expectation improve significantly would allow fast recovery economy, particularly 2016. regard inflation, pressure somewhat mild expect march, due low activity fact that, although volatility, peso continue depreciate. however, context persistently high inflation, bound margins, strong wage growth, high fuel price external risk scenario drive significant depreciation peso, inflationary risk remain important. a permanently aware legal mandate, one risk analyze monitor special care. after evaluate risks, board estimate risk balance unbiased output inflation. sum up, inflation remain high, despite decline recent months. domestic activity pick first quarter, outlook second half year moderated. a mention before, macroeconomic policy play countercyclical role. in particular, strong monetary impulse translate reduction 200 basis point monetary policy rate, help drive long-term rate close historic lows. the buoyant economy gradual decline inflation-in line expectations- suggest that, assumption baseline scenario, discussion gradual withdrawal monetary stimulus could delay respect march expectations. overall, future change mpr depend evolution domestic external macroeconomic condition implication inflation outlook. indeed, inflation high unrelenting foreseen, normalization anticipated; convergence inflation target fast foreseen, opposite happen. let present brief review main issue financial stability report. the financial stability report our financial stability report discloses, half-yearly basis (in june december), recent macroeconomic financial development might incidence chilean economy’s financial stability. the report present today examine external risk scenario i described. a i said, monetary policy develop economy remain expansionary. the measure ecb central bank cut benchmark rate continue push sovereign long-term rates, although lately show reversal. this, bi central bankers’ speech 5 plus still bound risk premiums, lead increase issue debt, mainly corporate. thus, environment low-cost fund incentive risk take persists, vulnerability may incubate could emerge global financial situation approach normality. again, outlook emerge economy continue deteriorate. despite recent increase, price commodities-especially oil-are level recent years, affect net export countries. meanwhile, growth prospect china, russia, particularly latin america also decline motivate idiosyncratic elements. therefore, risk that, beyond real channel, commercial link direct investment chilean companies, one cannot rule financial contagion episode price assets, exchange rate sovereign spreads. internally, note caution previous report respect situation corporate sector maintained. indebtedness percentage gdp reach 114 end 2014. this increase come mainly high external debt peso depreciation (figure 9). financial strength indicator company report svs similar describe previous reports, low compare historical average (figure 10). this reflect loss sector’s resilience possibility le favorable macroeconomic environment. finally, bank payment indicator also deteriorated, vary effect across banks, especially affect medium-sized ones. activity residential house market remain strong, price still rise. the moderation production cost anticipate purchase face upcoming enactment tax reform could behind sustain dynamic residential sector; meanwhile, price indicator continue grow, although moderation observe specific areas. in office space sector, new square meter build match equivalent increase demand, generate significant increase vacancy rate, warn previous reports. these level could remain prolong period due inertia market incorporation new project (figure 11). aggregate household indicator remain relatively stable, show marginal deterioration. the debt disposable income rise 2014, financial burden remain around 14 percent income, due low interest rate (figure 12). the low interest rate face household also result change debt composition, away higher-rate consumer loan lower-rate mortgage loans. no change indicator bank default seen, whereas non-bank lender new increase observed. this latter phenomenon partly explain regulatory adjustments, although worsen credit portfolio say lender cannot rule out. commercial consumer credit exhibit bound growth rates, mortgage loans, remain strong (figure 13). the behavior commercial consumer loan line slow growth private spending. demand-side factor could behind dynamics, suggest bank lend survey. the expansion mortgage lend largely explain increase average debt, consistent dynamic house price debt collateral ratios, remain stable. bank financial indicator stable. operate income continue primary contributor profitability banks, fell end 2014, 16 percent equity march. this due reversal temporary impact inflation indexation margin reduction interest rate spreads. bond issue bank contribute diversification fund sources, medium-sized bank remain highly dependent wholesale funding. stress test yield level capitalization permit absorb materialization scenario severe condition (figure 14). in short, internal external scenario virtually unchanged last report, although persistence favorable global finance condition incubate vulnerability would emerge condition disappear. this would 6 bi central bankers’ speech significant impact global financial markets, particularly emerge economies, whose growth prospect downward trend. in context, increase indebtedness domestic credit user (firms households) translate low resilience possible financial stress events, deterioration macroeconomic environment. chile maintain adequate solvency external liquidity confront international financial stress scenarios. however, insulate country development effects. i would like finish final thoughts. final think the macroeconomic outlook change much respect projection march. output demand post moderate annual growth rates, still improvement second half last year. this good news. however, marginal data show loss strength which, combine low confidence indicator firm households, lead u estimate recovery foresee second half year proceed slow pace. accordingly, adjust growth forecast year downward, one fourth point. inflation moderate still high thus main worry. in baseline scenario, around 4 percent month late descend toward 3 percent target. about risk face financial stability, report show big change either. corporate borrow continue rise past quarters. although obvious factor behind trend, increase external borrowing-a logical development give good credit conditions-and depreciation peso, must relent effort closely monitor tendencies. anyway, figure also show households’ firms’ financial burden increased, largely interest rate low, line clearly expansionary monetary policy. the external scenario also behave outline march. the recovery develop economy look balance across countries, boost confidence consolidate growth develop world. emerge market continue show weakening, especially region. global financial condition still favorable side historical perspective, case mean sudden turnaround cannot happen. a matter fact, consequence global financial market negative outcome greece ever close rise u interest rate still significant risk situation which, despite horizon long, must overlook forgotten. chile, say time again, able confront change external internal condition via significant quick adjustment. the absence large imbalances, combine proper macroeconomic policy framework, are, view, key elements, although sufficient, generate condition require resume growth level allow u reach desire development country. in context, i would like note i fully endorse finance minister say recently, fiscal stimulus-and i would add monetary stimulus well-cannot persistently maintain growth economy. on fiscal front, clear that, state appropriate authority, honor commitment matter, spend cannot grow eternally rate project year. on monetary front, give baseline scenario, convergence inflation inconsistent big impulse present one. thus, beyond minor adjustments, depend evolution business cycle, clear monetary fiscal policy already do job much room either one more. bi central bankers’ speech 7 thus, resume growth, need create environment allow investment recover, resource allocation gain efficiency productivity improve. one key element task household business regain confidence economy provide proper environment carry projects. sadly, predictions, take long thought. for part, continue best effort smooth business cycle, always price stability primary objective. this why, i mention earlier, inflation remain primary concern, although drop projected, still high. in context, assessment since late last year, see room cut monetary policy rate. and current condition make likely gradual withdrawal monetary stimulus take place first month 2016, i want emphasize depend actual inflation project month ahead behave line estimates. and last least, behalf board, i wish stress conduct monetary policy ensure inflation stand 3 percent policy horizon, insist need every participant financial system thoroughly evaluate borrow lend decisions. in addition, continue contribute task, i.e., safeguard stability currency normal function internal external payments, chile’s development welfare. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: presentation swiss national bank’s financial stability report introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 18 june 2015. * * * a colleague thomas jordan explained, global economic growth first quarter 2015 expectations. however, last 12 months, see improvement international economic financial conditions, although substantial risk remain. the domestic environment become challenge due strong appreciation swiss franc follow discontinuation minimum exchange rate january 2015. against background, i would like examine situation swiss bank financial stability perspective, look first big bank move discussion domestically focus banks. a detail assessment situation find late financial stability report publish today. big bank further improve resilience over past year, swiss big bank continue improve capital situation, albeit slow pace year before. they already meet requirement apply 2019. while acknowledge progress made, snb recommend big bank lose momentum effort improve resilience. this particularly warrant regard leverage ratio. resilience need improve three reasons: first, big banks’ loss potential relative capitalisation continue substantial. second, swiss big banks’ risk-weighted capital ratio average large globally active banks, cannot yet say leverage ratios. third, expect regulatory development international national level result increase capital requirements.1 the swiss big bank prepare developments. rwa problem identified, yet resolve in capital regulation banks, risk-weighted asset (rwa) play key role. a mention previous financial stability reports, markets’ authorities’ confidence rwa calculate use banks’ internal model steadily declined. a number study show that, instances, model-based rwa properly reflect bank’s economic risks.2 a consequence, capital ratio calculate use model-based rwa may overstate true level resilience. 1 base review swiss “too big fail” regulation group expert development financial market strategy (brunetti group experts), federal council instruct federal department finance prepare legal adjustments, primarily concern stringent capital requirements. cf. medium release federal council, 18 february 2015. 2 for instance, international study reveal significant difference rwa bank use model-based approach. these partially explain difference level risk take banks. cf., example, basel committee bank supervision, regulatory consistency assessment programme (rcap) – analysis risk-weighted asset market risks, january 2013; cf. also eba, interim result eba review consistency risk-weighted assets, 26 february 2013; barclays, the dog dug, 21 september 2012. study national level also show model-based rwa low cases. cf. finma annual medium conference, “models limitations”, 31 march 2015. 2 bi central bankers’ speech to address problem, regulatory initiative launch international national level. at international level, basel committee bank supervision fundamentally revise standardise approach. the committee also examine introduction floor internally model rwa base revise standardise approach. one important objective floor would ensure capital requirement base banks’ internal model fall prudent level. at national level, finma – together big bank support snb – conduct comparison rwa calculate use model-based standardise approaches. the result comparison, addition measure already take finma expect international level, take account work group lead federal department finance. this work group draw proposal associate legal adjustment implement recommendation federal council’s ‘too big fail’ evaluation report. alongside regulatory initiatives, snb still consider necessary big bank increase transparency regard rwa. finma call bank disclose difference calculation use model-based standardise approaches. such enhance transparency necessary restore credibility model-based rwa strengthen market discipline. the snb continue hold view risk-weighted capital requirement – include floor model-based rwa – leverage ratio requirement complement other. risk-weighted requirement guide economic decision margin, leverage ratio serve backstop. yet, measure resolve rwa problem take effect, prudent give great weight leverage ratio assess big banks’ resilience. indeed, analyst increasingly pay attention leverage ratio assess compare banks. domestically focus commercial bank increase mortgage exposure, capital situation stable i would like turn domestically focus commercial banks. in 2014, bank increase exposure swiss mortgage residential real estate markets. while share new loan high loan-to-income ratio – measure affordability risk – remain persistently high, mortgage lend growth share new mortgage loan high loan-to-value ratio decreased. hence, increase exposure low previous years. with respect bank capitalisation, situation remain largely unchanged 2014. first, domestically focus commercial banks’ leverage ratio remain stable high level historical standards. second, banks’ risk-weighted capital ratio increase slightly significantly regulatory minimum requirement overall. furthermore, stress test result suggest domestically focus bank able absorb estimate loss without see capitalisation fall regulatory minimum. nevertheless, relevant adverse scenario banks, loss would deplete large proportion surplus capital. experience switzerland 1990s, countries, suggest would lead general weaken bank sector significantly affect banks’ ability lend, negative last repercussion real economy. the stress test result highlight importance bank hold significant capital surplus relative regulatory minimum requirements. the activation countercyclical capital buff 2013 increase 2014 make significant contribution respect. bi central bankers’ speech 3 risk renew increase imbalance mortgage real estate market overall, imbalance mortgage residential real estate market remain broadly unchanged since last financial stability report. from financial stability perspective, positive development. however, still early give all-clear. on one hand, imbalance remain high level yet start decline. on hand, decline capital money market interest rate observe since january 2015 carry risk renew increase imbalance swiss mortgage residential real estate market medium term. first, compare alternative assets, investment real estate appear become attractive banks, commercial investor households. in residential investment property segment particular, additional demand investor search yield might push price further. second, unprecedented interest rate environment create additional incentive bank incur high interest rate credit risks. they might tempt increase maturity transformation lend compensate additional pressure margin stabilise short-term profitability. such strategy would increase banks’ exposure large interest rate shock correction mortgage real estate markets. give risk financial stability, bank authority remain alert and, necessary, take measure contain risks. in particular, momentum mortgage residential real estate market pick again, additional measure might become necessary. in regard, particular attention pay investment property segment. this segment likely materially affect additional demand investor search yield current environment. furthermore, measure take far predominantly address segment owner-occupied residential real estate. for part, snb continue monitor development mortgage real estate market closely, reassess need adjustment countercyclical capital buff regular basis. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: swiss national bank’s monetary policy decision assessment economic situation introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 18 june 2015. * * * lady gentleman it pleasure welcome swiss national bank’s (snb) news conference. a usual, i shall begin outline govern board’s monetary policy decision assessment economic situation. this follow jean-pierre danthine’s presentation annual financial stability report fritz zurbrügg’s comment financial market developments. after that, happy take questions. monetary policy decision let begin monetary policy decision. the snb decide leave target range three-month libor unchanged –1.25% –0.25% interest sight deposit snb remain –0.75%. negative interest rate switzerland make hold investment swiss franc le attractive help weaken swiss franc time. overall, swiss franc significantly overvalued. in formulate monetary policy, take account exchange rate situation impact inflation economic developments. we therefore remain active foreign exchange market, necessary, order influence monetary conditions. our new conditional inflation forecast differ greatly one present march. inflation reach low point third quarter 2015, –1.2%. for subsequent period, new inflation forecast slightly high march due rise oil prices. the short medium-term forecast slightly, 0.1 percentage point –1.0% 2015 –0.4% 2016. the forecast continue indicate inflation move back positive territory begin 2017; slight slowdown rate increase year progresses. the inflation forecast 2017 0.1 percentage points, 0.3%. the conditional forecast assume three-month libor remain –0.75% entire forecast horizon, swiss franc weaken. global economic outlook a inflation forecast heavily influence economic development abroad, let present assessment global economy. global economic growth weak expect first quarter 2015, development detrimental impact world trade. in us, gdp decline slightly, partly due special factors. moreover, strong u dollar weigh exports. in euro area, however, economy continue pick up, support persistent euro weakness improve lend conditions. in contrast previous quarter, large member state contribute growth. italy report gdp growth first time since enter multi-year recession. in japan, too, economy gain momentum. in emerge economies, performance remain uneven, growth continue cool china. the global economy expect gather pace again, reinforce expansionary monetary policy around world ongoing low oil prices. for instance, disappoint first 2 bi central bankers’ speech quarter, two large economies, u china, start show sign improvement. nonetheless, uncertainty future development global economy remain high. various risk – first foremost difficult financial situation greece geopolitical tension – could jeopardise recovery. swiss economic outlook accord initial estimates, switzerland’s real gdp decline slightly first quarter. a expected, good export suffer strong swiss franc appreciation, also downturn global trade. domestic demand, contrast, develop robustly. have say this, situation vary considerably one industry another. profit margin significant pressure several sectors, force company take step reduce production cost raise efficiency. against backdrop, unemployment increase slightly seasonally adjust basis. over come months, global economic recovery likely lead gradual upturn demand swiss products; cushion impact exchange rate shock somewhat. a global economy gather momentum, expect switzerland return positive growth second half year. the snb continue anticipate growth 1% 2015 whole. monetary financial condition allow move monetary financial conditions. since discontinuation minimum exchange rate, inflation move well negative territory. this chiefly attributable import good prices, may roughly 5% year-on-year, mainly due fall oil prices. domestic inflation, meanwhile, remain positive territory. our inflation forecast show period negative inflation temporary; part adjustment process follow sharp appreciation swiss franc. the snb currently expect sustain price decline or, indeed, deflationary spiral associate harmful effect economic activity employment. available survey inflation expectation household company present similar picture. short-term inflation expectation stabilised, albeit low level. long-term inflation expectation remain virtually unchanged last half-year.1 they remain within range consistent snb’s definition price stability. low inflation rate translate low nominal interest rates. on money market, short-term interest rate close interest sight deposit snb –0.75%; interest rate switzerland thus low countries. however, due negative inflation, switzerland’s real interest rates, ultimately determine investment returns, high nominal rates. moreover, also high real interest rate countries, us, germany uk. my colleague, fritz zurbrügg, provide detail interest rate development money capital markets. despite low interest rates, mortgage growth continue weaken slightly recent months. notwithstanding this, imbalance mortgage real estate market remain high. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, discus great depth remarks. 1 in october 2014, consensus economics project inflation expectation 1.4% period 2020–2024; april 2015, put 1.5% period 2021–2025. long-term inflation expectation survey half-yearly basis. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in light uncertainty regard future greece, swiss franc continue serve safe currency. in trade-weighted terms, swiss franc still approximately 12% high begin year. over time, negative interest rate swiss money capital market help correct overvaluation swiss franc. the rise long-term interest rate abroad also lead widen interest rate differential country late. a condition continue normalise international financial markets, investment currency become attractive; this, turn, likely help ease overvaluation swiss franc. the slowdown observe economy also suggest swiss franc unlikely remain persistently high. monetary policy outlook i shall move monetary policy. since 15 january, repeatedly thoroughly explain reason discontinue minimum exchange rate introduce negative interest sight deposit snb. uphold minimum exchange rate long sustainable give change take place international arena sharply diverge monetary policy stance world’s major currency blocks. in formulate monetary policy, confront exceptionally complex situation international financial markets. what more, global economy still grapple after-effects financial economic crisis, least form high level uncertainty. these reality snb – swiss economy – facing. turn blind eye option. in environment, aware discontinuation minimum exchange rate would cause switzerland’s economy slow. while data first quarter confirm slow process underway, country’s economic development since 15 january broadly line expectations. our monetary policy gear towards challenge set circumstance currently guide willingness take active role foreign exchange market apply negative interest rates. this two-pronged approach design weaken swiss franc. the snb’s intervention foreign exchange market, fee liquidity bank system, reinforce effect measures. we intend retain current interest rate level monitor effect closely. with respect set interest rate supply money market liquidity, snb’s monetary policy decision bold international standards. all thing considered, swiss franc nevertheless remain significantly overvalued. be switzerland negative interest

lady gentlemen, thank attention. it pleasure give floor jean-pierre danthine, present financial stability report. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 16 june 2015. * * * mr chairman, honourable member committee economic monetary affairs, lady gentlemen, i happy back committee regular hearing. today, i would like share ecb’s assessment current economic monetary condition euro area. i touch subject choose exchange views, namely risk side-effects asset purchase programme. finally, i say word current situation greece. economic outlook monetary policy the late economic indicator survey data broadly confirm assessment economic recovery proceed moderate pace. while growth mainly support private consumption recent quarters, see encourage sign also private investment pick up, underlie expectation economic recovery broaden. this support particular monetary policy measures, work way real economy, comparatively low price oil, improvement external price competitiveness. this also reflect late eurosystem staff projections: project economic growth increase 1.5% gdp 2015 1.9% 2016 2.0% 2017. after month negative zero rates, inflation may increase modestly, stand 0.3% year-on-year terms, negative contribution energy price fading. we expect inflation remain low month ahead rise stepwise around turn year. thereafter, inflation expect gradually converge toward level close still 2%. in eurosystem staff projection june, inflation project increase 0.3% 2015 1.5% 2016 1.8% 2017. over last quarter, money credit dynamic strengthen overall. the growth broad money april stand 5.3%, part reflect expansion bond purchase eurosystem. while improve further, loan growth private sector, stand 0.8% april, lag somewhat pace monetary trend firming. it remain moderate – atypically so, prolong phase credit compression – uneven across euro area economy new loan enterprise particularly weak. overall, remain prudently confident economic monetary condition place support gradual reflation euro area economy, sustain return inflation rate level below, close to, 2%. this assessment base full implementation monetary policy measures. we need keep steady monetary policy course firmly implement measures, include expand asset purchase programme. it clear intention purchase private public sector security eur 60 billion per month average end september 2016 and, case, see sustain adjustment path inflation consistent aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. 2 bi central bankers’ speech over recent weeks, financial market register measurable trend reversal price surge volatility, fixed-income market epicentre correction. let make two observation respect. first, period high volatility phenomenon frequently observe long start large quantitative programme, short-term rate press low bound. price discovery gradual complex world central bank intervene long-dated security market re-appraise prospect macro-economy exceptionally uncertain conditions. second, notwithstanding developments, financial market condition remain accommodative supportive economic recovery euro area. for example, give amount accommodation introduce even expand asset purchase programme commence march, bank lend rate – key indicator finance condition euro area – still trend down. since announcement expand app, composite bank lend rate euro area nfcs decline 13 basis point 2.30% april (and compare 2.79% june 2014). bank lend rate loan household house purchase decline 25 basis point 2.25% april (and compare 2.87% june 2014). in addition, measure cross-country dispersion show tangible decline nfcs. a interest rate outstanding loan re-set, new credit contract embody favourable term borrower replace old ones, financial accommodation reach grow number consumer investors. this incremental process yet run course. it still on-going. this said, process price adjustment, term structure money market interest rate come intense upward pressure. the expect policy rate path imply money market quote shift steepen noticeably consequence. the short end curve – expand surplus liquidity – remain well-anchored around level broadly line forward guidance horizons. we closely monitor condition detect sign unwarranted tighten stance, would need react. risk side-effects app engage large-scale asset purchase programme without risk side effects. let focus financial risk balance sheet, financial stability implication euro area, effect income distribution. we monitor closely risk eurosystem’s balance sheet associate asset purchase programme manage risk keep level threaten capacity fulfil policy mandate maintain price stability. in particular, manage credit risk exclusively purchase asset sufficient credit quality, define asset allocation limit framework ensure degree diversification, apply severe due diligence monitor processes. with regard pspp, also decide purchase government bond conduct eurosystem ncbs risk-shared within eurosystem. this hamper effectiveness purchase programme singleness monetary policy. the govern council full control design feature programme. the specific risk-sharing agreement take account unique institutional structure euro area, common currency single monetary policy coexist alongside 19 national fiscal policies. a regard possible financial stability risks, ass risk rather contain now. look particular house market euro area, don’t see sign general overvaluation. important indicator increase financial imbalance real estate price credit growth, far witness low growth rate both. for instance, annual growth rate price house apartment euro area bi central bankers’ speech 3 increase average 0.8% last quarter 2014. the annual growth rate loan house purchase stand 0.1% april 2015. nevertheless, monitor development closely. if needed, macro-prudential policy tool use safeguard financial stability. finally, large-scale asset purchase – monetary policy measure – distributional consequences. in short run, current combination low interest rates, forward guidance asset purchase conducive change asset price wealth gain investor hold wide spectrum assets. but mechanism asset price change lie heart monetary policy transmission set motion every time central bank activate instrument monetary policy, whether conventional unconventional, pursuit objective. interest rate change always alter attractiveness save relative consumption influence debt burden borrowers. likewise, current accommodative monetary policy stance eas finance condition throughout economy, boost consumption investment and, ultimately, inflation. this absolute precondition interest rate return normal level consistent sustainable growth price stability. by reduce cyclical component unemployment, also contribute reduce major source inequality, particularly amongst young lower-income groups. in end, citizen across euro area benefit environment stable prices, macroeconomic stability, economic growth job creation long run. the current situation greece finally, let say word situation greece ecb’s role. a case member country euro area, ecb, context euro system, fulfil mandate central bank toward greece. furthermore, ssm regulation adopt together council 2013 make ecb supervisor greek bank system direct indirect supervision. and two-pack, parliament council ask commission liaise ecb negotiate conditionality attach adjustment programme review implementation. when come monetary policy supervisory action, ecb continue take decision full independence accordance legal framework. this rules-based approach require us. this follow continue follow. in context, eurosystem provide support allow greek bank continue finance economy. currently, central bank liquidity extend greek bank amount around eur 118 billion, double amount end 2014. the current liquidity support represent around 66% greece’s gdp, high level share gdp euro area country. last week, govern council decide object increase ela ceiling, eur 2.3 billion eur 83 billion. liquidity continue extend long greek bank solvent sufficient collateral. however, situation greek government market access, liquidity use circumvent prohibition monetary financing, lay art. 123 treaty function european union. this, together supervisory considerations, explain ceiling greek t-bill hold greek bank sector. for govern council reconsider t-bill ceiling, credible perspective successful conclusion current review subsequent implementation would imply disbursement programme fund euro area member states. this would also significantly improve outlook future market access greek government. 4 bi central bankers’ speech it absolutely clear decision whether conclude review current programme disburse financial support greece lie entirely eurogroup, ultimately euro area member states. hence political decision take elect policymakers, central bankers. in meantime, continue provide advice adjustment programmes. it within context, need strong comprehensive agreement greece, need soon. by strong comprehensive i mean agreement produce growth, social fairness, also fiscally sustainable, ensure competitiveness, address remain source financial instability. i assure ecb facilitate successful outcome. such strong credible agreement greece needed, interest greece, also euro area whole. while actor need go extra mile, ball lie squarely camp greek government take necessary steps. conclusion the situation greece remind u economic monetary union unfinished construction long tool place ensure euro area member economically, fiscally financially sufficiently resilient. to complete economic monetary union, need quantum leap towards stronger, efficient institutional architecture. a know, colleague i currently work report aim show roadmap this. we final stage process, i hope understand also respect colleagues, i able tell i already say repeatedly: that need put institutional framework much strong footing; need, i said, quantum leap. i look forward discussion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: remark financial integration asia pacific speech mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, launch australian centre financial study report financial integration asia pacific, sydney, 16 june 2015 * * * thank marc-oliver thurner david norman assistance. accompany chart find reserve bank australia’s website. it pleasure speak launch australian centre financial study (acfs) work financial integration asia pacific. i first hand experience financial integration asian bond fund (abf) initiative, work fellow central banker asia emeap. in particular, launch abf2 pan-asian index fund (paif) around decade ago, get direct exposure impediment financial integration region, regulatory tax. we work together reduce impediments, help pave way expansion cross-border fix income investment region. i would like talk issue come mind think financial integration. in so, aim pose question acfs work might consider, without provide answers. the first issue development past decade so, show financial integration monotonic process. it always onwards upwards. there reversal metric financial integration 2008. in particular, cross-border bank flow decline steeply 2008 2009, have, aggregate, continue shrink fairly recently. interestingly, cross-border flow involve chinese japanese bank increase elsewhere, particularly europe, declining. we see australia, lend chinese japanese bank australia grow quite rapidly (albeit low base), lend european bank decline (graph 1). some chinese bank obtain australian bank licence european bank give up. in light developments, one question worth contemplate whether thing optimal degree financial integration? can much it? the experience financial crisis show least form financial integration didn’t go well. relatedly, beneficial form financial integration? be cross-border bank flows? and so, flow branch subsidiary, take account vary regulatory environment come choice? be bank bank flow problematic direct lend foreign bank domestic borrowers? the experience cross-border bank also replete example last-mover disadvantage. the general argument mount support cross-border bank allow bank profitably utilise knowledge, system skill new market. but best do partner exist bank, enter market own? while may opportunity arise good bank model, often case good credit taken. the local bank already well-established relationship customer strong balance sheet may quite difficult wean away, however attractive proposition put them. this lead new entrant fill book fish john west rejects. that’s necessarily bad thing, obviously unprofitable, credit quality likely lower. 2 bi central bankers’ speech alternatively, flow intermediate market beneficial, whether form bond equity? for many years, mark contrast financial structure u rest world. in us, considerably high share market-based intermediation, whereas rest world, include australia asia, bank-based intermediation lion’s share financing. one consequence regulatory reform program crisis tend increase cost bank-intermediated finance. a result, market intermediation increasing, implication future financial integration asia. this evident recent strong issuance offshore bond asian non-financial corporations. much rise drive chinese issuers, account 40 per cent bond issuance asian non-financial corporation (graph 2). however, borrow bank still represent vast majority debt asian non-financial corporations. another question arise form cross-border flow – bank market-based – stable? this issue get lot attention asian region come sharp relief feed raise policy rate. the increase cross-border flow emerge market recent years, particularly asian region, contain large amount market-based finance. asset manager much high share emerge asia fund management today decade ago. how stable flow likely volatile environment? what behaviour investor allocate high share portfolio emerge markets? how much increase share result search high yield might reverse yield traditional develop market increase? how much structural diversification emerge world become much large share global economic financial landscape? a major influence future path financial integration asia-pacific region development chinese financial markets. china path financial deregulation capital account liberalisation. almost country manage process without encounter significant problems. while china endeavour learn lesson country go path, include australia, significant achievement able pull without encounter problems. invest china’s domestic market become easy past year, range new initiative gradually open capital account, stage, primarily allow portfolio flow hong kong mainland. the new scheme expand avenue invest china’s domestic debt equity market exist rqfii qfii programs, end may account around us$140 billion foreign investment

recognition fund agreement, effective july, allow fund manager register hong kong offer investment fund product mainland resident (and vice versa). from australian perspective, avenue provide opportunity australian banks, asset manager client increase exposure chinese domestic financial market. australian international portfolio investment grow strongly recent year around a$450 billion 2010 a$750 billion end 2014 (graph 3). while share asian bond investment rise little period, share investment asian equity largely steady. both remain well 10 per cent total portfolio investment

come. there many issue discuss, i highlight here. the brief paper promise start i wish well rest project. bi central bankers’ speech 1 christopher kent: monetary policy transmission – what’s know what’s change public lecture mr christopher kent, assistant governor (economic) reserve bank australia, australian national university, canberra, 15 june 2015. * * * accompany chart find reserve bank australia’s website. i thank laura berger-thomson, adam cagliarini, gianni la cava matthew read excellent suggestion assistance prepare remarks. 1. introduction i’d like thank rohan pitchford martin richardson organise event. it’s great back anu, almost 30 year ago i embark study botany across campus, economics side good measure. it dislike compulsory chemistry class lead side path. tonight i want talk effect monetary policy economy. interest rate low level time. yet economic growth trend, unemployment rate relatively high domestic inflationary pressure well contained. this expect remain case time. it’s natural ask whether monetary policy le effective past. almost 20 year ago, stephen grenville, current role time, give comprehensive account know didn’t know transmission monetary policy australia.1 the structure economy change since way may alter transmission mechanism. so timely two count consider monetary policy transmission mechanism operate current environment. 2. how monetary policy work (in theory) 2.1 overview transmission mechanism in respond cyclical development inflation pressures, monetary policy significant influence aggregate demand inflation. the transmission interest rate economy roughly describe follows. i’ll focus ease monetary policy. 1. the reserve bank low overnight cash rate. 2. financial market update expectation future path cash rate structure deposit lend rate quickly altered. 3. over time, household firm respond low interest rate increase demand credit, reduce save increase (current) demand goods, service asset (such house equities). 4. other thing equal, rise demand increase price non-tradable good services. the price-setting behaviour firm depend demand condition 1 grenville s (1995), “the monetary policy transmission process: what do we know? (and what don't we know?)”, talk australian business economists, sydney, 28 august. 2 bi central bankers’ speech cost inputs, include labour. high aggregate demand lead increase labour demand rise wages. the transmission mechanism depend crucially monetary policy affect households’ firms’ expectations. expectation future path cash rate affect financial market price returns, asset price expect price goods, service factor production (including labour). expectation persistent change cash rate large effects. the extent low interest rate lead extra demand depend household business alter behaviour regard borrow investing, well consume saving. these response often describe occur via number different channels. 2.2 how interest rate affect demand – various channel the exchange rate channel one way interest rate affect demand. low interest rate contribute exchange rate depreciation reduce return to, hence demand for, domestic asset relative foreign currency-denominated assets. a depreciation increase price foreign product relative domestic products. this lead switch demand towards domestically produce good services. (a low exchange rate also lead directly increase import prices.) many macroeconomic model emphasise intertemporal substitution primary transmission channel. household business make decision whether save le spend le later. low interest rate provide le reward saving, thereby encourage expenditure near term (and le out). decrease interest rate boost asset prices, number effects. first, boost investment housing, equipment capital good become le expensive build buy (this likely important, although empirical evidence relevance ‘q-ratio’ weak). second, household typically respond increase net worth consume little point time. this know wealth channel, appear important australian context. the balance sheet channel closely related. rise net worth make easy borrow, high collateral value make lend le risky proposition. the cash-flow channel appear important part transmission mechanism australia. change interest rate affect households’ businesses’ cash flows. if face liquidity borrow constraints, increase cash flow typically lead spending.2 for example, decrease interest rate low interest payment household variable-rate mortgages, leave disposable income spend. at time, cash flow low otherwise interest-earning asset may choose restrict spending. notwithstanding latter effect, decrease interest rate expect increase demand channel. this reflect fact household sector australia net borrower, i mean interest bear liability great interest-earning assets.3 moreover, seem plausible marginal propensity spend generally high debtor (who may face credit constraints) creditors. 2 unconstrained household adjust borrow smooth consumption face temporary fluctuation income. 3 in close economy context (with public sector), net debt position household sector would imply corporate sector lend households. in world, low interest rate would benefit household debt, expense low payment household corporate sector. in case, cash-flow channel would depend difference marginal propensity consume across different type households. bi central bankers’ speech 3 that’s rough sketch theory transmission mechanism. what say practice might change time? 3. estimate overall effect monetary policy it difficult enough estimate strength monetary policy transmission mechanism term effect economy overall. it hard still separately identify strength various channels. a key challenge disentangle effect monetary policy influences, foreign development change fiscal policy. this require model simultaneously account forces. there wide range model estimate choose, capture different aspect way world work reality. for illustrative purposes, let mention one set recent estimate provide colleague use so-called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) model.4 consider estimate effect decrease cash rate 100 basis points. this lead gdp high otherwise ½ ¾ percentage point course two year (graph 1). inflation estimate rise somewhat le ¼ percentage point per annum 2–3 years. these estimate close models.5 estimate dsge model tentatively suggest overall effect monetary policy change significantly recent years. in particular, estimate ‘endogenous’ relationship model base data 2008 (after interest rate notably lower) estimate base data present day. this suggest period below-trend growth gdp past year may reflect change monetary policy transmission mechanism. rather, model attribute below-trend growth sizeable exogenous force shocks. the sharp fall commodity price play important role late. also, weakness private investment – beyond explain subdue domestic demand fall commodity price – make sizeable contribution below-trend growth. the model also suggest consumption growth bite weak past. these estimate provide tentative evidence overall effect monetary policy neither le effective past. however, may it’s early identify structural change data hand. alternatively, effect monetary policy overall activity inflation might close historical average, could mask change effect across different part economy variation relative strength different channel one episode next. 4. estimate channel monetary policy i’ll consider possibility look closely behaviour dwell construction household consumption. i’ll leave one side effect monetary policy business 4 see rees d, p smith j hall (2015), “a multi-sector model australian economy ,” rba research discussion paper no 2015-07. this paper explicitly model various channel monetary policy refer effect change monetary policy activity inflation loosely interpret operation relevant channel variables. 5 for example, see dungey m a pagan (2000), ‘a structural var model australian economy’, economic record, 76(235), pp 321–342; berkelmans l (2005), ‘credit monetary policy: an australian svar’, rba research discussion paper no 2005–06; bjørnland h (2009), ‘monetary policy exchange rate overshooting: dornbusch wa right after all’, journal international economics, 79(1), pp 64–77; jääskelä j k nimark (2011), ‘a medium-scale new keynesian open economy model australia’, economic record, 87(276), pp 11–36. 4 bi central bankers’ speech investment external trade.6 i’d note though rise growth rate household expenditure contribute, time, pick-up non-mining business investment. so would depreciation exchange rate, would raise demand domestic production. we argue exchange rate depreciation appear likely necessary, particularly give large decline commodity price year. 4.1 responsiveness dwell construction dwell construction typically interest-rate sensitive component expenditure australian economy. it grow strongly response low interest rates, rise 9 per cent past year (graph 2). the result standard ‘single-equation’ reduced-form model suggest response (to date) residential build approval low interest rate high house price broadly consistent historical experience.7 although behaviour construction investment past year unusual, possible period low rate limit much demand dwell construction bring forward future. it also possible period low interest rate eventually lead high inflation land construction work, normally require bring forth supply particular good service. these pressure might arise depletion suitable land available development need attract developer worker industry. in circumstances, increase construction demand would tend push price exist new dwellings. this could occur via increase land prices, construction wages, developers’ margin combination three. the direct effect additional demand construction economic activity would le case ample spare capacity. but situation would still provide support aggregate demand ways, include via operation balance-sheet wealth channels. there evidence tighten supply pocket country. in cities, stock unsold lot suitable development appear unusually low (graph 3). shortage evident sydney, greenfield land release keep pace recent strong demand. also, bank’s liaison contact concern stock suitable site apartment development sydney deplete past years. there little evidence labour supply constraint outside trade professional roles. however, inflation build material price rise bank’s liaison suggest builder increase margin past year so. consistent this, inflation new dwell cost rise almost 2 percentage point average inflation-targeting period; although, still see dwell construction strong early 2000s. despite potential emergence constraint affect supply new dwell pocket country, appear scope strong growth new dwell 6 i’ve say quite bite difficulty model business investment. see kent c (2014), ‘non-mining business investment – where here?’, address bloomberg summit, sydney, 16 september. it often difficult find significant empirical relationship interest rate business investment. for discussion business respond change interest rate see lane k t rosewall (2015), ‘firms’ investment decision interest rates’, rba bulletin, june, forthcoming. 7 it appear might slightly long delay time approval grant construction house past. this likely reflect large share higher-density dwellings, take long complete detach dwellings. for information point, see rba (2015), ‘box c: the cycle dwell investment’, statement monetary policy, may, pp 43– 45. bi central bankers’ speech 5 construction part country. moreover, alteration addition activity could pick up. this use account 45 per cent total dwell construction, decline past years, despite low interest rate sizeable increase dwell prices. in short, sign tighten supply condition pocket country, dwell construction overall respond low interest rate much always done. 4.2 consumption behaviour borrower saver what effect low interest rate household consumption? this model simple way link household consumption disposable income household wealth. in model, low interest rate affect consumption indirectly increase household disposable income boost house equity prices.8 this simple model (like dsge model result i discussed) provide tentative evidence consumption growth bite weak recent year suggest historical experience. much history, however, capture period adjustment easy access credit early 1990s mid 2000s. at time, household indebtedness increase substantially save ratio decline well early norm (graph 4).9 so way, recent experience could regard standard response. indeed, behaviour late appear sustainable previous episode.10 one aspect change behaviour evident household inject equity house stock recent years. that is, net new spend house asset exceed borrow secure housing. this stand stark contrast period strong house market condition first half 2000s, saw household withdraw house equity help finance consumption (graph 5).11 a i mentioned, experience recent year characterise slightly low growth consumption might expected. however, responsiveness consumption disposable income wealth appear changed, least statistically significant way. there two possible explanation observation. first, growth consumption late could affect factor stance monetary policy. second, may strength various monetary policy transmission channel affect consumption changed, way difficult identify use model aggregate household behaviour. although hard definitive, sense explanation likely true. 8 estimate wealth effect tend differ somewhat base exact data methodology use estimation. previous work bank staff suggest household consume 3 4 cent every extra dollar house wealth. for examples, see dvornak n m kohler (2003), ‘housing wealth, stock market wealth consumption: a panel analysis australia’, rba research discussion paper no 2003–07 windsor c, j jääskelä r finlay (2013), ‘home price household spending’, rba research discussion paper no 2013–04. 9 see rba (2014), submission financial system inquiry, march, chapter 2. 10 see stevens g (2013), ‘economic policy booms’, address the anika foundation luncheon, sydney, 30 july. 11 for description house equity withdrawal, see schwartz c, t hampton, c lewis d norman (2006), ‘a survey house equity withdrawal injection australia’, rba research discussion paper no 2006–08. 6 bi central bankers’ speech let start change affect cash-flow channel. net interest payment household responsive change interest rate decade ago (at least short term). to illustrate magnitude this, estimate effect 100 basis point reduction cash rate net interest payment (as share household disposable incomes; graph 6).12 there noticeable increase households’ hold interest-earning asset (such bank deposits) recent year (graph 7). but despite this, reduction interest rate still low households’ net interest payments, much case early decades. this large response reflect substantial increase house credit early 1990s mid 2000s. by itself, great responsiveness net interest payment imply cash-flow channel strong previously. other thing equal, might expect strong effect interest rate average household’s cash flows, operation channel monetary policy, would encourage noticeable rise debt large increase current consumption response low interest rates. yet household indebtedness relatively stable year (graph 7 graph 9). while low interest rate may help support consumption debt, force appear work opposite direction. moreover, response consumption indebtedness depend different type household respond forces. let make clear examples. some household may revise expectation income growth may also uncertain incomes. this would consistent substantial decline wage growth rise unemployment rate past years.13 this could cause household become uncomfortable level debt carrying. accordingly, many household may decide pay debt fast would world unchanged expectation incomes, thereby contribute period weak consumption growth. in environment, low interest rate help facilitate ‘deleveraging’, hasten time household feel secure financial situation. there evidence many household behave way. in particular, rate mortgage prepayment increase interest rate fall household well ahead require schedule repayment (graph 8).14, 15 also, deduct fund hold mortgage offset account ignore investor credit, see rest household credit decline 4 percentage point share household disposable income since early 2010. this consistent degree deleveraging among households, particularly consider low interest rate 12 this chart estimate reaction cash flow cash rate change within month. since large share deposit rate fix loan rates, overstate effect cash flow long time horizons, though extent bias necessarily change time obvious way. 13 jacob d a rush (2015), ‘why wage growth so low?’, rba bulletin, june, forthcoming. 14 a lack data mean cannot make comparison early ease phase indebtedness lower. 15 another factor potentially mute response consumption interest rate change relate banks’ process adjust schedule mortgage repayment follow change lend rates. some bank decrease schedule mortgage repayment interest rate decrease. this mean even though interest component repayment declined, total repayment same, result many borrower automatically make excess principal repayments. see thurner m-o a dwyer (2013), ‘partial mortgage prepayment house credit growth’, rba bulletin, september, pp 31–38. bi central bankers’ speech 7 might otherwise encourage general increase type credit period (graph 9).16 what household rely interest-bearing assets? their disposable income low otherwise give sizeable decline interest rates.17 accordingly, household may reluctant maintain consumption either run pool liquid assets, access capital gain may enjoy house equity hold. such behaviour would contribute growth aggregate consumption le responsive decline interest rate past. finally, let’s consider household spare fund invest. the low level interest rate may prompt household search yield. many household combine spare fund new debt purchase house purpose investment. indeed, strong growth investor house loan drive growth household debt (as share disposable incomes) recent year contribute rise house price dwell construction. while may directly contribute rise consumption household undertake investment, support overall economic activity nonetheless. conclusion monetary policy clearly work support demand, although work strong headwinds. these include significant decline mine investment, fiscal consolidation state federal level exchange rate, continue offer le assistance would normally expect achieve balance growth economy. model estimate control force provide tentative evidence monetary policy transmission mechanism, aggregate, effective usual. however, may early pick statistically significant change use models. a usual, dwell construction grow strongly response low interest rates, make contribution growth aggregate demand employment. it may part country, substantial increase residential construction activity might run supply constraints, put upward pressure house prices. a bank note time now, large increase house prices, accompany strong growth credit relaxation lend standards, potential risk economic stability. accordingly, bank work regulator ass contain risk may arise house market. consumption growth pick since 2013. but still little weak suggest historical experience. this may reflect number factor include variation way different channel monetary policy affect household accord stage life. some indebted household appear take advantage low interest rate pay debt fast norm, perhaps response weak prospect income growth. those rely interest receipt may feel compel constrain consumption response relatively long period low interest rates. meanwhile, search yield doubt play role drive strong growth investor house credit. this might provide indirect support aggregate demand, channel without risk. 16 from mid 2010 mid 2012, half decline dash line graph 9 owe low owner-occupier house credit (net offset accounts), since return level five year ago (as share disposable income). 17 for discussion issue, see connolly e, f fleming j jääskelä (2012), ‘households’s interest-bearing assets‘, rba bulletin, december, pp 23’32. 8 bi central bankers’ speech in short, monetary policy working. the transmission mechanism may change respects, could help explain lower-than-expected growth consumption debt late. but hard definitive. to know this, would helpful good understand behaviour different type household use household-level data. to use botanical analogy, know plant, it’s helpful observe different type cell work. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: build real market good people speech mr mark

fair effective market review we must break back issues, fair effective market review show way forward. with publication today, main build block place real market need. i want pay tribute colleague charles roxburgh, minouche shafik martin wheatley, ably lead review. and salute elizabeth corley, expertly chair review’s independent market practitioner panel, canvass coalesce view across industry. the importance complexity task illustrate multiple root cause misconduct ficc markets. specifically, review identifies: – market structure present specific opportunity abuse, poor benchmark design, generally vulnerable conflict interest, collusion, thin markets; – standard acceptable market practice usually poorly understood, often ignore always lack teeth; – firms’ system internal governance control incapable assert interest firm – let alone wide market – close-knit trade staff; – individual incentive skewed, pay package stress short-term return overlong-term value good conduct; – and personal accountability lacking, culture impunity develop part market. all factor contribute ethical drift. unethical behaviour go unchecked, proliferate eventually become norm. too many participant neither felt responsible system recognise full impact actions. for many, city stop gates, though influence extend far beyond. a good start make address deficiencies. the design regulation key ficc

sanctions, necessary, aren’t solution, least since $150 billion fine levy global bank translate $3 trillion reduce lend capacity real economy. we need good balance individual firm accountability. but accountable? against standards? and consequences? in regards, i welcome review’s recommendation that: bi central bankers’ speech 5 first, individual must hold account. do require new, common standards, cast clear language; good train qualification ficc personnel; mechanism ensure individual fired, history know consider hire them. second, firm must take great responsibility system improve quality, clarity market-wide understand ficc trade practices. i welcome industry’s leadership draw plan new ficc market standard board. the board’s mandate establish readily understandable standards, keep up-to-date market developments, promote adherence them. crucially, board dynamic, monitor address area uncertainty specific trade practices. this major opportunity industry establish common standard market practice well understood, widely follow and, crucially, keep pace markets. if firm staff fail take opportunity, restrictive regulation inevitable. to give measure teeth, key element senior manager regime extend firm active wholesale ficc markets, include dealer asset managers. that mean senior manager would clearly define responsibility would answerable training, certify monitor material risk taker supervise. the fca oversee compliance, redeploy resource focus senior persons. in turn, individual would hook promote compliance within organisations. incentive aligned. for best

economy – tap untapped opportunity speech dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, inauguration rmb clear bank thailand 5th year celebration icbc (thai), bangkok, 22 april 2015. * * * 1. your excellency ambassador ning fukui, chairman jiang, chairman hu, dr. zhigang li, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, thank invitation give remark occasion inauguration icbc (thai) official renminbi clear bank thailand. 2. this development rmb clear bank thailand certainly also celebrate 5th anniversary icbc (thai) fact result long continue tie china thailand. it mark another important step development financial tie follow sign renminbi – thai baht bilateral swap agreement memorandum understand people’s bank china establishment renminbi clear arrangement december 2014. 3. today, i invite talk thai economy. so i please opportunity share observation current state thai economy. let humbly start challenge facing, economy currently reel internal external headwinds. internally, stagnant technology labour readiness far take toll thailand’s economic expansion. also, improvement domestic consumption investment slow due cautious private sector’s confidence. externally, thai economy affect current uneven recovery global economy hind thai export growth. however, thai economy expect recover 3.8% gdp growth year mere 0.8% last year. private consumption government expenditure play key role 2015 outlook. 4. on bright side, thailand rid back china’s economic prosperity. in words, regional prospect pin improvement intra-regional trade good services. china’s economic figure may somewhat low historical average, result sluggish recovery global demand continue structural reform china. however, china growth rate still satisfactorily high level. and china yet remain important engine support growth thai export sector. for past years, thailand become one popular destination among chinese tourists, thank popularity ‘lost thailand’ movie. each week, hundred flight thailand china land accommodate increase interest chinese visitors. we value considerably help boost tourism service sector thai economy, also tighten cultural connections. 5. a know, chinese economy become necessary ingredient secret recipe past decade. since china important economic partner thailand region. to strengthen flow trade investments, close financial cooperation key. the renminbi / baht bilateral swap agreement (or bsa short) establishment renminbi clear bank bangkok great examples. 6. the bsa design backstop liquidity facility, help boost confidence private sector use local currency trade investment settlement. after first sign bsa 2010, use chinese renminbi trade investment settlement thailand china grow remarkably. the share trade settlement renminbi quadruple 2010 2014. a investment 2 bi central bankers’ speech settlement, share climb dramatically mere 1% 2010 14% 2014. in spite rapid increases, volume still small compare major currencies. 7. the renminbi clear bank next important step bsa. it renminbi settlement mechanism sequence plan renminbi scalability. i could see merit fundamentally pave way renminbi internationalization well role renminbi global financial market become increasingly prominent near future. 8. there is, however, room improvement order realize full economic benefit thailand china. with regard, need promote financial cooperation trade investment facility arrangement today’s initiative. lady gentlemen, 9. i would like emphasize still untapped opportunity abound along whole spectrum exchange cooperation thailand china. a give food thought, followings, examples. firstly, regional supply chain network. our region already regard high quality cost-effective production bases. however, still gap fill opportunity grasped. since many economy region well integrate regional production networks. accord late world bank’s trade cross border indicator measure time cost trade across borders, new member asean score well asean average. this mainly due huge gap infrastructure. 10. here, narrow gap mobilize region’s abundant financial resource infrastructure investment. in regard, china play strategic role progression infrastructure development region. the improve infrastructure allow regional economy various stage development participate regional production network line evolve comparative advantage. infrastructure investment costly worth expense. 11. secondly, research technical development. although china emerge world centre stage recent decades, china world class technology lab own broad range advance technologies. these range “maglev” train shanghai supercomputer “tianhe-2” rank world’s fast compute system 2014. thailand, hand, currently face technology bottleneck take toll thailand’s competitiveness growth. accord unesco, thailand’s combine public private investment research development (r&d) around 0.25 percent gdp fall behind china’s 1.7 percent. 12. array china development plan coincide thailand’s research interest. accord china’s medium long-term plan development science technology (2006 – 2020), china’s topic strategic research include (1) agriculture science (2) green technology (3) public health. these topic line agenda thailand’s national science, technology innovation (sti) master plan. this provide opportunity joint scientific work base common interest medium-term visions. thailand could leverage china experience knowhow technology transfer. in light, thailand could step ahead fast pace achieve goals. this yet another great complement tap. 13. lastly, thailand gateway asean. thailand strategically position heart asean region relatively well-developed infrastructure reflect world bank’s late logistics performance index. thailand has, therefore, natural gateway link extra-regional economy asean markets. thailand advantage hub regional headquarter multinational companies; hub logistics distribution activities; source hub regional markets; financial hub regional markets. however, remain competitive regional hub challenge task. bi central bankers’ speech 3 14. to remain prefer hub entry point region, perceive opportunity investment china advantage capital, construction capacity technology. a advantage low cost factor production rapidly declining, china face urgent need re-orient supply chain thailand enter asean great mekong subregion (gms) particular. china thailand therefore make every effort grasp opportunity construct win-win solution sides. lady gentlemen, 15. let conclude china economic prosperity advancement provide wide range untapped opportunity thailand. they right now, region. we seize miss it. and i confident long work hand hand china, unite together, embrace merit economic integration, synergy two surely give fruit grow tree. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: economic policy capital market – promote prosperity europe open keynote speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, official monetary financial institution forum (omfif) global investment seminar, london, 11 june 2015. * * * 1. introduction my speech today cover number topics, start recent capital market development move monetary policy economic policy make europe prosperous. 2. recent capital market development the recent volatility bond market remind jam carville, advisor bill clinton, said: “i use think reincarnation, i want come back president pope .400 baseball hitter, i want come back bond market. you intimidate everybody.” bond investors, least one wrong-footed, certainly intimidate recent jump bond yields. to understand underlie decline bond prices, dub “bund tantrum” german bunds epicentre mini-crash, one bear mind precede rally, trigger large extent eurosystem’s sovereign bond purchase programme. expectation large-scale qe programme depress long-term interest rate even purchase actually began. however, somewhat surprisingly, interest rate drop still unprecedented low level purchase programme kick march. it development many attribute saw decisive implementation programme, also link gradual emergence consequence programme details. yield german bunds maturity eight year fall zero, suggest certain degree exuberance air. these developments, fuel economic news side atlantic, drive number bond investor doubt sustainability low yields. the german faz daily newspaper comment shift sentiment: “some people week ago regard negative yield sign serious crisis see rise yield signal serious crisis, too.” in opinion, recent rise yield largely explain correction market overshoot – kind re-normalisation. liquidity might issue, too. with bond price fall many investor catch guard, appear little appetite take long position bonds. for it’s worth, current level bond market volatility exceptionally high. indeed, unusually low past year. so market movement rather welcome development insofar help foster risk awareness. what episode illustrate central bank currently significant impact capital markets, become dominant market player. yet fully control long-term interest rates, try might strive fulfil monetary policy mandates. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but episode also show financial system able cope market movements. the ultimate goal qe accelerate inflation euro area bring inflation rate line definition price stability. accord definition, euro-area inflation close 2% medium term. you don’t need tell i was, i still am, one sceptic regard purchase sovereign bond euro area. have outline argument many occasions, example city london event february, i brief today. in nutshell, i doubt need large-volume qe programme and, backdrop, i see risk unintended side-effects might outweigh benefit term accelerate normalisation inflation. while current inflation rate significantly target, drive mainly positive supply-side shock cause low energy prices. a sign second-round effects, risk deflation low indeed. so, acceleration inflation rate already cards, without qe – qe, certainly faster. this benefit trade risks: central bank set become euro-area member states’ big creditors. when government become accustom favourable finance conditions, could dampen willingness consolidate budget implement structural reforms. and could make government keen try prevent ecb terminate ultra-easy monetary policy. at end day, could jeopardise central bank independence, undermine ability maintain price stability. it generally say monetary policymakers increasingly call upon step take action. let mention two item wish lists: 1. keep greek financial system afloat provide emergency liquidity and, thus, help prevent greek government defaulting. 2. protect economy negative outcome suppose era “secular stagnation” adopt activist monetary policy stance. central banks, unique eurosystem, run risk overburdened. thus, i think one core issue monetary policy go forward find right definition boundary monetary policy. it clear monetary policy stimulate economy short run. what cannot do, however, deliver sustainable growth. metaphorically speaking, row boat one oar broken, good try fix oar paddle remain one. in words, successful monetary policy hinge factor cannot fully determine itself. one key factor stability-oriented framework. such framework ensure sound public finance sustainable economic growth. it framework foster responsible political decision anchor principle liability – say, take decision accountable consequences. and particularly relevant monetary union. in vein, important undermine no-bail-out rule european treaty. solidarity expect conditionality accepted. otherwise, root cause problem addressed. i imagine guess i talk ongoing negotiation greece. there strong determination help greece improve public administration, remove barrier growth put public finance sustainable path. and taxpayer bi central bankers’ speech 3 euro-area country provide substantial fund support unavoidable adjustment processes. but time run out, risk insolvency increase day. the contagion effect scenario certainly good contain past, though underestimated. but main loser scenario would greece greek people. what i would like stress erosion principle monetary union also consequence eurosystem monetary union one downplay. 3. economic development recent growth figure global economy rather disappointing. growth dynamic dampened, least major emerge economies. the u economy contract first quarter year due brief spell poor weather. and uk economy also see growth rate shrink. the low oil price prove le drive force global economy anticipated. the moderate recovery euro area ongoing, however, economy pick momentum. the late eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection euro area see annual real gdp increase 1.5% 2015, 1.9% 2016 2.0% 2017. the german economy recover quickly expect cyclical lull middle last year return growth path underpin domestic foreign demand. domestic economic activity benefit favourable labour market situation substantial increase income. although foreign trade currently hamper dampen global dynamics, simultaneously buoy euro’s depreciation strengthen cyclical recovery euro area. the bundesbank’s economist expect germany’s real gdp grow 1.7% year, 1.8% 2016 1.5% 2017. a puzzle feature german economy divergence business investment employment, give finance condition extraordinarily favourable. the weak level business investment might explain high degree uncertainty external developments, might also point anticipate future shortage skilled labour. in words: age tone investment. 4. make europe prosperous the wait-and-see stance adopt many german enterprise motivate least modest economic outlook euro area. boost growth euro area, then, need top priority. this would help crisis country overcome difficult economic situation also benefit member states. to get grip crisis, crucial trouble economy press ahead adjustment process. that include shore public finance (in line fiscal rule stability growth pact); deleveraging private sector; implement structural reform boost price competitiveness. this, way, also hold true france. while second-largest euro-area economy obviously crisis country, nevertheless see competitiveness contract, public finance bad shape. moreover, france need act role model small economies. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the german economy much good position respect – public budget run surplus, private debt acceptable, labour market social reform last decade contribute low unemployment reduce burden social security systems; plus german enterprise competitive global markets. so everything hunky-dory? not all. germany’s economy may good shape right now, position complacent. germany face stiff economic challenges, particularly demographic change, also drag productivity growth. accord eu commission’s late age report, germany’s working-age population (people 15 64) shrink 28% year 2060 compare drop 8% rest european union. in france, meanwhile, working-age population expect rise 5%, uk 11%. no wonder, then, two eu country (crisis-ridden greece portugal) expect see low potential gdp growth 2013 2060. and even term per caput growth, germany mire mediocrity european standards, accord oecd projections. yet i want focus germany. i want make plain mobilise additional growth force task face whole europe. after all, title speech “how promote prosperity europe”. some may remember european council’s lisbon agenda. it set year 2000 aim “to make europe, 2010, competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world, capable sustainable economic growth good job great social cohesion”. well, obviously, european leader inspire italian artist michelangelo, quote saying: “the great danger u aim high miss it, low reach it.” give apparent failure strategy face unprecedented crisis, goal set successor, “europe 2020”, somewhat le ambitious: priority “europe 2020” “smart, sustainable inclusive growth”. however, strong growth come declaration. rather, growth-friendly measure require – particularly mean measure bolster function markets. incidentally, growth-friendly measure would also help mitigate risk uk leave european union. the benefit european integration cannot measure net contribution brussels’ budget. the economic value go far beyond europe zero-sum game benefit – provide promote competitive market structure unleash innovative forces. if europe really head “smart, sustainable inclusive growth”, would gain attractiveness – also uk. but much uk gain part eu, so, eu benefit uk member. the eu strong today uk’s contribution it: the dynamic european economy owe great deal britain’s commitment open flexible market – position much tune bundesbank’s, i might add. in remainder speech, i would like share think way european economy could become even dynamic. bi central bankers’ speech 5 4.1 capital market union financial market fragmentation certainly hindrance growth. build capital market union (cmu), one european commission’s top priorities, therefore step forward towards prosperous europe. a properly design implement cmu also deliver great economic financial stability. from bundesbank’s viewpoint, cmu particular aim foster european equity markets. corporate finance europe still heavily reliant debt, first foremost bank loans. take gdp yardstick, eu bank system four time large u counterpart. conversely, equity capital play minor role. while ratio stock market capitalisation bank credit private sector well one eu countries, us, respective figure two. however, u enterprise benefit good access equity capital. equity hold u also much widely disperse europe. research find private risk share integrate capital market much important shock absorber public risk sharing. the integrate market equity capital u cushion around 40% total cyclical fluctuation federal states. if negative shock hit industry specific region, loss spread widely beyond region. creditors, hand, expose loss – except case insolvency. in words: equity shock absorber, debt shock amplifier. that’s yet another reason need promote integration equity market europe, too. this also include venture capital. when come provide capital innovative firms, eu lot room improvement. in us, instance, find investor much problem innovative companies. on average, innovative u firm attract significantly capital one major european countries. dismantle national barrier create european venture capital market would help fast-growing, fledgling enterprise get good access capital. while regulation harmonise extent, however, many crucial domain venture capital funds, investor protection insolvency law, remain fragmented. hence, exploit economic advantage capital market union would imply legal change currently propose eu commission. 4.2 barrier market entry another obstacle particularly stifle growth business start-ups red tape. frequent administrative formalities, long approval period high fee make start business complicate expensive be. even though enterprise’s direct cost may appear manageable first glance, economic cost difficulty enter market and, result, weak competition underestimated. for example, study indicate difference cost enter market usa eu, though relatively small, could still account 10% 20% eu’s productivity shortfall. the cost remove red tape comparatively low could help strengthen growth. this hold true many european country – least germany, rank 106th global competitiveness report world economic forum question “how 6 bi central bankers’ speech many procedure require start business?” – alongside country like ethiopia, zimbabwe, mozambique chad. 4.3 market integration even uk, i think, would doubt single market great success benefit entire eu. it simplify trade goods, intensify competition narrow margins. nevertheless, market integration remain incomplete. in area services, cross-border competition under-developed. mark-ups cost service are, average, high usa. one could say european commission’s service directive fail live expectations. in nutshell, single market service yet deliver full potential. thus, complete single market service ensure unhindered cross-border provision service promise significant economic benefits. a far advance digitalisation concerned, know exactly economic transformation towards great digitalisation impact growth taxation. but know currently 28 separate digital market eu. however, clear benefit digitalisation reap economy flexible enough adjust change business conditions. in europe, market digital application highly fragmented, especially respect legal issue protection privacy, content copyright. the liability online intermediaries, electronic payment electronic contract also regulate differently. harmonisation term digital single market (dsm) would certainly contribute high potential growth. accord study european parliament, complete dsm could raise long-run level eu-28 gdp 4%. and european commission, recently present dsm strategy, expect creation 3.8 million jobs. harmonise rule regulation relevant trade good service within eu. do business trade partner outside eu hamper even great extent red tape, ongoing existence tariff and, all, trade barriers. in many cases, manufacturer produce two different version product meet respective requirement eu u markets. this produce unnecessary cost little benefit. a transatlantic free trade agreement world’s two large economy would therefore stimulate sustainable growth job creation. 4.4 flexible labour market the promise way reap benefit innovation technological change, however, implement structural reform aim create great labour market flexibility. researcher find that, compare us, innovative european firm find difficult hire staff need. this drag allocative efficiency and, ultimately, productivity, too. if want mimic u productivity drive unemployment acceptable levels, need modernise labour markets. overly strict employment protection exert “lock-in” effect: worker move easily one firm next. that mean establish “hire fire” system. low employment protection couple adequate financial support event job loss. scandinavian country lead way “flexicurity” reform and, fortunately, increase number euro-area country follow suit. bi central bankers’ speech 7 4.5 good infrastructure just like flexible labour market support growth, good infrastructure. conversely, infrastructure weakness inhibit growth considerably. in regard, often claim germany increase infrastructure investment. even germany, en vogue complain ail infrastructure. the weekly magazine d spiegel, example, last year publish issue entitle d bröckelstaat – “the crumble state”. however, neither comparable international data theoretical consideration suggest germany invest little. in 2014, ratio gross fix capital formation gdp germany slightly euro-area average also high uk. moreover, investment boost growth prospect per se. in fact, would put cart horse. good prospect growth, therefore profit, best incentive invest. international survey show germany consider one best infrastructure world. the global competitiveness report i mention early speech rank germany’s infrastructure seventh place, ahead france, spain, uk us. and world bank’s logistics performance index even put germany’s infrastructure first place worldwide. have say that, i would deny room improvement public investment, give net investment negative time now. international comparison suggest german public investment low. this, however, take pinch salt. the ratio public investment gdp hinge role state economy, differ widely across europe. provide public fund primarily invest area pay off, improve economic supply condition and, long term, growth potential. however, would unnecessary wrong fund high public infrastructure investment new borrowing. rather, make possible cut consumptive expenditures. call deficit-financed economic stimulus germany misplaced. in regard, former ecb chief economist otmar issing write financial time article last october still hold true day: “imagine ask give advice country economic policy. the country enjoy near-full employment; growth least full potential. there under-usage resource – economist call output gap – government’s budget balanced, debt level far target. to top all, monetary policy extremely loose. this exactly situation germany. (…) where economic textbook argue country run deficit stimulate economy?” 5. conclusion let conclude. my objective make plain monetary policy wrong addressee come promote prosperity europe. it still true maintain price stability best contribution monetary policy make achieve sustain economic growth long run. since i quote jam carville early on, i would like close modify famous phrase “it’s economy, stupid.” into: it’s monetary policy provide prosperity. it’s forward-looking economic policy set course sustainable growth. 8 bi central bankers’ speech thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenn stevens: economic condition prospect – create upside address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, economic society australia luncheon, brisbane, 10 june 2015. * * * i thank elliott jam research assistance. thank invitation speak brisbane again. the last time i speak group, july 2013, economy estimate grow 2½ per cent.1 underlie inflation 2¼–2½ per cent, consistent target 2–3 per cent. two year on, economy grow shy 2½ per cent underlie inflation around 2¼–2½ per cent, consistent target. in respects, then, might seem much changed. in fact number important development occur period, anticipate not. overall, fact much change disappointing: economy pick speed hoped. in talk, i make observation global domestic economies, try give sense learn past couple years. the global economy two year ago, judge australia’s trade partner group grow average pace around 4 per cent. it expect 2014 2015 growth group would pick bit, pace little average. in fact, growth trade partner remain 4 per cent expect stay next couple years. to sure, 4 per cent growth fast growth world economy whole, like 3¼ per cent. it australia’s advantage high exposure, advance country, faster-growing asian region. a example, euro area significant trade partner australia, probably le affect many country 2012 2013 europe lapse back recession. two year ago, i note economy euro area still small financial crisis. regrettably, remain true today. europe back growth path now, still fairly modest one, seem require extraordinary set monetary policy achieve even that. growth recently resume japan dip activity follow enactment tax increase last year. japanese growth rate remain pretty modest, though since japan decline population, look good per caput basis. the full implementation so-called “third arrow” structural reform could expected, occurs, lift growth per head long run. growth proceed reasonable clip rest asia, though i note two year ago, country possible restore pre-crisis growth rates. and growth achieve accompany number case 1 with subsequent data revision growth rate mid 2013 look little low now. 2 bi central bankers’ speech sizeable increase debt owe households, firm both. how big vulnerability turn different financial condition and/or low growth cannot yet know. while advantage less exposure europe many countries, flipside much great exposure china. that mean sensitive fluctuation china’s performance countries. this new point; i say much five year ago.2 but perhaps concrete now, give china’s growth slow appreciably past years. the moderation 2014 le china’s policymakers intended. the moderation see past six month may little intended. chinese policy respond outcome would expect: interest rate declining, select restraint credit eased. step back ebb flow short-run data, big point china’s policymakers attempt two major transitions. one towards consumption-driven growth, oppose investment export-led growth. this necessary continental-sized economy china cannot rely rest world absorb rapid growth output. the second, relate transition towards robust financial structure, necessary prevail structure many risky aspects. both transition necessary, remain work progress. how play unavoidably source uncertainty. what seem fairly clear pace growth demand commodity like iron ore low future past five years, even supply continue increase. thus far much additional supply australian ore, though apparent least future increase supply countries. perhaps surprising, then, australian discussion chinese economy prism iron ore price – day subject daily monitoring. a month ago, almost seem though price iron ore might, term attention given, eclipse price australian focus passion, namely price house. but late house price seem regain pre-eminent place national psyche! turn away china, quite significant good deal optimism unite states. the rate unemployment fall considerably growth wage begin increase. there weak march quarter result growth output, observer attribute temporary factors, though remain see robust return growth since. the significance healthy u economy two-fold. one element expectation many business people around world, include australia, still tend take cue tone u business. the second that, point, u monetary policy begin adjust improve conditions. that gradual process, stage, indication still seem u federal reserve begin process time year. it reasonable hope change course accomplish without serious disruption financial markets, cannot certain that. country receive cross-border capital flow generally seek strengthen economic financial fundamental since “taper tantrum” mid 2013. the fact feed signal clearly possible way think issue also help reduce instability. on hand, “guidance” guarantee smooth sailing. moreover, stand today highly unusual juncture. we see combination remarkably low yield financial 2 see ‘the challenge prosperity’, address committee economic development australia (ceda) annual dinner, melbourne, november 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 3 assets, compress risk premia diverge outlook monetary policy across major jurisdictions. it complex picture market participant policymakers. recently, see large abrupt movement currencies, commodity price even sovereign bond rates. while extent normalisation period unusually subdue volatility, movement may also signal degree underlie fragility build long period “search yield”. such dynamic bear watching. the australian economy in australia, recent growth economy strong want. of course, witness economy head along course normal economic cycle, complex rather lengthy adjustment once-in-a-century cycle term trade early increase household leverage. during late 1990s early 2000s, confident household spend borrow more, save less, process extend balance sheets. that process start fade 2006 finish abruptly financial crisis hit. but run-up resource price impart large stimulus economy allow solid growth continue time country still feel aftermath financial crisis. but capital spend need lift output mine sector completed, least production iron ore. some large lng project still underway, project others draw close, decline mine investment already underway continue (and perhaps accelerate). the late edition australian national accounts, release last week, show picture. the quarterly growth figure strong embody forecast may statement monetary policy, though come weaker-than-expected outcome previous quarter. some strength result unusually high export shipment resources, le disrupt weather condition “cyclone season” often case past. indication pace growth wasn’t repeat june quarter, shipment coal particular affect weather disruption east coast. take result past four quarters, growth “below trend”. export volume growth contribute strongly, domestic final demand increase bite 1 per cent, quite weak result. house construction rise strongly, consumer spend year rise real household income (that is, save rate fell). both result owe good deal low interest rate rise asset values. but component demand weak. business investment fell substantially, mine investment fall quickly and, best tell, non-mining capital spend also weak. public final spend didn’t grow all. public investment spend fell 8 per cent past year. overall, outcome weak what, two year ago, expect would happen now. back then, two-year-ahead forecast annual gdp growth range 2½ 4 per cent mid 2015. the width range reflect normal size error margins, couple inevitable uncertainty time component demand outside mine might strengthen, judgement accommodative monetary policy really hold place several year (which key assumption behind forecasts), activity could point start pick quite quickly. it three month get national account data june quarter, point, three four quarter available year june 2015, would appear outcome either right bottom range predict two year ago or, likely, bite it. 4 bi central bankers’ speech of course, forecast hardly educate guesswork two-year-ahead forecast even le reliable. that inevitably forecast error neither surprise new, concern per se always been. this far big forecast error i’ve see three decade game. but nonetheless useful see learn errors. the follow point prominent: • the term trade, two year ago assume fall, fact fall – 12 per cent low assume path. that mean national income lower, mean spend power lower. • the exchange rate, time parity u dollar, assume stay there, 25 per cent lower. it move direction term trade, normal. • the low exchange rate help produce contribution growth “net exports” much great early forecast, domestic demand much weaker. the latter mainly spread across non-mining business investment weak government spending, together soft consumption account low incomes. one thing different forecast two year ago mine sector capital spend fall sharply. • because net effect factor gdp growth weak side expectations, unemployment rate half percentage point high forecast two year ago. consistent that, growth wage is, would expect, low forecast. • headline inflation low forecast, largely recent fall oil prices. underlie inflation within 2–3 per cent range forecast. again, depreciation exchange rate factor here. • the cash rate 75 basis point low assume two year ago, monetary policy use room provide contain inflation try help growth. lend rate fall average 100 basis point period. this produce strong result house construction forecast also contribute rise dwell prices. in summary, economy several important respect follow different track one expect couple year ago. that partly condition world economy different expect partly several domestic factor different. some in-built response evidence. for example decline exchange rate, even much might expected, effect support growth keep inflation fall much might done. and, course, monetary policy also respond evolve situation, consistent reserve bank’s mandate. these response effect lessen extent growth inflation differ outcome expect two year ago, haven’t manage eliminate difference entirely, least case output growth. the slow wage growth response soft labour market condition also undoubtedly help hold employment up. in fact wage growth appear somewhat low previous relationship wage unemployment would suggest. this may sign increase price flexibility labour market could help explain employment recently look little high relative estimate gdp might expected. these hypothesis advance tentatively, though, data. bi central bankers’ speech 5 look ahead, recent forecast suggest growth rate similar observe recently yet. residential investment reach new high period ahead. household consumption expect record moderate growth. with national income growth reduce fall term trade, require modest decline save rate. it doesn’t seem reasonable expect much consumption growth that. resource sector investment good deal fall yet next two years. other area investment seem low i would expect would show sign strengthening, recent indication for, anything, weaken year ahead. public final spend grow fiscal consolidation still way run. under current macroeconomic conditions, would seem inappropriate government seek additional restraint near term. inflation likely remain low. growth labour cost low force push certain administer price start reverse. so even exchange rate fall further, view need to, seem unlikely problem excessive inflation. put together, thing stand, economy could demand growth next couple years. of course, forecasts. they might wrong. in fact, wrong, dimension other. our publish material go length articulate range “risks”. it easy think “downside” one current mood determine pessimism. but entirely impossible think upside one well. a fall exchange rate, assume forecasts, would add growth prices. if one think decline point likely, constitute “upside” risk. of course, list country would prefer low exchange rate long one can’t it. that so, might give think try create upside risk growth outlook policy initiatives. the reserve bank remain attune do, consistent various element mandate – include price stability, full employment financial stability. we remain open possibility policy easing, is, balance, beneficial sustainable growth. the temptation, course, presume outcome fine-tune policy set simply dial le demand short order avoid deviation ideal path. reality inevitably messy always kind fine-tune notions. a is, observer think monetary policy do little, others think already do way much. i think right circumstances. but big point monetary policy alone can’t deliver everything need expect much lead, time, much big problems. much effect monetary policy come spending, borrow save decision households. there isn’t much cause research, current data, expect direct impact business investment. but three broad sector – households, government corporation – household probably least scope expand balance sheet drive spending. that’s already decade ago. their debt burden, well service low arrears rates, already high. it reason i previously note reservation much monetary policy expect boost growth low low interest rates. it monetary policy entirely powerless, marginal effect may smaller, associate risk greater, low interest rate go already low levels. i think everyone see that. 6 bi central bankers’ speech if i correct this, really important policy coalesce around narrative growth. in regard, i think government right track seek compensate low revenue growth cut spend short run. of course, resolution long-run budget trend still go need sustain confidence easy conversation. meanwhile, often remarked, infrastructure spend role play sustain growth also generate confidence. i doubtful capacity deploy sort spend short-term countercyclical device. the evidence history take long start long stop. but would confidence-enhancing agree story long-term pipeline infrastructure projects, surround appropriate governance project selection, risk-sharing public private sector vary stage production ownership, appropriate price use finish product. the supplier would feel worth improve offer project one-offs. the financial sector would attract opportunity finance asset ownership. the real economy would benefit steady pipeline construction work – oppose boom bust. it would also benefit confidence improve efficiency logistics time result good infrastructure. amenity would improve million ordinary citizen daily lives. we could unleash large potential benefit present available congestion transportation networks. the impediment outcome financial. the fund would available, long term interest rate low ever see likely to. (and perfectly sensible public debt use fund infrastructure earn return. that borrow pay pension public servants.) the impediment decision-making process and, seems, inability find political agreement proceed. physical infrastructure is, course, part need. the confidence-enhancing narrative need extend skills, education, technology, ability freedom respond incentives, ability adapt willingness take risk. it area too, various initiative place planned, often get enough attention, need create positive dynamic confidence, innovation investment. that upside need create. bi central bankers’ speech 1 carolyn wilkins: panel remark round table discussion 21st conference montréal panel remark m carolyn wilkins, senior deputy governor bank canada, round table discussion 21st conference montréal: international economic forum americas, montréal, quebec, 8 june 2015. * * * introduction thank invitation today. i’m honour part panel. it’s seven year since global financial crisis began, we’re still cop aftermath. one consequence crisis disruption financial globalization. global capital flow – give one measure – fall half pre-crisis peak us$8 trillion.1 i’ll spend minute we’re see fragmentation. i’ll offer view realize full benefit financial globalization manage risk associate it. cause fragmentation the retreat financial globalization we’ve see reflect cyclical economic forces, slowdown global trade investment. it also reflect structural adjustments, include deleveraging undertake bank repair balance sheet respond regulatory changes. none come surprise, give we’ve through. on cyclical side, crisis cost world economy much us$10 trillion lose output, almost 15 per cent production. global trade slowed, demand international financial service support it. the share trade gdp fell crisis, reverse 20-percentage-point increase two decade precede it.2 on structural side, financial institution experience loss crisis repair balance sheet scale back lend – home especially internationally. trade, commodity infrastructure finance particularly hard hit. since crisis, bank double amount common equity capital hold. while this, bank tend focus home market best way allocate capital new environment. rule anti-money launder counter terrorism finance law may also alter terrain. financial institution also respond regulatory changes. for example, derivative dealer appear business domestic counterparties part stringent, sometimes inconsistent, rules.3 while level cross- 1 the institute international finance, “financial globalization: maximize benefits, contain risks”

perspective, total foreign bank claim measure share global gdp fall one-third since 2008, 39 per cent end 2014.5 this fragmentation concern people like me, believe open global financial market generally good thing economy facilitate efficient allocation capital boost growth. at time, crisis teach u integrate market also entail risk need properly managed. we know that, unchecked, financial globalization could increase pro-cyclicality make financial cycle larger.6 in words, boom bust could become frequent destabilizing. and it’s possible international financial flow inflate excessive growth finance relative global gdp.7 so authority find right balance encourage globalization guard risks. get right balance progress make globally. we put place framework good manage risk come financial globalization reform agree g-20 leaders. the basel committee bank supervision establish new rule banks, financial stability board (fsb) publish key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions. these big step right direction. some reform substantially implemented. i’m talk basel iii rules, impose stringent standard capital liquidity surcharge systemically important

consistent implementation different countries. at national level, recovery resolution regime introduce protect taxpayer minimize systemic disruption event domestic systemically important bank (d-sib) fails. canada make good progress put place g-20 reform spirit intended. we’ve implement basel iii ahead schedule start work recovery resolution plan d-sibs. some jurisdiction also make rule deliberately separate different part financial systems. for example, enact change ring-fence retail bank activity within bank group limit fund investment bank activity deposit back government safety

interconnect world, action one country affect others. if jurisdiction act national interest, narrowly defined, everyone could leave bad off. co-operative outcome superior. mutual recognition this point need coordination among regulators. the g-20 reform make world safe international capital flow long consistent implementation international standard mutual recognition among authorities. if fail achieve this, could end inconsistent incomplete regulation impede desirable flow create scope circumvention. canada stay away impose structural reform would create separation commercial investment bank activities, focus instead principles-based approach. historically, canadian bank benefit diversification business lines, consolidate supervision bank group office superintendent financial institution effective.8 a lot work remain international level. it hasn’t easy agree plan coordinate cross-border recovery resolution global systemically important bank (g-sibs), lack effort goodwill part home host authorities. one major step take october, 18 g-sibs agree protocol establish international swap derivative association give authority time organize orderly resolution trouble bank. the success mechanism depend broad adoption market participants, industry also responsibility here. if multilateral agreement prove intractable, bilateral agreement could another way reach goal, light trend toward regional banking. in time, successful bilateral agreement could even serve model ambitious multilateral agreements. conclusion let wrap up. the global financial system important canada. we’re small, open economy, highly dependent global trade. that mean rely cross-border financial flow fund export investment. and canadian bank continue increase foreign presence post-crisis period. in past five years, foreign claim rise 70 per cent. this canada push consistent implementation global rules. with homogeneous financial regulation good co-operation supervision, achieve solid prudential outcomes, build trust reduce tension contribute ring-fencing fragmentation. while still challenge international level, notably around resolution international banks, continue make progress. a reform agenda implemented, we’ll see improvement global financial flows. we probably won’t get back pre-crisis pace globalization. this pace probably unsustainable anyway. we nonetheless achieve close right balance sustainable growth financial stability. i’d like thank paul chilcott alexandra lai help prepare remarks. 8 m. zelmer, “promoting safe sound financial system: lesson goose that lay golden egg”

kganyago, governor south african reserve bank, swift regional conference, cape town, 5 may 2015. * * * chairperson, distinguish delegates, lady gentlemen; it honour welcome cape town, south africa occasion swift regional conference. “africa rise – seize opportunity” theme year’s conference. i think agree theme appropriate, africa bless abundant resource although face several challenges, far outweigh many opportunity continent offers. we acknowledge take advantage opportunity require strong political pan-african cooperation, however, numerous regional integration initiative take place continent testimony indeed possible. this 22nd swift african regional conference (arc) delegate include policy makers, industry leader broad financial community across african continent. the typical african regional conference attract 500 delegate around 40 countries, unique forum networking, education, discussion, debate – within collaborative environment. i believe discussion next three day focus, inter alia, intra- africa trade economic growth boosted, look african security market evolve growth plan african corporates expand across continent. the conference also focus leverage role technology innovation africa benefit financial industry support sustainable growth objective continent. from payment system environment, aware intra-africa payment past mostly facilitate correspondent bank arrangements, standard cross border payment globally. in practice, intra-africa payment effect correspondent bank relationship bank partner normally locate within usa europe. most correspondent bank arrangement still use extensively today, prove inadequate inefficient. across continent, several region launch initiative facilitate efficient transact mechanism within respective regions. the advantage initiative transact party control payments, within region. concern raise general reduction correspondent bank relationships, relate financial service globally. the driver reduction correspondent bank relationship clear, surmise regulation relate aml/cft increase number cross-border money remittance transfer company could contribute factor decline trend. in case money remittance companies, argue global bank may concern high risk uncertainty facilitate transaction unknown/non-vetted clients, especially emde’s1, term aml/cft2 rules. this raise potential fine reputational risk bank therefore reduce appetite exposure specific jurisdiction bank participate environment. there 1 emerge market develop economy (emdes). 2 aml – anti money laundering; cft – counter terrorist financing. 2 bi central bankers’ speech also potential downside decrease cross-border transactions. for example, well-known fact money remittance attract high costs, therefore likely small company would affect reduction global correspondent activity. in instances, would poor small commercial entity would vulnerable correspondent bank activity replace efficient reliable alternatives. regional solutions, implement payment system environment, go long way address constraint may introduce reduction correspondent bank services, well bring overall efficiency execution intra-regional cross border payments. i would like share development relate three regional initiative examples. in 2000, five country west africa (gambia, ghana, guinea, nigeria sierra leone) establish west african monetary zone (wamz). at time also set-up west african monetary institute (wami). liberia join 2010. the objective country establish west african monetary zone (wamz) monetary custom union common currency. initially propose introduce single currency 2003, subsequently agree launch new single currency 2015. a country represent conference, benefit update progress make initiative. the main objective wamz agree as: • promotion trade integration region; • trade financial facilitation; • harmonisation legislation statistics; • payment system macroeconomic convergence. the wami establish main body responsible creation common west african central bank single currency wamz. in east africa, east african community (eac) establish regional intergovernmental organisation republic burundi, kenya, rwanda, unite republic tanzania, republic uganda. the vision eac foster prosperous, competitive, secure, stable politically unite east africa. their mission widen deepen economic, political, social cultural integration order improve quality life people east africa increase competitiveness, value add production, trade investments. the treaty establishment east african community sign 30 november 1999 come force 7 july 2000. the republic rwanda republic burundi become full member community effect 1 july 2007. from payment system perspective, region achieve goal implement integrate payment infrastructure facilitate ease flow payment among participate member county know east africa payment system (eaps). the eaps secure, effective efficient fund transfer system enhance efficiency safety payment settlement within eac region. the system operate real time gross settlement basis utilise linkage various partner states’ real time gross settlement (rtgs) system use swift (society worldwide interbank financial telecommunication) message network safe secure delivery payment settlement message other. the eaps also facilitate cross border transaction essential boost intra-regional trade among east african countries. some benefit eaps: • real time fund transfers, safe efficient transfer large value payment bi central bankers’ speech 3 • finality irrevocability payment • increase accessibility eaps available commercial banks’ branch networks, • same-day settlement. this initiative indeed success worth celebrating. the southern african development community (sadc) establish development coordinate conference (sadcc) 1980 transform development community 1992. it inter-governmental organisation whose goal promote sustainable equitable economic growth socio-economic development efficient productive systems, deep co-operation integration, good governance durable peace security among fifteen southern african member-states. in process drive development objectives, region adopt regional indicative strategic development plan. in support plan, central bank within region work collaboration bank community launch payment system integration project culminate implementation sadc integrate regional electronic settlement system (siress). accord late data, implementation sire system result 43 per cent eligible intra-sadc cross-border south african rand payment participate nine country settle account regional bank hold sire system, instead via normal cross-border correspondent bank system. at relatively ‘early’ stage sire (implemented july 2013), high percentage cross-border transaction settle via sire system real time significant, could future even significant impact correspondent bank activity within sadc region. i take great pride able share sire reach zar 1 trillion settlement mark last week april 2015. we also recognise emergence regional solution siress, require regional authority resolve possible concern may arise regulatory requirement within business process flow ensure matter aml/cft exchange controls, exist, take care of. it hope development initiative lay solid foundation facilitate trade investment africa. leverage current infrastructure, efficient security market solution future infrastructure solution may contribute facilitate ease investment continent. the regional initiative also pave way achievement integration agenda whole continent i hope undertake separate regional initiatives, open standard adopt facilitate ultimate integration regional infrastructures. what africa need get various regional system interact settlement take place seamlessly across region. i also note aim leverage hands-on experience project africa, one session conference look rapid growth regional payment system lesson learn project could replicate regions. the regulatory session explore how, take proactive stance cop new financial regulations, move quickly adopt global best practice various field compliance address issue relate regulatory capital requirement lead competitive advantages. it also interest i gather first time, 2015 arc host african round swift innotribe start-up challenge. innotribe laudable initiative offer opportunity bring innovative idea fore foster discussion would enable practical solution emerge ideas. the start-up challenge bring together young african financial technology company across continent, introduce venture capitalist investors. the winner proceed compete grand 4 bi central bankers’ speech finale sibos 2015 conference schedule late year singapore. our continent surely

work ma rather interesting. • ma house one roof central banking, financial surveillance, integrate supervision. • ma also responsible develop sound progressive financial centre. mas’ single agency model set u apart financial regulators. many jurisdiction operate commonly know twin peak model regulation. under model, separate agency responsibility prudential oversight market conduct respectively. prudential oversight concern principally safety soundness institution market conduct focus effective function market consumer protection. australia, canada, uk among lead jurisdiction twin peak regulators. like black white bungalows, mas’ unique mandate central bank, integrate supervisor, promoter financial sector development, bear partly circumstance. for small country like singapore limit human capital, single agency model allow ma effectively utilise available expertise exploit synergy achieve objective financial sector wide economy. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and like blend british tropical theme bungalows, bring together central banking, integrate supervision, developmental function serf important practical purposes. first, integrate supervisor give u good insight full range activity financial institution engage hence facilitate holistic financial supervision. integrate supervision consistent broad range service financial institution provide well blur distinction across financial product see today. • bank offer client suite financial services, include investment insurance products. • insurance company offer financial plan solution incorporate element save deposit investments, addition protection. there synergy across prudential regulation market conduct regulation. market conduct issue provide useful perspective prudential safety soundness individual firms. how financial institution treat customer speak great deal corporate values, ethical standards, quality risk management internal controls. second, central bank financial regulator allow u harness synergy macroeconomic analysis financial stability oversight. during global financial crisis subsequent eurozone crisis, macroeconomic shocks, financial market stresses, institution-specific vulnerability interact complex way consequence systemic stability safety individual institutions. the two-way flow information share perspective central bank supervisory arm ma prove invaluable help u ass rapidly evolve situation coordinate appropriate policy response timely manner. have central bank financial supervision within one organisation way achieve good financial stability outcomes. it make sense small country like singapore. large jurisdiction seek outcome strengthen co-ordination mechanism among various agency whose work contribute financial stability. the financial stability oversight council u financial policy committee uk two good examples. third, financial regulator well promoter financial sector development help ensure regulation robust sensitive broad need economy. l doubt, financial stability override objective. but safe financial sector help meet need business individual support economic growth development miss purpose. sound regulation promote robust yet vibrant financial sector support wide need economy. our experience achieve good stability development outcome within one organisation share purpose rather separate agency possibly conflict goals. smart regulation – sound purposeful i would describe approach – least goal – smart regulation: regulation sound yet purposeful. ma seek three ways. • first, regulation align best international standard also appropriate risk domestic markets. bi central bankers’ speech 3 • second, regulation complement intensive supervision calibrate response accord risk profile impact individual institutions. • third, regulation focus outcome rather prescribe checklist implement way seek minimise compliance burden. align international standard appropriate domestic risk mas’ regulatory framework align global standard principles. indeed, play active role develop many standard active participation various international standard set bodies, include iais. global standard promote financial stability provide level play field financial institution minimise regulatory arbitrage. but financial market homogeneous risk profiles. it necessary apply regulatory standard manner

anita angelovska-bezoska: macedonia’s current macroeconomic landscape main challenge ahead speech m anita angelovska-bezoska, vice-governor national bank republic macedonia, economic financial dialogue economic reform program western balkan turkey, brussels, 12 may 2015. * * * dear ministers, dear representative european commission, european central bank eurostat, at beginning, let express gratitude european central bank, european commission eurostat assessment economic reform program period 2015–2017. let mention appreciate much dialogue eu institution overall feedback policy receive process believe highly beneficial regard preparedness join eu. at point, i would like address several important issue relate current macroeconomic landscape macedonian economy, well main challenge ahead. the growth momentum keep 2014, real gdp growth accelerate 3.8% p.a. a external environment sufficiently “growth-conducive”, strong performance domestic economy explain country-specific factors. firstly, reflection positive fundamental shifts, grow foreign investments, mainly tradable sector. they help economy gradually increase resilience, significantly increase diversification production export structure economy, also yield positive second-round effects, improve labor market conditions, increase know-how, integrate domestic supplier production process. secondly, economy impact favorably fiscal stimulus infrastructure, area continuously pinpoint weak spot, come structural competitiveness. hence, albeit fiscal impulse positive short run effect growth – bridge current “anemic external environment”, also affect long-term potential economy. the solid economic recovery significantly improve labor market conditions, increase labor demand, reduce unemployment, positively impact participation rate, also boost productivity growth economy. a largely export investment-led, solid growth create pressure external position economy, inflation. on contrary, external sector relatively good shape, current account deficit bring 1.3% gdp, hit low end average around 2% last five years. the incessant improvement current account, large extent reflect rise net-impact trade new foreign production facilities, particularly case 2014. yet, foreign demand start recover, positive shift traditional export segment also visible. of course, last year fall oil price also beneficial trade balance. on finance side, financial flow large enough cover current account deficit provide additional reserve accumulation. it important note fdi inflow continue flow economy, ratio gdp keep stable 3.3% gdp. yet, large part finance flow come government borrow international market, rather favorable terms, pinpoint perception investor sound fundamental rather prudent policy macedonian economy. observe inflation path, le resemble inflation pattern elsewhere, fall food energy price push price down. the average headline rate 2014 mildly negative (–0.3%), core inflation albeit slow down, average remain positive. the inflation adjustment perceive temporary, drive supply-side factors, without risk become entrench inflation expectation jeopardize 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic recovery. the fact negative output gap narrow fall price significantly slow first month year, support former notion. domestic finance bank sector significantly increase 2014, credit market recover much fast compare previous years. give bank system enter crisis sufficient capital liquidity buffers, credit flow economy fact never seized. yet, last year, backdrop economic recovery improvement overall risk perceptions, credit accelerate 10% annual basis, reflect supply demand credits. a notable rise allocation credit corporate sector compare previous year observed. hence, size structure credit growth supportive. the finance credit growth underpin solid rise deposit (10.4% p.a.), confirm yet reliance bank domestic source financing, rather cross-border flows, might quite volatile current juncture. an important point trend rise preference save domestic currency, continue 2014, reflect stable expectation reduce monetary policy burden. the bank sector remain stable sound, solid liquidity capital adequacy ratio 15.7% end 2014. non-performing loan bank remain moderate level crisis period, compare region. in 2014, relatively stable, slightly decrease 11.3% end year remain highly provisioned. the actual envisage economic recovery expect improve quality financial soundness borrowers, support downward path npls. yet, vigilance area important prevent buildup materialization systemic risk. last year exception term close monitor soundness bank system, change prudential regulation, appropriate balance need support private sector financing, maintain health bank system time. what monetary policy stance like 2014 give already elaborate economic financial conditions? in general, accommodative stance maintained. the main interest rate maintain historically low level, target measure support net-exporting electricity produce company extend end 2015, certain credit-supportive macro-prudential measure undertaken. this relatively loose stance maintain consequence “benign” external position, jeopardize foreign reserves, enable rather balance foreign exchange market year. low inflation also favor maintain accommodative stance. yet, room monetary policy accommodation appear largely exhausted. the outlook 2015–2016, le expect resemble state economy previous year. growth economy expect accelerate 4.1% 4.5% 2015 2016. the fundamental factor underpin growth dynamic remain same. the boost export investment expect new exist foreign companies, well envisage enter market. investment cycle expect strengthen continuation productive fiscal investments. a external demand envisage recover further, additional stimulus expect channel. the mention growth factor expect strengthen labor market disposable income households, hence boost private consumption well. the growth expectation provide room additional rise deposit potential bank system, accompany rise credit demand willingness bank lend, enable credit growth rate 9–10% period come. the inflation expect influence mainly global price primary commodity consumer price main trade partners. an average inflation 0.5% expect 2015, current forecast indicate reversal 2% 2016, reflect rise demand import prices. the structural improvement export sector expect continue 2015, along overall external recovery much low oil prices, envisage bring moderate current bi central bankers’ speech 3 account deficit bellow 1.6% gdp. in follow year, widen 3% expected, reflect fall private transfer import pressure new investment. the external finance needs, within current scenario, expect cover inflow foreign direct investment public borrow infrastructure purposes. the current forecast point rather stable external debt gdp ratio. no major pressure foresee follow two year foreign reserves, maintain adequate level. risk surround baseline macroeconomic scenario neglected. for us, small open economy, mostly come external environment main trade financial partners. although late monetary ease ecb downside risk euro zone growth le pronounced, general global growth risk balanced, still present materialized, could impact economy. additional source risk sharp sudden swing primary commodity prices, country like ours, change envisage economic profile large extent. a new, additional source risk current domestic political context, harm economy, tackle swiftly. of course, risk challenge closely monitored. this even pronounced, give policies’ space current juncture great extent exhausted. hence, continuation structural reform remain paramount challenge, increase resilience economy, mitigate risk reduce policy burden. for u emerge country, foreign bank presence, global financial regulatory reform also pose challenges, possibly stimulate deleveraging, reduce access finance finance flow private sector. at end, let also avail opportunity emphasize yet continuous effort align eu requirement area operation, especially bank regulation statistics, notwithstanding effort progress do fields. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview d standard interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, d standard, conduct mr andras szigètvari 10 june 2015 publish 13 june 2015. * * * standard: mr praet, role ecb change since outbreak crisis. you engage political debate, tell country reform implement. hasn’t ecb stretch mandate order maintain price stability? praet: a know, ecb take monetary policy decision achieve objective maintain price stability. we make voice hear structural reform consider necessary context mandate treaty. and, mario draghi indicate sintra, member monetary union, resilience crucial avoid shock lead permanent economic divergence time ‒ therefore direct implication price stability. in sense, different from, example, federal reserve unite states, would never engage debate. we frequently get advice concentrate core business ‒ monetary policy. but, currency union like euro area, individual country lose flexibility provide exchange rate own. they must thus become resilient crisis external shocks. sound governance effective institution key importance. that applies, among things, labour product markets, court administration. they need efficient monetary policy currency union therefore tell government structural reform important. here, interest country implement reforms, them. what interest u successful, impact monetary union whole. however, i would also like make self-critical comment that, past, message sound much like mantra. standard: what mean? praet: in several respects, country similar part monetary union, many respect differ result national conditions. so various combination structural reform work – “one-size-fits-all” model. we must make clear, otherwise may impression citizen don’t much choice. we must convey fact reform also allow diversity. for example, enough merely say publicly country’s labour market must become flexible. otherwise, people take mean become easy fire people. that wrong. in germany, example, dramatic contraction demand result 2008 crisis, firm get rid workers. union accept wage reduction short work hour prevent bad decline. thus, despite apparent rigidities, labour market respond flexible way. also, country wealthy stable without implement policies. the unite state sweden two good examples: labour market different there, people country still good standard living. standard: what you’re say sound good theory. but within troika, ecb always demand portugal greece weaken protection layoff soften collective wage agreements. there hasn’t really much room manoeuvre. praet: our job troika support eu commission work. that technical work and, end day, it’s eurogroup make political decision direction followed, since represent elect government therefore european taxpayers. it must also clear every political solution 2 bi central bankers’ speech feasible, social system must remain fundable. still, i hope that, future, great focus give country ownership reform programmes; act initiative take responsibility. standard: but possible really change country, it’s try make savings? praet: a crisis take effect, investors’ trust sustainability several countries’ debt eroded. the ensue adjustment public finance therefore implement look mainly short-term effects. frequently, public investment cut value-added tax raise order obtain quick debt reduction, even weigh growth prospects. at time, however, certain country reform successfully ‒ labour market become flexible bank restructured. that wasn’t easy also painful, grow again. standard: but even colleague say radical course austerity isn’t right medicine, example, case greece. praet: allow make general point: institutional standard many country face challenge particularly low. the world bank, also imf, issue well-known rank good governance solid institutions. these show clear correlation per caput gdp country position rankings. some country rank low term criterion relate good governance. competitiveness regain make cheap produce goods. however, long business environment remain unchanged, result satisfactory. this problem already touch upon first reform programmes. but little importance attach problem governance standards. standard: early on, talk “ownership”. but imply government believe reform measure shouldn’t implement them. praet: at end 1970s, i work economist imf. at time, request aid states, so-called “letter intent”, pre-written imf staff, send country imf letters. even though content outcome discussions, was, course, somewhat strange. but imf give money impose conditions, understand “ownership” then. i believe learn this. standard: but case greece, mean that, matter left-wing syriza government signs, can’t work long don’t believe themselves. praet: because ongoing negotiations, i won’t comment greece. fundamentally, mutual trust credibility critical importance situations. this mean country agree something, implement agreement. the credible country is, patient creditor trust show. that go countries: government trusted, doesn’t mean much agree figure reach exactly year. the problem lose confidence, situation become messy creditor immediately press results. standard: jean-claude trichet, former president ecb, active letter-writer: write letter ireland, threaten cut aid country didn’t accept aid programme agree reforms. he late exert pressure berlusconi government rome socialist spain. do go beyond ecb’s mandate? praet: i won’t comment letters. however, i would say that, outbreak financial crisis, euro area invest little institution would’ve available emergencies. consequently, institution deal bank crisis weak. bi central bankers’ speech 3 standard: independence important central banks. doe question also put differently public now: extent central bank allow get involve politics? praet: i would put way: sufficiently effective crisis management institution crisis erupted, ecb could simply ignore potential consequence bank crisis price stability. in light mandate, ecb couldn’t accept that. standard: the greek prime minister, alexis tsipras, say week would disaster country leave euro whole world would see euro reversible. how see it? praet: let reiterate mario draghi say ecb press conference week ago: govern council ecb want greece remain member euro. standard: mr praet, feel like thief? praet: a thief? standard: yes. that’s many people austria would describe you. after all, colleague ecb have, de facto, abolish interest rates. anybody put money save account hardly receive anything now. praet: i’m sure austrian feel confident monetary policy appropriate necessary reaction weak economic condition extraordinarily low inflation rates, far monetary policy objective below, close to, 2%. the low interest rate issue savers. however, them, nominal interest rate influence directly decisive, rather real interest rate – inflation deduct – count. in past, long period real interest rate significantly low today, simply inflation high. also, long run, crucial real income saver state economy. a central bank influence factor determine structural strength economy thus real, inflation-adjusted, interest rates. standard: that’s much help saver today. praet: in medium long term, monetary policy certainly help savers. we’re part help economy recover. this bring rate inflation back objective subsequently bring level interest rate back normal. therefore, low interest rate may short-term pain some, long-term gain all. everybody europe interest u get current situation, mark low inflation low growth. we succeed so. but crisis severe process take number years. standard: some economist say it’ll year interest rate higher. praet: there always cassandra speak badly everything… standard: cassandra right warnings. praet: yes, prophecy make people scar become self-fulfilling dangerous. standard: the ecb start buy government bond massive scale january 2016. have get proof quantitative ease programme take effect? praet: yes. the first effect give clear signal. when low interest rates, credit condition company country rapidly improved. now, quantitative ease background, loan firm government sector become significantly cheap overall. 4 bi central bankers’ speech standard: austria first country europe initiate bail-in, namely case hypo alpe adria. why don’t eu institution give support [this measure]? after all, it’s something that’s fight years. praet: we support bail-in clause eu’s bank resolution recovery directive. however, i cannot comment specific cases, come supervision single supervisory mechanism. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: remark cpmi’s 25th anniversary conference remark mr

cpmi contribute increase importance time. a always, i say represent view necessarily federal open market committee federal reserve system.1 the first trend development global financial system. this increase financial system interdependency and, hence, importance harmonize standard across national regulatory regimes. it also make important avoid regulatory arbitrage race bottom type behavior

competitiveness, madrid, 24 june 2015. * * * lady gentlemen, i appear committee occasion presentation banco de españa annual report 2014. let begin review development spanish economy, factor underpin recovery economic policy challenge strengthen recovery. i shall address aspect relate start-up bank union situation of, outlook for, spanish bank system. economic situation outlook in mid-2013, spanish economy initiate recovery phase firm last year continue 2015 date. in 2014, gdp grow rate 1.4% employment 1.2%, first positive figure since start crisis. in quarterly report publish tomorrow, banco de españa present new set macroeconomic projections. accord these, spanish economy grow rate 3.1% average 2015, upward revision 0.3 pp projection publish march. on basis change, activity perform good project three month back. follow quarter-on-quarter growth gdp 0.9% first quarter, late information indicate activity expect maintain strong rate expansion, whereby slight quicken output estimate second quarter, 1% quarterly terms. average growth first half year, annualised terms, thus expect around 4%. the projection rest 2015 next year point continue dynamism, spain clearly outpace euro area partners. however, momentum might slightly contain weaken expansionary impulses, fall oil price depreciation euro. for 2016, projection estimate average growth 2.7%, great uncertainty naturally accompany long time ahead involved. in term composition spending, recent phase recovery mark grow weight national demand, replace external demand main net contributor growth. foreseeably, near future, pattern continue, contribution external sector increase gdp practically neutral net terms. exports, particularly euro area, expect post high growth, tempo import slacken somewhat. turn prices, inflation, negative territory virtually since recovery began, undergo progressive correction since start year, stand –0.2% may rise energy component gradual pick-up core inflation. the decline price spain prove mark monetary union whole, mean inflation differential continue help bring ongoing improvement economy’s competitiveness. inflation might run moderately positive rate end 2015 owe combination several factors. firstly, progressive petering effect induce heavy fall oil price close stretch 2014 expect bring automatic rise energy component cpi close month year. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and further, depreciation euro impact non-energy good service prices. in event, persistence considerable slack economy, i.e. substantial unused capacity, mean mild recovery inflation rate next two year expected. the factor underpin growth the favourable growth outlook underpinned, all, restore macroeconomic equilibria. the progress make measure underpin allow confidence external investor spanish household firm restored. improve confidence also benefit change certain external condition factors, link ecb’s monetary policy progress economic monetary union, prompt ease finance conditions. on top transitory effects, link low level oil price depreciation euro. i shall continue analysis contain annual report, briefly review key factor behind recovery. budgetary consolidation firstly, regard public finances, general government deficit meet objective set european council (5.8% gdp) third year running. in 2014, fiscal policy le restrictive impact precede year le prominent condition factor macroeconomic developments. the reduction deficit 2014 come result great adjustment make central local government levels, since regional government exceed target set. the budgetary improvement also consequence similar-sized contribution revenue public spend (once impact financial assistance bank system strip spending). the tax take progressively pick year, step cyclical improvement change composition gdp. in turn, budgetary consolidation measure cyclical improvement economy bring decline public spending/gdp ratio, largely owe improvement spend interest debt discounted. interest payment proportion gdp hold similar level 2013, despite significant decline treasury’s finance costs, owe increase public debt. the public debt/gdp ratio rise 2014 97.7%, thereby meet forecasts. the late update stability programme (which confirm deficit target 2017) presage continue increase debt year 98.9% gdp, reduction commence 2016, although good growth project 2015 may improve projections. bi central bankers’ speech 3 private-sector deleveraging secondly, headway correct private-sector indebtedness. spanish household debt stand end-2014 71% gdp, 10 pp euro area average, 2010 20 pp it; non-financial corporations’ debt stand end last year 92% gdp, 8 pp euro area average, 2010 gap 35 pp. in come years, nominal growth economy make ready adjustment ease pressure still exert past debt new finance flows. indeed, new lend see expand 2014, continue open month 2015. labour market competitiveness thirdly, visible significant feature current phase recovery high rate job creation reduction unemployment almost half million people 2014. the pick-up employment partly relate firms’ great capacity adapt work condition cyclical competitive situation. this environment help usher period wage moderation adjustment relative cost relative euro area whole, largely explain gain competitiveness recently attain spanish economy. turn prices, annual report pay particular attention factor underpin recent disinflationary phase spain. the analysis conclude that, beyond influence prolong weakness spend fall oil price may had, great responsiveness price change economic situation, might attributed, least part, reform certain market services. retain great degree flexibility price- wage-setting vital that, face adverse shocks, adjustment may make relative price expense economic activity employment, traditionally occur spanish economy recent recessions. there likewise notably sharp correction external imbalance, external surplus attain past three years, albeit small amount 2014. nonetheless, correction international investment position (iip), debtor position equivalent 93.5% gdp close 2014, prove gradual, denote need maintain gain competitiveness achieved, improve current account balance reduce still-high level external debt. the role external condition factor let refer external condition factor recovery spanish economy. the world economy lose momentum 2014, particularly euro area. euro area growth weak second third quarter year thereafter begin show somewhat great strength. on occasion, moreover, germany france – area’s two big economy two big trade partner – also affected. the late ecb projection point moderate recovery, whereby area’s gdp expect grow 1.5% year 1.9% 2016. these are, then, clearly low rate project economy. other external development provide boost activity. i already mention fall oil prices. unquestionably, though, durable positive external impulse stem ecb’s monetary policy start-up bank union. 4 bi central bankers’ speech throughout last year 2015 date, ecb continue deepen expansionary monetary policy stance. once again, combine conventional measures, cut official interest rate place deposit facility negative territory, other, unconventional measures, new private-sector credit-linked lend programme launch ambitious plan purchase private- public-sector securities, expect run september 2016 and, event, inflation resume path keep medium-term objective, namely around 2% ecb. these expansionary monetary impulses, along expectation change u monetary policy stance interest rate increase federal reserve, depreciate euro reduce spanish economy’s finance costs. the market fragmentation cause crisis may consider reversed. such fragmentation hamper full transmission expansionary monetary measure economy. the start-up single supervisory mechanism (ssm), first step bank union, play important role process financial normalisation. the start-up single supervisory mechanism in november last year ssm commence operate and, since then, participation support national authorities, ecb take control bank supervision throughout monetary union. a prior step, ambitious comprehensive assessment european bank undertake 2014, whose positive result contribute increase investor confidence european bank system. a known, bank comfortably pass test, confirm favourable result restructure recapitalisation programme carry 2012 2013 agreement assistance eu partners. the comprehensive assessment significant euro area bank twin-pronged, entail asset quality review stress test determine banks’ resilience hypothetical adverse scenarios. the result obtain spanish bank favourable. first, i highlight fact spanish bank few adjustment make result asset quality review which, unlike stress tests, base hypothesis detail balance sheet review. a regard solvency, one bank stand slightly threshold set one part exercise and, event, bank already adopt capital-strengthening measure 2014 scale far exceed need cover shortfall identified. in course 2014, ecb national authority make significant effort address challenge pose adaptation new supervisory framework. in respect, make joint work easier, banco de españa reorganise directorate general bank supervision, create structure mirror ecb’s ssm. in 2015, first year operation, ssm define list priorities, bear mind environment main risk bank sector. these include notably profitability. european credit institution operate recent year adverse macroeconomic conditions. in market characterise low interest rates, bank margin subject downward pressure which, combine asset impairment losses, affect capacity obtain profits. one priority european supervision 2015 identify determinant profitability attempt detect aggressive strategy contrary financial stability. in prudential realm, one main challenge bank adapt strict capital requirement new basel iii solvency regime. the ssm, like banco de españa bi central bankers’ speech 5 previous years, issue recommendation prudence bank connection distribution dividends. in case, regard difficult economic bank situation 2013, dividend payment 25% profit broadly restricted; european supervisor’s recommendation impose restriction solely bank face tight situation term solvency. one priority matter review national discretionality option permit european solvency regulations, order harmonise legislation applicable ssm-supervised banks. the review begin recently jointly tackle ecb national competent authorities. the second element bank union, prepare 2014 view entry force 2015, single resolution mechanism (srm), establish common european framework restructure resolution credit institutions. the aim is, case arise, provide management situation bank non-viability preserve stability financial system, minimise public financial support, safeguard depositor ensure continuity critical economic function bank question. all forego might influence management bank balance sheet particular bear composition liabilities, part must eligible absorb loss recapitalisation. the srm comprise two elements: single resolution board single resolution fund. the latter, mean contribution bank sector, expect amount €55 billion 2024. in national arena, recently approve legislation recovery resolution credit institution investment service firm distinguish pre-emptive resolution functions, correspond banco de españa case credit institution national security market commission (cnmv) investment service firms, enforcement resolution functions, attributable fund orderly restructure bank sector (frob), sit moreover srm board, banco de españa observer status. performance credit institution 2014 before concluding, i shall review recent performance spanish credit institutions. the year 2014 saw improvement financial condition recovery activity employment. lend resident private sector spain continue shrink 2014, line need deleveraging spanish economy; said, rate decline lend ease (from 8.3% 2013 6.4% 2014). at firm engage construction real estate activities, credit fell much less, shift negative rate 9% 2013 still-negative rate 1.5% 2014. the figure available 2015 suggest year conclude credit run rate change close zero positive territory first time since 2009. one key aspect 2014 fact non-performing loan (npls) resident private sector fell absolute term (by €24 billion) term npl ratio, decline almost 1 pp 12.9%. in 2015 date, trend holding, npls fall 12.3%. resident private-sector refinance exposure fall 4.5% account 14% total, proportion still highly influence forbear exposure real estate development construction companies. it also worth point household non-financial corporation change composition save response low interest rate environment, mean bank deposit decline unit investment fund increase significantly. 6 bi central bankers’ speech spanish banks’ attribute profit 2014 increase close 34%, continue recovery initiate 2013. despite backdrop decline credit low interest rates, net interest income rise almost 5% owe finance cost fall swift pace return financial products. also, containment operate expense decline asset impairment loss contribute improvement results. however, persistence environment low interest rate presence significant volume non-productive asset continue bear income statement. that lead bank reflect sustainable business model, involve application new technologies, new activity office staff structure good tailor attain model. in december 2014, top-quality common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio bank stand 11.8%. this ratio rise 13.6% total capital. both figure amply exceed regulatory minimum levels. even standard schedule force 2018 – basel iii become fully applicable – applied, percentage would remain minimum level (9.9% 12.1%, respectively). moreover, recourse bank eurosystem fund continue fall. notwithstanding positive assessment, spanish bank must continue strengthen capital loss-absorption capacity order withstand new macroeconomic environment, heighten competition new, demand complex regulatory framework. conclusion overall, outlook spanish economy improve recent period. it degree vulnerability potential shock progressively diminish headway make correct imbalances, strengthen economic activity generate employment. nonetheless, effect crisis serious condition economy’s growth capacity short medium term. accordingly, economic policy measure gear shore foundation recovery see correction imbalances. the cyclical situation euro area spain mean maintenance demand-side policy mix supportive recovery foreseeable. in case monetary policy, commitment assume ecb, i refer earlier. and case budgetary policy, adhere fiscal consolidation path compatible progressively le contractionary neutral contribution public sector growth. in current economic circumstances, continue necessary complement measure reform aim enhance competitiveness low obstacle rapid absorption unemployment. such action take particular significance situation like present aggregate level debt economy still high gain competitiveness come le propitious environment, give low inflation euro area envisage low growth productivity. reduce unemployment, high rate despite favourable development social security registration reduction register unemployment, remain major economic policy task. in connection, wage bargain must allow different situation different firm sector take account, avoid far possible return now-superseded wage indexation practices. considerable progress make correct fiscal imbalance, without forget constraint high level public debt imposes. in short medium run, bi central bankers’ speech 7 perseverance fiscal consolidation basis growth-conducive revenue spend mix ensure compliance budgetary stability law unavoidable. i like conclude think challenge pose long-term growth spanish economy. in spain, country affected, crisis large-scale impact level output, result sizeable capital job destruction. the future growth spanish economy influence manage overcome effects, also capacity raise productivity, whose low pace growth continuously affect us. against background, vital continue deepen reform boost investment, low obstacle competition remove barrier prevent suitable reallocation productive resource towards firm sector high growth potential. the annual report conclude barrier outcome various factors: inappropriate regulations, small firm-size, limit regional sectoral job mobility, degree educational mismatch labour supply demand, insufficient innovative capacity. overcome constraint call response always straightforward simple either technical political terms. but stress reform bring positive synergy expansionary monetary policy pursue ecb, even short term, owe impact growth expectations. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: of credit capital – need efficient resilient financial system? speech dr jens weidmann,

something here. that something pretty fundamental insight: every economic decision involve trade-off need factor decision. a such, economic decision-making weigh benefit costs, strike delicate balance. take central banks, instance. the task monetary policy find interest rate neither choke economy cause overheat. only balance inflation low stable – usually central bank’s mandate. economist knut wicksell term rate “natural rate interest”. and strike right balance core challenge regard another central bank function well – role lender last resort. overly restrictive provision liquidity time financial turmoil might fail quell upheaval – possibly cause conflagration. but provide much liquidity long might end cause problem well. if non-viable bank keep life support central bank money, go make evergreen loan non-viable company – situation heighten risk future problem bank system. and liquidity channel towards sovereign find otherwise hard access markets, run risk blur line monetary fiscal policy. greece case point here. the emergency liquidity assistance (ela) – originally conceive temporary source liquidity financially sound bank return good collateral – provide protract period

doubt is. besides balance monetary policymakers strike, another state balance count maintain price stability – well-balanced financial system. 2. credit capital: competition complementarity? let u close look relationship bank-based finance market-based financing. doe one detract other, one deliver benefit one come short? to put succinctly: be credit capital competitive complementary? the debate superiority bank-based market-based financial system decades, century old.1 one notable development spark debate difference growth germany uk late nineteenth early twentieth centuries. some argue pre-eminence bank close relationship client facilitate rapid growth germany’s manufacture industry. others point manufacture growth germany faster, overall growth rate broadly same. similar argument make today. in general, proponent bank-based system argue bank good suit deal information asymmetries, long-standing tie client allow glean information firm managers. this information lead efficient capital allocation good corporate governance. the long-standing tie bank client deliver quality information exclusively bank. naturally, incline keep information itself. in contrast, finance via capital market quickly disseminate information firms, joseph stiglitz2 point out. this may, however, stunt incentive individual investor acquire private information soundness creditors. proponent market-based system make opposite claim: large liquid financial market strengthen rather weaken incentive gather information firm, information use grand scale.3 and rather banks’ use private information firm channel resource productive, might use information shield exist client competition.4 at first sight, two view seem irreconcilable. on close inspection, though, contradiction begin disappear – regardless one take perspective individual firm broad macroeconomic view. 1 levine, r.

sverige riksbank macroprudential conference, stockholm, sweden, 24 june 2015. * * * it’s pleasure take part riksbank macroprudential conference i thank organizer invite participate conference, particularly panel stress testing. stress test become cornerstone new approach regulation supervision large financial institution unite states. the federal reserve’s first supervisory stress test supervisory capital assessment program, know scap. conduct 2009 depth financial crisis, scap mark first time u.s. bank regulatory agency conduct supervisory stress test simultaneously across large bank firms. the result clearly demonstrate value simultaneous, forward-looking supervisory assessment capital adequacy stress conditions. the scap also key contributor relatively rapid restoration financial health u.s. bank system. the fed’s approach stress test large systemic financial institution evolve since scap, several key element persist day.1 these element include, first, supervisory stress scenario applicable firms; second, define consequence firm deem insufficiently capitalized; third, public disclosure results. the feed subsequently conduct five stress test exercise build success scap, make important improvement stress test processes. the first key innovation development supervisory model process allow feed evaluate independently whether bank sufficiently resilient continue lend consumer business adverse economic financial conditions. this innovation take place course several exercise make possible extensive collection data banks. these data allow supervisor build model sensitive stress scenario good define riskiness firms’ different business exposures. the second innovation since scap use supervisory stress test key input annual supervisory evaluation capital adequacy large bank hold companies. the crisis demonstrate importance forward-looking supervision account possibility negative outcomes. by focus forward-looking post-stress capital ratios, stress test provide assessment firm’s capital adequacy complementary regulatory capital ratios, reflect firm’s performance date. although view new approach capital assessment significant improvement previous practices, aware true test new regime come another period significant financial economic stress materialize-which say strong test effectiveness stress test stress test undergo real world stress test. the comment, mutatis mutandis, apply overall change method bank regulation supervision make since september 15, 2008. 1 the dodd-frank act require feed conduct supervisory stress test bank hold company $50 billion total consolidate assets, nonbank financial company designate financial stability oversight council (fsoc) feed supervision. 2 bi central bankers’ speech third, supervisory stress test lead edge movement toward great supervisory transparency. since scap, feed steadily increase transparency around stress test processes, methodologies, results. before crisis, release unfavorable supervisory information particular firm unthinkable-for fear set run banks. however, release scap result help calm market crisis reduce uncertainty firm solvency. indeed, one 10 firm deem capital shortfall unable close identify gap private markets. our experience date transparency around stress test exercise improve credibility exercise create accountability firm supervisors. that said, much transparency also potentially negative consequences, idea i turn shortly. with benefit five year experience, feed continue ass stress test program, make appropriate changes. example change date include assumption default firm’s large counterparty assumption firm would curtail lend consumer businesses, even severely adverse conditions. a part assessment process, also currently seek feedback industry, market analysts, academic program. supervisory stress test static exercise must adapt change economic financial environment must incorporate innovation model technology. work currently underway adapt stress test framework accommodate firm traditionally subject tests. the dodd-frank act require feed conduct stress test non-bank financial institution designate systemically important fsoc-the financial stability oversight council. three currently designate financial institution global insurance companies. while distress firm pose risk financial stability, particularly stressful period, certain source risk firm distinct risk bank organization face. a key aspect ongoing work include adapt current stress test framework scenario ensure test non-bank sifis-systemically important financial institutions-are appropriate. another area work continues-and likely always continue-is fed’s ongoing research aim improve ability estimate loss revenue stress. supervisor develop new approach push state art stress test respond new model technique develop firm activity risk concentration evolve time. for example, forecast particular bank’s revenue may respond severe macroeconomic recession challenging, continue seek way enhance ability so. supervisory stress test model methodology evolve time order good capture salient emerge risk financial firm system whole. however, framework cannot simply expand include aspect reality. for example, incorporate feedback financial system distress real economy complex difficult model challenge. whether recognize not, standard solution complex model challenge simplify-typically minimum extent possible-aspects overall model framework. however, incorporate feedback stress test framework may require simplify aspect framework point le able capture risk individual institutions. even so, one imagine substantial gain continue research stress testing’s role macroprudential supervision understand risk financial system, knock-on effects, contagion, fire sales, interaction capital liquidity crisis. finally, let close address question often arise use supervisory stress test, conduct fed, common scenario bi central bankers’ speech 3 models. such test may create possibility of, former chairman bernanke’s words, “model monoculture,” model similar miss key risks.2 such culture could possibly create vulnerability financial system. at feed try address issue, part, appropriate disclosure supervisory stress test. we publish information overall framework employ various aspect supervisory stress test, full detail bank could use manage test. this-making easy game test-is potential negative consequence transparency i allude earlier. we also value different approach design scenario conduct stress tests. in unite states, addition supervisory stress testing, large financial firm require conduct stress tests, use model stress scenario capture unique risks.3 in evaluate bank’s capital plan process, supervisor focus well banks’ internal scenario model capture unique risk business models. we expect firm determine risk inherent businesses, risk-appetite, make business decision basis. and good place stop. thank you. 2 ben s. bernanke (2013), “stress test banks: what have we learned?“ speech deliver “maintaining financial stability: hold tiger tail” financial market conference sponsor

rodrigo vergara: chile’s march 2015 monetary policy report presentation mr rodrigo vergara, governor central bank chile, monetary policy report finance committee honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 30 march 2015. * * * the monetary policy report march 2015 find http://www.bcentral.cl. accompany chart find central bank chile’ website. introduction mr. president finance committee senate, senator andrés zaldívar, senator member committee, ladies, gentlemen, i grateful invitation present vision board central bank chile recent macroeconomic developments, prospect implication monetary policy. this vision detail monetary policy report (ipom) march 2015. but first foremost, word solidarity towards fellow citizen recently suffer nature’s wrath. the image story receive catastrophe sweep across country’s north devastate fill u concern. in past months, inflation exceed december’s forecasts, stubbornly 4 percent. this report’s baseline scenario also estimate slow return target range foresee end 2014. the depreciation peso continue main factor behind price dynamics, which, couple widespread indexation tight expect labor market, push core measure, i.e. cpi exclude foodstuff energy, cpiefe, 4.3 4.7 percent annually november february. however, low oil price international market pass-through domestic price help moderate annual growth cpi inflation, go 5.5 percent november 4.4 percent february (figure 1). recent inflation figure take market surprise, assume clearly downward position respect behavior prices, even prediction december report. thus, market expectation inflation end 2015 revise somewhat 3 percent, inflation one year out. expectation two year remain anchor 3 percent (figure 2). on contrary, output expenditure evolve forecast december. again time baseline scenario i share moment foresee gradual recovery gain strength towards second half year. consistently scenario board’s statement, market expectation monetary policy rate (mpr) rule new cut and, cases, point cycle increase begin late year. in follow i describe macroeconomic scenario believe likely come quarters, associate risks. macroeconomic scenario the external environment relate risk remain largely determine impend monetary normalization process unite states. change expectation fast finally occur affect world financial market significantly. by contrast, eurozone develop emerge economies, monetary policy become expansionary, largely respond low inflation figure low 2 bi central bankers’ speech medium-term inflation outlook. such scenario quite opposite see chile latin america general. the eurozone show stable output trajectory towards end 2014, drive germany. preliminary first-quarter figure suggest germany continue lead bloc. it also worth mention 2014 spain post positive gdp figure three year recession. meanwhile, italy france continue show meager results. all all, past month region’s growth prospect improved. in baseline scenario, expect eurozone grow 1.5 percent year, 1 percent december. still, risk relate political situation, especially may happen greece. about latin america, mark deterioration region’s economies, compound low commodity price countries, public private expenditure imbalances. so main economy region grow average nearly 4 percent 2010 2013, 2014 barely grow 0.7 percent 2014 expect grow 0.8 percent year. by countries, big correction go brazilian forecast, market expect post gdp drop 0.7 2015, bad several years. the great relative strength unite states, plus ever close begin monetary policy normalization, prompt substantial appreciation dollar recent quarters. for sure, news situation u economy plus fed’s statement cause important swing dollar price past weeks. this reflect large movement currency around world. a chilean peso, middle march trade 640 unit dollar, late drop near 620 peso per dollar statistical cutoff report (figure 3). the peso depreciation cycle begin 2013 stand long last decade occur context gradual economic slowdown sharp recession. this one main reason behind inflation remain 4 percent. the data indicate pass-through coefficient exchange rate inflation line historic patterns, although upper part available estimates. besides, peso depreciation different time emerge commodity export economies. the early adjustment chilean economy, term private expenditure monetary policy reaction, mean large part 2014 currency one depreciate globally. subsequently, rest emerge economy enter mark adjustment cycle, difference narrow peso even appreciate multilateral term (figure 4). a march, real exchange rate somewhat average last two decade (figure 5). domestic activity behave foresee december, although last year close somewhat high growth forecast previous report: 1.9 percent. revision early figure somewhat strong fourth-quarter growth explain result. partial first-quarter figure continue reveal moderate growth, definitely good figure show since mid- 2014. on demand side, big news either respect end last year. aside specific factors, consumption investment remain weak. durable consumption investment machinery equipment continue grow low negative annual rates, albeit marginal stability. anyway, worth note great impulse fiscal spending, particularly public investment, positive effect peso depreciation productive performance tradable sectors. the labor market continue show strength previously foreseen. the unemployment rate, despite marginal increase, still low. annual growth salaried employment pick recent months, although job creation cycle-sensitive sector remain slow. meanwhile, nominal wage continue grow strong pace, partly generally index past inflation (figure 6). although low bi central bankers’ speech 3 level unemployment seem conflict state business cycle, structural factor might explain unemployment rate historic averages, change demographic composition labor force (figure 7). turn projections, baseline scenario gdp grow 2015 2014 stand 2.5 3.5 percent, different december forecast. in projection, gdp growth remain medium-term growth estimate, place 4 4.5 percent. the baseline scenario also assume first half year economy post growth rate near average past months, recovery process become visible towards year’s end. growth final domestic demand – without inventory – revise downward december projection. this, slow expect recovery private consumption investment, particularly import components. with this, total domestic demand growth drop 2.5 percent annually. in case private consumption, also reduction durable good consumption due peso depreciation slow growth real wage associate upward revision inflation forecast. a investment, downward correction survey capital good corporation investment plan 2015. thus, measure real terms, gross fix capital formation 23.7 percent gdp year. in projection, gross national save rise 21.5 percent gdp 2015, reflect increase private save past quarters. this great national save drive reduction current account. accordingly, estimate year near 0 percent gdp (table 1). on external front, projection assume trade partner grow two-year period 2015–2016 previous years. the term trade improve, help drop oil prices, whose impact partly outdo downward adjustment copper price. the baseline scenario assume copper trade average 280 dollar cent per pound 2015–2016. in period, brent oil average 62 dollar per barrel wti oil, 55 dollar per barrel (table 2). another element contribute domestic output demand resume great growth monetary policy continue add significant boost economy, help keep medium- long-term interest rate near record low (figure 8). likewise, foresee fiscal policy contribute expenditure growth significantly year, especially increase public investment. a usual, projection rely number assumptions, important one consumer business expectation recover. recent data show slight revision upward indicators, still clearly pessimistic nonetheless. meanwhile, information gather business perception report quarterly publication bank, point moderate performance business 2015, investment plan primarily focus capital replenishment. turn inflation, baseline scenario cpi stay 4 percent annually months, approach 3 percent course 2016. for cpiefe, prefer measure core inflation, forecast 2015 revise expect approach 3 percent 2016 stay neighborhood end projection horizon (figure 9). this trajectory assume pass-through peso depreciation recent month price stand upper part historic patterns; real wage adjust line productivity; capacity gap persist projection horizon. for real exchange rate, forecast us methodological assumption remain similar current value, consider within range believe consistent state business cycle long-term fundamentals. about monetary policy rate, statistical cutoff report market expectation show difference 4 bi central bankers’ speech expect path 2015. the survey indicate mpr would remain 3 percent throughout year, rise 2016. meanwhile, price financial asset suggest raise second half 2015. a work assumption, mpr assume follow trajectory somewhat implicit survey (figure 10). a usual projections, baseline scenario reflect event estimate likely occur information hand close report. there risks, however that, materialized, may reshape macroeconomic scenario and, therefore, may alter course monetary policy. abroad, several element might trigger new episode volatility world financial markets, significant effect credit costs, currency parity short-term inflation outlook. on one hand, important surprise regard time speed federal reserve raise benchmark rate may cause significant volatility global financial markets, push interest rate appreciate dollar. in scenario, one cannot rule that, additionally, observe abrupt portfolio rebalancing, give low level long-term interest rate high stock price unite states. although late statement federal reserve attenuate possibility drastic changes, risk still present. on hand, situation emerge market enduring, macroeconomic scenario could complicate commodity continue trade low prices. this risk important latin america, compound complex economic political factors. furthermore, several country region, fiscal current-account deficit persist, make necessary adjustment difficult costly. this case chile, policy framework allow timely macroeconomic adjustment last year half. and let’s forget geopolitical conflict middle east part europe, sadly live quite time. in europe, greek situation quirk characterize agreement finance debt. on positive side risks, could also happen recovery strong eurozone, could mean strong boost world economy chile. in addition, possible effect drop oil price large project also price remain low longer. finally, still risk associate low growth china consequence price copper. the state chinese financial system real estate sector continue draw attention. at home, main risk evolution inflation, mainly unrelenting exchange rate depreciation accumulate effect costs. this, context margin seem narrow high annual growth nominal wage limit pass-through low fuel price sectors. therefore, materialization external risk scenario trigger significant additional depreciation peso may substantial effect short-term inflation outlook, depend state business cycle. on hand, also possible that, despite recent improvement domestic expenditure output compare previous quarters, private expectation improve sufficiently stimulate spending, especially investment. conversely, scenario expectation recover strongly expect would allow dynamic economic activity. the happen increase national income great effect expenditure context comfortable external accounts. after evaluate risks, estimate that, although local risk moderated, risk balance still downward bias output, risk balance inflation unbiased. let share final think now. bi central bankers’ speech 5 final think lately, chilean economy respond big change local external environment, make major adjustment. domestic spend go annual average growth 8 percent 2011 2012, 3.7 percent 2013 decline 0.6 percent 2014, significant contraction last year spend import goods, especially durable consumption investment machinery equipment. this help current account deficit, mid-2013 think around 5 percent gdp drop 1.2 percent gdp past year project nearly attain equilibrium 2015. beyond discussion shock trigger adjustment, clear process sound, evidenced, example, behavior labor market, unemployment rate time never exceed 6.5 percent. i doubt country’s economic policy framework play fundamental role this. a strong, well regulate bank system permit credit continue flow dynamically activity needed. our fiscal policy base rule determine public expenditure see past cyclical up downs, allow significant spend program carry without jeopardize public finances. from central bank contribute smooth cycle, aggressively opportunely reduce monetary policy rate 200 basis points, thus help drive medium- long-term interest rate near record lows. last least, free float exchange rate system permit exchange rate depreciate nearly 11 percent real term respect trough 2013, help adjust current account favor competitiveness export sector. the say go obvious talk about, talk forgotten. so i think relevant, especially environment time become overwhelmingly pessimistic, stress well equip economy deal adverse situations. i think comparison economy continent, also suffer brunt fall price commodities, revealing: high current account deficit several show fiscal situation worry say least. in many them, high level dollarization currency mismatch financial sector, restrict room exchange rate adjustment force authority use le efficient instrument achieve goals. chile’s reality different: economy’s adjustment occur sooner country rapidly deeply. this situation allow u look come year peace mind. in context, project december, output growth tend stabilize around 2.5 percent annually, low, line baseline scenario increase gradually year. true, baseline scenario contemplates, among assumptions, dynamism accompany improve agents’ expectations. a say before, sensitive point require u cooperate. we must also bear mind terrible natural disaster hit north country effect output figure release come months, moment guess able ass time go by. moreover, well know, every adjustment process costs. in case, main associate cost high inflation. in recent month inflation exceed forecast estimate remain 4 percent long time, strongly influence depreciation peso, great persistent previously thought. thus, although understand high inflation part adjustment process i describe above, i want clear current level exceed estimates, inflation upper limit tolerance range several month row situation leave u satisfied. this i hereby reiterate unwavering commitment central bank board safeguard price stability, commitment involve introduce change monetary 6 bi central bankers’ speech policy deem necessary inflation converge target level within projection horizon. in baseline scenario, foresee exchange rate stabilize effect price decrease, allow inflation slowly converge target level. other factor contribute inflation’s convergence widen capacity gaps, economy continue grow potential still time, price effect indexation tax reform tend lose significance. additionally, global environment reduce inflation incidence dollar price import good also contribute slow growth prices. a work assumption, projection assume guarantee inflation’s convergence, mpr slightly survey imply. accordingly, likely scenario additional cuts. so, toward year’s end debate best time begin normalize monetary impulse. of course, present inflationary trend end deep persistent expected, debate could anticipated. the opposite happen trend prove mild foreseen. i would like finish recall year bring major change world economy. on one hand, aftermath 2008–2009 crisis main central bank world adopt unconventional policy cheer ail economies, flood world unprecedented level liquidity thus increase price financial assets. today, start u monetary policy normalization around corner, intensify divergence develop economy whose cycle behind. meanwhile, year seemingly endless increase commodity prices, see so-called super cycle commodity wear out, it, boom investment income experience good part past decade. these two situation pose major challenge emerge economy chile particular. in short term, likely see increase financial volatility, include unusual fluctuation exchange rate. this may complicate inflation outlook, least short term, inflation closely link fluctuation nominal exchange rate short periods. the effect situation increase volatility inflation trajectory long terms, certainly important monetary policy, difficult predict, depend many factors, cyclical state economy expectations, carefully ass make decisions. certainly challenge transition face u with. we need flexible economy allow redirect resource rapidly efficiently sector lose appeal gain it; financial system able weigh risk help new venture thrive; must double effort improve productivity, on. the good news is, i mentioned, appropriate macroeconomic policy framework confront change external environment economy that, make significant adjustments, free significant imbalances. this i believe that, never forget small open economy therefore ever expose external shocks, look future confidence. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: comment

exchange rate low negative interest rate 15 january. the swiss stock market experience price correction, loss rapidly recouped. at present, smi roughly level start year. thus swiss share benefit generally favourable mood among investors. since begin 2015, major share index record gain – albeit vary degrees. on international bond markets, exceptional price movement record past months, show

15% period. another important issue financial market increase uncertainty due unresolved debt problem greece. despite fact risk attitudes, such, positive, demand safe investment thus swiss franc remain particularly strong. consequently, recent movement swiss franc influence divergence dollar euro regions, also persistent safe flows. the discontinuation minimum exchange rate lead substantial short-lived appreciation swiss franc. the extent appreciation show chart 3. the extreme movement exchange rate accompany sharp increase volatility swiss franc foreign exchange market. since then, swiss franc volatility declined, although remain high long-term comparison period prior financial crisis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech at time, bid-ask spreads, i.e. difference best purchase sell offers, widen substantially follow end minimum exchange rate. these, too, decline past months, although bid-ask spread remain relatively large. in trade-weighted terms, swiss franc long extreme level prevail immediately discontinuation minimum exchange rate. however, still 12% level begin year. thus, swiss franc still substantially overvalued. implementation impact negative interest exactly six month ago, 18 december 2014, swiss national bank (snb) decide impose negative interest sight deposit account balance snb first time, set rate –0.25%. when discontinue minimum exchange rate, low rate 0.5 percentage points, –0.75%. by impose negative interest sight deposits, snb intend move three-month libor negative territory significantly reduce interest rate money capital markets. the low interest rate make much le attractive hold swiss franc compare currencies. this lead weaken swiss franc time. how negative interest rate apply i would like take moment remind negative interest rate applied. it impose sight deposit account balance bank financial market participant hold snb exceed give exemption threshold. for domestic banks, exemption threshold 20 time statutory minimum reserve requirement. for non-banks foreign-domiciled bank (which subject minimum reserve requirement), fix exemption threshold least chf 10 million set. the cumulative exemption threshold come chf 300 billion. this mean that, current sight deposit amount chf 455 billion, approximately chf 155 billion subject negative interest. to date, interest due amount total around chf 100 million per month. the exemption threshold take account high level liquidity bank system, due snb’s past intervention foreign exchange market. the exemption calculate ensure remain virtually unchanged time. this mean interest burden increase soon snb fee liquidity system – particular event foreign exchange interventions. consequently, snb’s readiness remain active foreign exchange market negative interest rate two mutually reinforce measures. by impose negative interest sight deposit exceed give exemption threshold, set incentive entire financial system give preference investment foreign currency swiss francs, thereby limit new inflow swiss currency. since exceptional demand swiss franc foreign also domestic, economic argument differentiate origin investor. what more, reduce minimum number exception obligation pay negative interest. impact negative interest six month announcement negative interest, see measure desire effect money capital markets. the money market work well, even negative interest. money market interest rate react rapidly, three-month libor settle middle range targeted. this show marginal cost – cost additional unit swiss franc liquidity – relevant transmission interbank market. although trade activity money market remain low financial crisis, revive somewhat. for instance, turnover bi central bankers’ speech 3 secure money market, particular swiss franc repo market, rise since introduction negative interest. a intended, negative interest transmit money market capital market. the low interest rate maturity widen traditional interest rate differential country somewhat. previously, narrow substantially. on money capital markets, interest rate differential great without negative interest, particular short-term interest rates. chart 4 show path interest rate three-month loan swiss franc euro money markets, together differential. the great interest rate differential help ensure swiss franc investment le attractive investment euro currencies. moreover, rise interest rate differential increase cost hedge foreign currency position forward exchange market, additional factor dampen swiss franc demand. although interest rate differential risen, still considerably long-term average, particularly since interest rate abroad decrease substantially financial crisis switzerland. this see chart 5, show example interest rate differential germany switzerland three-month, two-year, five-year ten-year maturities. while interest rate money capital market decline result negative interest, mortgage rate decrease extent. indeed, mortgage long terms, rate slightly high begin year. the main reason divergence major part bank refinance cost consist interest pay save deposits, fall zero interest rate money market. because interest save deposit significantly high money market interest rate, bank interest margin come pressure hedge interest rate risk associate mortgage business, mortgage rate increased. fear negative interest might contribute significant decline mortgage rate and, turn, strong growth mortgage lend far prove unfounded. for investors, contrast, current low interest rate environment mean challenge increased. it even difficult find yield-bearing investments. i emphasise, however, investment predicament international phenomenon limit swiss franc alone. conclusion i come conclude remarks. initial experience show interest rate instrument also effective negative territory. a intended, negative interest sight deposit snb rapidly transmit segment money capital markets. in current situation, negative interest fulfil important monetary policy purpose: help correct overvaluation swiss franc time. bi central bankers’ speech 1 javier guzmán calafell: the normalization monetary policy unite state – challenge emerge market

effects. third, one take “leaning wind” view monetary policy, play role temper financial cycle misallocation resource often come it. but monetary policy already play part euro area, i want dwell topic today. i focus instead area still create condition sustainable long-run growth – is, structural reform euro area. the main point i would like make follows. for many euro area country structural reform central high long-run growth. and economy achieve turn critical efficient implementation monetary policy and, time, integrity monetary union. but “one size fit all” model country go tackle structural challenges. while principle apply across countries, economy different reform tailor national conditions. a central banker, interest therefore country go strengthen economies. this government individually collectively decide know national challenge best. my interest whether succeed so, due impact price stability cohesion union whole. in remainder remark i elaborate points, focus two main channel structural reform support long-run growth euro area. 2 bi central bankers’ speech increase adjustment capacity the first increase adjustment capacity economy. this mean two things: first, output le affect shock relative price adjust quickly; second, recovery output fast economy able reallocate resource efficient way. adjustment capacity important itself, also support long-term growth insofar reduce depth recession duration unemployment, lessen labour capital hysteresis. when country independent monetary policy exchange rate, euro area, ability adjust shock way become commensurately important. to avoid large increase unemployment crucial national institution facilitate smooth adjustment process. in words, need high degree “resilience” come automatically membership monetary union. while first foremost national responsibility, also common interest monetary union. if member consistently rebound slowly shock others, complicate achievement price stability euro area level. the risk also increase difference structural unemployment become entrench across union. and insofar weaken political rationale monetary union – member good time inside union would outside – also weaken long-term cohesion. that negative spillover member economies. it context several colleague ecb executive board recently call strong common governance european level economic policies.1 the ability country adjust well shock key delivery mandate, vital integrity currency. this area legitimate interest central bank guardian currency. however, important stress ecb’s interest structural reform misinterpret call centralisation along “one size fit all” model. we need euro area country adopt identical structural reforms. what need framework take account country differ base national conditions, similar virtue monetary union. within parameter various combination country-specific institution produce smooth adjustment. let illustrate i mean focus one example: labour markets. theory suggest that, monetary union, certain principle apply labour market across countries. for instance, without option exchange rate devaluation, maintain wage line productivity time think central sustain competitiveness avoid painful internal devaluations. ensure wage respond change labour demand supply also see key element limit employment cost shocks. if firm scope cut cost intensive margin – i.e. wages, bonus work time – le likely cut cost extensive margin, is, labour shedding. wage-productivity link indeed prove important factor countries’ external positions. france, example, experience large loss export market share since start monetary union 1999, part reason labour market institution allow wage productivity de-link across firms. micro-level data show wage grow almost much least productive french firm last decade productive. by contrast, germany clear wage dispersion accord firm productivity. 1 for instance, see draghi, mario (2015). “structural reforms, inflation, monetary policy.” introductory speech ecb forum central banking, 22 may 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 3 moreover, strength crisis shock inevitably lead high job destruction, employment cost appear influence margin adjustment available firms. on whole scope adjust intensive margin cut job less. for example, new micro level research eurosystem find firm flexibility plant-level reduce employment le crisis bind centralise wage bargain agreements, partly able adjust wage work time economic conditions.2 labour market policy reflect principle may therefore beneficial euro area countries. but follow optimal model labour market must emulate. economy complex, labour market function depend manifold interaction national level. design structural reform thus require nuanced country-specific approach. for example, labour market adjust shock depend wage formation, overall constellation labour market institution within national economies. that is, adjustment margin interact feature unemployment insurance, employment protection active labour market policy – latter particularly important current context “cleansing” recession require substantial reallocation retrain workers. and know international experience different combination labour market institution produce similar employment outcomes. if one compares, example, large euro area economy, germany, u denmark, see different level public expenditure labour market protection (0.1% us, 0.7% germany 2.1% denmark), different level union density (us 11%, de 19%, dk 69%) different percentage employee cover wage bargain agreement (us 13%, de 62%, dk 80%). unemployment rate three country nonetheless downward trend since 2009. moreover, labour market institution affect adjustment also depend critically interaction policy areas. in greece, example, take around two year low labour cost translate low prices, largely product market highly protect react. due structural factor responsiveness economy price change also relatively low: greece rank small economy term share foreign trade gdp elasticity export price competitiveness. policy objective like raise competitiveness therefore take broad set national condition account: competition product markets, quality judicial system public administration, ease business, name few. there course factor relevant well, particular role demand policies. but key point diversity. it enough give one-dimensional prescription labour market must become flexible. what matter combination policy institution within country produce outcome satisfactory citizen sustainable euro area whole. underscore message important, otherwise wrongly seem though monetary union deprive citizen democratic choice. one could get idea political orientation country opt unimportant, implement structural reform anyway. there minimum requirement come part monetary union. but various way meet them. this perhaps notion that, future, could good job conveying. 2 di mauro, f., ronchi, m. (2015). “centralisation wage bargain firms’ adjustment great recession: a micro-based analysis.” compnet policy brief, no. 8, may 2015. 4 bi central bankers’ speech reinforce supply capacity alongside adjustment capacity, structural reform contribute long-run growth second channel: increase supply capacity economy, potential growth rate. well-designed structural policy increase quantity input production process – i.e. high labour supply capital growth – also foster efficient use input across within sectors, is, high total factor productivity (tfp). the supply capacity channel also especially important monetary union. in absence large-scale fiscal transfer limit labour mobility across countries, member economy need able sustain high level growth employment union cohesive long-term. potential growth however weak many euro area countries. this part crisis low capital growth, steep fall investment, labour supply, high structural unemployment. but also reflect weak long-term trend productivity. for example, 2000-14 tfp increase cumulatively 1.5% euro area, u rise 10.9% period. this situation complacent, least give substantial damage still remain crisis. structural reform play important role, different ways, address challenge relate production factor. labour supply euro area inevitably affect impact age societies. yet high structural unemployment clear scope increase quantities, especially labour market policy target reactivate long-term unemployed. in portugal, example, ecb internal estimate find active labour market policy explain one-third improvement employment since trough. the 2012 spanish labour market reform also estimate save destruction 60,000 job short term, medium-term impact 300,000 few job destroyed.3 these admittedly relatively small gain relative scale challenge, provide indication determine action area produce results. though investment-to-gdp ratio euro area currently still 3.5 pp pre-crisis level, capital growth project bounce back economy strengthen accelerator effect take hold. however, two key risk factor outlook, structural reform help mitigate. the first pessimism among firm future growth prospect continue weaken business case high investment. 5 year ahead growth expectation among forecaster fall continuously since 2001, around 2.7% 1.4% today, may filter “animal spirits”. in context, structural reform raise expectation path potential growth important psychological impact, insofar reduce uncertainty dislodge negative sentiment. the second risk factor persistence debt overhang part euro area continue act major drag firm household spending. here structural reform supportive positive effect gdp – denominator effect – facilitate nominal debt reduction – numerator effect. in latter case, come issue improve efficiency insolvency regimes, out-of-court restructure framework judicial systems.4 3 bbva (2013). revista situación españa, 2013 q2. 4 for point see speech peter praet, “repairing bank lend channel: next steps”, 17 november 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 5 however, know raise quantity investment matter long-term growth; quality investments, contribute tfp growth, significant. indeed, tell since 2000 total investment slightly high percentage gdp euro area us, produce much inferior tfp performance. two factor help explain discrepancy: first, relatively high share u firm invest ict capital, second, efficiency turn investment productivity gains. and structural factor which, least part, account two differences. first, variance within euro area, whole relatively high proportion micro small firm europe us. european firm also static, sense grow shrink time. for example, average size manufacture sector start-up u italy roughly within first two year – 5–10 employees. after ten years, however, average u firm grow around 75 employees, average italian still 15 employees.5 this matter size growth rate firm tend strong impact ict diffusion. small firm generally characterise relatively low accumulation ict capital due high fix cost face.6 they also tend towards high risk aversion encounter great difficulty collect resource finance innovative projects.7 an economy populate small firm grow therefore likely one low investment ict, therefore low tfp growth. the reason euro area firm grow slowly complex, structural policy certainly play role. in italy, example, regulation kick-in 15 employee threshold appear encourage firm stay small (although de facto long force).8 a similar phenomenon observe france, size-contingent regulation appear cause firm cluster 50 employees.9 wide product labour market regulation may also affect firm growth hind firm entry exit hence discourage reallocation. for example, difference product market protection associate difference ict adoption diffusion service sector.10 recent evidence suggest quality institution also affect reallocation: enhance efficiency civil justice lead high rate firms' market entry attract foreign direct investment.11 in sense, incentive within-firm innovation may closely link capacity between-firm reallocation.12 5 criscuolo et al. “the dynamic employment growth: new evidence 18 countries.” cep discussion papers, no. 1274, june 2014. 6 pellegrino, b., zingales, l. “diagnosing italian disease.” unpublished manuscript, september 2014. 7 amatori, f., bugamelli m. a. colli (2011), “italian firm history: size, technology entrepreneurship”, banca d’italia economic history work papers, no. 13, october 2011. see also bugamelli, m., cannari l., lotti f. s. magri (2011), “il gap innovativo del sistema produttivo italiano: radici e possibili rimedi”, banca d’italia occasional paper no. 121, april 2012. 8 schivardi, f., torrini, r.

(1981), structure change economic history. new york: w.w. norton; 2 bi central bankers’ speech institution interpret set permanent rule limit behavior individual government, provide stable framework certainty. the rule law represent central piece group, encompass factor protection property right administration justice. the explanatory power institution place empirically factor geography, international trade, human capital.2 result ongoing investigation conclusive. although research economics evolve idea may late refuted, case, prolong lack conclusiveness seem reflect two difficulties. the first technical issue associate measurement problem choice instrument correct possible endogenous nature propose determinants. for instance, significant debate center might adequate institution indicator, give fact concept vague, variable commonly use come opinion survey necessarily reflect permanent rule game. similarly, instrument criticize exhibit exclusive correlation variable tested. yet, spite complications, technical problem eventually settled.3 a second, perhaps deep reason empirical confirmation prominent role institution remain contest fact search single key driver could misplaced. it likely that, give complexity process economic development, several factor might come play, changeable mixes, may fit notion institution. for example, interaction among different realm economic policy conform favorable business environment gain grind empirical research possible set lead engine growth. the stellar economic performance china south korea last decade provide support idea good policy may precede preeminence strong institutions.4 additionally, research do micro data shed light role internal element firm level, managerial ability practices, well impact industry structure productivity. for example, reallocation resource toward productive firm within industry describe result competition different skill distribution among heterogeneous firms.5 in short, literature ample scope paper present seminar bear witness need multifaceted explanation productivity. north, d.c.

(2011), “what determine productivity?” journal economic literature, 49(2). bi central bankers’ speech 3 policy struggle promote productivity give productivity expansion crucial economic growth, promotion constitute natural target policy making. country vary term geography, cultural heritage, condition may affect economic efficiency differently. at time, nation, room enhance productivity growth almost always claimed. the pursuit objective face significant challenges. while common policy decisions, difficulty encounter may great due follow four reasons, least. first, silver bullet resolve problem productivity. the economic literature refer discussion hold conference make clear number element may interact. second, well-defined list factor could ensure high productivity growth cases. for example, economist know reliable institutions, fully operate markets, competition may provide incentive investment, human capital accumulation, productivity growth. however, many policy decision may also contribute end, combination may vary. there recipe, let u say, base composite indicator, policy maker try maximize results. the best policy mix need concrete institution may depend history initial condition specific countries. third, even clear-cut list element productivity expansion, relative importance component would hardly undisputed. the consequence roadmap obviously superior alternative path economic reform. fourth, though trajectory exist would dictate preferable sequence measures, democratic society require change legislated. international experience demonstrate political feasibility necessarily coincide economic desirability. these four difficulty illustrate fact understand productivity capacity prescribe change necessarily limited, point towards need caution. perhaps area, give breadth, economic adviser policy maker exert great deal judgment while, time remain humble. in case, policy maker expect use information hand, include best estimate theoretical models, foment favorable set productivity. sometimes, may simply mean incrementally remove obstacles, thereby allow private participant strengthen exist institution facilitate economic activity.6 additionally, implementation measure fuel efficiency must consider isolation. the absence presence policy institution could necessary take account. a lead example privatization, lack appropriate regulatory framework governance rule country produce unintended consequences, include strip privatize company assets.7 finally, go without say expectation potential economic measure ought remain realistic. reasonable expectation require social support continue never-ending process economic modernization. 6 easterly, w. (2008), “institutions: top down bottom up,” american economic review: paper proceedings, 98(2) argue favor “bottom-up” approach institutional development. 7 for discussion problem case transition economies, see hoff k. j.e. stiglitz (2005), “the creation rule law legitimacy property rights: the political economic consequence corrupt privatization,” nber work paper no. 11772, november. 4 bi central bankers’ speech mexico’s productivity challenge in last decades, mexico’s economic performance far impressive. examination data reveal main problem either employment investment, productivity. in particular, thirty-five year begin 1980, gdp per caput grow annual average rate 0.9 percent. growth account reveal labor investment contributed, respectively, 1.1 0.6 percent moderate expansion, high contribution labor largely reflect diminish dependency ratio years. tfp contracted, average, 0.7 percent per year.8 to gain insight mexico’s productivity problem, useful examine sectorial productivity performance. due lack reliable data capital sector, need focus labor productivity. for exercise, i divide gdp four sectors: agriculture, manufacture industry, nonmanufacturing industry, services. for period consideration, average, total labor productivity drop 0.3 percent per year, rise first two segment economy fall latter two. without attempt provide formal explanation contrast sectorial development, follow conjecture relatively safe.9 the fastest-growing sector term productivity agriculture, average annual rate 1.2 percent, mainly reflect sharp reduction labor force dedicate activity. average productivity growth manufacture 0.2 percent per year, surprisingly low give undeniable efficiency level subsectors automobile electronics expose competition international markets. nonmanufacturing exhibit sharp contraction productivity, negative 1.7 percent. this dismal result drive mainly utility hand state monopolies, construction, large fraction self-construction suffer low scale lag technology. labor productivity service also declined, 1.1 percent, explained, extent, absorption low-skilled labor rural area widespread level informality branch economic activity. finally, last two years, mexico undertake program structural reform various area economy. the aim tackle evident problem low efficiency briefly described, allow increase competition well facilitate investment market operations. result measure depend depth actual implementation and, case, view step along road need pave changes. conclude remark productivity central subject researcher policy makers, bear core issue potential sustain economic improvement. this conference contribute 8 own calculation growth decomposition base kehoe, t.j. f. meza, (2011), “catch-up growth follow

average annual change base data inegi groningen growth development centre 10-sector database, july 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 5 greatly effort scholar practitioner put piece productivity puzzle together. many factor impinge country’s productivity dynamics, make necessary explanation consider issue multifaceted way. the pursuit high productivity growth challenging. policy maker avoid look nonexistent panacea, time recognize need continuous progress. in mexico, bar also high. productivity performance underwhelming, recent program structural change could yield benefit along path great modernization, essential build block rule law reinforce reform implement adequately deeply. bi central bankers’ speech 1 takehiro sato: recent economic financial development monetary policy speech mr takehiro sato, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, kofu, yamanashi prefecture, 10 june 2015. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction thank give opportunity exchange view people represent political, economic, financial arena yamanashi prefecture. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan’s kofu branch. in today’s speech, i begin focus economic financial development japan abroad, well bank’s recent monetary policy. i touch briefly economy yamanashi prefecture. follow speech, i would like hear view actual condition local economy bank’s conduct monetary policy. i. recent economic financial development japan abroad a. development world economy the world economy sluggish, despite decline energy price (chart 1). in january–march quarter 2015 particular, exhibit sign slowdown, growth rate u.s. economy turn negative due effect severe winter weather labor dispute west coast ports, growth rate chinese economy remain around 7 percent. these development world economy affect japan’s economy degree well. the decline energy price since 2014 initially expect positive effect world economy, negative effect seem precede – decline income commodity-exporting country decrease investment resource development – due rapid pace energy price declines. a outlook, world economy expect see moderate increase growth rate, recent improvement soft data reflect hard data, positive effect decline energy price – increase real income energy-consuming country – permeate gradually. a u.s. economy, substantial deceleration growth january–march quarter observe three time past five years. the deceleration occur different reason time, seem seasonal pattern kind. besides severe winter weather labor dispute west coast ports, appreciation dollar also cast shadow manufacturers’ sentiment, thereby affect indicator business fix investment. the effect decline energy price investment resource development also evident (chart 2). in contrast, reflect improvement employment situation decline gasoline prices, consumer sentiment generally stay high level. it matter concern that, despite favorable sentiment, private consumption remain lackluster growth april–june quarter 2015 sluggish far. however, economy expect gradually return recovery path lead private consumption back moderate increase wage employment situation continue improve – follow le pattern past five years. the inflation rate stable due decline energy prices, slack labor market seem diminish certain degree, reflect 2 bi central bankers’ speech decline unemployment rate, although problem increase number long-term unemployed worker part-time workers. in situation, federal reserve (fed) communicate public path toward raise policy interest rate, take flexible cautious stance exact time depend future economic indicators. in europe, manufacturers’ sentiment pick reflection decline energy price depreciation euro, consumer sentiment also start recover (chart 3). with improvement soft data, pick-up hard data become evident, seen, example, positive gdp growth eight consecutive quarters. the inflation rate, temporarily negative, recover around 0 percent. that said, give effect debt problem remain, risk prolongation low inflation lead postponement investment consumption recede seem still exist, i monitor development closely. meanwhile, unconventional monetary policy measure introduce european central bank (ecb) initially significant effect foreign exchange bond markets; however, market recently show large fluctuations. many point make regard sustainability large-scale asset purchases, i pay attention progress make regard matter. with regard chinese economy, gdp growth rate january–march quarter 2015 decelerate 7.0 percent. look recent development electricity consumption railway freight turnover, impression actual economic growth could slow suggest gdp figures, although make decisive judgment development may reflect effect shift toward service economy progress structural reform promote chinese government (chart 4). moreover, manufacturers’ sentiment dampen further. movement toward inventory adjustment japan – material relate good iron steel – seem partly affect slowdown chinese economy. a outlook chinese economy, growth rate likely remain downward-biased, owe sharp change demographic situation resultant fall potential growth rate. however, give typical pattern observe past year – which, economy project deviate downward growth target, government implement small-scale economic packages, thereby achieve pick-up economy – development generally seem take place year well. meanwhile, attention pay point downward pressure inflation increasing, evidence year-on-year rate change gdp deflator january–march quarter 2015 turn negative first time since 2009. b. development global financial market take account development world economy i illustrated, let turn development global financial market time being. the first key point hike policy rate unite state affect global financial markets. in light recent u.s. economic indicators, time hike target federal fund rate market participant expect either move forward backward. on hand, feed work let market factor rate hike near future cautiously avoid provide decisive information. judge price federal fund future market, intention feed generally permeate markets, difference view federal open market committee (fomc) participant market – see time ago – start resolve (chart 5). of course, market participant begin identify specific time rate hike, global financial market might show different reaction past. this concern seem materialize market reaction feed chair janet yellen mention valuation stock bond market early may 2015. meanwhile, result number financial regulations, major market makers’ risk-taking activity restricted, induce concern regard decline bi central bankers’ speech 3 liquidity even u.s. treasury markets. give circumstances, i would like monitor carefully whether, time rate hike become clear future, change international flow fund cause significant repricing unexpected knock-on effect various asset markets. the second key point term development global financial market effect large-scale asset purchase ecb (chart 6). when purchase first implemented, consider effect purchase already factor in. however, even implementation, long-term interest rate european country fell markedly; example, 10-year german bund yield decline around 0 percent temporarily. at time, euro depreciate further. since late april, however – probably reaction sharp drop interest rate – long-term interest rate germany rise level see implementation ecb’s asset purchases, thus exhibit rather volatile movements. this increase volatility appear relate decline market liquidity, result scale ecb’s purchase massive relative size sovereign bond markets. also, japan, rise volatility long-term interest rate observe introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) april 2013 follow expansion qqe end-october 2014. specifically, contrary initial intention, yield 10-year japanese government bond (jgbs) temporarily jump somewhat significantly immediately implementation qqe. in contrast, decline expansion qqe recently return around level see expansion. these fluctuation long-term interest rate appear attributable monetary policy also external factors, therefore assess carefully. that said, effect monetary policy produce decline nominal real interest rates, due attention pay possibility liquidity premium jgb market – bring bank’s massive jgb purchase – might part weaken effect monetary policy. there also possibility fluctuation long-term interest rate reflect move factor improvement outlook economic activity prices. the third key point also relate european factor – namely, development political economic condition greece. a greek government face severe finance needs, negotiation regard financial assistance country continue. at point, possible effect peripheral european country limited. however, i would like monitor future development whether unexpected knock-on effect emerge global financial markets. c. development japan’s economy look development japan’s economy january–march quarter 2015, business fix investment also export production maintain moderate improve trend. private consumption import resilient final demand remain firm. for april–june quarter, economy expect continue recover moderately because, example, seem private consumption resilient since march, although production project le unchanged, mainly due inventory adjustment industry (chart 7). expectation somewhat high growth world economy also serve tailwind japan’s economy. the virtuous cycle income consumption investment likely operate, certainty gradually increasing, back firm employment situation favorable corporate results. however, probably mindful risk increase households’ real purchase power improvement corporate profits, bring low crude oil prices, lead expansion spend much expected, consequently pressure excess save – increase current account surplus – alleviate easily. 4 bi central bankers’ speech with regard employment income situation, form basis virtuous cycle i mentioned, wage continue rise moderately situation labor market condition become increasingly tight, even year-on-year growth total cash earn revise downward due replacement sample monthly labour survey (chart 8). wage expect continue increase moderately, reflect base pay increase likely take place second consecutive year. thus, private consumption expect reach moderately high level effect decline real income due consumption tax hike april 2014 dissipate gradually. from somewhat longer-term perspective, i focus pace increase firms’ productivity, basis sustainable rise wages, well impact age population. in order consumption maintain uptrend medium term, would necessary sustainable recovery real wage 60 million worker could offset development real income 40 million pensioners. the pace recovery private consumption likely remain moderate somewhat longer-term perspective, even consider wage gradually see high rate increase accordance rise productivity bring increase business fix investment, confidence sustainability social security system increase implementation relate reforms. regard private business fix investment, investment gdp basis slow increase far despite pick-up monthly indicators, shipment aggregate supply capital goods, firmness investment plan suggest result tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan). however, fix investment overseas mark consecutive double-digit increase recently, suggest firms’ appetite fix investment consolidate basis robust time (chart 9). what matter whether firm increase fix investment further, whether make investment japan. in regard, domestic fix investment far make nonmanufacturers particular, manufacturer finally begin increase production capacity japan, reflect yen’s depreciation past two years, although automobile firms’ shift production facility overseas, make full-fledged manner since around 2014, remain part. from somewhat longer-term perspective, whether change firms’ production network strategy become widespread, turn lead increasingly build production capacity japan rather overseas, depend medium- long-term projection exchange rates. specifically, firm judge yen’s depreciation past two year sustainable trend, would proceed increase production capacity japan. on hand, firm concern regard possible resurgent appreciation yen would easily change production network strategy even recent depreciation yen. in regard, annual survey corporate behavior, conduct cabinet office, provide favorable factor: yen-u.s. dollar rate next year forecast firm 119.5 yen/dollar, mark weak yen forecast third consecutive year (chart 10). however, note that, firm decide fix investment, long-term projection next five ten year important. therefore, uncertain whether trend increase production capacity japan become widespread future. d. development price let turn development prices. the year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food 0 percent recently, reflect decline energy prices. it likely level time being, due remain effect decline energy price (chart 11). this suggest consumer price also lack momentum present. however, decline general price due decrease energy price exert upward pressure real income, therefore i consider bi central bankers’ speech 5 favorable factor japan’s economy. what matter fluctuation monthly figure year-on-year rate change cpi, underlie trend inflation, reflect overall economic conditions. in view, underlie trend inflation firmly maintained. in situation inflation rate rise mainly due depreciation yen increase energy price past two years, various soft data suggest negative reaction household rise inflation rate light sluggish growth real wages. in fact, private consumption, also affect consumption tax hike, sluggish (chart 12). this prove people consider desirable see inflation rate rise balance wage income economic condition improve, rather see inflation rate simply rising. i believe price stability target intrinsically aim desirable developments. a matter concern whether deceleration rate increase cpi decline cpi year-on-year basis, observe recently, affect people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation backward-looking manner. in regard, judge firms’ price-setting behavior, consumers’ spend activity, recent development wage negotiations, people’s perception inflation change steadily despite decline energy prices. moreover, wide range estimate – expect inflation derive nominal interest rates1 trend inflation use regime-switching model2 – suggest medium- long-term inflation expectation japan appear rise since introduction qqe somewhat longer-term perspective (chart 13). however, deflation last 15 years, medium- long-term inflation expectation appear consistently remain low unite states. the challenge re-anchor expectation around 2 percent, comparable level unite states. what i consider important factor determine people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation past development inflation rate i mention earlier, also development overall economy asset prices, well forward-looking expectation formation base on, example, wage revisions. take point account, i hold optimistic view le likely people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation negatively affect decline inflation rate due fall energy prices. i would note recent result academic research method measure inflation rate offer valuable suggestion old also new issue define consumer prices. for example, sri-hitotsubashi unit value price index, develop professor naohito abe hitotsubashi university, incorporate price new good firm frequently introduce market calculate price indexes3 accord research professor abe, 46–47 percent good exist week previous year average retailers, indicate replacement rate good high reality (chart 14). the research also find new good virtually unchanged previous ones, suggest possibility firm replace good frequently mean adjust price effect. in calculate change price good 1 see kei imakubo jouchi nakajima, “estimating inflation risk premia nominal real yield curve use shadow-rate model,” bank japan work paper series no. 15-e-1, april 2015. 2 see sohei kaihatsu jouchi nakajima, “has trend inflation shifted? an empirical analysis regime-switching model,” bank japan work paper series no. 15-e-3, may 2015. 3 for details, see naohito abe, “saikin kakaku shisuu doukou shin shohin eikyo ni tsuite (recent development price index effect new goods),” newsletter no. 3, research center economic social risk (rcesr), institute economic research, hitotsubashi university, march 2015 (available japanese), naohito abe et al., “effects new good product turnover price indexes,” rcesr discussion paper series no. dp15–2, march 2015. 6 bi central bankers’ speech particular period, general consumer price index cover good price information available begin end period; hand, sri-hitotsubashi unit value price index quantify importance introduction new good i mentioned. the research conclude that, mainly due effect introduction prices, year-on-year rate increase sri-hitotsubashi unit value price index supermarket recently 1 1.5 percent, show high rate inflation cpi statistic release ministry internal affair communication (mic) price index cover continue good (chart 15). these research result allow simple comparison cpi statistic release mic, part coverage sri-hitotsubashi unit value price index limit good point-of-sale (pos) data. however, i take view provide useful insight firms’ price-setting behavior introduction new good effect development prices, divergence inflation rate perceive household measure price statistics. ii. future conduct monetary policy a. the price stability target conduct monetary policy in follows, i explain issue regard monetary policy. about two year ago, bank introduce qqe achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi early possible time, time horizon two years. the late figure year-on-year rate increase cpi 0 percent due decline energy prices, baseline scenario outline april 2015 outlook economic activity price show time reach price stability target delay around first half fiscal 2016 (chart 16). however, bank’s policy board judge policy action necessary point base view – i mention early – underlie trend inflation firmly maintain virtuous cycle economy. with regard time reach price stability target, i believe phrase “at early possible time” represent essence “a time horizon two years” non-binding target, commitment achieve specific price level within specific time frame, opinion, fit conduct monetary policy adopt major country first place. that is, understanding, price stability target roll target time horizon two years, broadly line idea inflation target adopt major countries. from viewpoint, delay time reach price stability target would essential problem. a i touch earlier, firm household generally negative reaction mere inflation, mainly due concern rise cost negative effect real wages, stem rise import prices. on hand, continue qqe, i consider necessary take account policy kind shock therapy influence formation people’s inflation expectation low real interest rate risk premium bring massive asset purchases, well strong commitment. the bank provide forward guidance – namely, continue qqe, long necessary achieve price stability target stable manner – course, necessity continue qqe judge line guidance. i therefore think current policy framework review automatic fashion simply two year pass since introduction. in understanding, price stability target flexible concept certain range upward downward deviation actual inflation rate target framework forecast targeting. it also understand achieve price stability target stable manner refer state year-on-year rate increase cpi simply mark 2 percent, rather one people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation re-anchored around bi central bankers’ speech 7 2 percent – words, situation household firm project shift consumption investment behavior one assume around 2 percent inflation. the status achieve price stability target necessity continue qqe judge bank’s policy board monetary policy meeting. in so, i would like take account (1) effect qqe expansion, (2) sustainability bank’s massive jgb purchases, (3) wide range qqe’s side effects, i elaborate shortly. b. effect qqe expansion the first point need examine continue qqe policy effect (chart 17). after expansion qqe end-october 2014, 10-year jgb yield temporarily drop 0.2 percent, recently recover around level see prior expansion. meanwhile, market’s outlook economic activity price actually revise downward, therefore lack persuasive evidence rise inflation expectations. one assume transmission mechanism qqe put downward pressure nominal interest rate across entire yield curve massive purchase jgbs. i understand expansion qqe end-october 2014 action would strengthen mechanism. in reality, however, appear degree difficulty implement qqe rising, effect low nominal interest rate diminish gradually, due mainly rise liquidity premiums, despite large-scale expansion bank’s jgb purchases. let give background become difficult long-term interest rate decline. first, interest rate level already low, become difficult see linear relationship amount jgb purchase interest rates. second, tend le demand jgbs final investor extremely low interest rates. third, dealers’ risk tolerance declining, increase volatility due decline market liquidity effect overseas interest rates. i explain three factor detail. with regard first one, key whether real interest rate decline – words, whether people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation rise bank’s “strong clear commitment” – situation become difficult nominal interest rate decline. of course, may theoretically possible push nominal interest rate bank continue purchase jgbs even negative interest rates. however, case, bank would become buyer jgbs, would likely give rise concern bank’s purchase perceive finance fiscal deficit, well decline market functioning. regard second factor, whether demand final investor decrease depend part future stance jgb purchases. for example, reduction life insurance companies’ promise return insurance product start july 2015 might affect investors’ future behavior (chart 18). a third factor, dealers’ risk tolerance likely change depend market conditions. take factor consideration, i pay close attention effect progress bank’s asset purchase interest rate formation, also change investors’ dealers’ behavior, closely monitor policy effect emerge future. c. sustainability bank’s massive asset purchase the second point need examine continue qqe sustainability bank’s massive jgb purchase (chart 19). the bank currently commit purchase jgbs medium- long-term maturity amount outstanding increase annual pace 80 trillion yen. on gross basis, bank purchase jgbs 8 bi central bankers’ speech annual pace 110 120 trillion yen, equivalent 90 percent total amount jgbs’ market issuance. if final investor reduce hold jgbs redeem bond time come maturity reinvesting amount redeem jgbs, bank’s massive jgb purchase would sustainable. however, reality, certain level demand jgbs, mainly use collateral. for example, amount jgb hold major banks, reduce time qqe introduced, stable recently, apply amount hold regional financial institutions. in situation appear certain level demand final investor reinvest amount redeem maturity, sustainability bank’s jgb purchase may become issue bank continue massive purchase current pace final investor reduce hold jgbs least possible extent. this limit dependent interest rate level factor point time, thus difficult project point. nevertheless, continue qqe, important give consideration feasibility term bank’s market operations. d. examination side effect the third point need examine continue qqe side effect bank’s massive asset purchases. it true policy effect side effect two side coin, positive effect cannot expect policy side effects. have say that, continue unprecedented policy, essential compare positive effect side effect examine whether latter outweigh marginal effect continue policy. with regard increase share bank’s hold jgb market affect market functioning, i somewhat concern result bond market survey conduct bank february 2015, recovery market function consider key smooth exit qqe somewhat longer-term perspective (chart 20). i also continue pay careful attention effect continue extremely low interest rate financial institutions’ business, stability broadly define settlement system. e. importance effort toward fiscal consolidation the bank’s massive purchase jgbs carry context conduct monetary policy way finance fiscal deficit. in order explanation persuasive, government’s effort toward fiscal consolidation important. it also note massive jgb purchases, continue long period, could lead extremely low interest rate build fiscal plan, thereby affect fiscal discipline – although continuation purchase aim fulfil purpose monetary policy. once market participant concern fiscal discipline, control long-term interest rate become difficult, even bank. my assessment qqe generally exert intend effect far, order qqe gain success – smooth process find exit qqe somewhat longer-term perspective – government’s initiative toward fiscal consolidation important. the government look formulate new fiscal consolidation plan summer 2015 maintain goal generate surplus primary balance fiscal 2020. the bank strongly expect government steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure view ensure credibility country’s fiscal management. conclude remarks: economic activity yamanashi prefecture my conclude remark touch economy yamanashi prefecture. a feature industrial structure yamanashi prefecture share manufacture – industry relate machinery particular – large country overall. the prefecture’s economy recently recover moderately, lead bi central bankers’ speech 9 manufacture firm attract external demand, directly indirectly (chart 21). nevertheless, somewhat longer-term perspective, move manufacture industry prefecture concentrate production site japan shift part production overseas, purpose enhance cost competitiveness, mainly response yen’s appreciation since lehman shock intensification competition stem growth asian firms. such move lead structural issue prefecture, decline population well age population decline birth rate. in address issues, key make full use advantage yamanashi prefecture. the first advantage prefecture close tokyo yet bless bounteous nature, include mt. fuji hot springs. recently, particular, number foreign visitor prefecture increase substantially, partly owe yen’s depreciation. it also note prefecture highly attractive place move to, live tokyo metropolitan area. i hear initiative take advantage environment spreading, improve tourism infrastructure expand support system invite wish move area. moreover, event tokyo 2020 summer olympic paralympic game launch linear chuo shinkansen line act tailwind yamanashi prefecture. the second advantage advance technology firm yamanashi prefecture develop far. i hope technological innovation advance result brush technologies, apply new areas, work integrate firms’ technologies. this, together cooperative effort among industry, government, academia, financial institutions, expect lead future achievements. i would like conclude speech express strong hope region enjoy growth future initiative i mentioned, make use potential. 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi

tombini: central bank – next 50 year introductory remark mr alexandre a tombini, governor central bank brazil, panel discussion celebrate 50th anniversary central bank brazil, rio de janeiro, 10 june 2015. * * * today’s panel discussion part series event celebrate 50th anniversary banco central brasil. other event series look backward. today we’d like take advantage collective wisdom experience distinguish guest look forward: expect next 50 year central banking? this ambitious question, appropriate one art science central bank currently flux, outcome today’s policy debate institutional innovation shape central bank many year come. the global financial crisis major impact think central banking. before crisis, were, naturally, number unanswered question challenge issue central banking, prevalent view major pillar field largely settled. in grow number countries, operational regime monetary policy inflation targeting; monetary financial stability objective could safely address separately; float exchange rates, couple robust international reserve access multilateral fund facilities, often see sufficient protect financial stability excessive international capital flow volatility. naturally, macroeconomic stability still necessary condition framework operate properly. the crisis lead reexamination issue think settle emergence new questions. even though brazil epicenter crisis, affect crisis policy put place wake. furthermore, actively participate international central bank debate order offer view learn experience others. * * * in open remarks, i focus three topic provoke particularly intense debate i believe shape central bank time come. in topics, global financial crisis prompt rethink still underway, although initial conclusion already drawn. first, maintain financial stability reemphasized core function central banks. central bank always concern financial stability, particularly lender-of-last-resort role. but many jurisdictions, central bank progressively downgrade importance financial stability goal post-war period. the supervision bank progressively split central banking, gap emerge that, jurisdictions, nobody task look vulnerability system whole. this le true emerge markets, include brazil, central bank tend keep strong focus financial stability even global financial crisis. in part, reflect fact financial crisis relatively common emerge market late 20th century. there also old important academic monetary policy debate decade lead crisis whether lean financial bubble clean burst. however, lack consensus issue resulted, practice, mostly laissez-faire policy stance. 2 bi central bankers’ speech today, i think safe say general agreement proactively maintain financial stability, take appropriate action buildup vulnerabilities, proper goal central banks. the high cost “cleaning up” global financial crisis serve reminder excessive complacency time come. the current debate policy tool goal maintain financial stability. macroprudential policy widely see first line defense systemic risk, still uncertainty effectiveness. there also disagreement whether monetary policy take financial stability consideration account all. on latter issue – use monetary policy deflate potential financial bubble – two views. one monetary policy likely particularly effective affect financial markets. another view, state forcefully lars svensson, monetary policy inefficient potentially even harmful tool financial stability, since unfocused may counterproductive macroeconomic effects. this far theoretical matter: currently lively debate whether current low interest rate major jurisdiction lead “search-for-yield” behavior certain financial market segments, potentially threaten financial stability, whether provide additional motivation normalize monetary policy sooner rather later. the view seem gain strength, i subscribe, use macroprudential policy maintain financial stability allow monetary policy focus price stability. however, definitive answer question depend progress development macroprudential policy tool frameworks. despite positive experiences, include brazil, macroprudential tool still insufficiently test theoretical literature infancy. the degree success use tool help determine whether role monetary policy help achieve financial stability goal. a second issue subject considerable debate nature monetary policy regimes. before crisis, strong consensus inflation target (or it) adequate monetary policy regime, due flexibility transparency. after crisis began, major central bank soon force low interest rate effective zero low bound. or think time: central bank test bind bring interest rate zero. even so, clear must effective low bind interest rates. furthermore, negative rates, maintain significant period time, may result financial market distortions; example cause last damage money market fund business model. central bank respond new challenge variety unconventional measure include know quantitative ease (or qe). however, still full agreement effectiveness collateral effect unconventional policies. (i speak side-effects bite later). even debate limit it framework zero-lower bound, many economists, particularly academia, propose innovative monetary policy regime price-level even nominal gdp targeting. these regime see powerful zero low bind would effectively require central bank make period below-target inflation nominal gdp growth keep rate low require it economy recovers. since monetary policy primarily affect economy long-term real interest rates, therefore agents’ expectation future path policy rate inflation, end result would accommodative policy downturn recommend it regime. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a modest proposal keep it regime, increase target level inflation. the crisis bubbly period precede convince many modern macroeconomy prone shock previously believed, therefore 2% target level prevail mature economy crisis perhaps low keep economy repeatedly hit zero low bound. my take debate that, end day, inflation target emerge even strong crisis. no major central bank abandon inflation targeting, central bank inflation-targeters adopt element framework. there several reason resilience it regime: • central bank find inflation target actually helpful explain need room unconventional policy measure general public. • furthermore, inflation target help anchor inflation expectations, keep deflation bay despite large output gap prevalent height crisis. • the propose new monetary policy regime suffer number practical deficiencies. they complex general public understand follow. and nominal gdp target rely heavily unobserved variable, potential gdp growth. • finally, change regime, even raise inflation target, middle crisis risk damage credibility central bank gain it regime. however, secular stagnation hypothesis revive larry summer paul krugman believed, debate may far over. the argument may tendency chronic excess save relative investment, various reason include slow population growth le capital-intensive economy. if so, real equilibrium interest rate low past zero-lower-bound recurrently bind constraint. i still unconvinced hypothesis, however. a point ben bernanke, secular stagnation argument tend ignore global nature today’s economy. a long profitable investment opportunity somewhere world, capital tend flow economy excessive save excessive investment demand. the result exchange rate depreciation would increase aggregate demand therefore neutral interest rate economy excessive savings. and indeed, abundant high-return, capital-intensive investment opportunity many emerge economy include brazil, particularly infrastructure. however, hypothesis turn realistic, zero low bind recur, shortcoming inflation target regime condition may lead renew search alternatives. the third final issue i address today deal capital flows. of course, potential destabilize capital flow well understand even crisis. in fact, various financial crisis 1990’s, emerge market begin accumulate international reserve order build buff foreign exchange liquidity. the combination float exchange rate robust foreign reserves, hoped, would sufficient protect economy financial system destabilize capital flows. the resort unconventional monetary policy wake global financial crisis result unprecedented level global liquidity. emerge market buffet unusually intense volatile capital flows. exchange rate appreciation fx market intervention insufficient maintain financial stability. the policy response many emerge market include macroprudential policy 4 bi central bankers’ speech dampen effect capital inflow domestic credit capital markets. these policy include measure aim domestic market measure directly target capital inflows. there currently widespread agreement multipronged approach, include macroeconomic, structural, macroprudential policy may necessary order deal capital flow surges. more recently, academia, central bank researcher imf endorse judicious combination capital flow management measure strong macroeconomic policies, include use exchange rate flexibility first shock absorber. however, measure costs, include market distortions, administrative burden, negative market reactions. furthermore, still number open questions. what combination policy instrument recipient country use order minimize costs? to extent burden adjustment also source countries? be possible improve decentralize outcome international policy cooperation? i still unconvinced room much great international policy coordination – central bank domestic, global mandates. however, seem scope cooperation least identify potential cross-border financial stability risk adopting, necessary, target macroprudential policy – either recipient source country – order prevent capital flow fuel unsustainable financial bubbles. * * * i’ve raise number open issue central bank i believe shape central bank time come: • financial stability core function central banks, macroprudential policy framework still infancy, proper role monetary policy ensure financial stability still discussion. • inflation target remain dominant monetary policy regime, growth skeptic correct zero-lower-bound recurs, renew call move innovative regime least high inflation target mature economies. • a laissez-faire approach capital flow table. there still disagreement, however, deal flows, bear burden adjustment, scope global policy cooperation. however, perhaps deep lesson draw global financial crisis. the crisis come largely surprise; see bubble forming, rather central bank community whole fail fully take account vulnerability result growth shadow bank sector, opacity novel financial instrument help fuel bubble, complex domestic international linkage different financial sector intermediaries. a fundamental lesson draw global financial crisis need develop integrated, forward-looking approach central bank bring together: • comprehensive, granular (and perhaps “real time”) financial sector surveillance focus identify systemic risk develop adequate market infrastructure report systems; • market intelligence capture short, medium long-term trend financial system, including, example, potential impact rapid evolution electronic trade platform algorithmic investment strategies; bi central bankers’ speech 5 • research analysis span monetary, exchange rate, macroprudential policies. we make progress direction central bank brazil, expect continue develop integrate approach central bank year come. host discussion like one today part process, i’m look forward hear panelists, require introduction. but nevertheless let say word introduce you. our first panelist jacob frenkel. dr. frenkel teach international economics university chicago serve governor bank israel 1991 2000. he move private sector, currently chairman jpmorgan chase international also serf chairman board trustee group thirty. i’d also like introduce jean claude trichet. mr. trichet long successful career public sector assign various post french government, include governor banque de france. in 2003 appoint president european central bank, capacity serve eight years. he currently chairman ceo group thirty. our third panelist axel weber. after distinguish career academia, dr. weber president deutsche bundesbank 2004 2011. after leave bundesbank, visit professor booth school business university chicago. he currently chairman board ubs. i enjoy throughout many years, variety forum debate always-to-the-point sharp remark i hope today benefit thoughts, thank jacob, jean-claude axel. ms. adriana arai moderate discussion. ms. arai join bloomberg news 2004, currently executive editor local language content chair bloomberg são paulo office committee. previously, work dow jones newswires são paulo, brasília london. adriana, floor yours. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: interview la croix interview mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, la croix, conduct m marie dancer publish 10 june 2015. * * * 1. the economy be see real recovery euro area? yes, see recovery. growth return euro area, include country suffer crisis (with exception greece). however, recovery need consolidated, begin remain fragile. first all, drive number temporary factors: cheap energy prices, combine low level interest rate euro’s exchange rate, result monetary policy. we able rely factor forever. the second area fragility – concern, even – weakness investment. until investment clearly pick again, able say recovery robust. the ecb contribute pick-up investment reduce cost short long-term financing. (the average maturity asset purchase eight years.) however, sustainable pick-up investment require involvement players. it mean business climate encourage firm invest favourable regulatory social environment. it fall government social partner determine rule game. bank also need lend. lend pick euro area, mainly large firms. lend small medium-sized enterprise grow strongly enough. the new bank regulation intend discourage speculation; reason finance economy. should borrow european level order invest? investment primarily private sector, priority, again, creation favourable environment. the financial condition achieved, regulatory fiscal condition yet put place. the question, then, whether need great public investment order act catalyst. yes, certainly – country sufficient room manoeuvre. be recovery artificial, drive liquidity? prosperity judge basis growth decline unemployment rate. liquidity merely tool serve objective. unemployment begin fall – albeit gradually – euro area. but number countries, include france, yet declining. in sense, right – job yet completed. be france lag behind? i french. i faith country’s ability create growth, numerous assets, demographic (which dynamic european average), ability innovate strength exports. so i concern france’s position euro area world long term. but france step neighbour country ireland spain, carry reform do early – mention germany, benefit even old reforms. at moment, country reap benefit reform term growth. 2 bi central bankers’ speech be reform france sufficiently ambitious? reform always difficult large countries, i doubt france right track. now recovery clearly begun, need make strong sustainable. the ecb’s action create window opportunity reforms. there risk pace reform slow electoral timetable, time push ahead them. what work bad france? it ecb highlight good bad point go detail reform carry elect governments. much do reduce burden firm responsibility pact competitiveness employment tax credit (cice), effort make cut public spending. we argue effort (since ecb would like ambitious), effort made. the area france suffer comparison rest euro area labour market. it would benefit move towards labour market inclusive people problem find employment. 2. financial markets, liquidity bubble be excess liquidity inject market – notably ecb – pave way bubble next crisis? be market high liquidity? the ecb pursue policy monetary ease – rock-bottom interest rate purchase security market – order return growth inflation below, close to, 2% euro area, line mandate. we know policy side effects. it true lot liquidity circulation. we currently concern financial bubble euro area. financial asset over-valued present; i think stock market particular. but remain vigilant regard, particularly since rate remain low extend period time. doe mean economist sound alarm correct? such warn useful. we must learn lesson financial crisis, scarcely emerge from, ensure growth model euro area different lead crisis – base uncontrolled debt, risky (and even unlawful) behaviour bank non-productive investment (e.g. investment spanish irish property markets). to end, new instruments. the financial sector much good regulate – thanks, first all, bank union, allow bank supervision independent political pressures, strict harmonised. the bank also good capitalised, new “macro-prudential” instrument aim prevent bubble financial instability, hesitate use. the ecb also involve discussion regard financial regulation global level, argue non-bank sector – “shadow banking” – supervise rigorously banks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 you worry abrupt reversal market could quickly break firewalls? admittedly, short-term volatility market [ed.: yo-yoing rates]. that inevitable, much monetary ease pursue ecb, uncertainty global economy, go soft patch first quarter year. the financial market need adapt fact different monetary policy unite state euro area new regulatory environment. that cause lot uncertainty entail period adjustment. the ecb intend counter volatility short term, would effectively give market participant free insurance policy. however, allow excessive fluctuation financial market threaten achievement objective, ensure price stability medium term. the best contribution make clear future direction monetary policy. for reason, clear fact purchase security continue september 2016 least, long necessary. doe ecb still room manoeuvre, use tool disposal? the reason rate zero purchase security carry want kick-start european economy raise inflation towards 2%. this temporary strategy aim respond specific situation saw 2014, inflation rate deviate target last basis flirt deflation. be abandon policy today, would plunge euro area undesirable situation growth inflation weak long term. some people refer “world 1%” – i.e. 1% growth 1% inflation. there is, course, question u that. but monetary policy cannot everything. in order avoid “secular stagnation” certain economist fear, monetary policy must supplement (i) responsible fiscal policy use available room manoeuvre country exist prevent debt explode country debt level high (ii) economic environment allow firm invest create job foster employability. doe ecb feel alone tackle crisis euro area? we independent governments, vice versa. there dialogue various european institutions, concern monetary policy sole response current crisis. that would doom failure. doe ecb’s quantitative ease signal return currency wars? there currency war present. the depreciation euro result difference euro area unite state term respective position economic cycle and, accordingly, monetary policies. our partner recognise monetary policy decision appropriate give situation euro area. this question seek influence euro’s exchange rate, respect ecb specific objectives. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 3. greece could ecb find front line come save greece negotiation fail? could end print money? will involve operate outside european treaties? we already front line fully play part central bank responsible 19 country share single currency, include greece. the liquidity provide greek bank eurosystem (the ecb bank greece) increase €45 billion december 2014 €119 billion today, give idea extent support provide ecb greek firm households. however, ability act govern rule stem treaties, approve european citizens: one hand, lend greek bank solvent provide collateral, hand, allow lend greek government (or government). it government euro area, together form eurogroup, decide whether wish lend greek government conditions, ecb. in 2012 mario draghi say would whatever take save euro, within ecb’s mandate. the ecb institution powerful instruments, use within narrow scope set treaties, supervision european parliament court justice european union. respect law fundamental respect democracy. that said, i refuse discus greek exit euro area work within framework. we finance greek economy work alongside imf european commission secure agreement athens, aim keep greece euro area. should greece’s debt restructured? this question taboo, greek debt already restructure private banks. a public creditors, already agree significant adjustment regard extension repayment period rate cuts, result greek debt burden significantly low italy spain percentage national income. should done? the answer depend final term agreement creditor greek authorities. this yardstick reassess sustainability debt. the money stake belong taxpayer euro area countries, governments, ecb, make decision regard. could ecb make kind gesture? the ecb’s claim greece stem loan grant country, bond purchase capital market height crisis improve transmission monetary policy decisions. we allow restructure them, treaty prohibit u provide financial assistance states. the negotiation greece creditor seem dialogue deaf… the goal strike balance programme newly elect government strong democratic legitimacy interest euro area countries, also democracies. the issue reform necessary greece, also fact reform finance taxpayer countries, also affect crisis. bi central bankers’ speech 5 would greek exit euro area trigger demise single currency? the ecb, i reiterate, want greece remain euro area. if, one day, country leave euro area, would serious warn sign europe, question would inevitably arise whether scenario could repeated. but answer question widely know – seem broad consensus concern condition enable country benefit advantage euro last basis. these condition include accountability before, solidarity towards, peers. these common value reflect national european institutions. incidentally, country commit value successfully overcome crisis (notably spain ireland). so i worry cohesion euro area. but country decide depart consensus, would undoubtedly oblige country unequivocally consolidate commitment value i mention accelerate process strengthen euro area. this would entail acceleration process institutional reflection currently long-term endeavour. be imf demanding? the imf different mandate different shareholder european institutions. it work behalf 188 countries, euro area standard live low greece. so imf concern regard equal treatment i think entirely legitimate. 4. the institution be euro area today strong enough face new crisis? yes, i certain is. thorough reform implement since 2010 reinforce responsibility member country (notably fiscal matters), well solidarity (with creation european stability mechanism), bank union strengthen bank supervision break financial link bank states. but still halfway there. we yet reach point completely ease strength euro area long term. it essential country implement responsible policies. economic policy structural reform need good coordinated, common interest, economy become resistant shocks. the resilience euro area whole must also strengthened. this could achieved, example, give euro area specific budgetary capacity, use would subject democratic oversight. the president european council, european commission, eurogroup ecb soon publish proposal issues. hasn’t euro failure, give substantial divergence among 19 country share single currency? no, euro failure. it give firm access large market bring favourable finance conditions. it also symbol unite european attach value. the finance condition lead crisis? the euro cause crisis. what lead crisis allow money invest non-productive activities, like house market. we also allow certain country file false account accumulate debt far beyond reasonable levels. this must 6 bi central bankers’ speech rectified, existence euro spur growth euro area. now continue identify, one one, source weakness, propose solutions. what role ecb play face rise populist movements? many people believe democratic institution… the best way respond euroscepticism create growth. i repeat, use tool disposal work towards this. everyone likewise. the ecb european institution give certain duty perform, within democratic framework. the treaty validate democratic process. the ecb accountable european parliament, become transparent. it nowadays also explain action national parliaments. we also increase transparency regard decision publish minute monetary policy meetings. one day, i sure, publish different member govern council vote. we already come long way regard, continue follow path. will ecb save euro? the euro long danger way could three year ago. but question reveal – show society’s expectation central bank still excessive. in one respect, fact ecb independent political constraint mean everyone pin (unrealistic) hope term economic policy. but unreasonable! if much ask central banks, become behold vest interest le effective, lose legitimacy process. but isn’t evolution role central bank irreversible? the best response show consolidate growth without rely monetary policy. this big issue come month years. to fulfil goal extraordinary economic environment, central banker take le extraordinary decision place centre stage. a soon stability returns, i doubt return ploughs, like cincinnatus roman times. be candidate position governor banque de france? this decision french president alone. the banque de france ecb’s second-largest shareholder. it magnificent institution continue make voice hear euro area global financial debates. bi central bankers’ speech 1 john mourmouras: divergent monetary policy global capital market speech professor john mourmouras, deputy governor bank greece, session “the role central bank today” xxiv international bank congress, st. petersburg, 4 june 2015. * * * governors, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure st. petersburg i would like thank governor bank russia, elvira nabiullina, invite international congress attend distinguish representative finance industry central bank sector. i would like make remark potential financial consequence divergent monetary policies, remain dominant theme global financial environment. afterwards, i happy answer question pose panel floor. 1. introduction global growth inflation prospects, dire month ago, far robust. notwithstanding slow step federal reserve (fed) towards normalisation monetary policy us, central bank community today remain ultra-loose, certainty stimulus europe japan month ahead likelihood monetary ease china elsewhere. the greek debt crisis still remain pending also downside risk geopolitical front, even region (e.g. event ukraine, particularly minsk ii ceasefire increase strain). several central bank (including four major, i.e. u federal reserve, ecb, bank england bank japan) engage unconventional monetary policies, include large-scale asset purchase programmes, forward guidance future path monetary policy. we also lately witness discretionary policy action increase number central bank direct effect foreign exchange value currencies, naturally raise concern recourse beggar-thy-neighbour policy competitive devaluations. the consensus among analyst period divergent monetary policy among central bank last quite time, give rise number important question addressed, mention two: (a) effect channel international transmission monetary policy today, (b) spillover policy major central bank rest world, include emerge markets, term capital flows, bond market exchange rates, scope global monetary policy coordination. i propose focus follow three remarks. firstly, i discus ecb’s ongoing expand asset purchase programme (qe) impact euro area economy. secondly, i discus divergent monetary policy among world’s lead central bank may trigger excessive volatility global financial markets. last least, i examine scope global monetary policy coordination effectively address risk lie behind “asymmetric” monetary policies. 2. draghi’s qe: early evaluation first all, i explain talk low inflation, rather deflation, euro area. inflation expect remain low slightly negative come months, average inflation projection 0.3% year 2015, yearly average 2 bi central bankers’ speech 0.4% 2014. in advance economies, inflation rate stand 0.4% yearly basis 2015, accord late imf forecasts, low level last 30 years, emes 5.4%, one low last 20 years. although euro area, 50% risk inflation rate hover one percent short-run, risk deflation quite low le 10% short term (in next one two years) effectively zero (1% risk) long term (in next five years). despite recent monthly inflation “dips” negative level deflationary bias embed wage contract consumer behaviour euro area, oppose inflationary bias experience past three decade (1980s-1990s-2000s). ultimately, ecb fulfil mandate, harmonise index consumer price (hicp) expect reach 1.8% 2017, consistent primary goal price stability, i.e. maintain euro area inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. let quickly refer key feature ecb’s recent asset purchase programme focus mainly impact qe, judge preliminary evidence, really encouraging. the key element programme following: (a) monthly asset purchase amount €60 billion private sovereign debt. the programme amount total €1.1 trillion asset purchase carry march 2015 september 2016. (b) loss-sharing reserve purchase carry ecb, account 20% total purchases. the remain 80% purchase – i.e. purchase make ncbs – subject loss-sharing. since announcement ecb’s qe 22 january, projection real gdp growth 2015 2016 revise upwards (to 1.5% 1.9%, respectively) compare december 2014. furthermore, model-based estimate indicate market-based measure inflation expectation react positively progressive expansion ecb’s balance sheet last month revise upwards, well. a far financial market concerned, impact asset purchase programme account fall euro area long-term sovereign bond yield since last december, market participant anticipate ecb’s qe programme. government bond across wide range euro area country trade historically low, often negative, yields. the decline pronounce long maturities, yield french german 10-year bond fall around 60 basis points, italian portuguese bond maturity shrink 70 90 basis points, respectively. the major european stock market rise since end-2014 17%. furthermore, euro depreciate 11% since last december, hit 12-year low dollar (for detail assessment ecb’s qe, see early speech 33rd meet central bank governors’ club shanghai 15 may 2015, available at: http://www.bankofgreece.gr/pages/en/bank/news/ speeches/dispitem.aspx?item_id=317&list_id=b2e9402e-db05–4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b). follow ecb’s accommodative monetary policy (with standard non-standard measures) central bank adopt similar policies. for instance, europe, central bank denmark cut key policy rate, take negative territory –0.75%, central bank sweden (riksbank), base rate –0.25%, announce expand quantitative ease programme (the riksbank pledge buy skr40 billion skr50 billion (us $4.8–6 billion) government bonds, take total stock swedish sovereign debt hold central bank skr80 billion skr90 billion share swedish government debt 15%) effort stimulate economy. in total, start year, 22 central bank low official rate (including bank russia, which, since last december’s drastic rise 17%, low interest rate three consecutive times, last time april, rate cut 1.5 percentage point 12.5%). in light this, one speak period truly global monetary easing! bi central bankers’ speech 3 3. divergent monetary policy capital market some theory many analyst believe purchase central bank dominant cause low bond yield today. apparently, factor since qe programme, nature, extension intervention horizon monetary policy direct impact long-term interest rate (the average maturity security buy ecb qe programme 8.1 years). however, far important determinant low bond yield today expectation short-term rate stay low, turn reflect expectation low persistent inflation weak uncertain recovery. perhaps theory useful here. theory suggest long-term interest rate weight average expect short-term interest rate plus term premium. the premium normally positive, even absence default risk. longer-term security risky short-term ones, price volatile. expect short-term nominal rate determine expect real interest rate expect inflation, expect change real interest rate should, turn, determine expect balance save investment. finally, factors, risk aversion also affect price long-term bonds. what suggest future path yields? the sharp rise expect short-term interest rate hence long-term yield (the term structure interest rate theoretical terms) likely follow strong recovery subsequently sharp rise inflation expectation (in empirical terms, historically, sovereign bond yield and, less extent, exchange rate track nominal gdp growth rates). we yet: robust recovery europe monetary policy normalisation u market start price risk traditional manner. the recent bond sell-off it true, though, last day april saw begin sharp sell-off sovereign bond across euro area bond markets, lead soar volatility european bond markets, sharp steepen yield curve appreciation euro. the figure quite spectacular often case markets: 17 work days, global sovereign bond index lose €0.5 trillion value! this upward correction bond yield early overshoot bond price (early undershoot exchange rate), mark first significant adjustment european sovereign bond market since mid-2013 (triggered turn federal reserve’s taper asset purchases). the 10-year bund yield increase historical low 7.5 bps 20 april 80 bps early june. a euro area countries, yield france core country increase similar way, spread peripheral bond bund narrowed. turn u government bond market, give strong co-movement 10-year german u government bond yield (with high correlation coefficient .80), 10-year u treasury yield rise substantially reach high close level year region 2.30%, contagion european bond sell-off main driver recent rise. give fact recent u macro data mix uncertainty surround fed’s rate hike timing, additional volatility u yield spill bunds euro area countries, interest rate differential set remain region 1.50%. in addition, widen gap u euro area interest rate also drive u company issue euro-denominated debt seem cheap interest rate differential terms. in short, apart technical condition (e.g. shorter-dated german bunds become eligible, previously not, negative yields, hence le need buy longer-dated bond and/or volatility cluster global bond markets, namely volatility generate volatility), recent bond sell-off reveal vulnerability current low-yield/low-inflation environment also regard evident financial implication divergent monetary policies. one forget still another trillion leave draghi’s qe programme paid. finally, 4 bi central bankers’ speech analyst claim issue macroprudential policy arise which, well-known, address risk financial system whole. more precisely, ecb’s implementation expand asset purchase programme current juncture might necessitate use exist macroprudential tool oversee fallout credit expansion prevent least moderate asset market bubbles, even creation new tools, instance address pressure insurance sector result low-yield environment operate today. capital flow the repercussion world economy redirection major central bank’s monetary policy and/or divergent global monetary policy sharply alter global exchange rates, one old question international monetary economics pose recently, feed launch quantitative ease (qe) programme. at time, governor central bank brazil express strong dismay loosen fed’s monetary policy impact emerge countries, form large capital inflow trigger sharp appreciation currency decline exports. it indeed quite difficult predict precise form (sometimes conflicting) spillover effect stem change monetary policy stance. for instance, fed’s quantitative ease 1 (qε1) programme follow capital flow emerge economy (emes) u treasuries, second round quantitative ease (qε2) exact opposite effect. since then, fed’s change tack spur intense reaction emes (see recent statement reserve bank india governor): taper fed’s asset purchase programme result massive capital flow advance economy subsequent sharp rise interest rate emerge economy prevent sharp devaluation currency (the currency brazil, south africa turkey particularly hard-hit). their large current account deficit typically finance short-term portfolio flow case brazil south africa, fall commodity price add pressure. up now, clear indication international portfolio rebalances due upcoming interest rate hike feed and/or qe programme currently implement ecb. 4. monetary policy coordination? we look negative spillover effect divergent monetary policies. of course, central bank’s mandate domestic, policy may global implications. furthermore, international macroeconomic environment subdue uneven growth high unemployment, zero lower-bound interest rate tight fiscal policy stance, certain nation may attempt use monetary policy – standard non-standard measure – order influence exchange rate bolster economy boost employment. the question thus arise whether monetary authority act coordinate manner final stage exit global crisis time foreign exchange rate official monetary policy objective advance economies. ecb president mario draghi, answer relevant question ecb govern council press conference 6 february 2014, stress international monetary cooperation cannot rule out. example international monetary policy coordination rare, olivier blanchard capture reality caveat: “it like loch ness monster much discussed, rarely seen” (15 december 2013). a matter fact, recent notable example monetary policy coordination among major central bank take place onset global crisis 2008, world’s four lead central bank (the federal reserve, ecb, bank england bank japan) take coordinate action, affirm need go beyond traditional way conduct monetary policy order continue provide liquidity financial system prevent collapse transaction global crash. hence establish liquidity swap arrangement intention provide foreign currency fund bi central bankers’ speech 5 bank system jurisdictions. the u federal reserve provide u $500 billion major central bank 2008–2010 period, others use liquidity swap line less extent. while international cooperation central bank quite common field foreign exchange markets, occasion mark first multilateral central bank cooperation money market field, central implementation central bank’s monetary policy. it worth remind past, serious initiative coordinate monetary policy take 1985 plaza accord 1987 louvre accord order stabilise dollar exchange rate. if thing move towards policy coordination, view take follow form: i) feed could perhaps extend new swap line central bank emes, like swap line offer start global crisis (a kind formal policy coordination), and/or ii) commitment part four major central bank communicate monetary policy clear timely manner within context forward guidance policies, agree g20 meet 2014, (a kind informal policy coordination, whereby major cbs mindful consequence actions). such forward guidance enable emerge economy promptly protect sharp significant capital flow develop policy avoid exclusive dependence speculative capital flow render vulnerable excessive volatility financial markets. at current juncture, major central bank signal future interest rate change timely manner, without concern cause market panic, otherwise investor continue overborrow would potentially destabilising. all all, era globalisation especially background low persistent inflation today, form coordinate action major central bank perhaps put table, particularly give fact government unable protect central bank decisions, trigger significant capital flows, available tool limit capital flow efficient. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stefan gerlach: make residential rental market work financial stability address mr stefan gerlach, deputy governor (central banking) central bank ireland, twenty-first dubrovnik economic conference, dubrovnik, 8 june 2015. * * * accompany chart find central bank ireland’s website. i would like thank amelia dennigan, gabriel fagan, john flynn, robert kelly, maurice mcguire, cyril roux, rebecca stuart and, particular, therese grace help prepare speech. 1. introduction i please dubrovnik 21st dubrovnik economic conference. today i talk rental market financial stability. while rental market currently focus attention many countries, include ireland1, link financial stability, preoccupation central banks, issue frequently neglect important public debate housing. before proceeding, i note house policy outside remit central banks, financial stability concern raise not. in talk, i therefore hope draw attention issues, recognise others set specific policy areas. my talk motivate three observation house market crisis: first, owner-occupancy rate increase prior crisis, recent crisis saw owner-occupancy rate fall. consequently, number renter rise many country affect house market downturns, include ireland. this indicate many people household formation age, rental market act backstop, turn time uncertainty tight credit conditions. my second observation empirical evidence show economy rental market relatively large deep suffer le financial crisis. deep rental market thus appear promote resilience economy adverse shock therefore desirable economic stability perspective. to promote development, important rent attractive long-term proposition household landlord alike. my third final observation arise fact that, economy recover ireland, house market take rapidly, property price increase 20 per cent 2014, fall 12 per cent two year early (indeed, january 2015, central bank ireland introduce loan-to-value loan-to-income limit increase resilience bank household sector property market reduce risk bank credit house price spiral develop future).2 this pick-up often attribute “pent-up” demand owner-occupied house built-up crisis year credit scarce uncertainty path house prices.3 whatever causes, indicate that, people will rent short-term basis, strong preference owner-occupied house rent accommodation. 1 see, particular, recent report national economic social council (nesc (2015)). 2 see central bank ireland press release associate documentation, 27 january 2015. 3 the effect also exacerbate low level new house build crisis years, result local supply shortages. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2. the financial crisis to put role house market perspective, useful start review depth recent economic crisis. one measure adversity outcome loss potential output, show chart 1 sample 24 countries.4 these loss arise crisis reduce level perhaps also growth rate economy’s productive potential. another measure increase unemployment rate 2005 2014, show sample 19 country chart 2. furthermore, chart 3 indicate high correlation output loss house price declines. those country experience great loss large house price decrease crisis. these chart illustrate croatia ireland fare particularly poorly crisis: experience large loss potential output, large increase unemployment large fall real property prices. they also make clear great difference country economic outcomes. while travail croatia ireland might simply due bad luck, credit-fuelled house bubble play big part countries’ pre-crisis growth subsequent decline. it aspect i focus and, particular, role deep well-developed rental market play help reduce effect shock house markets. 3. what role rental markets? so role rental market downturn? a show chart 4, proportion population rent property, rental rate, vary among industrialise economy 60 per cent switzerland 20 per cent spain croatia.5 the rental rate low english-speaking countries, range 36 per cent canada 26 per cent ireland. indeed, rental rate increase number country experience house market turmoil crisis years. consider simplify scenario people economy finish school 18, save 10 year buy house. in scenario, predictable number people enter house market every year: turn 28 year age.6 when shock hit economy, house purchase delayed, either uncertainty future direction house prices, lack credit. this delay house purchase result people move rental market. a deep rental market good place absorb increase demand thin rental market. this increase demand small portion overall size market. moreover, compare situation new household formation take place time uncertainty, switch preference owner-occupancy rent accommodation important stabilise effect house markets. a house price fall demand rental property push rents, yield rental property increase, make attractive become landlord instead sell depress price. in ireland, estimate 36 per cent landlord “accidental landlords” find property could sell result house market crash.7 rent receive property enable landlord meet outstanding mortgage repayments, thus help avoid fall mortgage arrears. moreover, price fall, rental yield 4 these loss compute ball (2014). 5 due limit cross-country data availability, rental rate data include household private publicly-provided rental accommodation. 6 see mile (2011) discussion effects. 7 redc survey result report house agency (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 3 property likely rise, encourage new landlord market help create floor house prices. overall, deep well-established rental market therefore seem mitigant effect shock broad economy house markets. this clear cross-country data. chart 5 contain scatterplot loss potential output crisis rental rate chart 6 show relationship rental rate change unemployment. in case clear negative relationship readily apparent. overall, evidence suggest link depth rental market severity macroeconomic outcome recent crisis. 4. the role mortgage debt financial crisis there course also number social benefit owner-occupancy need keep mind. for instance, owner-occupancy represent purchase asset and, since mortgage loan amortise ireland, therefore lead wealth accumulation. this particularly helpful retirement, reduce income offset low cost outright ownership housing. in addition, study show homeowner engage social political activities, positive assessment neighbourhoods, good psychological health high educational attainments.8 survey u show homeowner believe neighbourhood safe good place raise children.9 but benefit owner-occupancy well documented, much le well-known flipside coin: risk associate financially vulnerable household take financial burden house purchase. let discus issue. in ireland burden current crisis fall squarely young, many buy property top market. the perception one must get “on property ladder” soon possible particular feature boom years, also consequence poorly function rental market ireland, implication young families. many leave unsuitable property house need (for example, one bedroom apartment satisfactory grow families), debt could long service salary decline unemployment rise economic downturn. moreover, negative equity mortgage arrears may make difficult move pursuit new, good paid, employment. while desirable beneficial many, homeownership come together important risk many neglect onset crisis. a particular concern regard fact risk become unemployed experience income loss evenly share across society. young le experience workers, work industry sensitive business cycle, construction sector, particularly expose risk unemployment. this illustrate chart 7 show crisis disproportionately affect unemployment rate among young age cohort ireland. graduate salary decline significantly since 2007, long-term implication earn potential young people.10 chart 8 show employment sector vulnerable economic cycle, construction, adversely affect crisis. thus, lack deep well-functioning rental market force households, include relatively high risk unemployment, property market. while great 8 see rohe lindblad (2013) discussion benefit homeownership. 9 see belsky (2013). 10 conefrey smith (2014). 4 bi central bankers’ speech majority borrower credit worthy service loans, unemployment income loss, may cause unemployment spouse partner, important determinant mortgage arrears ireland.11 bank economy high house ownership rate may therefore experience high credit loss downturn. the result link highly-indebted financially vulnerable household bank sector create cycle self-reinforcing good time expectation increase capital value increase equity enable great indebtedness, bad time bank household suffer losses. what role rental market play? buy house use mortgage risky leverage investment involve household borrow several time annual income buy asset uncertain future value. such investment enter understand risk feel able assume them. moreover, rental market alleviate risk capital loss negative equity, increase labour mobility thus facilitate adjustment follow adverse economic shocks. from financial stability perspective therefore important household worry risk homeownership option, wish, rent property provide type quality housing, security tenure, require. let next turn rental market. 5. the private rental market it clear ireland, contrast elsewhere europe, rent home see long-term option households. indeed, result recent survey show 70 per cent private rental tenant would prefer property, 17 per cent wish rent long-term.12 while may reflect cultural preference, benefit homeownership, seem likely type, quality, affordability and, particular, security tenure private rent accommodation also play important role. what do make rent attractive long-term alternative homeownership? i believe three aspect problem: first, rental market structure, particularly term security tenure, play role. second, investment horizon landlord important. a culture whereby market dominate landlord seek income stream long term, rather capital gain short run, help raise attractiveness rent number ways. finally, many countries, policy aim specifically incentivise homeownership, detriment rental market. 5.1 security tenure a particular concern ireland absence long-term rental contracts; household may wish stay long period accommodation, rental contract ireland predominantly year’s duration. this lead wide-spread lack security tenure. indeed, recent survey indicate 23 per cent private tenant ireland afraid lose home. in addition, 32 per cent formal lease, even though half live current accommodation two years.13 the risk associate cost move may make household opt purchase home take financial risk may feel well place assume. indeed, 29 per cent tenant say would likely rent long term possibility long term lease.14 lengthen rental contract therefore seem desirable.15 11 mccarthy (2014). 12 redc survey report house agency (2014). 13 house sentiment survey conduct ireach, report nabco (2014). 14 house agency (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 5 interestingly, research show country comparatively strong security tenure high rental rates, germany netherlands, security tenure see foster long-run demand rent rental investment, neither tenant landlord seek weaken security.16 why rental contract ireland short term nature? ireland’s history high variable inflation lack institutional investor rental market must important. in economy history inflation, bank protect lend flexible interest rates. in turn, mortgage cost vary time, renter protect short term contracts. in contrast, economy history low stable inflation, mortgage lend tend long maturity rental contract tend long term. of course, ireland’s history inflation over. but lend arrangement change slowly. overall, house market financial stability ireland would benefit borrower wide choice fix rate loans. 5.2 incentive landlord the lack institutional investor rental market also important. the irish rental market dominate private household let single property.17 the fact may need dwell family member, may wish sell it, another factor make short-term contract concern security tenure. furthermore, buy-to-let property high rate mortgage arrears. the late figure december 2014 show 25 per cent buy-to-let mortgage arrears. indeed, survey find suggest almost 50 per cent landlords18 cannot cover loan repayment rental income. overall, 29 per cent landlord intend exit market soon possible.19 in contrast, institutional investors, pension fund insurance companies, long investment horizon strong preference tenant stay extend period time, since find new tenant refurbish apartment costly.20 institutional investor bring standardised, professional approach management entire build apartments, aid supply suitable accommodation popular areas. this suggest attract institutional investor would promote well-functioning rental market important financial stability.21 furthermore, investor likely le leverage diversify portfolio individual own one two rental properties, thus good able withstand economic downturn. 15 nesc (2015) discus security tenure depth. 16 see de boer bitetti (2014). 17 see house agency (2014) suggest 80 per cent landlord one two properties. 18 include without outstanding debts. 19 house agency (2014). 20 a private household invest property purpose additional income retirement. in germany, many people rent extend periods, large share landlord individuals, however, retirement purpose rather capital gains, therefore interest steady income stream long-term tenant (see ecb (2009), particularly box 3). 21 to end, budget 2013 introduce real estate investment trust (reits) ireland. to date, approximately 1,500 residential unit acquire reits. 6 bi central bankers’ speech there wide variety government intervention rental market, direct provision social house regulation private rent sector.22 because move costly disruptive, tenant-landlord relationship inherently asymmetric. regulation, design well, therefore improve outcomes. that said, poorly think regulation, particular rent controls, adverse effect reduce supply rental property discourage new construction maintenance exist rental properties. get house regulation “right” – task outside central bank’s remit – important. 5.3 policy favour home-ownership home-ownership bring many benefits, understandable policy place enable house purchase; i already outline potential benefit term asset accumulation social advantage associate home-ownership. however, policy aim enable people gain benefit home-ownership effect worsen situation either choose homeowners, cannot afford so. one important issue influence households’ choice buy rent property tax policy. in many country generally favourable towards homeownership. example favourable taxation treatment house include exemption impute rental income principal home income tax calculations, tax relief mortgage interest payments, exemption capital gain sale principal homes, use outdated house value property taxes. a favourable tax treatment homeownership risk encourage excessive leverage house investment, lead development macroeconomic financial imbalances.23 it also tempt household worry risk inherent mortgage borrow house ownership. overall, seem desirable tax policy neutral homeownership renting. to end, important note tax relief mortgage payment phase since crisis, recurrent property tax introduced, ireland. 6. conclusion economy experience boom-bust cycle housing, croatia ireland, suffer disproportionately financial crisis. there numerous reason large impact, many are, now, familiar. however, le frequently note economy deep rental market suffer less. while specific house policy outside remit central banks, incumbent u draw attention issue relate financial stability. to reduce risk amplitude future house cycles, house policy need consider also financial stability issues. in regard, seem particularly important promote well-developed rental market genuine alternative ownership, attractive investment proposition potential landlords. while many household may continue buy rather rent, need make sure choice reflect preference merely reflect poorly function rental market. reference ball, l., (2014) “long-term damage great recession oecd countries”, nber work paper 20185. 22 for information, see:

recent international domestic economic development change financial regulatory architecture address mr françois groepe, deputy governor south african reserve bank, actuarial society south africa (assa) 2015 investment seminar, cape town, 27 may 2015. * * * introduction good day lady gentlemen. thank invite seminar i look forward share view recent international domestic economic developments, well change financial regulatory architecture. global outlook the global environment face south africa remain challenge fraught high degree uncertainty. development us, particular, continue spill-over effect emerge market general south africa particular. while clear monetary policy normalisation (and should) take place, time initial “lift off” still uncertain, dependent domestic development us, least labour market. this make data release source volatility, good news payroll data generally interpret bring forward expect commencement date normalisation process. perhaps great importance “lift off” question future path interest rates. the u feed go great pain communicate gradual path, “dots” (the interest rate forecast individual members) illustrate subject high degree dispersion change meet meeting. this reflect high degree uncertainty. however, uncertainty u economy abound. the economy appear well road recovery second half last year, first quarter data disappointed, follow advance estimate growth rate 0,2 per cent. the general expectation due temporary factors, risk still remain could portend general extend slowdown. furthermore, still uncertainty regard improvement labour market: particular, whether improvement result decline labour force participation rates, could reverse improvement economy sustained. finally, still great deal uncertainty whether potential growth rate return pre-crisis level settle low level, likely implication long term neutral rate interest. the eurozone appear improve follow weak quarters, positive growth impulse weak euro low oil prices. the partial reversal oil price suggest impulse may waning. it however appear quantitative ease ecb bear fruit, question remain whether region sustain recovery without support. a question mark also remain regard possible contagion effect greek debt crisis. the market reaction date suggest contained, unlike generalise crisis 2011 risk premia peripheral eurozone bond widen significantly. the chinese economy continue focus rebalancing away investment domestic consumption. this result downward revision growth targets, also mean demand commodity strong previously. while growth rate 7 per cent would seem unattainable south africa, relatively low recent historical standard china. 2 bi central bankers’ speech domestic outlook the spill over south africa development significant. the u impact exchange rate long term bond yields, highly correlate uk. the eurozone important destination south africa’s manufacture exports, slow recovery bad manufacture sector, (until recently) weak euro mean competitive advantage weak rand undermined. although african continent, grow quite robustly, emerge one main destination south africa’s manufacture exports, downside risk continent’s growth prospect give decline oil commodity prices. the slowdown china mark impact global commodity prices, result deterioration south africa’s term trade, reverse extent collapse international oil price since late last year, even windfall reverse somewhat. so indeed face challenge international environment. however, would wrong suggest subdue outlook domestic economy purely function global developments. domestic factor also important, making. real gdp first quarter year slow 1.3 per cent compare 4.1 per cent (qqsa) record final quarter 2014. this backdrop sluggish growth rate 1,5 per cent 2014 well bank’s estimate potential output 2,0 2,5 per cent. the weak outcome last year partly due impact protract strike mine manufacture sector year. the bank estimate negative impact strike order around 1,2 percentage point gdp. hopefully, prolong work stoppage regular feature year. the question need ask growth prognosis weak. some global economy, i outline earlier. secondly, bind constraint come electricity supply uncertainties. our estimate growth try incorporate element impact load shed output. there two element here: one impact long term constraint hamper new investment, reflect overall low potential output; impact load-shedding exist capacity therefore current output. we estimate latter factor order magnitude around 0,5 percentage point gdp. load-shedding appear contribute general low level business confidence, evident various confidence indices, also evident low growth private sector gross fix capital formation. in 2014, gross fix capital formation contract 0,4 per cent, drive mainly 3,4 per cent contraction investment private sector, account two third capital formation. on positive note, second half year growth positive, reversal strongly negative trend observe first half year. however, supply side constraint low confidence likely constrain strong growth. it worth note favourable fix investment outcome observe 2013 mainly relate renewable energy projects. the main driver growth recent year consumption expenditure households. however, contribution growth 2014 decline one percentage point 0,8 percentage points. while would prefer investment-driven growth, even consumption relatively subdue time, decline 1,4 per cent 2014 compare 2,9 per cent 2013. a concern recent sharp drop consumer confidence, which, accord fnb/ber survey reach level –4 first quarter year, compare average +5. factor undermine consumer confidence include partial reversal boost consumption provide low petrol prices; increase marginal tax rate february budget; high level household indebtedness despite deleveraging; continue weak growth credit extension households. employment growth trend also supportive respect, although wage growth remain relatively high, positive net impact consumption could offset extent negative impact employment relatively high wage growth. bi central bankers’ speech 3 inflation currently well within inflation target band 3–6 per cent. however, focus monetary policy current inflation, something cannot anything about, rather inflation trajectory relevant policy horizon, i.e. time period monetary policy impact inflation around 12–18 month ahead. headline cpi inflation accelerate 4,5 per cent april, mid-point target range. the main driver annual increase house utility (1,3 percentage points), miscellaneous good service (1,1 percentage points) well food non-alcoholic beverage (0,8 percentage points). on monthly basis headline cpi inflation increase 0.9 percentage points, recent low 3,9 per cent february mainly attributable previous decline petrol price, largely reversed. a note monetary policy statement last week, inflation expect accelerate come months, expect rise 6,8 per cent average quarter thus temporarily breach upper end headline inflation target range first quarter 2016. the cpi inflation rate expect average 6,1 per cent 5,7 per cent 2016 2017, respectively. core inflation forecast average 5,4 per cent 5,2 per cent out two year persistence measure largely attribute high level wage growth, currency depreciation inflation expectation anchor upper end target range. there number upside risk outlook. the main one emanate exchange rate, give rand’s sensitivity imminent u feed monetary tightening. south africa, along emerge market wide current account fiscal deficit see particularly vulnerable. however, great deal uncertainty regard. how much already price exchange rate? will weaken temporary overshoot? to extent offset qe eurozone japan? we also recognise domestic factor also play role, include persistently wide current account deficit, weak growth outlook uncertainty arise bind electricity constraints. and finally, regard, uncertainty regard degree pass-through depreciation inflation. we see far mute pass-through past years, previous episode rand depreciation bank estimate actual pass-through could half assume forecast model. the uncertainty whether represent form structural change, whether cyclical – case increase growth pick – whether inflexion point exist, beyond inflation accelerate. a issue relate electricity prices. there uncertainty follow application nersa 25 per cent increase electricity tariffs. the bank’s model previously incorporate increase around 13 per cent, effective 1 july 2015, high increase granted, see upside pressure inflation. the backdrop provide difficult challenge monetary policy. it clear main pressure inflation supply side shocks, rather demand pressure easy deal monetary policy. at time, growth outlook remain highly constrained. we, however cannot simply ignore supply side developments, could allow inflation expectation become unanchored. furthermore, mpc concern persistence medium term inflation outlook heighten level significant upside risk outlook, include electricity tariff increases, exchange rate level wage settlements. our focus therefore sharply possible second round effect shock see spill generalise inflation. monetary policy accommodative, appropriate light weak real economy. we however hike cycle deteriorate inflation outlook may necessitate policy action window unchanged stance narrowed. the pace normalisation however influence data. 4 bi central bankers’ speech regulatory reform a doubt aware, bank’s mandate broaden explicitly include financial stability. follow global financial crisis, become clear price stability necessary, insufficient condition financial stability become explicit mandate central bank many countries. while price stability mandate sarb clearly define measureable, mandate financial stability much broad share responsibility stakeholders. national treasury publish policy document february 2011 title a safe financial sector serve south africa better, outline government’s decision shift twin peak model financial sector regulation. the twin peak model financial sector regulation represent move away fragment regulatory approach base institution activity towards regulatory supervision model base objectives. it envisage that, fully implemented, twin peak system regulation focus harmonise system licensing, supervision, enforcement, customer complaints, appeal review mechanism, consumer advice education. national treasury publish second draft financial sector regulation bill december 2014. this bill propose confer upon bank responsibility financial stability oversight market infrastructure payment systems. it propose establishment two regulators, namely prudential authority within bank new financial sector conduct authority. the prudential authority would supervise safety soundness banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, market conduct authority would supervise way financial service firm conduct treat customers. this reform form part current broad overhaul global regulatory system aim address too-big-to-fail problem systemically important financial institutions, build resilient financial institutions, reduce opacity over-the-counter derivative markets, mitigate impact shadow bank financial stability, enhance financial benchmark transparency, promote convergence account standards. within theme number regulatory initiatives, regulation systemically important financial institution too-big-to-fail problem, basel iii proposal basic capital requirement insurer strengthen theme build resilient financial institutions. the bank’s main activity financial stability arena currently include develop implement recovery resolution plan systemically important financial institutions, introduce macroprudential toolkit policy instrument contain risk associate imbalance financial system, apply top-down stress test framework bank sector south africa. although bank’s financial stability mandate distinct price stability mandate, careful consideration continuously give interaction bank’s monetary policy financial stability objectives. this coordination facilitate cross-membership bank’s monetary policy financial stability committee structures. the main risk global domestic environment might impact stability domestic financial system monitor continuously term possible mitigate action include possibility severe electricity supply disruptions, volatility risk aversion global financial markets, protract period slow growth euro area, low growth domestic economy escalation global geopolitical tensions. these possible scenario potential threat financial stability rat accord likelihood occurrence expect impact domestic financial system. the result capture risk assessment matrix publish late financial stability review release end april. this publication aim analyse bi central bankers’ speech 5 potential risk financial stability stimulate debate pertinent financial stability issues. conclusion it clear although global recovery start gain momentum continue erratic number downside risk global economic growth outlook. the recent partial rebound price crude oil ameliorate benefit arise early sharp decline. a risk possible grexit geopolitical risks. on domestic front, growth continue disappoint, medium term growth outlook likely constrain due bind electricity constraints. the inflation outlook deteriorate uncomfortable level recently inflation expectation remain close upper-end target notable upside risk outlook. the scale regulatory reform process way probably significant overhaul financial regulatory architecture last decades. despite ambitious scale, bank make good progress prepare take new responsibility set financial sector regulation bill. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 françois groepe: south africa’s structural unemployment challenge – important issue address place south africa sustainable growth path effort reduce unemployment level address mr françois groepe, deputy governor south african reserve bank, occasion release 14th uasa south african employment report, johannesburg, 30 april 2015. * * * chairperson, lady gentlemen, i please part proceed day, gather release 14th uasa employment report. this publication grow stature year earn place amongst various high-level publication inform state south african labour market. this morning, i shall focus important issue address place south africa sustainable growth path effort to, amongst others reduce unemployment levels. south africa counts, among key challenges, high level structural unemployment exacerbate level poverty inequality country. these challenges, turn, give rise host socio-economic socio-political challenges. early policies, accelerate share growth initiative (asgisa) (2006), well recent long-term vision south africa, capture national development plan first release 2012, highlight requirement economic growth excess 5 per cent sustain basis meaningfully make inroad towards reduce high level unemployment. prior global financial crisis 2008/09, progress make reduce overall level unemployment country strong global local economic growth result high level output lead increase demand labour. south africa, fact, experience one long period uninterrupted economic growth – 55 quarter growth average 3 5,6 per cent annually. a global economic growth recover financial crisis, albeit hesitantly unevenly, south africa lag behind, grow rate well potential, negatively impact strain relation industrial action, also structural deficiency electricity load shedding. while south africa perform well manage largely contain inflation, within inflation target range, doubt assist part low international food oil prices, country le successful match level growth experience develop countries. within brics partnership, south africa small economy term gross domestic product population size low level average growth employment past decade. of concern fact south africa continue experience level inequality rank amongst elevate world. all indicator require renew focus basic driver development, education enhancement intervention directly address structural barrier growth employment. broadly speaking, effective solution focus stimulate growth key industries, industry lag actively engage appropriate policies. such policy improve micro-foundations economic growth, include education skill training, industrial trade policy, labour market policy competition policy. along line national development plan (ndp) central focus elimination unemployment, poverty inequality 2030. within plan, nine main challenge highlighted, namely: 2 bi central bankers’ speech • the elevate level unemployment; • the standard education, large proportion learner arguably undesirable quality; • infrastructure, always optimally located, time under-maintained insufficient foster high growth rates; • spatial pattern exclude poor benefit development; • an economy could describe overly unsustainably resource intensive; • a widespread disease burden compound challenge face public health system; • public service uneven often certain circumstance inadequate quality; • the corruption level perceive wide spread; • the perception exist regard division within broad society. the ndp provide useful framework issue address systematic structure manner government actively pursue implementation. the challenge remain alignment medium-term short-term plan government effort effectively implement ndp. the adoption cabinet medium term strategic framework 2014 2019 outcome ndp clear evidence government’s commitment towards successful implementation ndp. the key pillar medium term strategic framework comprise following: • infrastructure programme must lead crowd productive investment government spend boost demand goods, lead increase private demand new output sources, factories; • growth employment productive sector economy supported; • red tape unintended consequence regulation reduced; • skill planning, address need economy, improved; • the level employment agriculture increased; • growth investment support sustainable fiscal policies; • strong partnerships, business labour, build workplace conflict reduced; • public employment programme scale up; • economic opportunity historically exclude vulnerable group expanded; • investment research, development innovation supported. return ndp, part broad development agenda, business investment identify cornerstone create 11-million job eliminate poverty south africa 2030. it set target reduce unemployment rate current level 25 per cent 14 per cent 2020 6 per cent 2030 increase labour force participation rate 54 per cent 65 per cent. per caput income also envisage increase around r50 000 around r120 000 per year. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the ndp suggest labour regulation relax effort encourage business enterprise employ easily, well low entry-level wage facilitate high uptake young people job market. some proposal plan doubt fall within area public discourse possible contestation require continue intense negotiation among social partner effort reach broad consensus order secure implementation. the plan take pragmatic broad-based approach challenge south africa face eradicate unemployment. the role plan see government’s intervention permeate willingness work private sector, plan lean towards le regulation economy. the plan envisage small expand company create around 90 per cent new employment opportunity economy next 20 years. this place south africa step global employment trends. small firm would benefit bold proposal drastically reduce so-called “red tape” improve employment practice procedures. the ndp strive towards economy enable business entry expansion, focus credit market access. cognisance take fact inclusive growth strategy harness creativity, innovation competitiveness private sector unlikely succeed. regulatory reform support advocate plan intention boost mass entrepreneurship. the topic strain labour relation also addressed, indicate inconceivable, economy evolve labour-intensive structure tension employer labour persist. way need find reduce probability occurrence lengthy strikes, experience last year. these tension need deal transparent honest manner amend labour legislation, order conducive enhance labour absorb growth. a social partners, re-establish trust among themselves, go way towards process reinforce social pact. central proposition make ndp relate job market, statement 20-year horizon wage growth need link productivity growth feasible sustain labour absorb path, unless grow tandem. in effort enhance labour absorption rate economy, plan already lead reduction initial cost employ young labour-market entrants, implementation employment tax incentive, act 26 2013 come effect 1 january 2014. this initiative compliment government’s measure create job young worker special economic zone offer tax incentive employer encourage employment workers. this initiative, accord minister finance, lead 200 000 young people employed, significantly excess government’s initial expectation 70 000 within six month implementation. furthermore, newly introduce change labour legislation, general, hold promise improve function labour market, good address discrimination, advance approach equal pay work equal value. these change benefit young people, result equitable labour relation environment general. over focus job market, ndp also advance frank recommendation area education, health public sector, part creation nurture enable environment business prosper. a set integrate action propose address issue inefficiency challenge relate public service delivery. to improve educational outcomes, plan directly confront issues, teacher performance, appointment procedure accountability. the challenge public health management also address build capable state, detail recommendation make professionalise public service. some area government, improvement occurred, south african revenue 4 bi central bankers’ speech service improvement operational procedures, management delivery system emulate organ state. an initiative worth mention term already improve process public sector introduction e-portal 1 april 2015 reshape south african government supply chain processes, particularly relate government tenders. it envisage public eventually able see tenders, bidder price quoted, well minute bid committee meetings. over e-portal, national database approve compliant supplier “online shop”, government department place order le r500 000, established. initiative laudable contribute towards increase efficiency service delivery essential improve growth prospects. the focus within ndp eradication corruption system welcome, take cognisance fact state official act corrupt fashion, require will counter party private sector necessary. the introduction government’s new tender process, already mentioned, go long way expose limit possible corruption within system. the ndp recognise need increase fix investment economy set target raise level gross fix capital formation around 20 per cent gdp currently, high 30 per cent 2030. inarguably, well-planned appropriate infrastructural development conducive high level economic growth job creation. the ndp clearly distinguish investment generate immediate financial returns, airport power station project financial return far le measurable, school hospitals. the role business increase overall level fix investment country appropriately lie area fix investment financial return evident, public private partnerships. international experience show private sector participation infrastructure provision successful transport energy sectors. the participation private sector contribute effective cost containment profit motive, improve efficiency lead sustainable job ambitious skill transfer initiatives. an area, private sector excel, give appropriate incentives, research development could act driver competitiveness job creation. a number large r&d project already show feasibility ability develop new industries, create substantial opportunity increase employment, foreign revenue income, beneficiation competitiveness. many infrastructure investment project act attractive asset class private investors, due predictable nature returns, thereby provide low risk investment profile. infrastructure investment project may provide mean whereby consistent real return inflation attain low volatility investment vehicle. private sector fund is, however, subject policy certainty private investor assure able realise return investments. the ndp propose regulatory impact assessment do new regulations, expert panel appoint prepare comprehensive regulatory review small- medium-sized firm effort ass whether special condition require entities. to end, new unit create presidency carry thorough impact assessment new exist legislation regulation within social economic impact assessment system ensure alignment ndp reduce risk unintended consequences. the continue drive towards establishment viable renewable energy sector south africa support example area small business could rapidly gain traction, country become incline embrace green growth development approach, enter so-called solar age. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the proper implementation ndp conducive increase level entrepreneurship economy, ease business improves. the obvious outcome process creation sustainable jobs. small business generally capacity attract low moderately skilled are, therefore, best place recruit among significant pool unemployed workers. the ndp already facilitate bring together various stakeholder economy within environment common purpose. the ndp thus constitute powerful integrate development agenda state whole south africa, plan succeed continuously translate action plans, clear milestone along way, within realistic time frames. to yield relatively swift results, term improve growth, follow two focus area deserve mentioning. the first good integration south african economy africa. this indeed beneficial boost interregional trade, investment capital flows, allow domestic economy tap vibrant growth rate experience rest sub-saharan africa. it estimate effective integration sub-continent could add much 1,5 per cent south africa’s growth rate. furthermore, south africa capitalise comparative advantages, relate physical, financial telecommunication infrastructure attract international firm aspiration gain foothold africa. a study, recently conduct world bank, identify three area opportunity improve country’s export competitiveness, namely, boost local competition open south african market domestic foreign entry; promote deep regional integration good service within africa; alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks. this bring u second factor would meaningfully enhance south africa’s growth potential, namely forceful implementation r1 trillion infrastructure expenditure programme government. through multiplier effects, term job creation, especially regard promotion low-skilled jobs, economic growth materially enhanced. several study show investment economic infrastructure potential act one effective policy term promote economic growth. employment create construction phase infrastructure projects, well operational life thereof. moreover, key driver private sector investment public sector investment inspire business consumer confidence. a combination two drive force potential easily boost south africa’s growth rate well excess current levels, put country high road economic prosperity, thus hopefully reduce unemployment levels, poverty level degree inequality. i believe positively contribute restore dignity fellow south africans. south african time tend fairly pessimistic. the challenge face immense, dissimilar scale extent face develop economy also develop economies. i however choose optimistic believe many factor count favour convince right policy choice go long way towards successfully address triple challenge structural unemployment, poverty inequality. i thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: generate winner microfinance speech mr amando m

* * introduction good evening, welcome south african reserve bank. insead internationally recognise excellence business education. it one large business school world; insead also strong tradition promote diversity, close 90 different nationality represent annual intake. i gather south african alumnus association 580 member attend mba executive level course insead. it pleasure host participate dialogue evening, particularly light fact many senior executive position large company hence important stakeholder address challenge confront country today. the world become increasingly globalised. this clearly evident economic indicator capital movement foreign direct investments, international trade, technology transfers, expansion cross-border activity multinational firms. thus, global consideration always radar screen policymakers, especially small open economy like south africa. in case monetary policy, factor oil price developments, capital flows, global inflation trends, exchange-rate development consideration bear policy stance determination. however, know many would read mpc statement last week, remark today focus policy, least directly. i would rather like use opportunity talk globalise nature central banking. in essence, remark focus financial crisis 2007/08 well role international forum (such g-20, international monetary fund, brics) respond crisis, impact work central banks. this also provide opportunity share involvement south african reserve bank international forums, complement interest-rate set mandate bank. monetary policy crisis much write globalisation might impact work central bank whether weaken effectiveness domestic monetary policy. some argue globalisation indeed dilute monetary policy’s effectiveness impact structure function markets, also pitch global factor prominent driver domestic outcomes. others point benefit emanate risk-sharing reduce volatility financial markets, globalisation, help increase liquidity financial markets, example. a everything, one could argue equally side cost benefit globalisation, but, needle say, impact differ across country region depend on, among others, level development financial markets, openness economies, credibility monetary fiscal authorities. of importance policymaker understand influence risk associate globalisation ensure risk adequately account policy formulation implementation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech lucas papademos, former vice-president european central bank, argue globalisation general fundamentally undermine effectiveness monetary policy preserve price stability. he acknowledge positive effect financial globalisation efficiency financial markets, global risk-sharing and, ultimately, economic growth worldwide, also admit global financial crisis reveal number weakness globalise financial system, tension one segment market one country rapidly spread across market countries.1 the global financial crisis certainly elevate subject globalisation impact world central banking. we first-hand knowledge financial globalisation particular alter monetary policy landscape influence nature magnitude spillover spillbacks. certainly, world central bank undergo dramatic change since 2007: unprecedented reduction policy rate zero low bind beyond, utilisation balance-sheet policy non-traditional ways, become norm advance economies. these action repercussion financial market increase capital flows, among others, emerge market bear brunt developments. we remind emerge market prepare possibility market dislocation give prevail environment divergent policy settings, feed uk path monetary policy tighten euro area japan likely maintain loose policy stance immediate future. besides influence monetary policy, crisis also reveal central bank could long see purely overseer monetary policy mandate broaden explicitly include financial stability. a bank international settlement put it, “the global financial crisis shake foundation deceptively comfortable pre-crisis central bank world”.2 the conventional wisdom hold prior crisis prove inadequate. it generally accept price stability alone insufficient macroeconomic stability. in addition, know neat separation monetary financial stability functions, central bank look economy, automatically lead appropriate global monetary stance. further, interest-rate policy alone enough. the regulation supervision financial institution need go beyond microprudential perspective towards macroprudential orientation, central bank play key role process. it financial crisis bring fore need great global cooperation, among advance economy also emerging-market economy would prove driver global growth crisis. it reason prominence g-20 raise leaders’ summit 2009. there clear recognition need

* introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation bank japan’s branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. look recent economic developments, slowdown emerge economies, particularly china, lead sluggishness japan’s export production. financial market globally volatile background decline chinese stock prices. meanwhile, price front, year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food) 0 percent, due mainly effect substantial decline crude oil price 2014. thus, somewhat stagnant development noticeable since summer, i explain, fundamental japan’s economy sound underlie trend inflation improve steadily. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe), bank introduce april 2013, exert intend effect toward overcome deflation. today, exchange view you, i would like explain bank’s view current situation outlook economic activity prices, well monetary policy. i. economic activity japan abroad current situation outlook japan’s economy let start discuss current situation outlook japan’s economic activity. japan’s economy continue recover moderately virtuous cycle income spend operate corporate household sectors, although export production affect slowdown emerge economies. that is, corporate sector, profit mark record high firms’ fix investment stance positive. in household sector, wage grow – see rise base pay two consecutive year situation unemployment rate decline level regard almost correspond “full employment” – private consumption resilient. the real gdp growth rate april-june quarter 2015 minus 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter basis, register negative figure first time three quarter (chart 1). this due weak export affect mainly recent slowdown emerge economy somewhat sluggish private consumption reflective bad weather. export likely remain le flat time being, due effect slowdown emerge economies. after that, however, likely increase moderately emerge economy move deceleration phase. on basis, japan’s economy expect continue recover moderately, virtuous cycle income spend continue operate corporate household sectors. now, i would like touch two point note observe japan’s economic activity. 2 bi central bankers’ speech robust domestic private demand first, domestic private demand continue robust. in corporate sector, japanese firm improve profitability considerably face various adversity occur since global financial crisis. in addition, correction excessive appreciation yen decline crude oil price since summer 2014, japanese firm make record profits, exceed peak register global financial crisis (chart 2). look ahead, corporate profit expect remain high levels. under favorable earn environment, firms’ fix investment stance positive. lead indicator machinery order construction start also suggest increase business fix investment. firms’ positive fix investment stance could confirm various survey results. accord june tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), business fix investment plan large manufacture firm fiscal 2015 mark high level time year since fiscal 2004, reflect part increase domestic investment appear yen likely remain weak, small firm mark roughly level average since fiscal 2000, suggest robustness. what worth note that, excessive appreciation yen corrected, japanese firm – prioritize foreign investment – seem increase domestic investment. this big change. on back mark improve trend corporate profit effect monetary easing, business fix investment project continue increase moderately. turn household sector, labor market condition tight firm maintain positive stance hiring. the unemployment rate, 4 percent introduction qqe, decline recently register 3.3 percent, low level last see 1997, accompany increase labor force participation rate number employee (chart 3). give always mismatch extent job open job applicant labor market, unemployment rate cannot go 0 percent. estimate base past relation job open job applicant japan, recent unemployment rate 3.0–3.5 percent could regard almost correspond “full employment.” a labor market condition tight, nominal wage increase moderately, albeit fluctuations. in annual labor-management wage negotiation spring, many firm increase wages, include base pay, raise large extent last year (chart 4). this development even spread small firms. since number employee increase nominal wage per employee risen, overall employee income increase moderately. in term household spending, private consumption somewhat sluggish recently, reflect bad weather april-june quarter. nevertheless, employment income situation continue steady improvement consumer sentiment improve trend, private consumption seem remain resilient whole. look ahead, consumption tax hike fiscal year – unlike last fiscal year – crude oil price decline annual basis, wage increase expect exceed price increase thereby real wage expect rise. in situation, private consumption expect resilient. house investment, component household spending, decline follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike, pick evidently since turn year backdrop steady improvement employment income situation. the pick-up likely continue go forward. export overseas economy second, i would like touch export overseas economies. export increase three quarter row since july-september quarter 2014, recently le flat, due mainly effect slowdown emerge economy (chart 5). bi central bankers’ speech 3 they expect remain le flat time being, that, likely increase moderately, support correction appreciation yen date emerge economy move deceleration phase. look closely development overseas economy region, u.s. economy continue recover, underpin household spending. in january-march quarter 2015, economic growth decelerate significantly due transitory factor effect severe winter weather strike west coast ports, clear rebound observe april-june quarter, high growth. against backdrop continue favorable employment income situation, growth momentum seem solid. the federal reserve’s tighten come sight also suggest improvement u.s. economy. the european economy saw continue growth nine consecutive quarter continue recover moderately. a financial assistance greece implemented, global financial markets’ view situation become positive. go forward, effect depreciation euro monetary ease permeate, european economy likely continue recover moderately. while advance economy grow steadily, emerge economy slowing. first, china, recent substantial decline stock price significant impact global financial markets. this could regard correction excessive level stock price double half-year prior decline. nevertheless, real economy also see somewhat slowdown recently. with increase income levels, chinese economy experience phase shift economic structure one center manufacturer one center service sector, lead change high growth medium growth. the recent slowdown consider adjustment excess investment manufacturer phase. the fact investment regional economy weak political, economic, social structural reform carry seem another reason slowdown. under situation, chinese authority provide series economic stimulus measure fiscal monetary fronts. with relatively large room conduct policy measure fiscal monetary fronts, chinese economy likely follow generally stable growth path, albeit somewhat reduce pace. emerge economy china also show sluggishness, reflect spillover effect adjustment china global weakness it-related demand. this sluggishness likely continue time, positive effect growth advance economy spread, economic growth emerge economy expect gradually accelerate, domestic demand pick up, support economic stimulus measures. a main scenario, overseas economies, particularly advance economies, expect continue grow moderately, emerge economy likely move deceleration phase. on basis, although japan’s export expect remain le flat time being, likely increase moderately thereafter. needle say, due attention need pay risk factor include development emerge economy global financial markets. ii. japan’s price development i next talk japan’s price developments. the year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) increase minus 0.5 percent introduction qqe 1.5 percent april 2014, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike. however, somewhat weak development private consumption continue consumption tax hike crude oil price decline substantially summer last year, annual cpi inflation decline 0 percent since turn year (chart 6). the absence acceleration headline cpi inflation attribute negative contribution energy prices. because negative effect, year-on-year rate 4 bi central bankers’ speech increase cpi push 1 percentage point recent months. needle say, unless crude oil price continue decline, negative contribution energy price year-on-year rate increase cpi eventually dissipate. simple arithmetic show negative contribution energy price fall alone push year-on-year rate increase cpi 1 percentage point compare current level. in addition, although effect decline energy price make hard discern, underlie trend inflation steadily improved. for example, year-on-year rate change cpi item le fresh food energy positive 23 consecutive month since october 2013, increase 1.1 percent accord late figure august. behind steady improvement underlie trend inflation firms’ households’ view price changed. the change firms’ households’ view price reveal wage- price-setting behavior. to begin with, spring wage negotiation worker management last year, base pay increase first time two decades. in year’s negotiations, base pay raise second year row, many firm increase large last year (chart 4). base pay increase achieve firm last year become widespread across industry firm different size. a price setting, increase number firm seem able pas increase costs, include rise input price personnel expenses, sale prices. in addition, seem household start accept sale price increase back increase prospect increase wages. there variety evidence firms’ price-hiking behavior become widespread sustain since start fiscal year. for example, look item make cpi (all item le fresh food), share item price rise minus share item price fell rise markedly since begin fiscal year recently reach high level since 2000 (chart 7). in addition, price index compile university tokyo hitotsubashi university aggregate price food daily necessity also show clear price increase since april year year-on-year basis, increase seem accelerating. many firm attempt raise sale price begin last fiscal year, coincide consumption tax hike, follow decline demand. firm therefore force quickly take price rise back. the price change year present clear contrast last year. the simultaneous occurrence base pay increase price hike regard evidence positive feedback loop increase employment wage moderate rise inflation place. give developments, although annual cpi inflation likely 0 percent time being, underlie trend inflation steadily rise negative contribution crude oil price decline dissipating, annual cpi inflation accelerate toward price stability target 2 percent. the time reach around 2 percent project around first half fiscal 2016, note time could either early late projection, depend development crude oil prices. iii. monetary policy go forward the bank pursue qqe, aim achieve state 2 percent inflation rate maintain stable manner. the observe inflation rate could move, reflect various temporary factors; thus, order achieve 2 percent stable manner, underlie trend inflation important. a i describe earlier, trend improve steadily. however, positive feedback loop increase employment wage rise inflation gain momentum order achieve price stability target 2 percent. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices. the bank maintain policy stance that, change trend inflation due manifestation risk factors, make adjustment without hesitation judge necessary achieve price stability target early possible time. conclude remark lastly, i would like touch point i believe important ensure virtuous cycle japanese economy continue work. now firm enjoy record profit labor market full-employment condition. in light mechanism economy, naturally would lead decent economic growth moderate increase wage prices, view i also share. at time, also true pace increase fix investment wage lackluster light record profits. this perhaps deflation protract japan take time change deflationary mindset firm households. with mind, bank continue strongly commit overcome deflation achieve price stability target 2 percent. a i explain several occasions, situation 2 percent target achieve stable manner, current low interest rate environment would last labor shortage would acute. those act early move forward secure opportunity future utilize profit currently hand rewarded, i sure already start act. the mechanism economy surely prevail, bank definitely decisively play role. i conclude remark make promise. thank you. 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’

systemic risk analytics, helsinki, 24 september 2015. * * * original presentation bank finland’s website: slide (pdf). 1. systemic risk – learn hard way [slide 1] [slide 2] the concept systemic risk receive much weight global financial crisis. before crisis, term mainly use within financial stability department central bank among limit number bank finance researchers. the concept mainly use microeconomic model banking, almost non-existent macroeconomic models. a result, structure dialogue two model world respect largely missing. this also reflect policy discussions. before crisis, justify concern potential risk relate micro level phenomenon – securitization credit risk transfer – macro level phenomenon – current account imbalances. however, analysis combine potentially interrelate phenomenon unify framework missing. moreover, banks’ risk management model new regulatory model mimic (the basel ii framework, particular) prevail paradigm base assumption market efficiency complete markets. these model sufficiently inform economics asymmetric information incomplete markets. a consequence shortcomings, many severe incentive problem undermine market efficiency may help fuel bubble take seriously enough. partly result that, global financial crisis take almost researchers, financial institution policy-makers surprise. complex world [slide 3] how improve understand risk vulnerability cause financial crises? one key task good incorporate systemic risk economic models. unfortunately, inconvenient fact model systemic risk reflect complexity real world make model simpler. this systemic risk linear nature. for example, private sector debt relative gdp increase substantially still remain trend, systemic risk may increase much. but ratio keep rise trend level, systemic risk might shoot point.1 1 cf., e.g., jokivuolle, e., j. pesola, m. virén (2015): why credit-to-gdp good measure set countercyclical capital buffers? journal financial stability 18, june 2015, pp. 117–126. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the shoot systemic risk example happen vulnerability firm household external shock enter critical zone. a debt grow, firm household would experience financial distress economy turn down. financial distress may fee back negatively economy consumption investment reduced. at worst, firm household default cause substantial loss financiers, especially banks. if bank also little capital much debt, especially short-term debt, bank may able absorb loss without cut back lending. this add potentially dangerous negative feedback economy. macroeconomic model take step incorporate effects. but work need done. another source complexity real world network bank banks´ bilateral exposures. the network contagion effect difficult analyze due, inter alia, imperfect information counterparty balance sheets.2 after crisis, attention pay network analysis. i certain presentation conference relate network contagion give u many new insights. complex risk – complex rules? [slide 4] if systemic risk complex, imply need complex regulatory rule combat them? not necessarily. while economic model miss important complexity real world prior crisis, regulation finance, particularly banks’ risk-based capital requirements, grow perhaps complex. complex regulation together heterogeneous implementation leave financial institution plenty room regulatory arbitrage even manipulation regulatory account information. this somewhat ironic, increase complexity regulation largely motivate need reduce incentive problem create “flat”, non-risk-based capital requirement early (basel i) framework. after crisis, simple robust regulatory rule develop back complex rules. the forthcoming leverage ratio requirement basel committee´s proposal new simple capital floor banks´ internal risk-based capital requirement example approach. such safeguard provide protection collective model risks, mismeasurement subprime mortgage risk turn systemic problem. ii. macroprudential analysis: policy-maker’s view [slide 5] economic research key role design good regulation. research inform regulator search right balance robustness sophistication regulatory rules. we also need high quality cost-benefit impact analysis regulation order ass effect regulation financial institution markets, and, ultimately, real economy. 2 a recent example use network analysis toivanen, m. (2015): essay credit contagion shock banking. doctoral dissertation, university vaasa. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in addition traditional financial regulatory rule think safeguard financial stability macroprudential policy generally. in holistic approach role analysis research is, possible, even important design traditional microprudential regulatory rules. when talk macroprudential policy, observer yet find useful make distinction regulation. paul tucker, instance, define macroprudential policy “dynamically adjust financial regulation”. give definition, one could argue well-designed stringently implement financial regulation first line defense systemic risks. macroprudential policy – is, dynamic adjustment regulation – important second line defense.3 high-quality analysis reduce inaction bias [slide 6] most economist policy-makers seem agree key objective macroprudential policy provide additional resilience financial institution financial system cyclical structural systemic risk vulnerabilities. but sufficient. we also need macroprudential policy effectively restrain excessive build-up leverage growth household corporate borrow thus dampen credit financial cycles. in euro area, need particularly acute, economic cycle currently diverge across country key monetary policy rate stay low prolong period time. to prevent least dampen potentially destructive financial booms, authority must able take early macroprudential actions. to that, role reliable early warn indicator critical. i welcome strong emphasis conference early warn indicator models. the effective tool dampen credit cycle seem so-called borrower-based instruments, cap borrowers´ loan-to-value (ltv), loan-to-income (lti) debt-service-to-income (dsti) ratios. fix cap ratios, apply many countries, certainly useful. but ideally, macroprudential authority power adjust ratios, necessary, counter-cyclical fashion. of course, challenging: discretionary use borrower-based instrument politically highly sensitive, may lead inaction bias. high-quality analysis research help policy-maker overcome bias: politically sensitive decision base sound indicator- model-based macroprudential analysis. the confident policy-makers quality analyses, easy decide (i) deploy macroprudential tools, (ii) tool use (ii) calibrate them. high-quality analysis research also help policy-makers ass impact different macroprudential measure lending, asset price economic activity. 3 for similar view, see e.g. blanchard (2015) ten takeaway “rethinking macro policy: progress confusion?” http://www.voxeu.org/article/rethinking-macroeconomic-policy-introduction. 4 bi central bankers’ speech macroprudential policy euro area [slide 7] let briefly discus macroprudential policy euro area, macroprudential framework special complementary role national macroprudential authority ecb. in environment, also special need macroprudential analysis research. in euro area, elsewhere, national authority bear main responsibility national macroprudential policies. they always best position detect country-specific systemic risk take appropriate measure address them. these national policy organize differently different countries. in finland, example, designate macroprudential authority financial supervisor, fin-fsa. in many euro area countries, however, national macroprudential authority central bank council domestic authorities. in november last year, ecb take responsibility supervise bank euro area. it le well-known time ecb become ultimate macroprudential decision-maker bank union. more specifically, ecb apply high requirement specific macroprudential tool propose designate national macroprudential authorities, deem suggest national measure inadequate. in euro area, role national macroprudential policy particularly important general also current juncture. there several reason that: first, absence national monetary policy put heighten demand national macroprudential policy reduce domestic systemic risks. second, financial system euro area country highly integrated, different macroprudential risk problem easily rapidly spread across borders. third, current accommodative monetary policy ecb central bank unintended side effect financial system, which, regard serious, need address macroprudential policies. in framework, special need analysis research least follow topics: how big macroprudential risk relate strong interconnectedness euro area financial institution markets? how important cross-border spillover national macroprudential action (and inactions)? how reduce potential inaction bias national macroprudential policies? what big macroprudential risk relate current low interest rate environment? what, any, macroprudential measure policy-makers use reduce potential risks? i challenge research community address issue addition important topic cover conference. bi central bankers’ speech 5 iii. learn lesson fight last war [slide 8] in recent years, rightly so, much regulatory reform research agenda shape experience global financial crisis 2007–2009. but regulatory academic community end look rear view mirror long. i want highlight three recent phenomenon call increase attention. the first recent shift credit intermediation away bank sector debt security market. in many ways, welcome development, especially europe heavy dependence banks. some recent study suggest excessively large bank sector associate low economic growth also high systemic risk.4 in addition, excessive reliance european sme´s bank finance one reason european commission launch plan european capital market union. but, ask jaime caruana recent speech, “is market-driven boom le risky bank-driven boom?”5 we know sure, try find out. second, banking-like activity shift call shadow bank sector, thereby potentially outside perimeter regulatory rules. this may imply new threat financial stability, macroprudential policy may tool deal. the third issue deserve close attention effect digitalization banking, likely wide-ranging. i believe understand potential benefit digitalization, need know risks. iv. conclusion [slide 9] let conclude. a good understand systemic risk – conference also contribute – help policy-makers design good regulation conduct timely effective macroprudential policy generally. with regard static form regulatory rules, research could guide regulator find right balance simplicity comprehensiveness. with regard macroprudential policy require discretionary decisions, reliable analysis research help policy-makers avoid pitfall excessive passivity. however, remain humble. to complement quantitative analysis, continue need sound expert judgment. weak signal risk potential crisis give due consideration. grass root level expert experience valued, encourage speak out. what particularly need expert ability imagine unlikely possible scenario present big threat financial stability. perhaps human resource allocate conduct think experiment regular basis. the result experiment regularly expose discussion top management avoid danger group thinking. i thank attention! 4 see eg. langfield pagano (2015) bank bias europe: effect systemic risk growth. ecb work paper, no. 1797. 5 jaime caruana (2014) macroprudential policy: opportunity challenges. abu dhabi, 9 december 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sabine lautenschläger: reintegrate bank sector society – earn re-establishing trust speech m sabine lautenschläger, member executive board european central bank vice-chair supervisory board single supervisory mechanism, 7th international bank conference “tomorrow’s bank business model – how far new equilibrium”, organise bocconi university, milan, 28 september 2015. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, esteem audience, first let thank organiser conference, especially andrea sironi, kind invitation. i much welcome opportunity elaborate i think currently important question banking: how banker regain trust lose crisis? how bank sector reintegrate society? there doubt banks, banker whole industry experience one bad crisis confidence ever. the turmoil 2008 2009 play major role loss public trust, problem end acute phase crisis. even seven year later, confidence bank sector still low. numerous scandals, like manipulation libor rates, large-scale tax evasion, fraudulent behaviour rogue traders, misconduct sell mortgages, large taxpayer bailouts banks, reinforce perception wrongdoing widespread bank sector. but mistrust confine bank themselves. investor client also le confidence correct function bank sector ability supervisor regulator prevent excessive risk-taking. we worry loss trust bank sector: • it impair proper function bank reallocate resources. • it hamper growth. • it lead instability costly crises. in recent paper, gennaioli et al.1 illustrate role trust play bank compare finance medicine. banking, service like healthcare, “transactions” take place two party differ term information, knowledge technical competence. patient put hand doctor, investors, like patients, would like good hand take advantage of. but trust bank sector restored? who key player process? be enough reform regulatory supervisory framework, do recent years? 1 see gennaioli, n., schleifer, a., vishny, r.w. (2015), “money doctors”, journal finance, vol. 70(1), pp. 91–114. 2 bi central bankers’ speech banks, intermediation trust let start use simplification activity bank explain worthwhile invest regain trust. traditionally, core activity commercial bank take deposit individual surplus resource allocate resource productive activities. bank thereby perform three main functions. first, provide payment settlement service households, entrepreneurs, company financial institutions. second, enable saver reap full benefit long-term investments, still able access liquidity needed. third, ass monitor creditworthiness payment behaviour borrower efficiently individual investor could. through activities, bank reduce inefficiency cause asymmetric information incentive problem save borrow. it mainly via channel, bank create value contribute economic growth. however, even though bank ass monitor borrowers’ creditworthiness, saver may still concern whether bank – management – necessary skill make require effort protect savings. asymmetric information incentive problem still present, arise new, different levels: long saver borrowers, savers, banker supervisors. in relationship bank creditors, incentive conflict may arise manager one side (who set bank’s strategy, make investment decision monitor performance investment project payment behaviour debtors) shareholder debt holder side (who provide bank’s fund bear ultimate risk receive benefit bank’s activities). information problem may also occur among bank link mutual business relationship collective vulnerability systemic events. asymmetric information incentive problem address contracts, institution appropriate regulatory supervisory frameworks. but rather abstract idealise view. in reality, needed: trust needed. the medical analogy handy way illustrate this. patient always sue doctor malpractice. they could always enforce “contract” doctor. however, patient ever consult doctor trust, even though sue him. the apply banking. in general, creditor deposit money bank whose integrity soundness trust. shareholder set remuneration scheme incentivise manager whose activity cannot monitor full time. but shareholder also need trust managers, activity perfectly contractible and, even were, could difficult time-consuming enforce incentive contract court. at point, one could interject that, trust may essential bank past, long case today. our economy society undergo dramatic change recent decades, also affect banks. innovation technological progress reduce need trust situations. computerisation allow bank use data-driven application rather rely expert judgement evaluation creditworthiness borrower price financial products. however, bank business become much complex use be, increase asymmetry information and, hence, need trust. for example, uncommon bank multiple parent-subsidiary structure operate different jurisdiction across globe. some bank product become sophisticate people, even bankers, long fully understand them. by bi central bankers’ speech 3 way, i expect every ceo board member without product understand. today, bank complex manage hard monitor activity difficult understand previously case, asymmetric information incentive problem i mention early prominent ever. in short, trust always essential bank carry activities, foster economic growth add value society. bank always trusting. what do restore trust? give currently low level confidence in, within, banks, need do rebuild trust? the role regulatory reform first, whose job regain trust? in aftermath crisis, significant change make regulatory supervisory framework. reform capital liquidity regulation, risk management, governance resolution regime introduced. moreover, consumer protection enhanced. the regulatory framework good broad base, le vulnerable arbitrage. while much achieved, i would like highlight one piece work particular. last year, financial stability board publish set guideline supervisory interaction bank risk culture. the guideline aim assist supervisor assessment risk culture list number indicator practice indicative overall sound well-balanced approach. these include appropriate “tone top” within bank key factors, accountability, effective internal communication, existence challenge mechanism within decision-making process, incentive employees. supervisor also change since crisis. they stricter, pro-active ass bank much holistic way. topic governance, remuneration risk appetite among key priority every supervisor’s agenda year. in single supervisory mechanism (ssm) example, final stage thematic review governance risk appetite 123 institution directly supervise u fee year’s assessment capital liquidity adequacy banks. our initial find indicate number banks, meet national requirements, comply international best practice regard governance. our key observation include example power concentration individual board member (e.g. hold multiple office chairmanship within group), lack separation bank’s risk audit functions, information asymmetry among board members, instance board simply take enough time discus reflect individual issues. it also apparent bank still early stage implement risk appetite framework therefore still lot work ensure consistent application throughout entire organisation. all issue reduce quality decision-making risk awareness within bank obscure even encourage malpractice. therefore, require bank follow findings. but effort regulator supervisor enough? can trust rebuild simply good credible rules? our finance-medicine analogy suggest answer question no. it doctor hold key earn trust patients. likewise, rebuild trust 4 bi central bankers’ speech bank sector require active engagement banker stakeholders. regulatory supervisory reform necessary, sufficient restore people’s trust banks. my view that, regulatory reform supervisory action certainly necessary lay foundation bank restore trust, regulator supervisor key player process. the main effort regain trust must come bankers, particular banks’ management board tone top well accountability banks’ top management key risk culture staff’s behaviour. without active effort, society start trust again. the necessary process laborious time-consuming; one measure action job, rather complex mixture governance, risk appetite, risk culture behaviour top. the role bank stakeholder restore trust so must banker rebuild trust? first, bank’s management develop viable business model clear long-term perspective. many recent crisis consequence bank target high, risky, short-term gain rather pursue lower, stable, long-term returns. bank refocus core functions: • provide valuable investment opportunity savers, shield liquidity risk, • provide fund need them, assess monitor creditworthiness. financial intermediation simply way garner revenues; also support economic growth thus, ultimately, provide important service society. significant change economic environment recent decade divert bank core functions. it seem combination increase range investment opportunity fund sources, trend towards liberal regulation, increasingly competitive environment cause bank reshuffle priority towards maximise short-term corporate often also personal gain. the change banks’ business model “originate hold” “originate repackage sell”, proverbial spark tinder box set financial crisis, see prime example lose sight goal maximise long-term value. second, bank’s management board must sense responsibility develop bank’s individual risk culture, thus enable deal risk way support long-term business perspective foster transparency accountability. every bank need strong cultural base, embody bank’s essence aspiration embrace role profit-oriented organisation without neglect relevance well-being national economy finance individual corporations. • this strong cultural base serve share value framework throughout organisation. • on top foundations, every bank need clear risk-taking policies, allow reach business objectives, ensure risk-taking activity beyond institution’s risk appetite identify address timely manner. • to complement this, must clear governance arrangement define process responsibility decision-making, risk management, control audit. bi central bankers’ speech 5 • lastly, bank require well-functioning communication mechanism it system link bank’s decision-making, risk management control organ together, convey information needed, help create awareness transparency bank’s objectives, policy value throughout organisation. change exist culture way organisation think business clearly major challenge. in particular, time bank sector whole comprehensively rethink value embody culture lives.2 although progress achieve recently, much still needed. in context, i welcome continue initiative policy-makers stimulate progress area. for example, may year, g-7 finance minister central bank governor urge financial stability board begin develop bankers’ “code conduct” complement exist guidance. third, banks’ senior management board create adequate incentive schemes, include remuneration policies, promote long-term perspective within organisation. we witness many scandal recent years, many case misconduct responsible party sufficiently hold accountable. we witness bank cooperate reluctantly criminal investigations, see interest group reject outright attempt reform remuneration bank sector. regain trust easy. bank manager must convince public reward socially beneficial behaviour, unacceptable behaviour credibly sanctioned, top.3 most importantly, people need believe manager truly responsible conduct report them. to achieve turnaround public sentiment, work bank must believe value sustainable business model ethical behaviour. the tone top key endeavour – message must everything legal also legitimate bank interest legitimate business. this may require considerable revision human resource policies, too. • for start, senior management could think introduce new recruitment train guideline indicate sort talent personality hire bank’s value teach employees. • a well-balanced combination monetary non-monetary incentive place. staff reasonable compensation development option align behaviour exhibit implement bank’s desire value culture. remuneration, performance evaluation promotion system calibrate way reward client orientation, long-term value creation sound risk management practice rather short-term revenues. one possibility could extend even exist claw-back time bonus discourage unacceptable behaviour, possibly seven years. • staff face clear rule responsibility, liability integrity subject proportionate follow-up disciplinary measure case infringements. 2 for discussion role culture financial industry interaction monetary incentive shape behaviours, see lo, a.w. (2015), “the gordon gekko effect: the role culture financial industry”, nber work paper, no 21267. 3 on importance “cleansing” sector adverse practice behaviour order “reintegrate” bank society, see hartmann, p. (2015), “financial reform transition”, evanoff, d., haldane, a. kaufman, g. (eds.), the new international financial system: analyze cumulative impact regulatory reform, hackensack, nj: world scientific publishing. 6 bi central bankers’ speech last, least, expectation bank shareholder critical key re-establishing trust. their demand high return put pressure bank induce embark risky business activities. hence, effort restore trust cannot successful without correspond change attitude among shareholders. they must understand thing “free lunch”. properly adjust risk, shareholder may actually good bank behave cooperatively achieve high level trust. the role bankers’ self-interest have identify possible action banker take restore trust, important question remains. why banker ever take actions? be interest? a i stress before, trust essential function bank sector. without trust, bank cannot function properly. this negative consequence rest economy, also negatively affect bank themselves. there several channel lack trust negatively affect banks. first, potential root cause crises. crisis usually lead significant often long-lasting contraction bank profits, seen, instance, large drop s&p 500 index bank sector. moreover, usually follow “aggressive” regulatory response constrain bank activities. second, lack trust negatively impact relationship regulator banks. the interaction tend become adversarial. regulator become le will listen banker take view business account. third, lack trust bank banker usually translate negative sentiment towards entire industry. this, turn, negative implication business. customer may leave, difficult recruit talent. but negative sentiment repercussion banks’ business prospects, also affect social stand bankers, whose image often tarnish society. conclude remark let conclude. the recent crisis stark reminder bank trusting. the dramatic change bank environment bring financial innovation technological progress diminish role trust banking. any lack trust significantly impair function bank sector prevent bank contribute economic growth. a lack trust also negatively affect banks’ business profitability. it banks’ collective interest restore preserve high level trust in, within, bank sector. rebuild trust long complex process. it certainly require effort part regulator supervisors, lot achieve there. but, ultimately, analogy trust doctor patient make clear, heavy lift do bank – senior managements, board shareholder – themselves. there plenty doing. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: monetary policy lesson financial crisis – remark dinner speech mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, snb research conference, organise swiss national bank, zurich, 24 september 2015. * * * it pleasure share think topic conference. let start word caution. i think yet position draw firm lessons. the final verdict many aspect crisis way policy-makers, include central bankers, react – globally respective jurisdiction – still out. therefore, somewhat le ambitiously, please allow offer remark conference topic. base experience, overarch challenge face major central bank term response recent financial crisis capture two insights. first, crisis intensify global level, face trade-off see long time, namely prevent meltdown financial system without cause undue harm incentive constraint vital importance function market-based economies. the pre-crisis macroeconomic debate spend considerable time effort explain negative supply side shock could present central banker difficult decision: whether stabilise inflation cost slow growth further, patient bring inflation back target cost destabilise inflation expectations. we think situation like bad scenario central bankers. therefore, finally face post-lehman brother meltdown different – far serious – decision handle panic preserve incentives, require experience deal had, extent, lost. we could consult history book – recurrent financial crisis 19th century regularly haunt central banker – macroeconomic textbooks. second, global meltdown successfully prevented, second type trade-off emerged, typical balance sheet recessions.1 what essentially happen banks, emerge painfully liquidity crisis, start deleverage actively attempt structurally reduce liquidity need shed excess exposures. the deleveraging additional downside force contribute slump. in situation, central banker tear two priorities. you want bank reduce excess exposures, precondition economy return healthy growth. in words, would like bank deleverage orderly way. at time, face danger that, aggregate level, type credit contraction undermine demand severely, deep contraction make difficult impossible central bank deliver price stability mandate. true, also argue central bank leeway – within mandate – facilitate need adjustments. for example, time horizon normalise inflation generally set calendar time, often make conditional shocks. this allow central bank accept disinflation – long – transition would tolerate different balance sheet conditions. but limit this. the reason central bank give mandate express term numerical objective 1 for details, see speech entitle monetary policy balance sheet adjustment deliver ecb forum central bank sintra 27 may 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech inflation legislature realise central banks’ discretion constrained. their reaction function make predictable within horizon realistic and, time, verifiable electorates. so, role monetary policy scenario? maintain accommodative policy stance long certainly carry significant risks. incentive timely balance sheet repair may undermine new imbalance may ultimately emerge. still, central bank remain true mandate ensure price stability. this mandate interpret symmetric mandate. too low inflation, even deflation, prolong period time cannot see consistent price stability. this overarch challenge, i see it, i come back element involve detail. i turn three specific remark global relevance, i make two conclude observation specific euro area. a. general remark at global level, financial crisis create environment many central bank resort unconventional measure conventional instrument, short-term policy rate, become constrain low bound. in jargon paper write crisis, simple say happened: many central bank hit famous zero low bind (zlb). the euro area, i mention end, reach low bind different avenue. and end point journey, know, zero, negative point. remark 1: the zlb constraint turn bind previously thought. what pre-crisis consensus? a concern unite states, let quote paper entitle “have we underestimate likelihood severity zero low bind events?”, write john williams co-author work board governor federal reserve system.2 the paper document prediction fed’s frb/us model (a large-scale macroeconometric model) frequency duration zlb episodes. the key find that, “if monetary policy follow prescription standard taylor (1993) rule inflation target 2 percent, federal fund rate would near zero 5 percent time “typical” zlb episode would last four quarters”. moreover, “the zlb would relatively minor effect macroeconomic performance policy assumptions.” with regard euro area, may recall zero low bind consideration relevant concern ecb’s strategy review 2003. at time, govern council clarify that, within ecb’s definition price stability positive inflation rate 2%, would aim maintain inflation rate “below, close to, 2%” medium term. this clarification see offer safety margin away zero nominal interest rate zero negative inflation rates. in spirit, overview background study conclude “most available study indicate likelihood [of hit zlb] decrease low level objective central bank set inflation rate 1%”.3 these quote describe view prevail prior crisis. but today, unite states, nearly seven year ago bind reached. and euro area, seven year collapse lehman brothers, still struggle headline inflation near zero. most likely, still take time govern council’s aim 2 chung, h., laforte, j.-p., reifschneider, d. williams, j.c., “have we underestimate likelihood severity zero low bind events?”, journal money, credit banking, 44, 2012, pp. 47–82. 3 background study ecb’s evaluation monetary policy strategy, european central bank, november 2003. bi central bankers’ speech 3 level close 2% reached. current ecb staff projection foresee inflation 1.7% end projection horizon, 2017. so, overlook pre-crisis times? go beyond fact crisis catch u “culturally unprepared” i try say before, answer combination factors. at deep level, model shape much great moderation period. they lack structural relationships, propagation mechanism shock become globally relevant since onset crisis. one example may suffice make point: likelihood zlb event depend strongly assume equilibrium real rate. a level 2%, assumption often make pre-crisis models, far “innocent”: if estimate frequency low bind hit shock model whose steady state nominal interest rate 4%, real rate equilibrium assume 2% 2% steady state inflation, occurrence zero negative interest rate much few start steady state 3% (2% inflation 1% natural rate). with hindsight, seem safe point model large lack feature like non-trivial financial side, sufficient consideration demographic development deep global linkages. in sum, seem general design mainstream pre-crisis model make inadequate interpret crisis, also fact rely data mostly draw time great moderation. remark 2: at low bound, monetary policy remain effective via non-standard measures. before crisis, central banker aware non-standard monetary policy would require main policy rate reach zero low bound. however, effectiveness policy take given. prominent line research, example, debate irrelevance central bank asset purchases.4 today, benefit several year experience implement policies, central bank show policy effective. they demonstrate monetary policy necessary toolkit influence yield curve along different horizons, include use forward guidance. indeed, capability act counterargument proposal zlb restriction overcome via adoption high inflation target. it seem hurdle suggestion become even higher. a shift high inflation target would raise significant credibility issue ‒ also remember prevail definition price stability welfare foundation.5 everything else equal, high inflation objective inevitably come together distortion harmful welfare perspective. meanwhile, still further understand many feature characterise non-standard measures. empirically, estimate effect measure activity inflation vary sizeably across studies. and inflation remain central banks’ target many jurisdictions. at conceptual level, discussion shadow rate measure show difficult find metric make various dimension large-scale asset purchase comparable ordinary rate cuts. we grow accustom measure stance taylor rules. but central bank intervene long end curve, stimulus inject intervention escape simple taylor metric, centre short end low bind binds. the shadow rate 4 eggertsson, g. woodford, m., the zero bind interest rate optimal monetary policy, brook paper economic activity, 2003, 1, pp. 139–211. 5 schmitt-grohe, s. uribe, m. optimal fiscal monetary policy sticky prices, journal economic theory, 2004, 114, pp. 198–230. 4 bi central bankers’ speech attempt re-establish status short-term interest rate signal monetary condition include information unconventional policy alter broad finance conditions. the idea appealing. but need test new measure – yield disperse measure stance – use policy work. the potential cost side-effects shift long end yield curve also matter controversy. for example, profession need good understand distributional implication quantitative ease (qe), although seem clear policy inaction environment low growth high unemployment also distributional consequences. in sum, see unconventional measure effective term arrest disinflation, prevent fear slide deflation support aggregate demand. but fair say need understand transmission order see whether qe retain instrument that, conventional, play valuable reliable role toolbox central bank make recourse. remark 3: zlb non-conventional policy pose extra challenge vis-à-vis normalisation. look ahead, monetary policy tighten cycle eventually commences, likely different challenge previous cycles. just try picture recent history policy rate major central bank chart. that chart would look odd y-axis x-axis: major economies, zero feature long value policy rate before. this make u think non-linearity impart low bind generally think apply policy rate way may exert, different reasons, impact also way low bound. the economy may get use number. for one thing, rate increase carefully align normalisation central bank balance sheets. there division task instrument think organised: portion accommodation remove – quite conventionally – raise short-term rates, portion active management portfolios, i.e. apply control pressure long-term rates. the profile evolution short-term rate shape term structure probably look different previous normalisation cycles. the ecb long way challenges, central bank confront i speak. b. euro-area specific remark in respect euro area, general remark require modification. for brevity, let focus two aspects. remark 4: the ecb hit low bind late many central banks, zero low bound, negative low bound. similarly, resort late stage large-scale asset purchases. it stand ecb’s monetary policy become distinctly unconventional early stage – least adoption fixed-rate full allotment tender refinance operation back 2008, short incursion unknown territory already 2007. moreover, practice late expand long horizons, policy rate still stand firmly positive levels. this approach naturally develop view predominantly bank-based nature euro area financial system. it lead rather passive mode liquidity injection, much tradition lender-of-last-resort function central bank. this important tradition owe much henry thornton walter bagehot. but read bagehot without know zlb affect ability central bank provide stimulus condition insufficient aggregate demand. the ecb adopt active control balance sheet development much late stage, course last year, ultimately lead adoption expand asset purchase programme (app). through app, via reliance outright purchases, ecb regain direct control size balance sheet. and bi central bankers’ speech 5 context short-term rate effectively reach low bind configuration. i think little disagreement that, term stimulate demand, precondition realise maximum impact large-scale purchase security various type maturity via rebalancing signal effects. let briefly elaborate i say short-term rate “effectively” reach low bind configuration. the pre-crisis view, focus “zero” low bind create mislead label. give interest rate sight deposit hold swiss national bank (snb) currently stand minus 75 basis points, rule constraint bind strictly zero. in euro area, interest rate deposit facility stand minus 20 basis points. we get use fact money market rate (as well good range interest rates) negative. so, one thing surely learn “zero rather something minus”. in particular sense, “zero” low bind turn le bind previously thought. in euro area, negative rate powerful propagate policy stimulus two reasons.6 first, term available policy instruments, negative rate can, certain extent, see substitute quantitative interventions. bring overnight interest rate negative level already june last year de facto mean start generate effect – certain degree – one expect see quantitative policies. second, negative rate policy complement channel app operates. a negative rate bank reserve inducement bank lend money balance avoid tax would otherwise pay them. this lead increase velocity circulation cash reserves, another way trigger acceleration portfolio rebalancing effect key component transmission asset purchase real economy. remark 5: go forward, effectiveness monetary policy improve complete european monetary union. ha describe special sequence ecb’s unconventional monetary policy measure appropriate? to answer question, recall euro area distinct characteristics. and, currency union, many way incomplete. in language “five presidents’ report”, “europe’s economic monetary union (emu) today like house build decade partially finished. it high time reinforce foundation turn emu mean be”. this diagnosis explain why, look back, measure first resort jurisdiction measure last resort euro area. in particular, clear that, euro area, central bank purchase sovereign debt raise additional question quasi-non-issues consolidate nation states. and, go forward, diagnosis also make clear euro area face extra challenges. we find right balance markus brunnermeier recently describe “stimulus versus reform debate” european economic association conference mannheim.7 a i say occasion, similar spirit, need bring together two different macroeconomic

malaysia), malaysian economic convention “financial governance economic growth”, kuala lumpur, 28 september 2015. * * * it indeed honour speak distinguish audience. it also great pleasure morning join colleague economics fraternity 2015 malaysian economic convention. to begin, let share story. twenty year ago, 28 january 1986, nasa space shuttle challenger launched. seventy-three second flight, spectator horrify space shuttle break apart fiery display disintegrate atlantic ocean. seven astronaut died. the catastrophe trace failure single o-ring – simple seal joint one rocket boosters. the o-ring fail due unusually cold temperature morning launch. relative highly sophisticate technology involve build launch shuttle, o-ring consider establish technology, one patent history 90 year time challenger launched. it ironic instructive complex machine, incorporate advance aerospace technology time, fail combust due component trivial basic o-ring. six year later, michael kremer, economist harvard university, formulate o-ring theory economic development1. accord him, strategic complementarity sufficiently strong within system, o-ring effect create low-production traps. financial time columnist tim hartford relate kremer’s theory concept weak links2. when system strong element interdependence, weak link begin multiplicative effect, rather additive effect, overall outcome system. a musical band good least experience player. a dance troupe synchronise bad dancer. today’s economy financial system undoubtedly become intricately interlink across agents, market nations. this progression bring benefit unlock new synergy uncover diverse source growth. however, increase interdependence also increase potential o-ring type effects. any single component within complex web economic financial relationship become weak link system, highly detrimental effect system’s stability economic growth. the financial crisis 2008–2009 advance economy good illustration o-ring weak link, whereby seemingly small segment u financial system – subprime mortgage market – trigger economic crisis reverberate around world effect still felt today. in many ways, build-up vulnerability lead crisis arise series bad financial decision make borrowers, bankers, investor regulators. this bring forth importance sound financial governance fundamental element robust economy financial systems, one ensure possibility existence weak link within system minimised. 1 kremer, m.

(2015). teamwork give u add personbyte. financial time 19 june 2015. 2 bi central bankers’ speech today, i would like discus three inter-related issue relevant theme conference. first briefly, issue global financial governance. then i focus great length relationship financial governance economic growth national level. the third final part remark cover governance finance. global financial governance: lack urgency let start global financial governance. i brief much discussion elsewhere various platforms. since demise bretton wood system 1970s, global monetary financial system become integrate sophisticated, global financial governance change little. the financial crisis advance economy year since clearly delineate fault line global system accentuate dire lack effective global financial governance. one would think would great sense urgency collaborate ensure weak link system wide-spread contagion. unfortunately, sense urgency. at core, global system remain uneven, unanchored unorganised. let elaborate. first, foundation international financial architecture uneven. a everyone aware, reliance u dollar reserve currency extension, over-concentration risk u economy financial system. the burden adjustment asymmetrical across country – deficit surplus countries, debtor creditor government private sector. despite high contribution emerge economy world growth, global policy priorities, decision make standard set remain largely domain advance economies. second, system unanchored crisis prone. with guideposts, automatic corrective mechanism coordination facilitate adjustment, system prone excess perpetually face disequilibrium conditions, result persistent global imbalance term current capital accounts, unsustainable build-up debt. with mean correct itself, adjustment often occur costly upheaval form balance payment financial crises. third, system unorganised inadequate global response mechanisms. there neither effective platform establish framework policy coordination crisis containment, management resolution. there also true global lender last resort imf limit resources. this lead rise governance innovation amongst many economies, include malaysia neighbours. since asian financial crisis 1997, various initiative foster strong regional cooperation, include information share alternative liquidity support arrangement bilateral regional scope. while effort reinforce region’s defence external shocks, reduce vulnerability individual economy external shocks. be fault line global monetary financial system widen, guarantee emerge economy like drag crevices. give lack global initiative close fault lines, economy like malaysia must ensure house strong. we must build-up defence resilience withstand volatility headwind create global economic financial environment. one important source resilience sound financial governance level society: government, corporate sector household sector. financial governance: foundation sustainable economic growth financial governance set stage sound financial decision-making. broadly defined, strong financial governance sum many part include strong institutions, efficient processes, effective rules, regulation norms. it affect way financial decision bi central bankers’ speech 3 made, include decision relate save spending, borrow lending, investment profit distribution, relevant economic agents, households, business governments. soundness financial governance critical prerequisite sustainable growth economy. have say that, also recognise process economic growth outcome system highly complex adaptive, country’s economy, polity society – institution underpin – embed within complex network interdependencies. therefore, cannot one-size-fits-all prescription constitute good financial governance economies. nevertheless, i believe recognise presence absence good financial governance base broad characteristics. in regard, three key inter-related feature typically present good financial governance. firstly, effective financial governance ensure financial decision take account externality arise decisions. financial decision often consequence fully bear decision maker. financial decision may appear rational individual level, may fact collectively unsustainable. for instance, corrupt practice may optimal individual perspective, clearly detrimental welfare society economy. in order avoid misallocation resources, externality internalise either align incentive decision maker; introduce representative decision-making process; put place appropriate institutional arrangements; effectively enforce laws, rule regulations; occasionally, societal norms. secondly, sound financial governance encourage discipline adhere budget constraint. all economic agent bind inter-temporal budget constraints, adherence make financial decision key sustainability. this particular relevant repercussion financial decision fall party represent – example, decision shift large debt burden onto future generations. thirdly, strong financial governance robust external check balances. to ensure sound decision making, especially externality involved, decision makers, decision make process, must subject scrutiny external parties. in regard, accountability, transparency, empowerment external party take consequential action key effective financial governance. all principle apply fully management public finances. sound public financial governance legitimate use authority management country’s financial resource integrity promote sustainable development. at heart all, sound governance practice government trace back concept articulate french enlightenment political philosopher (baron de) montesquieu 18th century. the separation power legislative, executive judicial arm government safeguard authority excessively centralise particular party. it effective separation power provide check balance ensure strong financial governance level government. it effective separation power ensure decision maker consider self-interest also society large. it effective separation power ensure risk abuse misuse public fund minimized. therefore, want know state public financial governance country, first question ask whether effective separation power. to great extent, current state public finance reflect past track record financial governance public sector. if state fiscal health crisis-affected economy good condition, monetary policy would much heavy lifting, qe may see light day, may good economic growth. when imbalance macroeconomic policies, 4 bi central bankers’ speech policy use substitute structural reforms, long-term outcome always sub-optimal, least distortion imbalance created. it certainly case recent crisis key factor behind increase government indebtedness. in aftermath crisis, government crisis affect economy use public fund rescue trouble banks. for example, ireland government debt gdp ratio 24% 2007, due bank crisis impact irish economy, number jump 111% 20113. in fact, even country centre financial crisis, fiscal spend stimulate domestic demand increase offset negative real sector shock create crisis. the low growth environment also reduce tax revenue governments, erode public finances. so, crisis certainly play role worsen public finances. but complete story. in many countries, public finance already stretch even crisis. this surely say something state financial governance public sector economies. in advance economies, age population over-generous health pension benefit major source strain fiscal positions. although threat demographic fiscal sustainability juncture imminent country japan, spain, italy greece, old age population rise sharply amid already high level debt, matter time many emerge market economy also face similar issues. that include country asean. it therefore imperative public financial governance adequately embed longer-term consideration financial decision make today. in many emerge market economy endowment resources, state financial governance also reflect government manage rich flow resource endowments, especially term provide future generation save bad times. sadly, many example country badly manage resource wealth. not fail save future, even use resource wealth contribute minimally support sustainable economic growth, often much wealth pillage responsible management. the practise good public financial governance evidence pattern spend also effectiveness implementation achievement outcomes. for example, education talent development key priority many countries, emerge well developed. large amount public fund devote education. on surface, may look like good financial governance spend much money socially economically desirable objective. yet, much spend go waste accompany measure bring complementary change raise standard professionalism, address incentives, ensure teach meet need economy. high spend public fund persistence mediocrity go hand-in-hand one likely hold accountable failure achieve outcomes. therefore, good financial governance must measure achievement specific measurable outcomes. if outcome fall short, tax-payer money cannot consider well spent. when lack financial governance public sector, mean government contract award base know rather give best value money. a result, government project often become costly, poorly deliver fail provide incentive increase proficiency productivity. not that, pool vest interest develop fee lack financial governance, threat privilege livelihood meet great hostility. it privilege position vest 3 source: imf’s fiscal monitor database. bi central bankers’ speech 5 interest make government reform difficult. the end result intention economy drive efficiency increase productivity remain unattainable. there country get right come good public financial governance. for resource rich economies, norway one example, since 1990, government put aside oil income fund end 2014 worth almost us$1 trillion4. the sustainability fund support fiscal rule specify course business cycle, government spend expect real return fund cannot use fund’s capital. for another example, time country significant resource endowments, singapore consider prudent public financial governance. again fiscal rectitude guide legal constraints. for example, country adopt legal constraint balance budget government’s term office. it also maintain internal discipline keep government spend 20% gdp5. by comparison, develop country government spend around 40–50% gdp. so, good public financial governance possible, assume political put place appropriate mechanisms. what financial governance private sector? the financial crisis advance economy year since show unsustainable household finance drag economic growth many years. excessive leverage high household indebtedness often negative economic implications. in ponder issue financial governance individual household level, i remind leo tolstoy’s infamous quote anna karenina, “all happy family alike; unhappy family unhappy way.” there indeed numerous cause unhappiness, confront consequence bad financial decision make past must surely common cause much unhappiness among many families. this issue especially pertinent current environment prolong low interest rates. sound financial decision need ensure household live beyond mean accumulate excessive debt. this essential ensure sustainable growth consumption, rather debt-fuelled consumption binge follow prolong slumps. it type consideration make bank negara malaysia maintain level interest rate believe balance support economy discourage excessive risk taking. this supplement policy tools, include macroprudential policies, manage risk within financial system economy. therefore, national government must practice sound financial governance, must also promote key priority within society create incentive lead unsustainable financial behaviour among economic agents. turn corporate sector, surface, corporate financial governance appear ample check balances. management accountable board board accountable shareholders. for publicly list companies, market discipline share price take beat perceive shortfall financial governance. unfortunately, history replete incidence failure check balances, include repeat failure market impose financial discipline corporations. notable example failure corporate financial governance include carrian group 1983, enron 2001, worldcom 2002, numerous example recent financial crisis. the narrow fixation profit maximisation has, many cases, lead 4 source: https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/the-government-pension-fund/market-value-of-the-government-pension-f/id699635/. 5 source:

towards unproductive activity purpose rent extraction speculation. this harm economic growth productive segment under-invested in. the function market also need improved. give widespread abuse attempt manipulation, i believe appropriate regulations, enforcement, help ensure market function intended, support great good society, rather greed self-interest market participants. there one final aspect corporate financial governance i would like mention, i consider one big threat future economic growth – environmental sustainability. the damage effect activity deforestation, over-fishing excessive emission environment, wide-ranging implication future quality economic activity, quality life itself. progress make term regulation increase sensitivity corporation environmental footprint. however, progress relatively small develop economy particularly vulnerable make choice location so-called dirty industries. the pursuit profit powerful motivation corporate existence unfortunately, often lead short-sighted behaviour. the ongoing volkswagen scandal clear example this. again, reinforce need sound government regulation ensure financial decision take corporation good corporates also society whole. let move last part speech, relate governance finance. after all, availability finance key constraint economic agent therefore, key determinant economic activity. governance finance: anchor finance real economy the need maintain sound financial governance financial institution best demonstrate impact absence. the recent crisis stark reminder weak financial governance financial institution result unsustainable level leverage, excessive maturity mismatch underprice risk within financial system, ultimately lead widespread wealth destruction economic dislocation. in u alone, conservative estimate place loss financial crisis $6 trillion $14 trillion, 40 90 per cent annual economic output6. in response global crisis, extensive international reform pursue strengthen financial buff financial institution through, among others, strict capital liquidity requirements. these reform help strengthen balance sheet financial institution sustain ability support orderly financial intermediation. while i acknowledge importance reforms, even important issue relate overall “governance finance”. the financial crisis contain many lesson governance finance fail well consequence failure. the governance finance relate behaviour financial institution determinant perspective organisational arrangements, incentive structure ethics, well regulatory market environment. when factor correctly aligned, financial system play role support sustainable economic growth; not, financial system create risk potentially undermine economic growth. central robust governance framework financial institution strong institutional arrangement provide effective check balance facilitate sound decision-making. at broad level, entail well-defined responsibility accountabilities,

separation board oversight management. while may appear rudimentary feature governance arrangement, may challenge organisation large complex opaque report lines, result board senior management far remove issue ground. “too big manage” real concern. in reflection bank practice lead crisis, unite kingdom’s parliamentary commission bank standard find “unclear, complex confuse allocation responsibilities” among senior management pose challenge identify individual responsible poor decision importantly, hold account7. this important lesson keep mind asia, financial institution continue significantly expand operation across sector geographical boundaries. in ensure effectiveness governance structures, none important competent commit individual helm financial institutions. the member board director must sound understand business, risk profile financial institution, operate environment. the board must also ready challenge executive management hold account. this demand combination experience, confidence character – element find lack among financial institution recent crisis. a financial time report 2008 find director several large trouble institution significant experience financial services8. an undue deference management director also prevalent bank northern rock, hbos rbs, board adequately challenge management’s pursuit aggressive, high-risk strategies. it reason bank negara malaysia undertake rigorous frequent supervisory engagement board financial institutions. such engagement crucial develop good understand board dynamic effectiveness governance role. a matter practice, prospective director financial institution malaysia subject close scrutiny rigorous interview bank. this approach also recently adopt uk’s prudential regulatory authority9. governance arrangement financial institution must also reinforce corporate culture value reinforce consideration risk, ethic compliance level financial institution. this start right “tone top”, whereby board senior management shape core value firm. a common theme find across various inquiry crisis breakdown culture, disregard prudence ethic tolerated. in cases, individual bear red flag ignored, punished. the financial crisis inquiry commission launch u government chronicle two instances10. in lehman brothers, chief risk officer (cro) strip role risk matter warn much risk face grow pressure compete investment banks. similarly, repeat warn raise business chief underwriter citigroup large purchase defective loan translate action; instead, downgrade performance review subsequently demoted. another major component governance finance individual incentive influence compensation. the global financial crisis offer tell display 7 parliamentary commission bank standard (2013). change bank good: first

concerns. for example, large institutional investors, include sovereign wealth funds, start channel fund firm sustainability commitments. admittedly, progress make front rather modest thus far, potential enable wide range stakeholder determine sustainability finance role facilitate sustainable economic growth. conclusion i actually finish story challenger shuttle disaster begin speech. after harrow accident, president reagan form rogers commission investigate incident, find accident could avoid entirely. the special commission report nasa’s organisational culture decision-making process

the fact lack good financial governance increase likelihood o-ring-like accidents, potentially devastate effect economy, make sound financial governance economic political priority. bi central bankers’ speech 1 gent sejko: the economy banks, present future challenge speech mr gent sejko, governor bank albania, round table “the economy banks, present future challenges”, organise bank albania government albania bank system, tirana, 16 september 2015. * * * your excellency prime minister, honour representative international institutions, dear bank executive representatives, this meet seek draw attention non-performing loans, issue discuss extensively recent years. it aim foster share concrete commitment reduce stock non-performing loans, increase financial intermediation bank sector underpin albania’s economic growth. following, i would like list facts. the high level non-performing loan affect bank sector’s stability. liquidity capitalisation indicator remain adequate financial performance positive improving. but, still-high percentage non-performing loan contribute high perception risk banks; turn, adopt conservative approach lending. our survey data point tighten lend standards; meanwhile, lend volume, albeit positive, still consider low. the credit quality improve year. the non-performing loan ratio, peak 25%, fell around 21% july 2015. we believe improvement reflect measure take last 2–3 years, i would like single out: a) amendment law “on income tax” end 2013, facilitate loan loss write balance sheet; b) amendment code civil procedure september 2013, improve collateral execution process; c) entry force regulation bank albania, render obligatory write loan classify bank “loss” period long 3 years; d) work accomplish cooperation commercial bank restructure loan borrower expose one bank; albeit number non-performing loan subject execution process significantly up, improvement credit quality reflect mainly loan loss write off banks’ balance sheet. for first half 2015, value amount around all 11 billion. the write bank’s balance sheet healthy bank useful economy, it: – provide realistic picture banks’ loan portfolio, release capital improve financial balance; – improve bank processes, thank efficient use human, financial technical resources, redirect focus bank toward new loans; – improve overall function financial market, contribute market “exit” non-competitive businesses. 2 bi central bankers’ speech – contribute positively market participants’ assessment bank sector (ratings) and, subsequently, assessment albania’s economy; – provide condition good manage debt collection, always accompany necessary message imply forgive borrower debt. in case, process loan loss write banks’ balance sheet detach process real developments. on contrary, reflect gradual improvement non-performing loans. in concrete terms, last two years, growth rate non-performing loan decelerate extraordinary rates, banks’ annual spend provision fallen, new loans, especially denominate lek, stable. on side, bank increasingly commit process. usually, happen effectiveness process improve and/or bank expectation lend improve. lady gentlemen, i would like point although credit quality improved, level non-performing loan consider still high, low fast pace. this complex process put test adequacy legal framework, well coordination consistent implementation institutional policies. these challenge identify annual forum organise june. some acknowledge need improve legal framework. others point unifying, single law, important stipulation execution executive title, currently envisage across several laws. we aware part difficulty arise dimension problem; also, ago, justice system lack experience specialise expertise matter still face inadequate capacity handle practices. however, inadequate legal provision inconsistent implementation practice render collateral execution process tedious, uncertain costly party involved. the coordination institutional policy another key process respond various problem timely appropriate fashion. for example, recent action plan resolution non-performing loan represent new level communication commitment public institution bank albania find sustainable solution. many issue concern bank industry, bank albania consider crucial, incorporate plan. for example, preparation draft law “on bankruptcy”, commendable effort ministry justice represent significant development unique opportunity render resolution financial obligation enforceable, predictable, efficient process. concluding, i would like underline reduce level non-performing loan closely relate magnitude financial intermediation bank sector. the need redirect private investment towards new sector economy, small market size, problem relate low quality financial report private entities, slowdown economic growth rate albania dictate unstable private demand loan . therefore, important find, addition macroeconomic policies, new alternative boost domestic demand, promote optimism economy contribute positively business consumer expectations. the acceleration economic growth would provide condition fast steady improvement level non-performing loans. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 23 september 2015. * * * mr chairman, honourable member economic monetary affair committee, lady gentlemen, during summer break, union face exceptional challenges. first, long complicate discussion new adjustment programme greece. and now, area much outside ecb’s competence, challenge harbour large number refugee leave home behind. both event – although different nature – show europe strong act unity basis solidarity cooperation. this lesson draw also challenge come. in remark today, i would like discus two main topics: first, assessment late economic development implication monetary policy stance; second, proposal colleague i present five presidents’ report. economic development monetary policy turn first topic, let give overview economic development since last hear june. over summer, industrial production indicator economic activity show sign resilience. at time, macroeconomic environment become challenging. our september macroeconomic projection indicate weak economic recovery slow increase inflation rate expect early year. the inflation rate remain close zero near term, rise towards end year. it take somewhat long previously anticipate converge back stabilise around level consider sufficiently close 2%. slow growth emerge market economies, strong euro fall oil price commodity price generally main cause developments. a result, renew downside risk outlook growth inflation emerged. for many changes, early judge sufficient confidence whether cause last slippage trajectory initially expect inflation follow decide expand asset purchase programme january. more time need determine particular whether loss growth momentum emerge market temporary permanent nature ass drive force behind drop international price commodity behind recent episode severe financial turbulence. we therefore monitor closely relevant incoming information impact outlook price stability. our monetary policy measure place, include tltros, continue favourable impact cost availability credit firm households. they far prevent measurable tighten financial condition real economy despite recent surge financial volatility. the sustain decline cost borrow strengthen domestic demand, support durable good consumption stimulate investment particularly small medium-sized businesses. this make euro area economy resistant external shocks. 2 bi central bankers’ speech should downwards risk weaken inflation outlook medium term fundamentally project present, would hesitate act. the asset purchase programme sufficient in-built flexibility. we adjust size, composition duration appropriate, monetary policy impulse become necessary. i aware many closely scrutinise potential effect low interest rate environment financial stability; econ coordinator choose one topic today. build i say hear march, let underline closely monitor risk financial stability, see materialise moment. should case, macroprudential policy – monetary policy – would tool choice address risks. here, build recent experience develop tools: last two years, national authority europe active introduce macroprudential policies, cap loan-to-value debt-to-income ratio structurally strengthen mortgage market counter growth real estate price well mortgage loans. similarly, strengthen bank system, country introduce systemic risk buffers, addition buff globally systemic bank important institutions. however, macroprudential instrument mainly cover lend bank sector. a sign finance euro area economy tend shift non-banks, coverage macroprudential framework need start extend shadow bank sector address risk financial sector whole. i would also like say word greece. during last hear june, i call comprehensive fair agreement greece. in follow weeks, come agreement difficult necessitate tremendous effort involved. but i grateful end, agreement reached. if completely implemented, new programme put greece position grow reap full benefit participate common currency. the ecb contributed, line provision lay legal framework, negotiation programme. in addition, ecb closely monitor provision emergency liquidity assistance bank greece accord rules, take account prospect successful completion negotiation point time. complete emu: follow five presidents’ report the negotiation summer reveal fact institutional framework still commensurate requirement share one currency. in five presidents’ report publish shortly last hearing, five author share one common conviction, namely make monetary union stable prosperous, complete union necessary. but outline common conviction; also present concrete roadmap show attain objective. this roadmap guide discussion month come. from perspective, two element particular importance. first, despite best effort actor involved, crisis show monetary union require political centre; centre take relevant fiscal, economic financial decision euro area whole swift transparent manner full democratic legitimacy clear set responsibility give legislators. it spirit i call repeatedly move rules-based coordination share sovereignty within common institutions. the report propose euro area treasury one example. such idea need spell out. but also go regard policies. the report make clear emu also need strengthen tool manage prevent build-up fiscal, financial macroeconomic risks. in last years, notably reform strengthen economic governance framework set esm, ssm srm, bi central bankers’ speech 3 make important first step improve crisis prevention crisis management toolkit. but yet. most imminently, move towards complete bank union common backstop single resolution fund european deposit insurance scheme. both essential create truly single bank system mirror single currency, crucial underpin credibility bank union finally achieve initial promise, namely break bank-sovereign nexus, make financial system resilient, protect interest taxpayers. at time – go beyond confine bank sector bank union – must make progress develop capital market union enhance scope cross-border private risk-sharing. in addition, need prevent imbalance – whatever nature – develop crisis environment. therefore, need new convergence process base capacity economy withstand shock grow quickly. this would imply robust financial system described, also strong governance structural reform tight control national fiscal policies. to ensure member state adjust shocks, whatever size, also need add layer fiscal stabilisation european level. take together, step towards complete emu would help make euro area survive, thrive prosper. on note, i look forward questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 pentti hakkarainen: economic outlook presentation mr pentti hakkarainen, deputy governor bank finland, yit group division management boards, lahti, 17 september 2015. * * * the slide find bank finland website slide 1. global economy the world economy growing, albeit bite slow expect year ago. the economic outlook unite state remain encourage euro area prospect clearly improved. however last august bumby month financial markets. stock market around world infect chinese stock market crash. the crash precede shanghai composite index double course little le year. the stock market bubble burst two phases: june august. first phase little effect globally, august, crash spread around major stock exchange cause turmoil. since then, situation somewhat stabilized. volatility remain high, around new – low – level. also raw material price decreased, partly reflect impair economic outlook china. in oil markets, supply side also partly blame for. oil supply remain solid despite price collapse. what stock market volatility fall raw material price reflect? one answer illustrate least partially uneven progress world economy. especially general assessment chinese growth prospect revise down. situation china also increase downward risk emerge market economies. growth moderation china cause change economic structure. currently economy undergo phase shift share household consumption increasing. in 2012, share consumption gdp 35 % low standards. for example unite states, household consumption make roughly 70 % gdp. this shift take time. bank finland’s forecast chinese gdp growth 2016 6 %. and still good number. 2. euro area euro area economy good time. total production increase four big euro area economies; germany, france, italy spain. in first half 2015, euro area economy grow 0,5 % first quarter 0,4 % second. especially spain grow rapidly hard year live through. in euro area, unemployment slowly declining, although high levels. improve employment, low oil price low interest rate increase household real income consumption. in corporate sector, investment support accommodative monetary policy improve financial conditions. although investment low long time, finally positive sign available. look european central bank staff projection september, euro area gdp growth rate project pick 1,4 % 2015 1,8 % 2017. inflation project 0,1 %in 2015, gradually increase 1,1 % 2016 1,7 % 2017. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 3. russia russian economy face economic headwinds. the large impact come fall oil price occur since middle 2014. this illustrate dependence economy export oil, oil product well gas. a decrease oil price easily put exchange rate downward slide. that case also russia. the fall oil price also push domestic demand russia year. this press gdp level second quarter 4.6 % low one year earlier. there sign slide may stopped. however, example bank russia late forecast project year decline gdp amount 3.9–4.4, oil price stay slightly 50 dollar per barrel rest year. similar crisis 2009, russia’s import fall significantly year, react strongly diminish domestic demand weaken rouble. in term value euros, import good service russia fell 20 % first half year first half 2014. expectation fall import volume entire year 2015 range 20 30 %. regard another burden, gdp growth russian slow already year early befor oil price decline sanction due geopolitical tensions. this slowdown reflect economy’s systemic shortfall like low level fix investments. this naturally fundamental burden think future, russia’s growth perspective long term. 4. finland finland fall behind euro area growth. accord last bank finland forecast june 2015, finland catch pace recovery euro area countries. economic growth finland slow prolong period, historically international comparison. finnish export suffer considerable loss market share since 2009, severe year recession. growth depress sectoral structural problems. the forest industry electrical engineer electronics, particular, experience serious difficulties. also age population lackluster productivity development weaken growth potential. in addition, finnish export growth remain subdue partially weak performance russian economy. during first half year growth rate finnish economy pull mildly positive territory mainly due global economic developments. these include oil price development low interest rate euro area recovery. however, headwind robust recovery. in addition structural factor mention above, factor weak competitiveness, labour market match problems, lack implementation plan structural reform hamper growth finland. the labour market situation deteriorate rapidly past year. unemployment high recession year 2009, unemployment rate stand 9.6 % july. the employment rate falling. the rise unemployment widespread, affect age groups, although especially rise youth unemployment accelerate first half year. over past 5 year soft, lengthy land finnish house market, reflect protract economic downturn. the house loan cycle finland pass second trough burst global financial crisis. there strong regional divergence house price household indebtedness within countries, too. these regional difference drive demand supply-side bi central bankers’ speech 3 factors. growth area typically characterise increase population, young residents, good employment situation high household income national average. this also reflect brisk house market high house price areas. for example, finland market condition metropolitan area diverge condition prevail area population diminishing. the large house loan concentrate big city growth centres. in centres, house price also highest. lady gentlemen, let know draw main conclusions: • the u economy grow today hear feed omc-meeting strong growth is, also hear whether monetary policy stance need changed. • emerge market economy difficult times; e.g. brazil russia face strong headwind china’s growth level off. • growth outlook europe improved, unfortunately finnish economy recover accordingly economy

english, give international audience speaker quite lucky today. i would first like express great pleasure i open conference twentieth anniversary banque de france foundation monetary, bank financial economic research. i welcome prominent speaker make u honor join u today – yann algan science po paris luigi zingales university chicago booth school business – chair discussant also renowned economist respective fields. a word topic conference now. the idea conference take step back time reflect monetary financial research general, impact policy society. we thus evoke role economics economist within society. the two provocative paper discuss today provide nice opportunity discussion. they point several concern economic research finance. they highlight tendency economist self-referential analyze social perception finance industry largely negative nowadays, since financial crisis. in respect, paper focus unite states, little doubt france probably exception rule either. after 2007–2008 crisis, first step take change incentive financial industry. and even do direction come years. at time, economist also adopt critical view financial industry practice judge impartially possible. but say economist themselves? be really self-referential tend overestimate role society? on personal note – policymaker central banker – i believe possible central bank governor may pay cost so-called “superiority” economist (for instance sure econometric models). how proceed conference today? in-depth discussion paper leave participants. however, i would like mention potential role foundation play help address important issues. first, economic analysis definitely need order sharpen policy makers’ understand world. at time, policy maker continuously challenge allege “superiority” economist complexity real world. second, action need take get academia involve policymaking, bring discipline theory-based analysis policy debates. that imply good access governmental data academic researchers, enable conduct independent 2 bi central bankers’ speech rigorous research expose result policymakers general public, listen return. well, i hope wishful think i leave floor distinguish speakers. thank you. ***** close speech to close today’s conference, i would like come back foundation role. i focus brief historical overview foundation monetary, bank financial economic research. a lot achieve since 1995, know. what goal? to promote excellence academic research field monetary policy finance. and achieve far? well, three hundred conference seminar sponsored. the research grant program also award 81 grant 2.4 million euro total. while difficult identify potential outcome project early stage, program reward excellent outcomes. most paper publish best international research journals. yet academic success achieved. some paper also finance foundation late become hot policy topics, sometimes good insight. for instance, i think paper freixas, parigi rochet “systemic risk, interbank relationship liquidity provision central bank” publish 2000 journal money, credit bank (jmcb). in 2000, eight year crisis. and yet paper already underline importance interbank relationship spread risk. some trend evolution research economics work central bank last twenty year also identify discussed. obviously globalization international link play ever important role monetary financial economics (including creation euro instance). there also change economic research, attention progressively give actual policy-making. one lead example perhaps so-called taylor rule, create describe actual behavior central bankers. this allow much rich interaction academia policy makers. change also affect policy-making, attention pay academic debates. these even influence structure central banks. research unit put place develop major central banks, include banque de france, also implement external evaluation research (eer). central banker indeed realize importance conduct research activity support policy making. heavy use theoretical find data-based analysis made, order central bank good articulate policy actions. also, economic research outside central bank – drive direct “daily” topic – prove ultimately valuable policy too. for example, idea develop krugman (1998) eggertson & woodford (2003) policy zero low bound, inspire economic stagnation japan, enter unite state euro area policy debate year publication. the banque de france foundation accompany significant trends. by foster research conduct international teams. by sponsor research unrelated immediate banque de france needs, would ultimately prove beneficial policies. in respect, i expect foundation still play important role next decade promote excellence research field monetary financial economics. i also hope – conclusion – wishful think either. bi central bankers’ speech 3 once again, let thank participants, speakers, discussant chair join u today fruitful talk congratulate young researcher receive well-deserved prize work. a special thank also actor foundation, whose constant help dedication mission precious appreciated. now time lunch i believe buffet prepared. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: sustainable growth financial sector – 2015 c k prahalad lecture speech dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, 4th d k prahalad memorial lecture, mumbai, 18 september 2015. * * * coimbatore krishnarao prahalad bear tamil nadu. one nine children, obtain undergraduate degree physic university madras go diploma iim, ahmedabad member first graduate batch. he follow dba harvard business school 1975. prahalad start academic career university michigan 1977, 1990, gary hamel co-author article harvard business review titled, “the core competence corporation.” in influential article, build work edith penrose first stress importance unique capability firm, prahalad hamel encourage corporate executive “identify, cultivate, exploit core competency make growth possible.” in 1994 book, compete future, prahalad hamel analyze establish market leader like ibm tend lose grind innovative upstart like apple – ibm fail see future personal computer focus maintain leadership mainframe business. perhaps important india, prahalad’s 2005 book, the fortune bottom pyramid: eradicate poverty through profits, explore business might pursue sustainable growth cater poor poor. indeed, much term “core competence”, term “the bottom pyramid” enter common lexicon. he receive many award honor life time, perhaps great honor continue influence work. i meet c.k. prahalad i university chicago. despite enormous reputation exalt circle move in, always earth, immensely insightful. he care deeply india, give freely time money make difference here. many attend seminar organize improve indian business practice. he believe indian could second none; businessmen take message heart delivered. he i never get chance research together, write joint letter prime minister 2009, together abhijit banerjee, advocating, among steps, accelerate effort bring unique id india. perhaps, therefore, small role prime minister set unique id authority, head nandan nilekani. a aside, give far nandan’s uidai take u towards universal unique identity india, would sad use severely restricted. other country like unite state use unique ids, social security numbers, without serious allegation violation privacy. learn worldwide experience, need see satisfy concern supreme court without undermine value unique id. the unique id enable variety economically valuable activity particularly benefit bottom pyramid. for instance, uids expand access poor young credit borrow collateral future good name, also allow regulator detect curb over-lending individual ask lender report id borrower credit bureaus. today, unscrupulous lender avoid current regulation over-lending simply misreporting borrower’s name address. similarly, government use uids weed duplicate beneficiary various welfare schemes, allow good target scarce fund poor. i think c.k. would want u find way move forward uids. i believe, c.k. did, india far successful influential today. what need succeed? how compete effectively best? do need identify core 2 bi central bankers’ speech competency nation? rather attempt speak perspective business, let speak vantage point central banker. let also quickly offer standard disclaimer: for hint upcoming policy statement, please read guidance last policy statement. i quote: “significant uncertainty resolve come months, include likely persistence recent inflationary pressures, full monsoon outturn, well possible federal reserve actions. a reserve bank await great transmission front-loaded past actions, monitor development emerge room accommodation.” nothing i say follow mean offer guidance, please don’t read veil mean none intended. if look around world today, present pretty picture. industrial country still struggling, exceptions, grow. our fellow brics deep problems. indeed, india appear island relative calm ocean turmoil. what different assure continue? a lesson brazil? perhaps brazil offer salutary lesson. only year ago, world applaud country’s thrive democracy, robust economic growth, enormous stride make reduce inequality. it grow 7.6 percent 2010, discover huge oil reserve president lula liken “winning lottery ticket”. yet country expect shrink 3 percent year, debt get downgrade junk. what go wrong? paradoxical may seem, brazil try grow fast. the 7.6 percent growth come back substantial stimulus global financial crisis. in attempt keep growth high, new york time say central bank press reduce interest rates, fuel credit spree overburden customer struggle repay.1 further, brazil’s government fund development bank hugely increase subsidize loan corporations. certain industry favor tax break price control impose gasoline electricity, cause huge loss public sector firms. petrobras, national oil company, suppose make enormous investment oil drilling, instead become embroil corruption scandal. even government pension burn ever large hole, budget deficit expanded, political consensus narrow become elusive. towards sustainable growth while brazilian authority work hard rectify situation, let u ignore lesson experience suggests. growth obtain right way. it possible grow fast substantial stimulus, 2010 2011, pay price high inflation, high deficits, low growth 2013 2014. of course, india situation today. but world inhospitable place, work hard strengthen current recovery put sustainable footing. and monetary policy accommodate extent room, expand sustainable growth potential continue implement reform government regulator announced. these intend strengthen environment business expand access financing, turn allow company find exploit core competencies. 1 “as boom fades, brazilian wonder how go wrong”, simon romero, new york times, september 11, 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 3 for rbi, key task keep inflation low today well future get moderate nominal interest rate satisfy vocal borrower also silent savers. we also need clean bank system distress asset position fund growth again. while understand difficulty industry work hard improve environment, india must resist special interest plea target stimulus, additional tax break protections, direct credit, subvention subsidies, historically render industry uncompetitive, government over-extended, country incapable regain rightful position amongst nations. belief what critical success, prime minister say early month meet industrialist bankers, business believe tremendous possibility opportunity nation has, will take investment risk generate returns. no country succeed without believe – i mean unwarranted belief intrinsically good everyone else confidence give population, demographics, massive infrastructure investment opportunities, wide range capability people, arc history turn towards us. while indian business hurt public authorities’ act omission commission past, look forward. and i doubt business press people position public responsibility make change need ease business, respond. what specifically environment financial sector need do? let turn that, dwell specifically need foster competition innovation, create environment hospitable belong club, improve structure deal distress, strengthen human capital financial system. foster competition innovation in order get sustain growth, need competition, especially new entrant good position reach hitherto exclude part economy. after decade new entry, see two new private bank year, large number payment bank small finance bank next year. license likely go tap. incumbent express fear unfair competition. competition unfair play field. in fact, new entrant privilege incumbent already enjoy. we hope, though, new entrant find innovative way give customer good service low prices, thus shake change bank sector better. regulator naturally conservative lot. it good way else would speed breaker economy slow propensity get trouble. but also stand way innovation. there chinese saying: “cross river feel stones”. we try follow path experimentation incremental liberalization. so, example, increasingly innovative new service want customer ability make payment quickly, allow small value card payment without two-factor authentication. a financial institution gain experience, new technology ensure security emerge, liberalize further. more generally, philosophy allow innovation institutions, instrument practice long present clear present danger. once understand better, grow material size, deep analysis regulated. similarly, allow participation derivative market typically know speculator – without underlie risk hedging. speculator much malign india often confuse market manipulators. the 4 bi central bankers’ speech two different. speculator take position instrument thus take risks, much investor stock take risk. they typically take necessary side hedgers. without speculators, would little depth market price would distorted. the market manipulator move thin market prefer direction make quick profit, contrast speculator simply take side think make money. in security regulate, intend encourage broad participation discourage manipulation. more generally, would like improve regulation focus absolutely necessary create sound business environment – focus enable regulation rather paternalistic regulation – increase enforcement books. we trust also verify. to end streamline regulation end year new master document place internet update real time basis, regulate entity know quickly gamut require undertake action. include outsider a india grows, financial sector participant grow beyond insider typically dominate economic activity early stage growth every country. outsider new entrant want access, arm’s length contract trust, dispute settlement system transparent predictable. start first access. we need bring hitherto exclude participate financial system. the prime minister’s jan dhan yojana create account much exclude population. government take next step attach variety financial service accident life insurance accounts, send direct benefit scholarships, pensions, subsidy accounts. we also ease access bank account business correspondents, payment banks, point-of-sales machine use frequently. easy payments, access cash-in cash-out facilities, widespread availability safe save instrument next objective financial inclusion households. we also need ease lend small producers, whether farmers, self help groups, businesses. for this, need improve structure work credit information bureaus, collateral registries, debt recovery tribunal – ironically, credit flow easily lender persuade get money back, easy access credit necessitate harsh consequence default. perhaps important source collateral value land. we need good digital map clean record land ownership across country land use effectively collateral. newcomer outsider rely, relationship get thing done, arm’s length auction contracts, enforce quickly impartial bureaucracy judiciary. the clean-up take place method allocate resource like mine spectrum, attempt improve speed bureaucratic judicial decision make much need increase participation, though much do time. any reform institutionalized, outlive reformer’s passing. finally, newcomer outsider need protection unfair practices. a one example doing, rbi develop charter consumer right follow public consultation. bank board ask put place framework ensure right protected. after framework operation time, rbi take view best practices, regulation, needed. in meantime, field visit rbi, check mis-selling well proper function bank infrastructure branch atms, expanded. bi central bankers’ speech 5 resolution distress failure inevitable free enterprise system. an effective resolution system need preserve residual enterprise value financial failure. two critical element speed resolution predictability loss share amongst contracts. for instance, outsider want lend believe subordinate promoter interest bad times. so need speedy bankruptcy code resolve distress maintain priority structure claims, i glad finance ministry intend bring one soon. the bankruptcy code give creditor ability resolve distress, help strengthen corporate bond market, essential infrastructure financing. in meantime, find way deal distress bank system. regulatory forbearance, rbi soften rule classify bad loans, make easy bank “extend pretend”. it solution. since stake-holder – promoter, tariff authorities, tax authorities, etc. – contribute resolution, real project limp along, become increasingly unviable. meanwhile, analyst grow increasingly suspicious bank balance sheet grow volume “restructured” assets. also, large promoter take advantage banker fear asset turn non-performing extract unwarranted concessions, without sacrifice value stake. regulatory forbearance therefore ensure problem grow size provision require deal problem properly become alarmingly large – prompt call yet forbearance. forbearance also disservice bank’s owner (which may include government) who, instead face small problem early give opportunity apply corrective action, face large problem suddenly cannot push future more. rbi end forbearance accord restructure loans. henceforth, restructure loan classify non-performing loans. however, rbi make easy recognize deal distress projects. in words, end forbearance, introduce flexibility recognize deal stress asset early – early warn database large loans, joint lenders’ forum, strategic debt restructure process, 5/25 mechanism, see rbi’s way give bank flexibility deal stress asset problem absence function bankruptcy code, even bring urgency discipline deal problem. naturally, criticise ease way restructuring. one gentleman accost day ask why, pay debt regularly, competitor siphon money firm over-invoicing get debt write unpayable. the reality firm get trouble variety reasons, one over-invoicing. wherever possible, course, promoter share fully cost restructuring. but restructure process mean deal criminality. siphon money business crime lender investors, deal investigative authorities. however, original sin over-invoicing reason keep idle spank new plant let worker go. develop human capital the country need many finance professional specific skill enormous finance need lie ahead. today, example, many project decision make bank listen set consultants, mean independent view get embed evaluation decision. ironically, consultant advise project initiation also call project go bad. bank need skill in-house force follow herd. this problem apparent public sector banks, though private bank immune. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the quick way public sector bank recruit need talent short run market. while challenge make mark public sector may attract top public sector bank positions, subordinate position may essential pay market wage. that cost small set enormous national benefit bank make good decisions. of course, bulk public sector promotion continue come in-house talent. also, poach talent bank zero sum game system. therefore, bank develop skill in-house train staff – much soft skill leadership hard skill risk management capabilities. in development role, rbi help strengthen human capital financial system. some teach unit college agriculture bank staff college train banker important area agricultural lend msme lending. increasingly, center advance financial research learn (cafral) provide course state art financial technique project evaluation, structure resolution distress well risk management. bank may want pool resource set facilities, press cafral expand offerings. conclusion these way i think position financial system towards sustainable growth. before i end, let try answer one last question. in way firm core competencies, country core competencies? perhaps do. but hard public authority determine face massive lobby disinformation interest parties. if say want focus national core competencies, every industry show thoroughly fit bill – way every industry today want tell u especially deserve special tax benefit interest subventions. remember, license permit raj persist precisely industry favour others so-called national interest. so even nation core competencies, hard determine are, easy succumb vest interest support wrong ones. good focus create enable environment, let core competency emerge fillip give environment – much it sector emerge result investment country make technical education, without specific encouragement government. let conclude. ck prahalad believe indian business capable scale world height i. but easy path top. jugaad “working around” difficulty hook crook thoroughly indian way cop predicate difficult impossible business environment. and encourage attitude short cut evasions, none help final product quality sustainable economic growth. while respect entrepreneurial ability business people difficult environments, good u change environment better. that indeed try do. all require patience. the current difficulty emerge market stem complicate set reasons, important one impatience regain growth overemphasize old ineffective method stimulus. brazil may overspent, china may overinvested. the world difficult place. let u recognize quite well comparison – indeed, many industry difficulty problem export low import competitive, domestic demand inordinately weak. we cannot compensate entirely happen across borders, else risk acquire problem fellow emerge market have. we discipline stick strategy build necessary institution create new path sustainable growth jugaad long needed. for this, need bi central bankers’ speech 7 understand cooperation business, impatience pressure quick impossible fixes. only realize true potential nation. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenn stevens: overview recent economic development australia open statement mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics, canberra, 18 september 2015. * * * chair member committee thank opportunity meet today. the australian economy continue progress major adjustment, midst test international circumstances. the term trade fall four year decline third since peak – though very, high peak. they back level 2006 – still 30 per cent 20th century average level. resource sector capital spend follow term trade lag. from extraordinarily high peak – 8 per cent gdp, nearly three time peak see previous upswings – investment fall two half years. by time finished, decline probably total something like 5 per cent gdp. we probably halfway decline. it predictable impact industry region early experience effect boom. resource sector export rise strongly great capacity result investment put use. australia export around three time volume iron ore decade ago, around twice much coal. a large rise export natural gas prospect next years. outside mine sector part economy directly expose it, sign condition gradually improving. survey-based measure business condition bite longer-run average level time now, recent read 2010. a non-mining sector show quite mark improvement past twelve months. to add overall number job vacancy economy increasing, even employment opportunity mine area diminish. the increase rapid, nonetheless trend clearly upward two years. since time last year, moreover, see rise 200 000, 2 per cent, employment. the labour force participation rate ratio employment population start increase. the rate unemployment, though variable month month, seem stop rising, level bite low thought, six month ago, might reach. of course, performance uniform geographically industry. the two large south-eastern state show large increase demand employment, dwell prices, condition elsewhere subdued. by industry, rise employment strong services, especially type service deliver households, though business service activity also add employment past year. monetary policy seek support transition, something inflation remain low. very low interest rates, couple financial institution want lend, play part improvement condition sectors. residential construction run high levels, household add little le income save saver search high returns. these indication easy money work. cognisant risk low interest rate may foster worry debt build-up, regulatory initiative place maintain sound lend standard capital adequacy. i 2 bi central bankers’ speech hasten add objective tool control dwell prices, contain leverage. the evidence emerge job. more recently, significant decline exchange rate start discernible effect pattern spend production. the decline past two year amount 25 per cent rise u dollar 18 per cent trade-weighted basket. we hear effect liaison also see data thing tourism flow well export business services. this expect exchange rate adjust change term trade. over year june, real gdp grow 2 per cent. this line forecast three month ago low end forecast range year ago. the effect unusual weather condition export mean gdp measure exaggerate strength march quarter weakness june quarter. there still puzzle reconcile happen real gdp happen employment indication business surveys. hopefully, puzzle resolve time. nonetheless, pretty clear economy growing, albeit fast would like, adjustment decline term trade well advanced, non-mining activity improve rather deteriorating. if latter trend continues, credible think achieve good output growth, particularly reach late phase decline mine investment. this need bring unemployment rate. a always, global factor important international set continue rather complex one. since last hearing, growth chinese economy continue moderate. growth part asia also weak around middle year. reflect outcomes, forecast global growth period ahead little low six month ago. that backdrop period volatility financial markets. the unwind equity market bubble china appear serve proximate trigger revision equity valuation around world. risk appetite diminish somewhat currency many emerge market economy come downward pressure. whether financial volatility serve dampen global growth prospect remain seen. sometimes event portend wide set economic events, often, don’t. in present instance, important stress long-term debt market core fund market financial institution impaired. these market remain open still case highly rat private borrower sovereign borrow remarkably low cost. thing could change, present see anything approach dislocation fund channel see serious crises. to sure, emerge market country pressure specific problem recognise markets. at time, though, many emerge market country do quite bite improve resilience years. it’s also worth note performance unite state continue improve. everyone know that, eventually, reflect le accommodative u monetary policy. some fret first increase u interest rate nine year expected, matter well telegraph been. the important factor, though, pace subsequent increases. the federal reserve indicate expect gradual, course depend happen u economy. there degree irreducible uncertainty hence possibility financial market volatility point. overall though, seem likely global interest rate still quite low quite time yet. bi central bankers’ speech 3 for australia, cannot, course, determine term trade force global economy. we adjust them. the record adjustment recent year good. we negotiate financial crisis without major financial crisis big downturn economic activity. we negotiate first two phase resource boom without major inflationary problems, part way adjustment third phase – far without major slump overall economic activity. there still pretty good chance come episode fairly well, much good come previous episode type. i turn briefly another area bank’s responsibilities, namely payment system. the new payment platform (npp) enable real-time, data-rich payment 24/7 basis households, business government agencies. the payment system board, work facilitate process private sector come together drive project, support industry’s efforts. the reserve bank make good progress part project. in card payment area, bank announce review release issue paper early march. among things, review contemplate potential change regulation card surcharge interchange fees. it provide opportunity consider issue raise financial system inquiry. a usual, bank consult widely, include via roundtable june include representative 30 interest organisations. the payment system board ask staff liaise industry participant possible “designation” certain card systems. a decision designate system first number step bank must take exercise regulatory power respect payment system, commit regulatory course action. the payment system board discussion case change regulatory framework future meetings. in event board propose change regulatory framework, bank would, usual, undertake thorough consultation process draft standards. in financial stability role, focus central counterparties, facilitate efficient safe clear type financial transactions. these entity increasingly important give way global regulatory standard moving. the bank focus ensure risk management meet high standard capacity recover financial shocks. we also do lot work ensure regulatory framework appropriately recognise regulator jurisdictions, important keep australian financial system connect global system. with remarks, chair, colleague i await questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: animal spirit period volatility speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp, central bank philippines), bloomberg fx forum, makati city, 2 september 2015. * * * good afternoon lady gentlemen. fortuitous good planning? someone bloomberg must psychic, choose “hedging world volatility” theme 2015 fx forum time schedule forum manila precise week. wa sixth sense “bread butter” excellent market reading? how hedge volatile market? indeed, market volatility late contain country jurisdictions. it neither restrict either advance emerge markets, span category countries. and volatility concentrate one market asset class alone, cross commodity financial, extent, real good market well. with variable form feedback loop uneven transmission mechanism macrofinancial system, relationship correlation – predict traditional model – appear long valid. therefore, question “hedge” world volatility – intimate theme forum – quite well timed. for market now. a quick look around room tell me, aren’t many around today. perhaps, sign change times? those already see number episode volatility “your day”, may saying, “healthy” correction. to degree, i’ll agree that. this “correction” one good positive fall recent market price action. we need tap brakes, speak, market follow one strong underlie trend now, seemingly oblivious factors. each time come crossroad this, analyst would say “uncharted” territory. i also cannot disagree that. for certain, one absolutely sure things: 1. the convergence recent pronouncement various feed official feed ultimately end doing. over jackson hole weekend, bill dudley new york feed say unscheduled interview september hike “less compelling” now. for part, esther george kansa city feed repeatedly call hike, say “it’s soon say recent market development alter fundamental view” economy prepare normalization. then stan fischer, feed vice chair, speak panel say “there good reason believe inflation move higher”, thus keep door open september hike. can anyone really tell certainty much feed tighten? some view september lift may seem prudent, give market volatility, may market need order eliminate one element uncertainty, all, monetary policy significant lags. 2. the next step chinese authority – whether continue intervene, extent, form, intervention funded. some analyst put cumulative decline chinese reserve since july $300b. question is, sell u treasury fund intervention? and so, impact u yield curve, fed’s project path normalization? 2 bi central bankers’ speech 3. what ecb still sleeve – dependent next move would behavior members, greece. 4. how combination factor account reaction function central bank ultimately work currency, bond commodity markets, 5. what would happen global growth china slow significantly, tout u growth end “false” start. what would engine global growth? what concern bsp most? i asked, bsp concern about. of risk i’ve list now, would influence monetary policy most? lady gentlemen, hard say, degree certainty, factor would affect domestic monetary policy more, because, factor interrelated. therefore, rest time give me, let – instead single one risk – consider item list try address i believe burn question mind. let’s start feed moves. you may ask, bsp follow fed’s cue term time magnitude lift-off? my answer – necessarily. we won’t sing tune, certainly sing harmony. what i mean? recall q2 last year embark series monetary tighten actions. the feed yet moved, market certainly talk time. a number factor play period last year. 1) domestic inflation threaten breach inflation target upside, 2) m3 grow 30 percent result operational adjustment sda facility put place account capital inflows. fortunately, economy grow robustly then, therefore need provide monetary stimulus. in words, assessment economy could withstand tighten financial condition time. you recall communication then, indicate move also motivate anticipation feed normalization. it pre-emptive monetary tighten order help guide domestic market break tendency value/appreciate risks. our concern acute/unabated undervaluation risk would create financial stability pressures, particularly real asset markets. while risk overhear asset market since dissipated, reverse course action yet. we will, however, consider 1) actual expect capital outflow may result current global financial market rout impact m3 growth, and, 2) carefully review balance sheets/portfolios bank system see need adjust policy set tweak macroprudential measures. we also, importantly, monitor inflation expectations. we share 2015, inflation likely go low government’s target band. even so, inflation see move high target range 2016 2017. mindful therefore significant lag monetary policy, careful make adjustment policy set go forward. now let’s talk china. you may ask, shouldn’t also devalue peso, currency war seem play? bi central bankers’ speech 3 textbook describe competitive devaluation “beggar thy neighbor policy”. but said, know policy maker always believe would best specific needs, sometimes without much concern impact action jurisdictions. this bring mind high policy consideration – principle “enlightened self-interest” espouse bank international settlements. bi general manager jaime caruana say may seem “keeping one’s house order” good defense, policy mindset also take account spillover one’s action may lead improve overall welfare. after all, share space, speak, spillover may “spill back” one’s economy. my appreciation principle seek one’s goal may lead u sub-optimal results. give size domestic market, don’t think compel reason deviate current fx policy allow market broadly determine exchange rate. just period strong capital inflow early years, allow exchange rate adjust market condition also period potential capital outflow may increase. the bsp go fundamental trend fx market, reserve scope official action smoothen volatility could disrupt business plan dislodge inflation expectations. this policy efficient equitable exchange rate affect different sector economy, differently. depreciation benefit exporter dollar earners, weigh debt burden borrower foreign currency increase input cost importers. i hear murmurs, even see quizzical looks. well, let borrow phrase stan fischer speak jackson hole weekend. i don’t wish “disappoint rational expectations” i won’t tell whether breach certain exchange rate level would worry bsp not. actually, bsp “magical” exchange rate. a i repeatedly said, bsp doesn’t target specific exchange rate levels. but, would concern rate go fast one direction other, manner consistent fundamentals. a may aware, philippine enjoy current account surplus. in fact, current account surplus decade support remittances, continue “volatility-proof” receipt bpo services. this important bear mind – because, end day, investor discriminate. and, generally case economy strong external liquidity position good able minimize impact external shock domestic economy financial markets. move oil price developments. the often ask question relation oil – be bsp concern deflation, especially give late inflation outturn 1 pct. fact forecast august inflation 0.2 1 pct.? with global growth prospect weakening, global oil price may remain soft. fuel fuel-related item account 9 pct. item cpi. it stand reason therefore domestic inflation expect also soft go forward. that said, see upside factor inflation. these include: 1) domestic wage rigid downward (especially mandate minimum relate benefits); 2) el nino project prolonged, may likely intensify; 3) potential economic output estimate around 5.5 6.5 pct. current actual (1h 2015) output respectable 5.3 pct. in words, countervail factor low oil prices. our assessment therefore risk deflation contained. but remain watchful supply/demand condition international oil markets. 4 bi central bankers’ speech close home, let’s talk gdp. q1 revise downward 5 pct. q2 announce 5.6 pct., drive consumption. government spend accelerate q2 contribute positively growth. with these, full-year growth look modest government’s growth target 7–8 pct. a question may back mind – be need bsp loosen policy set support growth, especially prospect low global growth? from indications, may need time economic stimulus monetary policy. the government fiscal space. a q2, government step spend vital infrastructure need economic growth sustainable. the forthcoming election spending, though one-time shoot arm, could also provide economic stimulus. what bsp help raise growth trajectory – addition ensure low stable inflation environment – enhance bank sector policy cement strength bank system. the bsp also continue pursue market reform help establish financial market infrastructure efficient intermediation fund fund source users. neda project realistic economic growth rate 2015 6–6.5 pct. it comfort even levels, philippine would likely still among fast grow economy region. conclusion lady gentlemen, i’ve cover lot grind afternoon. let summarize saying: the bsp watchful domestic external conditions. and, ready take appropriate policy actions, needed, minimize potential adverse impact risk economy. in pursuit create growth opportunity economy, bsp continue look whole market’s continue support. i know market player live volatility. it get juice going. but let provide word advice: these typical “vols.” there necessarily historical price action could confidently go back to, calculate vars. therefore, careful new product market look deal in. be sure understand well. have necessary credit, market operational risk mitigants place. finally, bout volatility likely go away quickly. so, game long haul, need temper animal spirit healthy dose reflection humility. i think i’ve say enough now. let end here. i wish well. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: three truth finance remark mr mark carney, governor bank england

brother shatter conventional wisdom lay bare three lie finance. unlike statue’s three lies, falsehood last consequences. 1 so write f a mackenzie, quebec-born writer journalist daily mail’s travel correspondent far east early 1900s. see mackenzie, f a, “american shrine britain”, chapter xlv hammerton, j a (ed.) (1926), wonderful britain: highways, byway historic places, vol. 2. 2 bi central bankers’ speech *** lie i: “this time different” the first lie four expensive word english language: “this time be different.”2 this misconception usually product initial success, early progress gradually build blind faith new era effortless prosperity. it take revolution macroeconomic policy help win battle high unstable inflation, rise unemployment volatile growth 1970s ‘80s. in small part due predecessors, particularly lord king, stagflationary threat uk tame new regime monetary stability democratically accountable highly effective. clear remits. parliamentary accountability. sound governance. independent, transparent effective policy-making. these great success time value endure today. but innovation didn’t deliver last macroeconomic stability. far it. price stability guarantee financial stability. an initially healthy focus become dangerous distraction. against serene backdrop so-called great moderation, storm brewing. debt build rapidly, total non-financial debt g7 double 300 per cent gdp prime minister thatcher brown. in u uk, lead massive increase household debt, like last see great depression. several factor drive debt super-cycle include demographic stagnation middle-class real wage (itself product technology globalisation). in us, household borrow want increase consumption. “let eat cake” become “let eat credit.” financial innovation make easy so. and ready supply foreign capital global save glut make cheaper. most importantly – lie – complacency among individual institutions, feed long period macroeconomic stability rise asset prices, make remorseless borrow seem sensible. after reckoning, ensue crisis feeble recovery would look much like others follow prolong credit booms. policymakers quickly disassociate receive wisdom great moderation scramble re-learn lesson great depression. that process continue today central bank contemplate current parallel late 1930s. the aftermath global credit crunch severe. global output ten percent pre-crisis trend, global nominal growth run two percentage point short pre-crisis average, challenge deleveraging remain acute. these challenge appear press question faith another new era – china’s glide path global economic hegemony. china’s economic miracle 2 for extensive survey, see reinhart, c rogoff, r, (2009), this time different: eight century financial folly, princeton university press. bi central bankers’ speech 3 past three decade extraordinary, help lift billion people around world poverty. however, chinese economy’s post-crisis performance bolster large build-up debt, double reach almost 200% gdp. a case advance world, chinese debt boom owe much explosion shadow banking, relate second lie finance. lie ii: “markets always clear” beneath new era think great moderation lay deep-seated faith wisdom markets. policymakers capture myth finance regulate correct spontaneously. they retreat much regulatory supervisory role necessary ensure stability.3 that “markets always clear” second lie, one give rise complex financial web inflate debt bubble. in market goods, capital, labour, evidence disequilibria abounds. in good markets, ‘sluggishness everywhere’. leave themselves, economy go sustain period operate potential, resulting, ultimately, excessive deficient inflation. yet efficient market force ‘should’ bring change price sufficient equate demand potential, leave inflation purely monetary phenomenon. in labour markets, ‘rigidity everywhere’. rather fluidly adjust equate demand labour supply, period deficient labour demand persist, sustain mass unemployment joblessness. yet efficient market force “should” eliminate disequilibria wage adjust ensure full employment always forever. monetary policy response rigidities; make effective them. in capital markets, ‘momentum everywhere’. from bond equity currency commodities, past winner seem enjoy win streaks, past loser persist trail behind.4 yet efficient market force ‘should’ eliminate predictable movement become apparent. *** the belief market always clear two dangerous consequences.5 first, market always clear, assume equilibrium; say differently “to always right.” if receive wisdom market efficient, bubble neither identify potential cause addressed. such think dominate (non)reaction u subprime house booms. consider many market participant find profitable anticipate other’s behaviour divine fundamentals. 3 for review broad phenomenon, see padoa-schioppa, t (2010), “markets government before, 2007-20xx crisis”, the per jacobsson lecture, june. 4 asness, c, moscowitz, t pedersen, l (2013), “value momentum everywhere”, journal finance, lxviii, no. 3, june. 5 see also turner, a (2010), “market efficiency rationality: financial market different”, lionel robbins memorial lectures, london school economics. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the game guess everyone else guess (everyone else guessing…) familiar keynes observe often investor “devote [their] intelligence anticipate average opinion expect average opinion be”.6 this disconnect decision fundamental fee market volatility capital misallocation. such “beauty contest” dynamic afflict sophisticate investors, also many mortgage lender homebuyers, particularly “new era”. if house price go up, it’s possible borrow large multiple pay future obligation capital gain almost surely follow. such “rational” behaviour fuel credit binge ultimately lead global crisis. second, market always clear, posse natural stability. evidence contrary must product market distortion result incomplete markets. much financial innovation spring logic solution market failure build new market old markets.7 progress infinite regress. during great moderation, think become organise principle financier policymakers. the latter pursue light touch regulatory agenda quest perfect world complete market first describe economist arrow debreu.8 their world imago self-interested, atomistic agents, coolly calculate odds future possible state world, write trade contract other, frictionlessly enforced, achieve mutually beneficial – indeed socially optimal – outcomes. of course, market clear textbooks. in fact people irrational, economy imperfect, nature unknowable. when imperfection exist (which always), add market sometimes make thing worse. take credit derivatives, suppose complete market default risk thereby improve price allocation capital. financial alchemy seem distribute risk, parcel allocate want bear it. however, system spread risk, contingently opaquely, way actually end increase it. risk end concentrate balance sheet intermediary capital constrained. with fate borrower lender tie together via hyper-globalised bank markets, problem core spread violently periphery. a truth finance riskiness asset depend own it. when market don’t always clear, ultimate owner may surprise find own. when surprise – think – widespread, panic ensues. the impossibility complete market practical problem pre-crisis approach. even market perfect, nature unknowable. recall arrow-debreu world rely people able calculate odds every possible scenario. 6 keynes, j m (1936), chapter 12. 7 but economist nuanced persuasion point far back 1950s logic flawed. see lipsey, r lancaster, k (1956), “the general theory second best”, review economic studies, 24(1). 8 arrow, k debreu, (1954), “existence equilibrium competitive economy”, econometrica, 22 (3). bi central bankers’ speech 5 then trade contract insure risk unwilling bear. a moment introspection reveal absurdity assumption description actual world. more often not, even describe universe possible outcome beyond mean mere mortal, let alone ascribe subjective probability outcomes. that genuine uncertainty, oppose risk, distinction make frank knight 1920s.9 and mean market outcome reflect individual choice make pretence knowledge. the swing sentiment result – pessimism one moment, exuberance next – don’t reflect nature’s odds, assessment them, inevitably distort keynesian “animal spirits”.10 in end, belief second lie “markets always clear” mean policymakers didn’t play proper role moderate tendency pursuit collective good. lie iii: “markets moral” despite shortcomings, well-managed market powerful driver prosperity. by finance firm hire, invest expand, drive growth. by open cross-border trade investment create new opportunity business savers. by transfer risk will bear them, help household business insure unexpected. but leave unattended, market prone excess abuse. that particularly financial markets, mean end easily become conflated. value become abstract relative. and pull crowd overwhelm integrity individual. lie three “markets moral” – financial capital take grant social capital necessary market fulfil promise. consider example fix income, currency commodity markets, historically rely heavily informal code understandings. that informality well suit early age. but market innovate grew, prove wanting. market need retain consent society – social licence – allow operate, innovate grow. repeat episode misconduct (such libor fx scandals) call social licence question. to restore it, need rebuild fair effective markets. 9 knight, f (1921), risk, uncertainty profit, signalman publishing. 10 in keynes (1936), chapter 12, wrote: “even apart instability due speculation, instability due characteristic human nature large proportion positive activity depend spontaneous optimism rather mathematical expectation, whether moral hedonistic economic. most, probably, decision something positive, full consequence draw many day come, take result animal spirit – spontaneous urge action rather inaction, outcome weight average quantitative benefit multiply quantitative probabilities.” keynes, j m (1936), the general theory interest, employment money, palgrave macmillan. 6 bi central bankers’ speech not market collapse shock abroad. not market transaction occur chat rooms. not market one appear accountable anything. real market professional open, informal clubby. their participant compete merit rather collude online. real market resilient, fair effective. they maintain social licence. but real market don’t happen; depend quality market infrastructure. robust market infrastructure public good constant danger under-provision best market innovate continually. this inherent risk manage market actors, public private, recognise responsibility system whole. true lie so time same. market don’t always clear. and suffer amorality. so knowledge? and retain it? the long central banker, careful become forecasts. “irreducible uncertainty” “multiple equilibria” occupational hazards; must predict future, tempt hedge heavily must modify constantly. but two area i’m confident: three lie john harvard continue reveal year come, time, three lie finance come enjoy widespread credulity again. to resist siren calls, policymakers market participant must bind mast. that mean build institutional structure make hard act lies. over past seven year great stride made. take “this time different”. to guard future complacency, policy framework substantially overhauled. the bank england give formal responsibility maintain financial stability considerable power promote it. in anticipation problems, increase bank capital tighten mortgage standards. we use monetary policy macroprudential policy tool concert, low long interest rate environment promote price financial stability. moreover, next time prof different, financial intermediary core system substantially strong footing. their capital requirement already increase ten-fold liquid asset four-fold. their trade asset third intra-bank exposure two-thirds. though cannot hope eliminate systemic risk altogether, reform end too big to fail individual institutions. the combination eliminate implicit public subsidy increase capitalisation reduce distort price bank shift activity market base finance. choice competition – real market force – increasing. recognise “markets always clear” spur several initiatives. reform improve risk transfer untangle complex web derivative create simple, comparable transparent securitisations. the bank help change plumb market resilient failure individual counterparties, work understand good dynamic market liquidity give change regulation, trade strategy rise asset management. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the bank also overhaul way provide liquidity expand range collateral well number type counterparties. and recognise instability market may mean occasionally seize up, bank stand ready act market maker last resort. and third lie? in order help restore trust fairness, financial reform re-building real markets. early year, publish fair effective market review. it identify multiple root cause misconduct ficc market contribute ethical drift abdication responsibility. a good start make

deutsche bundesbank, annual meet verein für socialpolitik, münster, 7 september 2015. * * * lady gentleman the theme year’s annual meet verein für socialpolitik “economic development – theory policy”. the evaluation development aid project relatively long tradition – many policy area may benefit. much great use could still make research find evaluation efficiency effectiveness public project economic policy measures. i wish illustrate use macroprudential policy example. why development aid project frequently evaluated? for one thing, financier expect accountability impact financial assistance. for another, researcher often contribute project design. that let incorporate feature need ex post impact analysis project still draw board. ex ante plan allow evaluation data collect manner conducive maximise reliability econometric identification. tackle stimulate research topic without nag question identification strategy boost likelihood published. that’s incentive researcher get involve evaluation key put evidence-based economic policymaking practice. and that, lady gentlemen, i think need see policy fields. but actual impact measure often uncertain outside realm development aid. in many cases, project question much large still relate entire country – tax policy, education policy, health policy – forget financial market regulation. the question this: make sure areas, too, subject great and, all, scientifically prove evaluation? there two hurdle overcome, view, neither insurmountable. the first inadequate data pool, second frequent absence need scientifically-based evaluation policy measures. a deputy president bundesbank, one area responsibility financial stability. this include macroprudential policy. we still don’t know much impact macroprudential policy measure right now. the available evidence sparse; often cross-sectional analysis across different country derive short time series. we therefore work create condition superior policy evaluation. 1. what financial stability? macroprudential policy relative newcomer policy space. in respects, level knowledge experience area roughly par field monetary policy year ago. the specific policy goal difficult quantify, transmission channel often unknown, data set analytical method need developed. why need macroprudential policy? the world traditional bank regulation offer little scope curb systemic repercussion financial crisis focus primarily economic health individual market participants. for part, microprudential analysis base assumption financial system whole stable, market liquid market player run difficulty significant detrimental impact financial system economy whole. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but view short-sighted one, past episode seemingly isolate microprudential risk either misinterpret underestimate teach u work need take broad perspective. risk stability financial system arise large institution create negative externality (too big fail), institution highly interconnect (too connect fail), also many small institution expose similar type risk (too many fail). this key takeaway recent financial crisis prompt establishment macroprudential authority around world focus risk might threaten financial system whole. let’s begin mandate objective. the objective macroprudential policy safeguard financial stability. financial stability term use denote financial system’s ability perform key macroeconomic function – particularly event unforeseen events, period stress structural upheaval. for cost financial crisis heavy – regard amount duration real economic loss also concern often considerable fiscal costs. it completely curb risk fluctuation financial market instead reduce negative externality cause distress individual institution market segments. here, need ask “financial stability” measure concrete indicator formulated. after all, even though situation appear stable, creation systemic risk moral hazard jeopardise financial stability. that’s reduce misguide incentive increase size risk buff system key maximise financial system stability. from general definition, indicator – property prices, risk premium credit growth – derive policymaking process use ass financial stability. 2. macroprudential policy germany main responsibility financial stability europe rest national level. in germany, financial stability committee (fsc) create 2013 national macroprudential body. it comprise representative federal ministry finance, federal financial supervisory authority (bafin), bundesbank financial market stabilisation agency (fmsa), observer status. the bundesbank play special role fsc, inject experience macroeconomic analysis bank supervision. in nutshell, bundesbank fsc’s “analytical arm”. what more, besides prepare committee’s annual report german bundestag status financial stability germany, bundesbank also draft warn recommendation fsc ass implementation. of course, merely establish macroprudential institution nothing boost financial stability – rather, need strategy macroprudential policy appropriate instruments. the internationally agree basel iii regime currently force already contain number instrument design macroprudential matter mind. for instance, systemically important bank hold capital institutions, primarily way counter moral hazard (“too big fail”) cause size. another instrument countercyclical capital buffer, ccb, design boost financial system resilience tighten capital requirement time increase lending. the ccb schedule become legally effective germany 1 january 2016, though decision take hitherto exact level. however, instrument rudimentary toolkit combat systemic risk emanate real estate markets. and yet recent financial crisis clearly demonstrate important residential property market financial stability. a bi central bankers’ speech 3 number country already use dedicate macroprudential instrument real estate market; germany, contrast, requisite legal basis yet. to close gap, fsc submit recommendation federal government 30 june 2015 propose creation new macroprudential instrument residential real estate market. i would expressly point out, however, step mean instrument deploy activated. the fsc recommend four instruments: cap loan-to-value (ltv) ratio, cap debt-to-income ratio/debt-service-to-income ratio well amortisation requirement. an ltv ratio, instance, specify minimum amount equity capital debtor must contribute residential real estate finance transaction. these instrument two objectives. one reduce likelihood overindebtedness thus crises. the stem effect crises, occur anyway, mean large risk buffers. if instrument activate future, ex post impact analysis carry out. that call sound data, committee’s recommendation ask creation legal basis collection granular data mandatory ex post impact analysis. 3. how data fit equation? but “sound data”? the lesson learn u experience tell u loosen credit standard subprime household one major root cause financial crises. a development kind identify granular data hand. the bundesbank respond need higher-quality granular data establish research data service centre (rdsc).1 a new project launch administer link microdata macrodata, make available bundesbank external researchers. at present, ten member staff busy capturing, compile maintain data, use 120 projects. internationally, too, host initiative kick-start effort close data gaps. for instance, europe’s central bank will, come years, set anacredit, comprehensive database help link loan-level data banks’ balance sheet data. that kind data pool would open wealth analytical opportunity could use great many areas. the bundesbank’s rsdc specifically look establish close tie research policy guidance. the idea researcher give access, free charge minimum red tape, data – subject, course, appropriate data protection requirements. so increase availability sound data, go long way towards dismantle first two hurdle face field. however, data alone insufficient tell u effective economic policy measure been. this measure, rather, need embed structure impact study. apply set objective structure procedure specify upfront yield information effectiveness potentially increase likelihood policy measure accepted. they prevent situation inconvenient find go unpublished access necessary data obstructed. the guideline adopt verein für socialpolitik important necessary step. at heart general principle methodological quality, transparency, objectivity independence. but make sure data shortage scupper evaluations, data capture process plan well ahead introduction enshrine law. this 1 http://www.bundesbank.de/navigation/en/bundesbank/research/rdsc/rdsc.html. 4 bi central bankers’ speech modus operandi cut cost policy evaluation, also diminish risk necessary data cannot provide ex post. and last least, make evaluation mandatory would step right direction. this procedure widely follow internationally, one example office management budget unite states, require law evaluate legislation substantial financial impact, switzerland, policy evaluation even enshrine national constitution. in connection, let revisit fsc recommendation i refer earlier. it contain regular impact analysis also verify third parties. lady gentlemen, impact analysis important tool find efficacy policy measures, quantify cost benefits, flag unexpected side-effects. they require guideline decision-makers researchers. however, also work forward-looking policy environment aim enshrine policy evaluation law provide necessary financial data resources. it important researcher contribute expertise ideas, play part process. more often not, bright idea “by-products” stimulate debate peers. that’s reason we’re today, without ado, i bring speech close. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 n s vishwanathan: basel iii implementation – challenge indian bank system inaugural

challenge onerous one would think whether challenge worth face to. 5. the first element debate whether need basel iii country like india. on this, dr. subba rao, governor rbi1 make interest point i quote him: “one view, although explicitly spell form, india need adopt basel iii, adopt dilute version it, balance benefit putative costs. to buttress view, argue basel iii design corrective advance economy bank go astray, oftentimes take advantage regulatory gap regulatory looseness, indian bank remain sound crisis burden “onerous” obligation basel iii. 1 basel iii international indian context ten question we should know answer for– inaugural address dr. duvvuri subbarao, governor, reserve bank india annual ficci – iba bank conference mumbai september 04, 2012. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the reserve bank agree view. our position india transit basel iii several reasons. by far important reason india integrate rest world, increasingly indian bank go abroad foreign bank come shores, cannot afford regulatory deviation global standards. any deviation hurt u way perception also actual practice. the “perception” low standard regulatory regime put indian bank disadvantage global competition, especially implementation basel iii subject “peer group” review whose find public domain. deviation basel iii also hurt u actual practice. we recognize basel iii provide improve risk management system banks. it important indian bank cushion afford risk management system withstand shock external systems, especially deepen link global financial system go forward.” 6. once take postulate granted, fact need be, let u see challenge are: capital what factor lead high capital? 7. the first set basel iii reform agree late part 2010 tackle issue numerator part regulatory capital ratio. while minimum total capital requirement keep unchanged 8% rwa, definition various component capital composition thoroughly revise ensure capital perform intend role loss absorption. the minimum common equity requirement raise 2% level, application regulatory adjustments, 4.5% application strict adjustments. this mean common equity requirement effectively raise 1% 4.5%. the tier 1 capital, include common equity qualify financial instrument base strict criteria, increase 4% 6%. it also agree would capital conservation buff 2.5% regulatory minimum requirement meet common equity. this effectively increase total capital requirement present 8% 10.5%. in case, level capital increase 9% 11.5%, capital conservation buff take account. in context, may pertinent note post-crisis, major bank advance economy raise capital adequacy level significantly. in general, globally bank raise cet1 ratio almost 400 bps last four years. and importantly, mainly way fresh infusion equity capital. a comparative capital position major indian bank vis-à-vis major global bank indicate graph 1. a may appreciated, capital level bank system need go significantly major bank compete globally. during

capital ratio (vertical axis) domestic banks. the diagonal line represent point tier 1 capital requirement would remain meet ratios. therefore, bank diagonal line, leverage ratio require capital risk-based capital ratio vice-versa. to ensure leverage ratio act credible back-stop measure, reserve bank would continue monitor leverage ratio behaviour indian bank also development relate regulatory framework finalize appropriate level leverage ratio indian banks. 9. another element could lead high capital change risk weight assets, specifically, account propose revision standardise approach risk measurements. the bcbs intend avoid reliance credit rat determine risk weight credit risk give lesson learn crisis. although work progress, propose revise framework, bank would require utilise set risk driver like leverage entity, npas, etc. determine appropriate risk weight. similarly, market risk, would requirement compute sensitivity (delta, gamma, etc.) deal level compute rwas. for measure counterparty credit risk (ccr) derivatives, otc exchange-traded derivatives, exist current exposure method (cem) replace revise method call standardise approach ccr (sa-ccr). besides, talk already underway review exist treatment sovereign asset basel framework wherein exposure sovereign require zero little capital charge. these proposal alter way bank compute rwas. besides, new explicit capital charge interest rate risk bank book position also propose introduced. further, specific advance approach risk measurement, basel committee undertake strategic framework review view enhance simplicity, reduce complexity time ensure framework remain risk sensitive. the committee would also examine potential interaction amongst various policy prescription amongst well monetary policy objective ass whether potential room material inconsistency may severely undermine overall objectives. 10. the fourth element impact capital requirement provisioning. ifrs 9 require provision base expect loss provisions. the bcbs recently put discussion paper account issue estimate expect loss. 11. no doubt new framework need additional capital. specific psbs, government announce infusion r 70000 crore next four years. but need hour much psbs improve internal process enhance efficiency, optimise capital allocation deal asset quality issue. there several measure internal bank must look look external factors. a lot do improve credit underwriting, manage credit post disbursement recoveries. there thus scope improvement internal accrual source capital, improve efficiency, risk management system asset quality management one important part effort external capital require clean balancer sheet unlike would happen now. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 12. when capital requirement increases, impact growth. there vary estimate impact. the macroeconomic assessment group (mag) establish february 2010 financial stability board basel committee bank supervision coordinate assessment macroeconomic implication basel committee’s propose reforms, estimate bring global common equity capital ratio level would meet agree minimum requirement capital conservation buff would result maximum decline gdp, relative baseline forecasts, 0.22%, would occur 35 quarters. in term growth rates, annual growth would 0.03 percentage point (or 3 basis points) baseline level time. this follow recovery gdp towards baseline. bank also respond high capital requirement reduce cost become efficient. in fact le stable financial system could deleterious consequences. the extent great recession put global economic growth back proof enough this. liquidity 13. the second challenge come liquidity framework. the global crisis underscore importance liquidity management banks. the apparently strong bank run difficulty interbank wholesale fund market witness seizure. in fact i mention elsewhere matter time liquidity risk degenerate solvency risk bank therefore need avoided. the crisis prove central bank support, crisis toll could go beyond saw. the lcr nsfr framework basically address problem. 14. in indian context, discussion lcr issue bring fore fact run parallel slr requirement. we period time reduce slr current level 21.5%, portion i.e.7 % available lcr well. there always contention parallel need maintain slr lcr pose additional burden bank india. we aware concern already communicate intention reduce slr requirement phase manner. however, several factor would address move address potential overlap. 15. the nsfr framework draft consultation. we look comment receive come final guideline take consideration response extent accommodate them. technology 16. the third challenge technology. a i mention earlier, bcbs process make significant change standardise approach compute rwas three risk areas. these revise standardise approach self quite risk sensitive dependent number computational requirements. further, bcbs propose bank advance approaches, rwas base standardise approach may work kind floor. bcbs work calibration floors. bank may need upgrade system process able compute capital requirement base revise standardise approach. skill development 17. the fourth challenge skill development. i see requirement supervise entity within reserve bank. implementation new capital accord require high specialise skill banks. in fact require paradigm shift risk management. the governance process recognise need make sure supervise entity gear it. risk awareness spread bank-wide, manner business measure risk adjust return need permeate system. top management human resource development policy bank thus need get tune bi central bankers’ speech 5 requirement. we reserve bank also need hone skill regulate supervise bank new system. we see ongoing process continuously work towards skill improvement. governance 18. one capital, liquid asset infrastructure. but corporate governance decide factor ability bank meet challenges. bcbs add separate principle corporate governance core principle effective bank supervision revise 2012. it interest note 2012, separate principle corporate governance. i think global community recognise importance corporate governance try fix issues. thus strong capital give financial strength, cannot assure good performance unless back good corporate governance. element conservatism minimum standard 19. several speaker mention super equivalence issue. let add bite discussion i conclude. there general feel put place stringent framework basel norm require. of course one would point 9 percent crar, 4.5 leverage ratio, slr run parallel lcr, high ccf otc derivative like. we need see context. i already deal slr-lcr issue. on capital, i say ultimate analysis, aggregate basis, make much difference. we must also appreciate relatively much long recovery process default loans, short history rat assign rat agency indian condition put certain constraint benchmarking international standards, relatively large population unrated borrower especially mid sme corporate sectors, market risk factor exhibit volatilities, etc. add challenges. besides, pillar 2 process relate add-on capital requirement also yet fully stabilised. the high prescription 9% minimum requirement comparison basel minimum 8% may see context. moreover, economy whose financial system dominate banks, one build resilience case. we also announce two bank dsibs base criterion size, interconnectedness, complexity substitutability. 20. i must add recent regulatory consistency assessment programme bcbs find regulation fully compliant issue relate capital. such affirmation bank work regulatory environment consistent global standard assurance international financial system business indian bank like other. it would instructive quote bcbs chairman2 “i would like remind basel framework minimum standard member free go beyond minimum. we actually encourage that, jurisdiction adopt minimum requirement exceed global standard. super-equivalences often find develop emerge market economies, bank high risk profile. the local regulator therefore set high minimum requirements”. 2 basel iii implementation: progress, pitfalls, prospects: keynote speech mr stefan ingves, chairman, basel committee bank supervision governor, sverige riksbank high-level meet americas, lima, peru, 3–5 november 2014. 6 bi central bankers’ speech incidentally, may also appreciate jurisdiction prescribe high minimum capital standards. several jurisdictions, particularly asian countries, propose high capital adequacy ratio basel iii may see table. 21. let conclude now. i begin say necessary implement basel iii india. i look various challenge bring argue cannot see challenge isolation. the basel rule seek make bank resilient risk aware. such bank system always good unstable one. we cannot overlook fact crisis good prevent face aftermath crisis costly incremental cost one incur prevent it. i suppose deliberation today’s meet would oblivious reality. let thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: medium long-term priority capital market union (cmu) ecb/eurosystem panel remark mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, eurofi conference, luxembourg, 10 september 2015. * * * while green paper set right overall objective cmu identify priority early action measure medium- long-term, cmu need pursue high level ambition achieve great capital market development deep financial integration. 1. to bring expect benefits, cmu

başçi: recent economic financial development turkey speech mr erdem başçi, governor central bank republic turkey, press conference presentation july 2015 inflation report, ankara, 30 july 2015. * * * accompany chart find end speech. distinguish guests, welcome brief hold convey main message inflation report july 2015. the report typically summarize economic outlook underlie monetary policy decisions, share evaluation macroeconomic development present medium-term inflation forecasts, revise view development last quarter, along monetary policy stance. in addition main text, report include six box entail interest up-to-date analysis various topics. these box report look information content credit explain inflation, scrutinize taxation turkish tobacco product market, analyze export-inflation relationship food products, examine use survey data short-term gdp forecasts, elaborate effect oil price exports, present information government spend multiplier. the title box show slide. all analysis shed light noteworthy issue turkish economy. i strongly recommend read boxes, soon publish website. i would like commence speech review global economic outlook, give undeniable influence policies. global financial market remain volatile second quarter 2015, attribute continue divergence among global monetary policies, uncertainty surround federal reserve (fed)’s normalization plan development regard greek debt crisis. in period, volatility long-term rate reach quite high levels, especially across advance economy (chart 1), also affect emerging-market rates. thus, portfolio flow emerging-markets weaken (chart 2). the global economic slowdown 2014 continue first quarter 2015 largely due emerge economies. despite sign economic recovery europe, geopolitical tension continue restrain turkey’s external demand. the volatility across global market implication turkish economy well, cause fluctuation financial indicator amid domestic uncertainty. in period heighten volatility long-term interest rate advance country add interest-rate sensitivity emerge economies, interest-rate corridor tight liquidity policy implement play major role shield economy global shocks. moreover, structural cyclical measure support fx liquidity, core liability long-term borrow strengthen economy’s resilience. 1. monetary policy financial condition in view uncertainty global market volatility food energy prices, maintain cautious monetary stance second quarter 2015. in period, keep interest rate unchanged, continue tight liquidity policy contain risk core inflation inflation expectations. to meet recently grow liquidity need, weight marginal fund increase and, result, cbrt average fund rate increase (chart 3). the cbrt average fund rate hover around 8.5 percent since mid-june (chart 4). the bist interbank overnight rate, hand, remain close upper bind corridor previous report period. 2 bi central bankers’ speech thank cautious monetary stance, yield curve remain nearly flat. although yield curve remain basically unchanged since publication previous inflation report, slight increase market rate two-year maturity (chart 5). thus, spread overnight repo rate bist interbank money market 5-year market rate narrow somewhat (chart 6). i would like reiterate monitor inflation expectations, price behavior factor affect inflation closely maintain cautious monetary policy stance keep flat yield curve significant improvement inflation outlook upcoming period. the wide interest rate corridor tight liquidity policy implement reduce economy’s sensitivity global shocks, thus support financial stability facilitate attainment price stability objective. in post-crisis period, unconventional policy advance economy ongoing uncertainty global monetary policy cause long-term interest rate economy fluctuate. in addition, emerging-market rate become extremely sensitive global monetary policy developments. to contain repercussion turkish economy, design monetary policy framework compose wide interest rate corridor active liquidity policy. the cbrt’s wide interest rate corridor tight liquidity policy strengthen resilience turkish economy global shock prove effective pursue primary objective price stability. the wide interest rate corridor enable u raise short-term rate temporarily long-term rate face shock keep yield curve nearly flat inverted. accordingly, turkish lira-denominated long-term rate remain stable economy become le sensitive global long-term interest rate shocks. moreover, flat invert yield curve constitute effective monetary policy stance support disinflation. in fact, especially follow strong monetary tighten early 2014, saw sensitivity domestic market global interest rate weaken substantially core inflation indicator improve significantly (chart 7). in upcoming period, follow start normalization global monetary policies, volatility long-term interest rate may decline permanently thank forward guidance policies. accord baseline scenario, need wide interest rate corridor country may diminish time. in case, may simplify operational framework cbrt’s interest rate policy gradually. in addition interest rate corridor tight liquidity policy, continue make efficient use policy tool develop response global financial volatility. these measure take regard financial system highly important encourage prudential borrow minimize macrofinancial risk amid domestic external uncertainty. the remuneration turkish lira require reserve different rate depend core liability effective january 2015. a 8 may 2015 maintenance period, raise remuneration rate 50 basis points. additionally, rise fx require reserve ratio extend maturity noncore liability appear contribute recent slowdown uptrend loan/deposit ratio (chart 8). furthermore, decrease share short-term non-deposit fx liability follow change fx require reserve stimulate long-term borrow become pronounce second quarter (chart 9). a another measure relate fx liquidity, remunerate usd denominate require reserves, reserve option free reserve hold cbrt 5 may 2015. we set announce remuneration rate apply daily basis take global local financial market condition account. in addition, reduce annual commission rate 0.02 basis point apply since 1 february 2015 euro-denominated account bank finance company cbrt yearly 0.005 basis point 1 july 2015, abolish 27 july 2015 due recent development euro area. bi central bankers’ speech 3 thank tight monetary policy stance macroprudential measures, loan growth continue stay reasonable levels. adjust exchange rate changes, loan provide non-financial sector increase modestly 18.1 percent year-on-year second quarter 2015. a comparison consumer commercial loan show commercial loan continue grow high rate consumer loans, partly due brsa regulations. the annualized growth rate commercial loan drop 15.1 percent end second quarter 2015, whereas rate 21.6 percent exchange rate-adjusted commercial loans. likewise, compare growth trend average past years, commercial loan close average whereas consumer loan significantly average (charts 10 11). due moderate economic activity recent tighten financial conditions, loan growth likely slow somewhat forthcoming period. 2. macroeconomic development main assumption now, i talk macroeconomic outlook assumption forecast based. first, i summarize recent inflation developments, continue domestic foreign demand outlook upon base projections. in second quarter 2015, annual consumer inflation decline 0.4 point end-first quarter 7.20 percent, near forecast april inflation report (charts 12 13). this improvement inflation mainly attribute decline food inflation, core inflation increase mostly due exchange rate developments. in period, contribution food category annual inflation 2.3 point amid correction food prices. yet, depreciation turkish lira limit decline inflation. the ongoing cautious monetary policy along prudent fiscal macroprudential policy favorable impact inflation, especially inflation exclude energy food (core inflation indicators). however, lag effect recent exchange rate development delay improvement inflation outlook. in fact, compare first quarter notable deterioration underlie core inflation trend second quarter (chart 14). this outlook largely due exchange rate-driven cost pressure become strong previous period. the cautious monetary stance moderate course domestic demand continue limit spillover cost pressure prices. a project april inflation report, food price exhibit remarkable correction amid climatic condition accommodate supply second quarter. annual food inflation, make around 25 percent consumption basket, fell 9.28 percent june. similarly, annual inflation food cater service post significant decline period. also period, consumer inflation exclude food cater service increase 1 point 5.82 percent inter-reporting period due cost pressure (chart 15). to sum up, food price pull inflation second quarter, yet depreciation turkish lira restrict decline, inhibit desire improvement inflation outlook. owe expect partial recovery food price accompany cautious monetary policy, project deterioration inflation outlook remain limit inflation reach target medium term. accord gdp data first quarter 2015, economic activity prove robust compare outlook present april inflation report, gdp rise 1.3 2.3 percent quarterly annual basis, respectively (chart 16). an analysis national income component production side indicate sector exclude construction exhibit increase first quarter compare previous-quarter averages. in period, agriculture net tax item regard gdp growth stand out, industry 4 bi central bankers’ speech service maintain mild trend increase (chart 17). seasonally-adjusted data expenditure side reveal final domestic demand increase owe rise consumption expenditure first quarter. investment expenditure contract public private sector quarterly basis. accord data export import good services, export post increase, import decline quarterly basis first quarter. foreign trade data exclude gold indicate import quantity index post steady rise line uptrend domestic demand period, export decline amid weak course external demand. data second quarter 2015 suggest economic activity continue expand moderate pace. industrial production rise 1.0 percent april-may period compare previous quarter. combine indicator june, expect industrial production record quarterly increase second quarter. sales, production, import indicator regard domestic demand show final domestic demand continue uptrend stem consumption demand. investment indicators, hand, signal weak outlook remain second quarter. the export quantity index exclude gold increase modest rate april-may period follow contraction first quarter, import exclude gold maintain uptrend suggest contribution external demand economic growth may limit second quarter (chart 18). the recovery economic activity project continue upcoming period, yet risk growth exist. downside risk regard external demand persist due geopolitical development trouble europe. moreover, domestic uncertainties, weak course confidence indices, volatility financial market drive global monetary policy may limit contribution final private demand growth. despite existence factor keep downside risk alive, robust employment performance follow global crisis along low oil price generate room domestic demand economic policy improve current account balance inflation outlook. in addition, expect correction agricultural value add emerge factor may support growth production side. against background, project second half 2015 witness sustain moderate growth demand condition support disinflation. in line favorable development term trade couple slowdown consumer loans, recovery trend current account balance anticipate continue upcoming period; yet weak course external demand may limit recovery extent (chart 19). a know, food, energy import price also play great role inflation forecasts. therefore, move forecasts, i briefly talk assumption regard variables. in second quarter 2015, oil price stand slightly path project previous report, usd-denominated import price remain projection (chart 20). on annual basis, low average oil price assumption 2 percent 2015, around 6 percent 2016. accordingly, revise assumption annual percentage change average import price downwards 1.7 point 2015 1.4 point 2016. development food price show unprocessed food price exhibit notable correction second quarter 2015 contribution food price inflation witness significant decline. due projection correction continue effect measure take relate institution materialize, revise food inflation assumption end-2015 downwards 9 percent 8 percent. our medium-term projection base assumption tax adjustment administer price exceed inflation target consistent automatic price mechanisms. the medium-term fiscal policy stance base medium term program projection cover 2015-2017 period. accordingly, assume cautious fiscal bi central bankers’ speech 5 stance implement primary expenditure gdp ratio decrease gradually. 3. inflation monetary policy outlook now, i would like present inflation output gap forecast base outlook i describe far. our medium-term forecast base framework cautious monetary policy stance maintain keep yield curve flat significant improvement inflation outlook. moreover, envisage annual loan growth rate continue hover around recent reasonable level 2015, also thank macroprudential measures. accordingly, expect inflation be, 70 percent probability, 6.0 percent 7.8 percent (with mid-point 6.9 percent) end-2015 3.7 percent 7.3 percent (with mid-point 5.5 percent) end-2016. we estimate inflation stabilize around 5 percent medium term (chart 21). in second quarter 2015, exchange rate movement delay recovery core inflation trend, cause year-end inflation forecast raise 0.5 point. on hand, improvement import food price compare previous report reduce year-end inflation forecast 0.1 point 0.3 point, respectively. a result, import food price estimate offset adverse effect core inflation figure second half year. accordingly, revise end-2015 inflation forecast, set 6.8 percent april inflation report, upwards 0.1 point. we keep end-2016 inflation forecast, 5.5 percent previous report, unchanged. consider downward revision average oil price assumption pull end-2016 inflation around 0.1 point, effect compensate effect come rise inflation forecast end-2015, leave end-2016 inflation forecast intact (chart 21). we opinion base effect continue determine course inflation rest 2015. accordingly, envisage inflation decline september, increase slightly september due base effects. then, follow fluctuate course, project reach 6.9 percent year-end. in addition forecasts, discus alternative scenario inflation outlook global economy risk section inflation report. you examine report details. while conclude remarks, i would like thank colleague contribute report, primarily research monetary policy department well member monetary policy committee, thank every one participation. 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi

movement india. he active areas, confront monopolistic giant like telephone services, indian airlines, particularly banks, earn title champion consumer. consumer protection consumer activism come long way since times. the best example financial sector legislative reform commission (fslrc) say report 2013. “consumer protection: a prime motivation financial regulation protect consumers. the relationship financial firm customer one where, many times, outcome may harm customers. these problem sporadic accidental; often root basic problem information incentive alleviate financial literacy

committee financial sector reform chair dr raghuram g. rajan. the rbi set bank ombudsman scheme act visible credible dispute resolution agency common person utilize bank service ensure redress grievance user bank service inexpensive, expeditious fair manner provide impetus improve customer service bank sector continuous basis. bi central bankers’ speech 5 some recent initiative reserve bank 15. let detail recent initiative reserve bank regard consumer protection: a) most important perhaps release charter customer rights, enshrine broad, overarch principle protection bank customer enunciate “five” basic right bank customers. these are: (i) right fair treatment; (ii) right transparency; fair honest dealing; (iii) right suitability; (iv) right privacy; (v) right grievance redress

understand many depositor’s mind, several question linger eagerly await regulator’s response. a i understand, answer seek rationale explanation action call “inactions”. it duty explain. let discus contemporary issue questions. deposit insurance 17. first issue i want discus relate deposit insurance. more specifically, issue relate increase limit deposit insurance cover. deposit insurance protect depositor loss deposit case deposit institution able meet obligation insure depositors. in india, commercial banks, regional rural bank (rrbs), local area bank (labs) co-operative bank cover deposit insurance. there persistent demand stakeholder public representative 8 bi central bankers’ speech recent past hike deposit insurance cover current level ₹1 lakh. the deposit insurance system around world evolve time reform adopt various jurisdiction base experience, international developments, guidance supra national body like imf, international association deposit insurer (iadi environmental change time time. one basic principle deposit insurance deposit insurance system cover least 80% deposit account 20–30% total assessable deposits. in india, surpass norm substantial way; march 31, 2015, dicgc’s deposit insurance cover high 92.3% deposit account 31% total assessable deposits. 18. therefore, decide demand, factor two major issue viz., moral hazard issue risk base premium issue. deposit insurance inherently create moral hazard i.e. party deposit insurance viz. bank insure depositor get incentive take risk cost risk, whole part, bear others, generally deposit insurance agency, case deposit insurance credit guarantee corporation (dicgc). most deposit insurance system initially adopt ex-ante flat-rate premium system relatively simple design, implement administer. however, system open criticism reflect level risk bank pose deposit insurance system. flat-rate premium system also view unfair “low-risk” bank require pay premium “higher-risk” banks. with inbuilt incentive “higher risk” bank improve risk profile, flat rate system would accentuate moral hazard problem. therefore primary objective differential premium system provide incentive bank avoid excessive risk taking, minimise moral hazard introduce fairness premium assessment process. introduce fairness system bolster industry support deposit insurance. a hike cover without calibrate premium rate risk profile insure bank exacerbate moral hazard. recognise this, committee differential premium system bank india (chairman: shri jasbir singh) constitute dicgc submit report yesterday. we hope introduction risk base premium system make grind consider raise insurance cover present ceiling ₹ 1 lakh. structure differentiate bank consumer protection 19. you notice recently grant “in principle” license 11 entity form payment bank country; several nurture vague feel differentiate bank subserve consumer interests. i want explain carefully structure regulatory arrangement bank perspective consumer protection. 20. a recall, consequent discussion paper call “banking structure india – the way forward”, bring reserve bank august 2013, recommendation committee head shri nachiket mor, comprehensive financial service small business low-income household look issue relate financial inclusion, november 2014 announce intention grant license two type differentiate bank viz., payment bank small finance banks. 21. the objective set payment bank financial inclusion; strategy provide (i) small save account (ii) payment / remittance service migrant labour workforce, low income households, small businesses, unorganised sector entity users. the scope activity permit payment bank include a. acceptance demand deposits. payment bank initially restrict hold maximum balance ₹ 1 lakh per individual customer, b. issuance atm / debit card c. payment remittance service various channel ancillary activities. bi central bankers’ speech 9 22. the deposit collect current save account; cannot accept fix deposits. the payment bank prohibit lend activity. they deploy deposit largely government security only; small portion, 25% deposits, hold deposit banks. 23. the consumer protection aspect design follows: the public deposit payment bank cover deposit insurance dicgc. a deposit ceiling ₹ 1 lakh deposit insurance ceiling also ₹ 1 lakh, mean depositor payment bank fully insured. actually, argument payment bank cover deposit insurance, asset fully high quality liquid asset government security high credit bank accounts. still, conclude assurance deposit insurance need depositor payment banks, concept new depositor need additional confidence. 24. a payment bank may operate remote area mostly bcs, atm networks, payment bank require least 25 per cent physical access point include bcs rural centres. further, require control office cluster access point also establish control various outlet customer grievance redressal. we insist bank high power customer grievance cell handle customer complaints. the payment bank also come purview rbi’s bank ombudsman scheme, 2006. 25. now, let explain arduous process adopt grant “in principle” licence. i want emphasize grant bank license tick box exercise; need base high regulatory comfort “fit proper” position manage bank. further, bank high leverage organisations; whose money leverage? they actually leverage public deposits. should require high degree assurance entity public money entrusted? will actually mean, say guidelines, license shall issue selective basis. the license authority apply mind exercise judgment. to this, multiple layer check exercise arbitrary. actually, five layer assessment – first round preliminary scrutiny staff base eligibility criteria, second round detail analysis application staff information collection, include agencies, third round external committee comprise people high integrity expertise, fourth round internal committee, fifth round committee central board reserve bank. we convince decision adopt cautious approach license payment bank initial year prudent sound. 26. another care take keep intact difference authorise financial service provider versus license financial product purveyors. the financial service provider deal consumers’ money; render broking, agency / advisory service consumers. whereas, financial product purveyor like banks, mutual fund insurance companies, actually receive money consumer manage moneys. this handle public money need totally different regulatory approach, compare handle service consumer agency advisory function. that prudential regulation former much stringent conduct regulation latter. it clearly follow liberal authorisation may possible case service providers, cautious authorisation need case authorisation banks. 27. we also announce license small finance banks, another new set differentiate banks. the objective set small finance banks, like payment banks, also financial inclusion; however, seek achieve different set strategy viz., (i) provision save vehicle primarily unserved underserved section population, (ii) supply credit small business units; small marginal farmers; micro small industries; unorganised sector entities, 10 bi central bankers’ speech high technology-low cost operations. the small finance bank, furtherance objective set up, shall primarily undertake basic bank activity acceptance deposit lend unserved underserved section include small business units, small marginal farmers, micro small industry unorganised sector entities. it also undertake non-risk share simple financial service activities, require commitment fund, distribution mutual fund units, insurance products, pension products, etc. 28. the prudential guideline small finance bank suitably tweaked. it require extend 75 per cent adjust net bank credit (anbc) sector eligible classification priority sector lend (psl). the maximum loan size investment limit exposure single group obligor would restrict 10 per cent 15 per cent capital funds, respectively. further, order ensure bank extend loan primarily small borrowers, least 50 per cent loan portfolio constitute loan advance ₹ 25 lakh. 29. keep customer protection requirement view, prescribe small finance bank high power customer grievance cell handle customer complaint small finance bank come purview rbi’s bank ombudsman scheme, 2006. 30. we receive 72 application final stage determine grant licenses. at cost repetition, i want emphasize also grant bank license tick box exercise; need base high regulatory comfort “fit proper” position manage bank. the small finance bank also high leverage organisations, require high degree assurance entity public money entrusted. therefore, licence shall issue selective basis only; soon announce grant license select applicants. market development customer protection 31. a regulator often face dilemma market development market innovation versus customer protection. we still develop emerge market; several respect reach international standards, still quite sizable segment financial sector need development innovations. financial inclusion case point. new idea need encouraged; initial cost typically high need recovered; initial period risk failure need adequate return compensation. on hand, compulsion militate consumer protection. a regulators, recognise dilemma. we face dilemma recent year case micro finance institutions, atms, credit debit cards, electronic fund transfer service like rtgs neft even cash services. we convince need expansion service conveniences; understand trade-off charge service consumer interests. our approach gradual move facilitate entrenchment development innovation ensure competition choice consumer fair treatment consumer fair charges. life low interest rate regime 32. now, i would like paint scenario emerge country next year preparation u saver undertaking. for long period, specifically live memory post-independence era, india go high inflationary period; course, thankfully, never hyper inflationary period like several african south american countries; certainly, experience inflation high single digit teen hence inflationary expectation well entrenched. though experience low inflationary level periods, could sustain it. for yet another time, experience low level bi central bankers’ speech 11 inflation amply clear time around able sustain year come. also, monetary policy framework agreement government, prescribe objective monetary policy maintain consumer inflation four, plus minus two percent. this give necessary assurance confidence keep inflationary expectation bay. it hearten note influential thinker worry recession. 33. what low inflationary period entail savers? for one thing, realize real value save high remain preserve protected. in period low inflation, real value money change much. however, find nominal interest rate receive low, compare interest rate enjoy high inflation period. after all, simple formula determine interest rate is: nominal interest rate = real interest rate + rate inflation. 34. a real interest rate economy le constant, nominal interest rate directly proportional rate inflation. thus rise rate inflation increase fall rate inflation falls. 35. the uninformed may get worried; may give rise illusion – specifically mind live fix interest income; income level come down. it so; actually, low nominal interest income command fetch good good services, real value save income preserved. 36. a business consumer confidence high good low inflationary levels, saver high appetite risk taking. this mean le reliance pure fix interest income; investing, saver weigh various financial product capital market appropriate risk-reward combination. saver increasingly need seek service financial adviser analyst help decide investments. this life must prepare for. conclusion 37. to conclude, let recall “the uncommon common man’, shri m r pai espoused. in word “most indian ignorant right therefore take ride”. a regulators, conscious position constantly pay close attention financial consumer protection, specifically protection vulnerable, defenseless retail consumers. 38. thank much patient attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 erkki liikanen: monetary policy effectiveness speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, public lecture croatian national bank, zagreb, 10 september 2015. * * * accompany slide find bank finland’s website lady gentlemen, it give great pleasure opportunity address today. at moment, interest juncture economic monetary development eu euro area. the economic condition country continent –big small, northern southern – deeply interconnected, i believe share many concern interests. it long arduous journey eu least euro area crisis 2008–2009 today, last see real promise economic recovery area well increase confidence solid foundation last financial stability laid. there lot uncertainties, course, global economy, regional geopolitics, – also sign economic recovery underway. so, excite time monetary policy important part overall picture. it purpose today concentrate monetary policy relate questions. i survey monetary policy situation point view euro area perspective member ecb’s govern council. it useful start review recent monetary policy, exceptional historical standards, term strength instruments. so, exactly doing? how impact euro area economy? what else need do ensure balance sustainable recovery? [slide 2] commitment accommodative monetary… commitment accommodative monetary policy benefit economic outlook the govern council ecb take series monetary policy measure stimulate euro area economy. the aim measure maintain price stability medium term. the recent monetary policy ease cycle, start june 2014, consist several measures. in addition interest rate policy, use so-called non-standard measure unprecedented scale. [slide 3] interest rate policy 2014 in june september 2014 govern council ecb cut monetary policy lend rate decide negative deposit facility rate. in consequence monetary policy interest rate reduce zero low bound. [slide 4] the decision support provision credit 2014 the govern council also introduce two asset purchase programmes, asset back security (abs) cover bonds. it also launch new refinance facility encourage bank increase lend productive investments. [slide 5] the decision large scale asset purchase forward… 2 bi central bankers’ speech in january 2015, govern council judge additional need ease monetary policy stance, inflation outlook weaken further. in situation launch big asset purchase programme eurosystem history. through expand asset purchase programme, eurosystem extend purchase bond issue euro area governments, government agency european institutions. within programme, eurosystem buy security value eur 60 billion per month september 2016, beyond necessary. thus, total purchase eur 1,000 billion. euro area government bond make purchases. the motivation behind decision expand purchase euro-denominated public sector security increase probability euro area fall deflation adverse effect stem prolong period low inflation. the govern council ecb want prevent price stability objective lose role firm anchor inflation expectation price formation euro area. the govern council state purchase “are intend run end september 2016, beyond, necessary, and, case, see sustain adjustment path inflation consistent aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term.” and flag readiness carry purchase security necessary. with forward guidance govern council indicate commitment monetary policy realign inflation price stability objective. in january euro area headline inflation negative –0.6%, hover around 0.2% past month august 2015. with nominal short-term interest rate already zero low bound, fade inflation expectation push real interest rates, effectively tighten monetary policy. [slide 6] large scale asset purchase stimulate large scale asset purchase stimulate demand inflation the two main channel effect large-scale asset purchase – often refer literature – signal effect portfolio balance effect. [slide 7] signal portfolio balance effect large-scale… the signal effect contribute strong anchor inflation expectation line medium-term objective price stability. this effect also contribute reduce anticipate real rates. depend monetary policy reaction rest world, signal also put downward pressure exchange rates. the portfolio balance effect broaden effect security purchase whole financial system even comparatively narrow range high-quality security purchase central bank. with effect, investor encourage shift hold asset class – e.g. sovereign corporate bonds, debt equity, across jurisdictions. this indirect effect price require rate return financial market whole. [slide 8] ecb’s accommodative monetary policy overall, ecb’s accommodative monetary policy low real interest rate eas financial condition economy, boost demand. consumption increase low cost debt finance, reduce cost equity weak exchange rate combination contribute make investment project profitable previously deem unattractive. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this support private consumption various channels. also, low cost debt finance, reduce cost equity finance, weak exchange rate contribute make investment project profitable. [slide 9] divergence monetary policy cycle weaken euro the divergence international monetary policy cycle put downward pressure external value euro. this development partly result tighten monetary policy expectation side atlantic. [slide 10] renew decline oil price put downward pressure… condition wide spectrum asset market develop broadly intend current cycle monetary policy easing. however, slowdown emerge market recent sharp fluctuation financial commodity market bring downside risk outlook growth inflation. the renew decline oil price put downward pressure inflation short run. [slide 11] commitment accommodative monetary policy stance… commitment accommodative monetary policy stance support inflation expectations, thereby low real interest rate. more recently, renew downside risk emerge inflation expectation decreased. however, owe sharp fluctuation financial commodity markets, govern council judge premature conclude whether development could last impact outlook prices, whether consider mainly transitory. [slide 12] sharp fall long-term bond yields… the ecb’s asset purchase programme already lead low reference interest rate whole maturity spectrum gradually result favourable borrow condition non-financial corporation households. despite somewhat high bond yield recently, borrow condition remain favourable loan dynamic expect improve. [slide 13] stock market turbulence august a policy quantitative ease boost property price stock markets. in august, however, equity price fell sharply china also globally uncertainty state chinese economy increased. this send jitter stock market world. it remain see whether uncertainty increase permanent fashion. [slide 14] monetary policy transmission real economy… monetary policy transmission real economy improve the expand asset purchase begin begin march. the full impact measures, especially accompany firm action policymakers, see month year ahead. while already see substantial effect measure bond yield asset prices, ultimately matter equivalent effect investment, consumption inflation. [slide 15] monetary policy measure support bank lend 4 bi central bankers’ speech recovery bank lend strengthen source finance important factor work current monetary policy euro area. our policy also improve credit channel, confirm fact credit private sector last gradually pick up. the ecb’s monetary policy measure enhance financial intermediation number ways. they low fund cost banks, make lend cheap profitable, thereby boost volume lending. and bank benefit measure via positive impact real economy. an improve real economy eventually reflect expand balance sheet improve profitability as, example, share non-performing loan loan stock declines. at time, banks’ credit risk decline, make easy increase lending. [slide 16] monetary policy transmission non-financial corporations… these extraordinary monetary policy measure contribute broad-based ease financial condition favourable borrow condition firm households. they support economic activity euro area countries, especially suffer stress condition recent year time execute substantial structural measure improve performance long run. [slide 17] corporate bond yield remain low… the importance market fund non-financial corporation increase euro area. the asset purchase support corporate bond markets, investor sell government bond expect switch higher-risk corporate bonds, reflect portfolio balance effect. corporate bond yield reach record low euro area early 2015. although corporate emission partially compensate decline bank lend case large corporations, smes access alternative source fund therefore still highly dependent bank lending. [slide 18] average interest rate new house loans… from perspective achieve price stability vital monetary policy measure positive effect corporate expenditure, also household expenditure. [slide 19] the recovery euro area expect continue the recovery euro area expect continue [slide 20] ecb staff projection september a result accommodative monetary policy measures, inflation growth outlook improved. the information available september indicate continue though somewhat weak economic recovery slow increase inflation rate compare early expectations. the recovery support domestic dynamics, external environment become le favourable. despite downward revision, ecb staff projection publish last week still point sustain recovery lead real growth rate 1.8%.% 2017. [slide 21] inflation outlook subdue 2015–2016 bi central bankers’ speech 5 inflation expect remain low project rise projection horizon, reach 1.7% 2017. the projection hicp inflation also entail downward revision, largely due low oil prices. [slide 22] finland fall behind euro area growth the accommodative monetary policy beneficial euro area finnish economy. the bank finland assess impact expand asset purchase programme finnish economy. accord calculations, low interest rate weak exchange rate increase gpd growth rate finland 0.3 percentage point two years. however, finland fall behind euro area growth export suffer labour market situation deteriorated. unfortunately, finland expect reach pace recovery rest euro area near term. [slide 23] financial stability risk macroprudential policy financial stability risk macroprudential policy while current monetary policy measure necessary ecb achieve primary objective maintain price stability ensure inflation remain low long, current monetary policy stance may also unintended side-effects financial system. a key concern prolong period accommodative monetary policy could result misallocation resource would ultimately undermine financial stability. [slide 24] the mandate ecb the eurosystem’s primary objective maintain price stability, monetary policy decision base assessment risk price stability euro area whole. high risk financial stability address primarily domestic so-called macroprudential policy different member countries. in single currency area, macroprudential policy particularly important deal sectoral regional risk cannot account single monetary policy. macroprudential policy therefore provide much need instrument mitigate financial stability risk thereby support price-stability-focused monetary policy. [slide 25] the ecb’s role new supervisory architecture from perspective financial stability, euro area substantially good position year ago. we operate new regulatory supervisory environment. in november last year, ecb take responsibility supervise bank country belong bank union. it le well-known that, time, ecb become ultimate macroprudential decision-maker union. [slide 26] the ecb reinforce cannot substitute… more specifically, ecb apply high requirement specific macroprudential tool propose designate national macroprudential authorities, deem suggest national measure inadequate. in contrast single monetary policy, macroprudential policy bank union joint responsibility different authorities. the main responsibility macroprudential policy lie national authorities. they best position detect country-specific systemic risk take appropriate measure address them. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the role ecb macroprudential policy enhance national policy reduce inaction bias inherent take potentially unpopular intrusive national actions. the ecb help identify potential financial stability risk foster coordinate stance macroprudential policy among euro area member states. the european systemic risk board (esrb), turn, monitor development eu-wide cross-border cross-sectional systemic risk provide guidance recommendation national authorities. [slide 27] macroprudential policy important time of… a necessary precondition successful macroprudential policy – national level bank union whole – availability sufficient macroprudential toolkits. importantly, capital requirement regulation directive (crr/crd iv) provide ecb national authority common minimum set macroprudential tool bank sector. these include countercyclical capital buff requirements, capital surcharge systemically important institution minimum risk weight real estate exposures, example. however, euro area countries, national toolkits strengthened. for example, many country tool contain excess house market build resilience realization housing-related risk strong enough. in addition, develop new tool address systemic risk potentially develop shadow bank sector. the availability strong national macroprudential toolkits courage use tool utmost importance current environment low interest rates. the ecb’s govern council closely monitor potential risk euro area financial stability, include excessive risk-taking. currently, risk contained. should emerge, macroprudential policy would best suit address them. it clear much work remain do make european financial system safer. we need evaluate sufficiency toolkits national authority ecb, well learn use new tool effectively; work progress continue. but take important step right direction. [slide 28] transparency improve accountability… transparency improve accountability effectiveness monetary policy in january year, govern council decide expand asset purchase programme, also decide publish summary meeting’s deliberation next monetary policy meeting. the day ‘never excuse, never explain’ central bank act opaque secretive institution good. [slide 29] transparency, accountability efficiency:.. a high degree transparency important tool independent central bank like ecb, facilitate accountability. we accountable achieve mandate, price stability. by explain reason behind monetary policy decision help good understand monetary policy make easy attain objective, facilitate efficiency. in mid-2013, introduce forward guidance 2014 convey govern council’s ‘reaction function’ increase influence shape yield curve. when decide purchase programme january, long-term nominal interest rate declined, communicate reaction function market understand it. bi central bankers’ speech 7 most recently, go forward, president mario draghi clarify reaction function discuss condition determine duration intensity expand asset purchase programme, beyond express intention carry purchase end-september 2016. we emphasize evaluate likelihood inflation converge level close 2%, also stabilize around level sufficient confidence thereafter. the decision publish account monetary policy meet precede long thorough discussion govern council. a increasingly resort unconventional measure meet mandate, decide need open public reach decisions. at time, felt even difference view communicate without compromise credibility singleness monetary policy. such difference quite normal exist committee meaningful analytical discussions. the account decide start publish intend provide rich summary convey flavour discussion among govern council members. this imply report monetary policy deliberation independence member govern council must put risk. at time, also important u preserve collegiality deliberations. that attribute position individual council members. in view, provide fair balance summary main argument put forward best way achieve this. the language use reflect collegiate, consensus-oriented mode discussion decision-making. and publish vote record allow member support decision committee, even may personally prefer different course action. [slide 30] thank you! let conclude. the economic recovery euro area proceeding, albeit slow pace expected. ecb policy working, underlie economic condition improve despite recent financial commodity market volatility. other policymakers, national government responsible effort strengthen euro area economy growth potential medium long term. this achieve mainly implement structural reform base country’s need capabilities. the govern council closely monitor relevant incoming information. it emphasize willingness ability act, use instrument available within mandate and, particular, recall asset purchase programme provide sufficient flexibility term adjust size, composition duration programme. in meantime, fully implement monthly asset purchase €60 billion per month. these purchase already continue favourable impact cost availability credit firm households. a i already noted, take decidedly medium-term approach, reflect commitment continue asset purchase end september 2016, beyond, necessary, and, case, see sustain adjustment path inflation consistent definition price stability. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 barry whiteside: promote financial inclusion

(see blind rudd, 2013, assessment effect special factor – include imposition removal price control 1971–74 period – consumer price inflation 1970s 1980s.) 2 bi central bankers’ speech inflation project return long run effect shock economy fully play out.3 a see figure, estimate trend drift high 1960s 1970s, imply period stable “anchor” inflation could expect eventually return – conclusion generally support procedure estimate trend inflation. today many economist believe feature inflation late 1960s 1970s – high level lack stable anchor – reflect combination factors, include chronically overheat labor product markets, effect energy food price shocks, emergence “inflationary psychology” whereby rise actual inflation lead people revise expectation future inflation. together, various factor cause inflation – actual expect – ratchet high time. ultimately, however, monetary policy bear responsibility broad contour happen actual expect inflation period federal reserve insufficiently focus return inflation predictable, low level follow shock food energy price disturbances. in late 1979, federal reserve begin significantly tighten monetary policy reduce inflation. in response tightening, precipitate severe economic downturn early 1980s, overall inflation move persistently lower, average le 4 percent 1983 1990. inflation come follow 1990–91 recession subsequent slow recovery average 2 percent many years. since recession end 2009, however, unite state experience inflation run appreciably fomc’s 2 percent objective, part reflect gradual pace subsequent economic recovery. examine behavior inflation’s estimate long-term trend reveal another important change inflation dynamics. with caveat result base specific implementation particular statistical model, imply since mid-1990s persistent movement predict long-run inflation rate, remain close 2 percent. remarkably, stability estimate continue recent severe recession, saw unemployment rate rise level comparable see 1981–82 downturn, trend shift markedly.4 a i discuss, stability trend appear link change behavior long-run inflation expectation – measure appear much good anchor today past, likely reflect improvement conduct monetary policy. in event, empirical analysis imply that, past 20 years, inflation much predictable long term back 1970s trend rate inflation predict return long move around appreciably. that said, inflation still vary considerably year year response various shocks. a figure 2 highlights, unite state experience low inflation average since financial crisis, part reflect persistent economic weakness prove difficult fully counter monetary policy. overall inflation (shown dash red line) average 1–1/2 percent per year since 2008 currently close zero. this result merely product fall energy prices, core inflation (the solid black line) also low average period. 3 the predict long-run trend show update estimate make peneva rudd (2015), us vector autoregression (var) time-varying parameter stochastic volatility compute stochastic trend inflation (see paper additional detail regard model specification data definitions). the estimation procedure var similar use clark terry (2010), turn follow cogley sargent (2005); see also cogley others (2010) ascari sbordone (2014) relate applications. 4 trend inflation estimate univariate statistical model manifest somewhat le stability recent years; see clark bednar (2015). bi central bankers’ speech 3 inflation cost in 2012 fomc adopted, first time, explicit longer-run inflation objective 2 percent measure pce price index.5 (other central banks, include european central bank bank england, also 2 percent inflation target.) this decision reflect fomc’s judgment inflation persistently deviate – – fix low level costly number ways. persistent high inflation induce household firm spend time effort try minimize cash hold force business adjust price frequently would otherwise necessary. more importantly, high inflation also tend raise after-tax cost capital, thereby discourage business investment. these adverse effect occur capital depreciation allowance aspect tax system partially index inflation.6 persistently high inflation, unanticipated, especially costly household rely pensions, annuities, long-term bond provide significant portion retirement income. because income provide asset typically fix nominal terms, real purchase power may decline surprisingly quickly inflation turn consistently high originally anticipated, potentially serious consequence retirees’ standard live age.7 an unexpected rise inflation also tend reduce real purchase power labor income time nominal wage salary generally slow adjust movement overall level prices. survey data suggest effect probably number one reason people dislike inflation much.8 in long run, however, real wage – is, wage adjust inflation – appear largely independent average rate inflation instead primarily determine productivity, global competition, nonmonetary factors. in support view, figure 3 show nominal wage growth tend broadly track price inflation long period time. inflation persistently low also costly, cost particularly relevant monetary policymakers recent years. the important cost low inflation constrain central bank’s ability combat recessions. normally, fomc fight economic downturn reduce nominal federal fund rate, rate charge bank lend overnight. these reductions, current expected, stimulate spend hire low longer-term real interest rate – is, nominal 5 in contrast, fomc determine number consideration preclude set fix numerical target leg dual mandate, maximum employment. a discuss statement longer-run goal monetary policy strategy (see note 1), maximum level employment something largely determine nonmonetary factor affect structure dynamic labor market. moreover, maximum level employment, longer-run “natural” rate unemployment, relate aspect labor market directly observable, change time, estimate imprecisely. a result, view vary labor market condition would consistent normal level resource utilization. 6 for general survey cost high inflation, see briault (1995). english (1999) discus cost associate increase need cash management. for discussion cost arise interaction inflation tax system, see feldstein (1997, 1999) cohen others (1999). finally, high inflation may adversely affect economy’s allocation resource increase magnitude misalignment relative price result firm continually adjust prices; discussion cost context new-keynesian model inflation, see ascari sbordone (2014). 7 more broadly, inflation evolve unpredictable manner many years, even financially sophisticate household firm may able avoid significant forecast error attendant costs. such cost arise wide variety situations; instance, firm, union, entity engage multiyear nominal contract may adversely affect unexpected increase decrease inflation, although side contract might benefit. 8 for survey, see shiller (1997). 4 bi central bankers’ speech rate adjust inflation – improve financial condition broadly. but federal fund rate nominal interest rate cannot go much zero, since hold cash always alternative invest securities.9 thus, low fomc feasibly push real federal fund rate essentially negative value inflation rate. a result, federal reserve le room ease monetary policy inflation low. this limitation potentially serious problem severe downturn great recession may require push real interest rate far zero extend period restore full employment satisfactory pace.10 for reason, pursue low inflation objective otherwise tolerate persistently low inflation would inconsistent leg fomc’s mandate, promote maximum employment.11 an unexpected decline inflation sizable persistent also costly increase debt burden borrowers. consider homeowner take conventional fixed-rate mortgage, expectation inflation remain close 2 percent nominal income rise 4 percent per year. if economy instead experience chronic mild deflation accompany flat decline nominal incomes, year homeowner might find noticeably difficult cover monthly mortgage payment originally anticipated. moreover, house price fall line consumer price rather rise expected, equity home low anticipated. this situation, sometimes refer “debt deflation,” would also confront household outstanding student loans, auto loans, credit card debt, well business take bank loan issue bonds.12 of course, situation, lender would receive real income. but net effect economy likely negative, large part borrower typically limit ability absorb losses. and increase debt-service burden decline collateral value severe enough force borrower bankruptcy, resultant hardship impose families, small business owners, laid-off worker may severe.13 9 because inconvenience store protect large quantity currency, firm will pay premium hold short-term government security bank deposit instead. a result, several foreign central bank find possible push nominal short-term interest rate somewhat zero. 10 for example, curdia others (2014) estimate stabilize economy last recession would require low real federal fund rate negative 10 percent time; comparison, average value real federal fund negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. of course, fomc able use policy tools, large-scale asset purchases, put additional downward pressure long-term interest rate nominal fund rate cut near zero; however, policy potential cost risk make imperfect substitute traditional interest rate policy. see krugman (1998), reifschneider williams (2000), eggertsson woodford (2003) discussion effect low inflation zero low bind nominal interest rate central bank’s ability stimulate economy economic downturns. in addition, see english, lopez-salido, tetlow (2015) engen, laubach, reifschneider (2015) model-based analysis effectiveness federal reserve’s large-scale asset purchase forward guidance mitigate effect zero low bound. finally, discussion cost benefit employ large scale asset purchases, see bernanke (2012) yellen (2013). 11 for discussion point, see mishkin (2007). 12 see fisher (1933) early discussion debt deflation effect economy. 13 very low inflation also result chronically high unemployment close important way labor market respond adverse shocks. in sector productivity lag demand slowing, decline real wage might necessary avoid even bad outcomes, layoffs. for various reasons, however, employer often try avoid nominal wage cuts. (bewley (1999) suggest number reason firm find cut nominal wage difficult, include effect cut employee morale. inflation therefore often say “grease wheel labor market” permit require adjustment real wage occur combination unchanged nominal wage rise prices.) but inflation fall low level, passive approach wage reduction may long viable many firms, cause relatively burden adjustment fall employment. bi central bankers’ speech 5 monetary policy action since financial crisis a i note earlier, weigh cost associate various rate inflation, fomc decide 2 percent inflation appropriate operational definition longer-run price objective.14 in wake 2008 financial crisis, however, achieve objective full employment (the leg federal reserve’s dual mandate) difficult, show figure 4. initially, unemployment rate (the solid black line) soar inflation (the dash red line) fell sharply. moreover, recession officially end 2009, subsequent recovery significantly slow variety persistent headwinds, include household underwater mortgage high debt burdens, reduce access credit many potential borrowers, constrain spend state local governments, weaken foreign growth prospects. in effort return employment inflation level consistent federal reserve’s dual mandate, fomc take variety unprecedented action help low longer-term interest rates, include reduce federal fund rate (the dot black line) near zero, communicate public short-term interest rate would likely stay exceptionally low time, buy large quantity longer-term treasury debt agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15 these action contribute highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby help bring considerable improvement labor market condition time. the unemployment rate, peak 10 percent 2009, 5.1 percent, slightly median fomc participants’ current estimate longer-run normal level. although indicator suggest unemployment rate currently understate much slack remain labor market, balance economy long far away full employment. in contrast, inflation continue run committee’s objective past several years, past 12 month essentially zero. nevertheless, committee expect inflation gradually return 2 percent next two three years. i turn determinant inflation factor underlie expectation. 14 blanchard, dell’ariccia mauro (2010), among others, recently suggest central bank consider raise inflation targets, grind condition since financial crisis demonstrate monetary policy constrain effective low bind (elb) nominal interest rate originally estimated. ball (2013), example, propose 4 percent appropriate target fomc. while certainly true early analysis elb cost significantly underestimate likelihood severe recession slow recovery sort recently experience unite state elsewhere (see chung others, 2012), also case analysis take account central banks’ ability use large-scale asset purchase unconventional tool mitigate cost arise elb constraint. in addition, obvious modestly high target rate inflation would greatly increase federal reserve’s ability support real activity special condition prevail wake financial crisis, channel low interest rate stimulate aggregate spending, house construction, probably attenuated. beyond tactical considerations, however, change fomc’s long-run inflation objective would risk call question fomc’s commitment stabilize inflation level might lead people suspect target could change opportunistically future. if so, key benefit stable inflation expectation discuss – increase ability monetary policy fight economic downturn without sacrifice price stability – might lost. moreover, purpose high inflation target increase ability central bank deal severe recession follow financial crises, good strategic approach might rely vigorous supervisory macroprudential policy reduce likelihood events. finally, target inflation vicinity 4 percent high would stretch mean “stable prices” federal reserve act. 15 for complete list federal reserve’s policy action recent years, see “the federal reserve’s response financial crisis action foster maximum employment price stability,” webpage available board’s website. also see engen, laubach, reifschneider (2015) analysis combine macroeconomic effect fomc’s asset purchase guidance concern future path federal fund rate. 6 bi central bankers’ speech inflation dynamic model use describe predict inflation commonly distinguish change food energy price – enter total inflation – movement price good service – is, core inflation. this decomposition useful food energy price extremely volatile, fluctuation often depend factor beyond influence monetary policy, technological political development (in case energy prices) weather disease (in case food prices). a result, core inflation usually provide good indicator total inflation total inflation head medium term.16 of course, food energy account significant portion household budgets, federal reserve’s inflation objective define term overall change consumer prices. what, then, determine core inflation? recall figure 1, core inflation tend fluctuate around longer-term trend essentially stable. let first focus fluctuation turn trend. economic theory suggests, empirical analysis confirms, deviation inflation trend depend partly intensity resource utilization economy – approximated, example, gap actual unemployment rate so-called natural rate, shortfall actual gross domestic product (gdp) potential output. this relationship – likely reflects, among things, tendency firms’ cost rise utilization rate increase – represent important channel monetary policy influence inflation medium term, although practice influence modest gradual. movement certain type input costs, particularly change price import goods, also cause core inflation deviate noticeably trend, sometimes mark amount year year.17 finally, nontrivial fraction quarter-to-quarter, even year-to-year, variability inflation attributable idiosyncratic often unpredictable shocks.18 what determinant inflation’s longer-term trend? here, instructive compare purely statistical estimate trend rate future inflation show early figure 1 survey measure people’s actual expectation long-run inflation, do figure 5. theory suggest inflation expectation – presumably link central bank’s inflation goal – play important role actual price setting.19 indeed, contour series strikingly similar, suggest estimate trend inflation fact relate households’ firms’ long-run inflation expectations.20 16 several approach commonly use abstract short-term volatility overall inflation thereby good discern medium-term direction. for example, one procedure remove component total pce price index large small price change compute average price change, yield “trimmed mean” pce index; another us median price change give period, rather mean change, represent overall inflation rate. in practice, simply use core inflation well predict overall inflation come year beyond alternative procedure (see detmeister, 2011, 2012). 17 another input cost affect core inflation price energy; recent decades, however, pass-through energy price change core inflation appear much small previous period (see hooker, 2002; clark terry, 2010). 18 some idiosyncratic shock relate identifiable factors, change medicare reimbursement rate movement (imputed) price hold check account. (both factor include service component pce price index, consumer price index (cpi).) however, idiosyncratic shock reliably trace specific factors, significant fraction represent unpredictable “noise.” 19 most theoretical version phillips curve suggest inflation depend short-run inflation expectations, but, empirical matter, measure long-run expectation appear explain data better. 20 see clark davig (2008); see also faust wright (2013), make relate point context inflation forecasting. note question expect inflation university michigan survey bi central bankers’ speech 7 to summarize, analysis suggest economic slack, change import good prices, idiosyncratic shock cause core inflation deviate longer-term trend ultimately determine long-run inflation expectations. a recognize, model core inflation variant theoretical model commonly refer expectations-augmented phillips curve.21 total inflation turn reflect movement core inflation, combine change price food energy. an important feature model inflation dynamic overall effect variation resource utilization, import prices, factor inflation depend crucially whether influence also affect long-run inflation expectations. figure 6 illustrate point stylize example inflation consequence gradual increase level import price – perhaps occur response strong real activity abroad fall exchange value dollar – cause rate change import price elevate time.22 first, consider situation show panel a, households’ firms’ expectation inflation solidly anchored, instead adjust response rate inflation actually observed.23 such condition – arguably prevail unite state 1970s mid-1990s – could plausibly arise central bank has, past, allow significant persistent movement inflation occur. in case, temporary rise rate change import price result permanent increase inflation. this shift occur initial increase inflation generate period rise import price lead household firm revise expectation future inflation. a permanent rise inflation would also result sustain rise level oil price temporary increase resource utilization. by contrast, suppose inflation expectation instead well anchored, perhaps central bank successful time keep inflation near specify target make clear public intend continue so. then response inflation temporary increase rate change import price transitory shock resemble pattern show panel b. in case, inflation deviate longer-term level long import price rising. but level out, inflation fall back previous trend absence disturbances.24 a key implication two example presence well-anchored inflation expectation greatly enhance central bank’s ability pursue objective – namely, price stability full employment. because temporary shift rate change import price transitory shock permanent influence expectations, transitory effect inflation. a result, central bank “look through” consumer phrase term specific measure prices, level – oppose contour – cannot directly compare particular measure inflation change pce price index. 21 see tobin (1972) friedman (1968) early discussion theory underpin expectations-augmented phillips curve. theoretical description inflation process remain active area research economics. in recent years, many economic theorist use so-called new-keynesian framework – optimize agent assume face constraint price wage set form adjustment cost explicit nominal contract – model inflation dynamic (see woodford, 2003, chapter 3, textbook treatment). although new-keynesian inflation model differ importantly specifics, tend assign central role inflation expectation resource utilization driver inflation dynamics. 22 in exercise, ignore inflation effect might arise shift resource utilization induce change import prices, express relative core prices. 23 an expectations-augmented phillips curve expectation inflation assume eventually respond one-for-one actual past inflation typically refer accelerationist phillips curve. 24 qualitatively similar result obtain fully specify structural model rational expectation – include frb/us, edo, sigma model maintain federal reserve board – long-term behavior inflation inflation expectation govern central bank’s (fixed) inflation objective. 8 bi central bankers’ speech short-run inflationary disturbance set monetary policy, allow focus return economy full employment without place price stability risk. indeed, federal reserve do set monetary policy past decade more. moreover, i discus shortly, inflation dynamic key reason fomc expect inflation return 2 percent next years. on balance, evidence suggest inflation expectation fact well anchor present. figure 7 plot two survey measure longer-term expect inflation i present earlier, along measure longer-term inflation compensation derive difference yield nominal treasury security inflation-indexed ones, call tips. since late 1990s, survey measure longer-term inflation expectation quite stable; stability persist recent year despite deep recession concern express observer regard potential inflationary effect unconventional monetary policy. the fact survey measure appear remain anchor level prevail prior recession suggest that, economy return full employment (and absent shocks), core inflation return pre-recession average level 2 percent. this conclusion temper somewhat recent movement longer-run inflation compensation, principle could reflect change investors’ expectation long-run inflation. this measure noticeably low year prior financial crisis.25 however, movement inflation compensation difficult interpret drive factor unique financial market – movement liquidity risk premium – well change expect inflation.26 indeed, empirical work attempt control factor suggest long-run inflation expectation embed asset price fact move relatively little past decade.27 nevertheless, decline inflation compensation past year may indicate financial market participant see increase risk low inflation persisting. although evidence, balance, suggest inflation expectation well anchor present, policymakers would unwise take situation granted. anchor inflation expectation easily quickly: experience suggest take many year carefully conduct monetary policy alter household firm perceive inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, persistent failure keep inflation control – let drift either high low long – could cause expectation become unmoored.28 give inflation run fomc’s 25 in evaluate potential implication decline expect pce inflation, one also need keep mind tip index cpi. cpi inflation generally run tenth percentage point high pce inflation, though differential vary materially time. 26 another complication know whose expectation “matter” determine inflation. inflation expectation professional forecaster (such collect blue chip economic indicators, survey professional forecasters, survey primary dealers) inflation expectation derive asset price probably capture view participant financial market need reflect view household firm broadly. a empirical matter, little information available longer-term inflation expectation firm atlanta federal reserve business inflation expectation survey suggest firms’ expectation closely resemble expectation university michigan survey consumer expectation professional forecasters. similarly, preliminary data new zealand study suggest inflation forecast firm much similar household professional forecaster (see coibion gorodnichenko, 2015). 27 d’amico, kim, wei (2014) examine number model use tip yield back expect inflation estimates. the best-fitting model show small decline longer-term inflation expectation since 2005. 28 my interpretation historical evidence long-run inflation expectation become anchor particular level central bank succeed keep actual inflation near target level many years. for reason, i somewhat skeptical actual effectiveness monetary policy rely primarily central bank’s theoretical ability influence public’s inflation expectation directly bi central bankers’ speech 9 objective several year now, concern reinforce appropriateness federal reserve’s current monetary policy, remain highly accommodative historical standard direct toward help return inflation 2 percent medium term.29 before turn implication inflation model current outlook monetary policy, cautionary note order. the phillips-curve approach forecast inflation long history economics, usefully inform monetary policy decisionmaking around globe. but theoretical underpinnings model still subject controversy among economists. moreover, inflation sometimes move way empirical version model, necessarily simplify version complicate reality, cannot adequately explain. for reason, significant uncertainty attache phillips curve predictions, validity forecast model must continuously evaluate response incoming data. policy implication assume read data correct long-run inflation expectation fact anchor near pre-recession levels, implication precede description inflation dynamic inflation outlook monetary policy? this framework suggests, first, much recent shortfall inflation 2 percent objective attributable special factor whose effect likely prove transitory. a solid black line figure 8 indicates, pce inflation run noticeably 2 percent objective average since 2008, shortfall approach 1 percentage point 2013 2014 1–1/2 percentage point year. the stack bar figure give contribution various factor deviation 2 percent, compute use estimate version simple inflation model i discussed.30 a solid blue portion bar shows, fall consumer energy price explain half simply announce pursue different inflation goal future. although announcement might potentially persuade financial market participant professional forecaster shift expectations, member public probably much le likely so. hence, actual inflation would probably affect central bank sufficient time concretely demonstrate sustain commitment ability generate new norm average level inflation behavior monetary policy – process might take years, base u.s. experience. consistent assessment announcement alone enough, bernanke others (1999) find evidence across number country initial disinflation follow adoption inflation target le costly disinflation carry alternative monetary regimes. 29 some might surprise precede discussion inflation determinant make mention labor costs. in past, wage provide good empirical indicator future direction price inflation; indeed, presence so-called wage-price spiral – high price inflation lead worker push high wage growth, thereby turn lead even fast price increase firms’ labor cost accelerate – often invoke explain inflationary dynamic 1970s. the wage-price spiral long seem provide useful description u.s. inflation process. in fact, evidence suggest that, like inflation, rate growth labor cost characterize stable long-run trend; again, likely explanation empirical find improve anchor long-term inflation expectations. (see peneva rudd, 2015, suggestive evidence along lines.) more generally, movement labor cost long appear especially good guide future price movements. (this development imply wage development carry useful information: because wage growth influence labor market slack, observe movement compensation gain provide indication close economy full employment.) 30 for technical explanation procedure use produce decomposition, see appendix. in decomposition procedure, movement core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; result, contribution food energy price inflation define component’s price change relative core, weight share total nominal consumer spending. (note “other” category include effect change food prices.) the estimate contribution movement import price also compute relative core inflation; thus, import price rise rate core inflation, estimate effect shortfall overall inflation 2 percent. in addition, decomposition take account lag adjustment core inflation movement resource utilization factors. 10 bi central bankers’ speech year’s shortfall sizable portion 2013 2014 shortfall well. another important source downward pressure year decline import prices, portion orange checkerboard pattern, largely attributable 15 percent appreciation dollar’s exchange value past year. in contrast, restraint impose economic slack, green dot portion, diminish steadily time economy recover estimate relatively modest.31 finally, similarly small portion current shortfall inflation 2 percent explain factor (which include change food prices); importantly, effect factor transitory often switch sign year year. although account exercise like one always imprecise depend specific model used, i think basic message – current near-zero rate inflation mostly attribute temporary effect fall price energy non-energy import – quite plausible. if so, 12-month change total pce price likely rebound 1-1/2 percent high 2016, bar substantial drop crude oil price provide dollar appreciate noticeably further. to reasonably confident inflation return 2 percent next years, need, turn, reasonably confident see continue solid economic growth gain resource utilization, longer-term inflation expectation remain near pre-recession level. fortunately, prospect u.s. economy generally appear solid. monthly payroll gain average close 210,000 since start year overall economy expand modestly fast productive potential. my colleague i, base recent forecasts, anticipate pattern continue labor market condition improve head 2016. the labor market achieve considerable progress past several years. even so, improvement labor market condition would welcome probably yet way back full employment. although unemployment rate may close longer-run normal level – fomc participant estimate around 4.9 percent – traditional metric resource utilization almost certainly understate actual amount slack currently exists: on cyclically adjust basis, labor force participation rate remain low relative underlie trend, unusually large number people work part time would prefer full-time employment.32 consistent assessment slow pace hourly wage compensation rising, suggest firm still find relatively easy hire retain employees. reduce slack along dimension may involve temporary decline unemployment rate somewhat level estimate consistent, long run, inflation stabilize 2 percent. for example, attract discourage worker back labor force may require period especially plentiful employment opportunity strong hiring. similarly, firm may unwilling restructure operation use full-time worker encounter great difficulty fill part-time positions. beyond considerations, modest decline unemployment rate long-run level time would, increase resource utilization, also benefit speed return 2 percent inflation. finally, albeit speculatively, environment might help reverse 31 a discuss later, current difference unemployment rate normal longer-run level likely understate actual amount slack remain labor market. if so, estimate report figure 8 somewhat understate contribution slack current shortfall inflation 2 percent and, correspondingly, overstate contribution factors. for example, standard unemployment gap currently understate true level slack 1/2 percentage point, contribution slack year’s inflation shortfall roughly 0.1 percentage point large estimate report figure 8. 32 for discussion current level resource utilization, see federal reserve board’s recent monetary policy report, date july 15, 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 11 significant supply-side damage appear occur recent years, thereby improve americans’ standard living.33 consistent inflation framework i outlined, median projection provide fomc participant recent meet show inflation gradually move back 2 percent, accompany temporary decline unemployment slightly median estimate rate expect prevail long run. these projection embody two key judgment regard project relationship real activity interest rates. first, real federal fund rate currently somewhat level would consistent real gdp expand line potential, imply unemployment rate likely continue fall absence tightening. second, participant implicitly expect various headwind economic growth i mention early continue fade, thereby boost economy’s underlie strength. combined, two judgment imply real interest rate consistent achieve maintain full employment medium run rise gradually time. this expectation, couple inherent lag response real activity inflation change monetary policy, key reason colleague i anticipate likely appropriate raise target range federal fund rate sometime late year continue boost short-term rate gradual pace thereafter labor market improve inflation move back 2 percent objective. by itself, precise time first increase target federal fund rate minor implication financial condition general economy. what matter overall financial condition entire trajectory short-term interest rate anticipate market public. a i noted, colleague i anticipate economic condition likely warrant raise short-term interest rate quite gradual pace next years. it’s important emphasize, however, time first rate increase subsequent adjustment federal fund rate target depend development economy influence committee’s outlook progress toward maximum employment 2 percent inflation. the economic outlook, course, highly uncertain conceivable, example, inflation could remain appreciably 2 percent target despite apparent anchor inflation expectations. here, japan’s recent history may instructive: a show figure 9, survey measure longer-term expect inflation country remain positive stable even country experience many year persistent, mild deflation.34 the explanation persistent divergence actual expect inflation japan clear, i believe illustrate problem face central banks: economists’ understand dynamic inflation far perfect. reflect limit understanding, prediction model often err, sometimes significantly so. accordingly, inflation may rise slowly rapidly committee currently anticipates; development occur, would need adjust stance policy response. considerable uncertainty also surround outlook economic activity. for example, cannot certain pace headwind still restrain domestic economy continue fade. moreover, net export serve significant drag growth past year recent global economic financial development highlight risk slowdown foreign growth might restrain u.s. economic activity somewhat further. the committee monitor development abroad, currently anticipate 33 for discussion supply-side damage occur since 2007 potential benefit partially reverse accommodative monetary policy, see reifschneider, wascher, wilcox (2015) van zandweghe (forthcoming). 34 in addition, cannot count expectation remain anchor federal reserve permit actual inflation continue run noticeably announce objective real economy substantially recovered. 12 bi central bankers’ speech effect recent development u.s. economy prove large enough significant effect path policy. that said, response surprise affect outlook economic activity, affect inflation, fomc would need adjust stance policy action remain consistent inflation return 2 percent objective medium term context maximum employment. give highly uncertain nature outlook, one might ask: why hold raise federal fund rate economy reach full employment inflation actually back 2 percent? the difficulty strategy monetary policy affect real activity inflation substantial lag. if fomc delay start policy normalization process long, would likely end tighten policy relatively abruptly keep economy significantly overshoot goals. such abrupt tighten would risk disrupt financial market perhaps even inadvertently push economy recession. in addition, continue hold short-term interest rate near zero well real activity return normal headwind fade could encourage excessive leverage form inappropriate risk-taking might undermine financial stability. for reasons, prudent strategy begin tighten timely fashion gradual pace, adjust policy need light incoming data. conclusion to conclude, let emphasize that, follow dual mandate establish congress, federal reserve commit achievement maximum employment price stability. to end, maintain highly accommodative monetary policy since financial crisis; policy foster mark improvement labor market condition help check undesirable disinflationary pressures. however, yet fully attain objective dual mandate: some slack remain labor markets, effect slack influence low energy price past dollar appreciation significant factor keep inflation goal. but i expect inflation return 2 percent next year temporary factor currently weigh inflation wane, provide economic growth continue strong enough complete return maximum employment long-run inflation expectation remain well anchored. most fomc participants, include myself, currently anticipate achieve condition likely entail initial increase federal fund rate late year, follow gradual pace tighten thereafter.

european central bank, federation international bank ireland (fibi), dublin, 23 september 2015. * * * in recent year global economy witness set economic financial condition consider barely possible year “great moderation”. interest rate across advance economy fall low levels. in euro area even see negative yield along yield curve: one point april 2015 36% euro-denominated government bond negative territory. and inflation advance economy remain subdued: case follow prolong downward drift since late 2011 still remain stubbornly low. what i would like explain remark arrive situation, return situation that, look retrospectively, would consider “more normal”. my main message euro area still go correction phase pronounce financial cycle, monetary policy vital role play support demand transition, must complement policy achieve strong sustain recovery crisis. the cause current situation the low growth low interest rate environment see euro area today part secular phenomenon. the growth rate total factor productivity (tfp) slow euro area decades. population growth also decline 0.7% early 1970s around 0.3% recent years. this mirror long-term decline real interest rates, low tfp population growth imply low demand investment loanable funds. but secular trend explain fully current situation. cyclical force also lead fluctuation around secular trends, especially drive financial cycle, force still play euro area today. demand conditions, improving, appear relatively weak early stage business cycle. this largely explain legacy financial crisis. specifically, euro area come “balance sheet recession”, build-up excessive debt set condition sharp downturn, turn create need substantial deleveraging balance sheet repair, prolong length slump. the fact financial excess associate significant sectoral resource misallocation, especially construction, hind pace recovery. the duration downturn also exacerbate damage output. long-term unemployment risen, “hysteresis” effect estimate reduce potential growth. this turn appear induce negative sentiment long-term growth: example, business currently perceive limit excess capacity, despite large estimate output gap. such uncertainty fee back weak demand today expectation confidence channels. investment, gradually pick up, still remain well pre-crisis levels. such post-debt crisis effect have, extent, common among advance economy strongly hit global financial crisis. yet observer would agree cost especially high euro area. this due third factor particular euro area: incomplete institutional construction, make work aftermath financial cycle harder. 2 bi central bankers’ speech crucially, euro area lack truly integrate bank system could share risk across country good times, also bad times. without harmonised, effective predictable resolution framework involve private sector, european public backstop preserve financial stability, onus fell onto sovereign support national bank sectors. and bank vulnerable country remain heavily expose sovereigns, feed back systemic bank crisis certain jurisdiction via “diabolical loop” bank sovereigns. other institutional mechanism could cushion shock also turn weak. notably, mechanism accelerate balance sheet restructure minimise fallout economy inoperative due shortcoming legal framework many countries. weak national insolvency regime slow judicial system reduce scope debt re-absorption write-off resolution bad loan euro area, especially compare post-crisis experiences. the upshot slow painful deleveraging. to sum up, though secular force certainly play euro area, current situation also explain cyclical factor link financial cycle, turn exacerbate institutional failings. a strong sustain recovery therefore depend comprehensive response address policy challenges. that underway. the response monetary policy on cyclical side, monetary policy played, continue play, important role respond demand weakness disinflationary pressure creates. but fiscal policy largely unavailable due fragile public finances, require determine monetary policy stance. implement stance increasingly imply unconventional measure short-term interest rate run effective low bound. we also design policy address serious disruption monetary transmission cause financial fragmentation euro area. the unconventional measure adopt include, recently, target long-term refinance operation expand asset purchase programme. these measure support demand several transmission channels, crucially help unclog bank lend channel monetary policy, thereby produce virtuous circle credit supply demand lend momentum recovery. in particular, incentive embed tltro lead bank compete credit support growth, cut margin lend rates. low rate turn create high net demand borrowing, allow bank expand overall lend volume keep interest income rise path. this initiate gradual ease credit standards, strengthen competitive pressures. and macroeconomic level, virtuous circle lead improvement outlook economic growth help contain non-performing loans. through meet mandate way, monetary policy also support orderly deleveraging. accommodative policy reduce interest payment burden raise nominal growth. yet monetary policy alone cannot solve debt overhang. that require mix high real growth rate low nominal debt. in areas, institutional incompleteness euro area hind process balance sheet adjustment. but both, substantial progress made. this effort tackle secular institutional challenge come in. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the role policy to begin with, many country implement structural reform lift potential output temper secular drag growth. particularly important policy help reverse resource misallocation thereby increase employment tfp. such policy include product market reform strengthen competitive pressure encourage reallocation capital towards productive firms; labour market reforms, especially active labour market policies, help provide worker skill need move innovative sectors. successful example measure introduce spain, ireland reform countries. the process private sector debt workout also advancing. the ecb’s comprehensive assessment accelerate crucial step acknowledge provision npls. what key that, necessary, npls restructure efficient insolvency proceed remove banks’ balance sheet altogether. several country take national initiative improve in- out-of-court restructure framework establish asset management company npls. this could support european level progress capital market union, induce great legal convergence deepen market distress debt. support deleveraging process way – raise real growth work private debt – would provide momentum recovery, raise confidence long-term growth prospects. but importantly, balance sheet repair also create pre-conditions address definitively one euro area’s key institutional weaknesses: incomplete bank union. a great deal progress make area recent years. with single supervisory mechanism system supervision le liable capture forbearance. the bank recovery resolution directive provide harmonise predictable framework private sector risk-sharing across union. and government way establish european public backstop single resolution mechanism. but complete bank union – notably term backstop srm establish common deposit guarantee scheme – legacy asset need first fully addressed. that balance sheet repair pivotal. complete bank union also require remove remnant regulatory framework implicitly support home bias. for example, much national discretion allow implement rules; fungible liquidity capital across borders; regulations, loss-absorbing capital, affect choice subsidiary versus branch – decision crucially shape microeconomic incentive bank become european. and macroeconomic consequence union significant. conclusion to conclude, work aftermath financial cycle require comprehensive response. monetary policy play part long needed, mean full implementation asset purchase programme and, necessary, adjustment size, composition duration. and meet objective, support growth inflation, turn create condition interest rate “normalise” more. but monetary policy much. it policymakers address secular institutional factor prevent strong sustain recovery. effort well underway. but long take, high hurdle policymakers ultimately climb. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel k tarullo: capital regulation across financial intermediary speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, bank france conference “financial regulation – stability versus uniformity; a focus non-bank actors”, paris, 28 september 2015. * * * strengthen quantity quality capital hold bank central element post-financial crisis regulatory reform. yet, topic conference remind us, crisis also expose weakness financial intermediary carry systemic implications. in unite states, bear stearns lehman brother failed, so-called freestanding investment banks, subject even inadequate pre-crisis regulatory regime bank hold companies. the stress american international group (aig), insurance company, vulnerability money market fund destabilize run contribute profound deepen crisis. hence theme session conference: in light recent history and, generally, steady growth nonbank financial intermediaries, degree subject capital regulation develop basel committee bank supervision apply bank hold company unite state commercial investment bank europe? at first glance, answer question might seem intuitively obvious. after all, risk loss associate particular corporate loan mortgage-backed security or, indeed, asset vary legal owner insurance company mutual fund, rather bank. yet know regulatory capital requirement sometimes vary nature firm. and i suspect people room believe good reason vary least circumstances. in remark morning, i explain identification circumstance proceed – look asset side financial intermediary’s balance sheet, liability side. the scope nature firm’s liability provide justification capital requirement regulation. difference liability can, accordingly, sometimes warrant different capital requirement portfolio similar asset across firms. at risk pack much introductory points, let also note emphasis firm’s liability relate to, synonymous with, emphasis activities. thus, example, simply decide intermediary provide mostly commercial bank service insurance product fully answer question capital requirement be. my purpose today offer specific proposals, even comprehensive conceptual framework, instead propose approach think purpose capital regulation across type financial intermediary suggest appropriate start point shape – reshape – applicable capital regulation. this seem particularly important effort time financial system undergo significant change. liability structure capital regulation to begin, remind capital regulation private corporation unusual. generally, market actor actual contemplate claim nonfinancial corporation leave device protect interests, though various feature contract, securities, insolvency law design help make judgment efficiently. in many kind financial intermediaries, hand, capital level regulated, usually market failure attributable combination information problems, moral hazard, collective action problems, systemic risk. scrutiny liability side balance sheet reveal whether various justification 2 bi central bankers’ speech present different financial intermediaries. let start couple straightforward examples, well-established regulatory practice. the first example arise fact that, nature business, many intermediary substantially customer-facing liabilities1 balance sheet nonfinancial firms. this characteristic often mean leverage higher. it almost always mean large portion liability side balance sheet account customers, well-positioned evaluate soundness intermediaries’ often-opaque balance sheets. consider case traditional life insurance company, collect premium customer protract period time, promise payout beneficiary insure dy within coverage period. the duration exposure, difficulty evaluate company’s ability pay, potentially high cost change coverage another firm even evaluation do together provide rationale insurance company capital requirements. here motivation capital regulation likely orient toward capacity company meet long-term claim come due, presumably fairly extend span. investor counterparties financial sector might well leave fend themselves. thus rationale capital regulation focus assure sufficient asset time satisfy policyholders’ claim company fail, le attention maintain company go concern. a second example liability side intermediary’s balance sheet suggest appropriate form capital regulation present familiar problem deposit run banks. like policyholder, depositor difficulty gauge health financial intermediary. but unlike life insurance policyholder, depositor withdraw fund fear – even ill-founded fear – bank may trouble. indeed, depositor rational incentive act quickly, since first withdraw best chance get money back. experience bank runs, more-damaging case bank panic (in problem one bank impute others basis incomplete possibly incorrect information), lead government-provided deposit insurance. while counter run panic protect depositor loss, government deposit insurance create different justification capital regulation – protect government insurance fund, guarantee significant portion bank’s liabilities, counter moral hazard, may arise insure depositor need long care whether bank adequately capitalized. the moral hazard issue lead u third example liability side balance sheet financial intermediary reveal need capital regulation – too-big-to-fail (tbtf) problem. a size intermediary increases, exposure market actor – include many intermediary – may become extensive failure would threaten financial system whole. believe government will, reason, prevent intermediary become insolvent, market actor may extend credit guarantee similar deposit insurance place. thus nature extent firm’s liabilities, take whole, may warrant capital regulation offset implicit tbtf subsidy. even distinct problem tbtf could counter means, credible bankruptcy resolution option, failure financial intermediary systemically significant liability raise prospect impose large negative externality financial system. this prospect create additional argument capital 1 by “customer face liabilities,” i mean liability households, retail investors, businesses. in financial intermediaries, liability great similarly size balance sheet non-financial firms. they also disproportionately arise financial transaction – accept deposit investment – rather performance service delivery goods. bi central bankers’ speech 3 requirement – or, precisely, argument progressively high capital requirement would reduce probability failure systemically important intermediary. note last discussion move u toward consideration macroprudential reason capital requirement – specifically, high requirement aim reduce probability insolvency would warrant sole regulatory aim protect customers, depositors, even government deposit insurance fund. a much discuss recent years, pre-crisis financial regulatory regime substantially undervalue systemwide considerations. indeed, first instance crisis spread direct effect engender insolvency individual firms, also dramatic contraction fund available throughout market widely hold asset mortgage-backed securities. the pre-crisis explosion short-term wholesale funding, inside outside traditional banks, leave entire financial system vulnerable disappearance market fund real estate price decline sharply uncertainty spread value asset funded. concern solvency accelerate run wholesale fund bear stearns lehman brothers, raise prospect classic fire sale assets, consequent depress effect balance sheet firm hold assets. experience financial crisis vindicate view argue liquidity, well capital, large intermediary need regulated.2 it also buttress view capital liquidity regulation closely relate need develop tandem, part regulatory framework. much academic research prompt crisis focus interrelationship fund solvency problems.3 here, then, another way characteristic liability side intermediary’s balance sheet determine form stringency capital regulation. short duration and, will, increase “runnability” liability create great threat stability financial system whole. where firm significantly dependent kind funding, may need common equity convince counterparties investor solvency period asset volatile maintain solvency need sell asset fire sale prices. this microprudential basis high capital requirement complement macroprudential rationale intermediary whose deleveraging could broad impact market liquidity fire sale relate effect require hold still capital. let make three additional point rationale high capital standards. first, run cut fund widely hold asset great risk system conventional bank run absence deposit insurance. a bank’s whole loan would usually sell great number even stress circumstance and, even degree were, banks’ portfolio loan generally mark stress bank’s sales. second, possible availability central bank liquidity support obviate need high capital intermediary reliant short-term wholesale funding. the factor make market actor uncertain value intermediary’s asset time stress relevant central bank’s ability assure recipient temporary liquidity fact solvent. third, risk firm 2 for highly insightful survey implication illiquidity issue market performance regulation, see jean tirole (2011), “illiquidity all it friends,” journal economic literature vol. 49, no. 2, pp. 287–325. 3 see, e.g., markus brunnermeier lasse heje pedersen (2009), “market liquidity fund liquidity,” review financial studies, vol. 22,

financial system arise composition liability side balance sheet, concern express apply – though perhaps somewhat different degree – regardless particular form intermediation firm engaged. tailor capital regulation with modest simplification always complex world financial regulation, one say capital requirement traditionally differ significantly different type financial intermediaries, relatively uniform firm classify particular type intermediary. a i mention outset, variation capital requirement might run contrary intuition risk loss give portfolio asset matter own them. of course, direct explanation variation lie part institutional history, different regulatory body give authority different type financial intermediaries. still, seen, difference liability side balance sheet fact provide good policy justification vary capital requirement among different type financial intermediaries. yet, i suggest moment, even conventional difference least broadly justifiable (which, course, say certain difference particular jurisdiction well-formulated specifics), fact many intermediary move well beyond traditional practices, products, scope may warrant qualification conventional practice. conversely, conventional regulatory principle impose le uniform capital requirement give form intermediary might seem intuitively correct. but one lesson regulator around world draw crisis macroprudential consideration sometimes argue vary capital requirement among kind intermediaries. let address, then, implication liability-side perspective capital requirement different form financial intermediaries. despite focus session conference nonbanks, i want begin note post-crisis change basel regime reflect characteristic intermediary’s liabilities. prior crisis, basel regime – though nominally applicable internationally active bank – fact apply bank many member jurisdictions, include unite state european union (eu). there quantitative liquidity requirements, capital requirement vary base liability side balance sheet. indeed, major departure uniform application capital rule opportunity afford basel ii large bank use internal model determine regulatory capital requirements, opportunity basel ii’s proponent expect result slightly low requirement standardize approach. in wake crisis, basel iii strengthen capital quality level across board. in addition, capital surcharge impose thirty bank global systemic importance (g-sibs), base criterion roughly reflect tbtf concern – is, size interconnectedness firms’ balance sheets. neither generally applicable basel iii change g-sib surcharge specifically tie stability bank’s debt structure. however, minimum quantitative liquidity requirement develop form shorter-horizon liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) longer-horizon net stable fund ratio, together intend place limit excessive reliance runnable liabilities.4 4 in unite states, also apply somewhat le stringent version lcr bank large cross threshold internationally active. this tiered approach consistent principle state early prudential requirement vary base potential impact firm’s failure financial system whole. bi central bankers’ speech 5 important change been, risk financial system pose large amount short-term wholesale fund argue close regulatory linkage capital liquidity concerns. conceptually, clean approach might integrate capital liquidity requirement single regulatory framework, would establish minimum level capital liquidity increase capital requirement intermediary vulnerable fund structures. high capital level would especially warrant intermediary use large enough amount short-term debt response fund liquidity constrain – either sell asset withhold fund customer – could adversely affect financial system whole. realistically, though, goal full integration capital liquidity regulation seem unattainable foreseeable future. for one thing, hard imagine relevant banking, market, insurance regulator converge novel approach anytime soon. in addition, though, without complete understand precise relationship liquidity capital needs, place much weight one form regulation would ill-advised. for present, then, basel regime maintain separate capital liquidity regulations, may differ among type financial intermediaries.5 but least strive establish set regulation reference attain least rough consistency across regulatory regime applicable various intermediaries. in unite states, already take one step direction. a may know, implement basel g-sib capital surcharge, decide surcharge somewhat high finally agree basel appropriate. a refashion basel approach, add metric short-term wholesale fund dependence formula determine firm’s systemic significance, factor unfortunately include basel. i hope come time review basel methodology identify group g-sibs, fund practice vulnerability receive attention. and may step could increase sensitivity. explore idea along line seem far preferable raise minimum liquidity requirement banks, even capital level well regulatory minimum. for example, stress test traditionally focus risk capital, observer suggest add liquidity risk stress test. turn implication intermediaries, i begin broker-dealers, pose perhaps clear case capital/funding relationship. broker-dealer tend hold large amount asset long duration, also relatively liquid normal time (in contrast, say, whole loan bank). however, see graphically case mortgage-backed security crisis, many asset rapidly become quite illiquid period stress. since broker-dealer generally fund substantial portion asset short-term liabilities, repurchase agreement (repos) rather insure deposits, potential, see crisis, run reminiscent bank run era advent deposit insurance. the liquidity rule clearly seem influence way bank manage balance sheets. in unite states, bank hold company subject lcr significantly increase hold high-quality liquid asset begin 2013 begin year, point many internationally active bank report lcr ratio already fully phased-in requirements, even though transition rule set 80 percent minimum ratio january 1, 2015. 5 it worth note net capital rule broker-dealer maintain u.s. security exchange commission form hybrid capital liquidity regulation. however, seem basically orient protect customers, bite like traditional regulation life insurance companies, develop go concern systemic implication mind. it not, instance, place high requirement firm heavy reliance short-term wholesale funding, though penalize firm hold large amount illiquid assets. in many respect rule seem well-suited small broker-dealer but, reason explain earlier, seem optimal large broker-dealer large bank hold companies. 6 bi central bankers’ speech to considerable extent, course, basel framework cover firms. in eu, broker-dealer covered, whether stand-alone entity part universal bank. in pre-crisis period unite states, matter le clear, since broker-dealer affiliate bank hold company cover full panoply basel requirements. there partial coverage five large freestanding broker-dealer need oversight order operate within eu. because, crisis, five firm either become bank hold company fail continue operation absorb bank hold companies, sizeable domestically own broker-dealer cover basel requirements. however, i mention moment ago, basel framework go far desirable make capital requirement large institution sensitive macroprudential fund concerns, circumstance underscore balance sheet typical broker-dealers. consideration change refinement formula assign surcharge g-sibs would useful basel standard revisit time. in interim, near-term opportunity supervisory measure take account relationship capital level fund vulnerabilities. perhaps interest application liability-side focus capital regulation case insurance companies. give ongoing discussion capital standard international association insurance supervisors, issue also timely one. several relevant point derive attention liability side insurance company balance sheets. first, show early example liability structure affect capital needs, large segment traditional insurance company’s liability compose contingent claim base occurrence specify events, death insure person destruction insure property. these claim cannot accelerate discretion holder contract so, unlike deposit bank, liability cannot run meaningful sense. unless customer decide sever relationship company, case contingent liability reduce eliminated, continue provide fund firm. life insurance, particular, unusually predictable liability pattern, well-refined actuary years. thus relative absence liquidity risk compare kind intermediaries. property casualty insurance somewhat volatile volatility correlate broad economy. so, high capital level may need microprudential purposes, traditional property-casualty insurance model appear raise significant funding, fire sale, macroprudential concerns. these traditional insurance liability argue low capital requirement might require hypothetical bank hold similar portfolio assets. and, note earlier, respect also argue gone-concern approach capital regulation. however, second observation liability side balance sheet many large insurance company look quite different traditional picture. many life insurers, example, offer wealth retirement product account value withdraw discretion policyholder, sometimes little surrender penalty. although product generally consider medium long-term liabilities, option surrender withdraw fund create potential increase claim could strain liquidity firm. recent history suggest surrender rate fix annuity directly relate path interest rate rises. in middle part last decade, interest rate rise unite states, surrender rate product increase 75 percent years, drop precipitously rapid decline rate follow onset financial crisis. similarly, move insurance firm security lending, repo, over-the-counter derivatives, capital market activity work significant change balance sheet firms, create tight connection rest financial system. a bi central bankers’ speech 7 financial intermediaries, insurer become subject demand post additional collateral close position unfavorable market condition take hold. in addition, book insurance company large enough, become potential vehicle transmit distress company part financial system. thus liability side balance sheet firm “insurance companies” vary substantially, firm call “banks” “bank hold companies.” yet capital regulation currently applicable insurance company seem make relevant distinctions. traditional capital regulation, implicit aim protect conventional policyholder time, potentially orderly insolvency, reflect balance sheet risk i described. yet recent measures, solvency ii, heavy emphasis current market valuation, may take account fact liability liquidity risk genuinely traditional life insurance product relatively limit compare many intermediaries. in respects, solvency ii ignore strength conventional insurance fund – asset hold truly long-term, multiple business cycle – even focus directly fluctuation asset value indeed relevant many le conventional activities. this brief review illustrate challenge fashion capital requirement large insurance company mix traditional, nontraditional, noninsurance activity sometimes quite intertwine particular business line subsidiaries. and, even activity reasonably segregate one another, policy device suggest differential capital treatment may misplaced. for example, decide high capital requirement base solely whether activity “nontraditional” insurance company inappropriate. a “nontraditional” activity insurance company could embrace everything massive derivative business maintain pre-crisis aig sedate business outside financial sphere entirely. in confront similar challenges, i would suggest focus actual nature liability associate firm’s activity provide good start point sound analysis. finally, let mention asset manager briefly. a garner increase share financial system assets, trend accelerate follow financial crisis, question arise whether hold capital buffers. of course case asset manager much balance sheet all. the fund often leveraged, case nearly liability share fund hold investors, price vary reflect value asset purchase manager fund.6 while commentator suggest liquidity challenge consequent fire sale type behavior might develop structure fund place premium exit first, kind risk would support argument le capital buff form prudential market regulation, rule liquidity redemptions. i would note regard last week sec issue propose rulemaking would require open-ended fund liquidity risk management control place shareholder redemptions, include time stress.7 likewise, degree certain idiosyncratic risk might 6 through use certain kind derivatives, fund acquire synthetic leverage. there argument additional regulation cases, though again, capital requirement seem first glance optimal tool. 7 under propose rules, mutual fund exchange-traded fund would require implement liquidity risk management program address investor redemptions, include swing price time rapid redemption calculation requirement measure amount asset could liquidate without impact market prices. security exchange commission press release 2015–201, sec propose liquidity management rule mutual fund etfs, september 22. sec chairman mary jo white previously provide roadmap development regulatory approach asset management 8 bi central bankers’ speech exist respect decision operation certain asset managers, liability structure suggest form prudential market regulation would good suit address risks. conclusion in conclusion, let recapitulate one set point add another. to recapitulate – focus characteristic liability side financial intermediary’s balance sheet suggest reason vary capital regulation across different form financial intermediation, significant shift nature scope intermediary’s liability may turn provide reason vary applicable capital regulation among firm primarily identify particular type intermediary. conceptual, institutional, practical impediment develop single framework capital regulation doubtlessly insuperable foreseeable future. but regulator mandate cover different kind intermediaries, include federal reserve, must keep side perspective mind. and, hopefully, regulator focus responsibility sensitive way regulate entity depart original liability structure. the additional point follow first. when concern raise regulatory arbitrage level play field, usually context similar asset held, business activity conducted, financial firm different regulatory structures. my discussion today would suggest attention must pay liability structure different firm decide whether asymmetric regulatory treatment prudent invitation propagation new financial risks. these two point underscore fact question regulator really whether capital rule develop bank extend nonbank actors. the basel standard already evolve take account different form intermediation financial firm subject rules. the basel framework might enhance differentiation capital liquidity requirement base liability structure firms. similarly, capital rule intermediary subject basel rule shape similar considerations. industry:

bond shift away bond invest risky assets, loan corporate bonds, stocks, foreign securities, real estate, thereby affect wide range market energize economic activity. since april 2013, boj adopt aggressive balance sheet policy set target annual pace monetary base increase quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). the boj increase monetary base annual pace 80 trillion yen. it also purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) amount outstanding increase annual pace also 80 trillion yen. with view encourage decline interest rate across entire yield curve, jgbs maturities, include 40-year bonds, eligible boj’s purchase average remain maturity government bond purchase currently target range seven ten years. in addition government bonds, boj make purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits). this balance sheet policy contribute expansion corporate profit employment together stock price hike depreciation yen, help improve output gap 2 percentage points. the ecb (as well european national central banks) purchase euro-denominated bond issue euro-area governments, agencies, european institution since march 2015 effort restore size balance sheet march 2012 – 2 bi central bankers’ speech 3 trillion euros. in conjunction cover bond asset-backed security (abs) purchase since october 2014, monthly pace combine asset purchase set 60 billion euros. except long-dated assets, remain maturity eligible public sector asset purchase must within two 30 years. in principle, asset need investment grade (above bbb–). this policy may regard reaction grow concern potentially weaken effectiveness monetary ease result shrink balance sheet amid decline inflation expectation indicators. although interest rate apply central bank’s asset purchase generally determine supply demand force relevant market, ecb apply deposit facility rate minus 0.2 percent floor rate. with regard second common monetary-easing instrument, forward guidance adopt two central bank objective indicate future direction ongoing monetary easing. this expect produce signal effect. the commonly observe form signal intention maintain significantly low policy interest rate long period. this instrument suppose exert downward pressure short- medium-term yield curve achieve additional monetary easing. moreover, forward guidance could also use signal central bank’s future stance ongoing asset purchase program, thereby exert downward pressure mainly long-term yield curve (albeit dependent remain maturity spectrum purchase assets). unlike federal reserve, boj forward guidance relate policy interest rate since boj switch main operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate monetary base introduce qqe 2013. the boj thus apply forward guidance indicate future stance continuation qqe package (monetary base target together size type asset purchased). forward guidance express mainly accord follow outcome-based statement: the bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. that statement follow qualify clause, declare upside downside risk economic activity price examine adjustment qqe make appropriate. the boj’s forward guidance therefore signal condition determine continuation qqe provide major risk materialize. give short- medium-term yield curve low substantially previous comprehensive monetary ease (october 2010 march 2013), intention forward guidance relate qqe exert downward pressure longer-term yield curve.1 at time, form forward guidance expect raise inflation expectation – consider maintain price stability target 2 percent stable manner equivalent anchor inflation expectation around 2 percent. with ecb, forward guidance first apply policy interest rate july 2013. it achieve term follow statement: “the govern council expect key ecb interest rate remain present low level extend period time.” in september 2014, ecb cut policy rate 10 basis point – 0.05 percent main refinance operation (mro), 0.3 percent marginal lend facility, minus 0.2 percent deposit facility – ecb president mario draghi report downward adjustment would long possible. thus, ecb’s present forward guidance refer duration maintain ongoing low policy interest rates. the ecb also adopt forward guidance march 2015 signal future stance combine monthly asset purchase 60 billion euro follow remark: “intended carry end september 2016 will, case, conduct see 1 the boj also purchase short-term treasury bill maintain 0.1-percent interest rate excess reserve (ioer). those move help promote market expectation short-term market interest rate would remain substantially low long period. bi central bankers’ speech 3 sustain adjustment path inflation consistent aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2 percent medium term.” the third common monetary-easing instrument conditional long-term lend facility. the boj provide low-cost fund (fixed 0.1 percent) financial institution amount twice net increase lend – maximum four year stimulate bank lend facility. this measure plan continue june 2016. similarly, ecb launch target longer-term refinance operation (tltros) september 2014. since march 2015, tltros provide low-cost fund (at interest rate mro) financial institution amount three time much net increase lend non-financial firm household (excluding loan household house purchases). currently, maximum three years; tltros schedule continue june 2016. both japan euro area characterize system bank-based financial intermediations; thus, ultimate goal instrument promote bank lend private sector. at time, could also help expand central bank’s balance sheet. iii. unconventional monetary policy – difference boj ecb i would like examine difference monetary-easing policy (chart 2). a. background ecb’s adoption negative deposit facility rate the ecb adopt first negative deposit rate minus 0.1 percent june 2014, follow minus 0.2 percent follow september. i believe three main factor contribute ecb’s decision maintain negative interest rate present. first, many nonresident holder government bond euro area: hold account 50 percent outstanding bond issued. the type nonresident investor also diverse, range short-term-oriented hedge fund long-term-oriented institutional investor foreign central banks. some investor therefore likely sell government bond ecb search capital gain without overly affect negative interest rate need rebalance portfolios, give high weight corporate bond stock euro area. second, long potentially large demand exist credit among firm households, financial institution euro area could encourage extend credit private sector attempt avoid negative deposit rate, may able charge high lend rate without restrain credit demand. consequently, financial institution may achieve profit offset negative interest rate promote credit creation. third, give presence segmentation cross-border interbank market euro area global financial crisis, negative interest rate policy unlikely harm behavior liquidity-abundant financial institutions. b. the boj’s decision hold positive interest rate excess reserve (ioer) by contrast, boj maintain 0.1-percent ioer since 2008. i would like explain broad background behind decision. that is, important note qqe adopt environment provide little room cut short- medium-term interest rates. to generate large-scale monetary-easing effect, therefore, boj decide adopt strategy exert downward pressure real long-term interest rates; decline nominal long-term interest rate increase inflation expectations. this strategy accommodative policy seek marginal cut shorter-term interest rates. that said, i give three reason decision keep positive ioer. first, reflect view cut ioer could give rise challenge environment boj term smoothly fulfil target amount asset purchases. unlike euro area, substantial number resident holder jgbs: amount hold account 90 percent outstanding bond issued. many investor 4 bi central bankers’ speech long-term-oriented financial institutions. with market structure, positive ioer may effect induce holder sell government bond boj. second, negative ioer may incur risk undermine intermediary function financial institution low profitability bank system. bank may unable pas increase cost (caused negative interest rate) retail depositor low deposit interest rate (which, around 0 percent, already low). alternatively, financial institution may attempt raise lend rate effort maintain profits; however, may discourage credit demand thus undermine lend activities. some european central bank charge negative interest rate deposit facility rate main lend (refinancing) policy rate. some financial institution apparently apply negative interest rate deposit large client interbank market well charge high lend rate corporate clients; maintain positive interest rate retail deposits. this practice unlikely occur japan give loan-to-deposit rate remain around 70 percent competition lend fierce. bank may ultimately absorb increase cost squeeze profit margins, thereby somewhat stifle incentive take credit risk increase lend activities. third, important support function interbank market certain degree allow arbitrage interest rate transaction bank hold current account balance boj without access accounts. such transaction also enable market interest rate function relatively effectively reference interest rates, conducive various relate financial transaction monetary policy judgments.2 more importantly, ecb face decline inflation expectation indicator accumulate disinflation risk second half 2014, negative deposit facility rate place. this suggest positive impact raise inflation expectation boj emphasize could really expect significant level negative interest rate policy. thus, although feasibility low ioer denied, policy need good understand properly discuss light difference financial market structure country region. c. difference importance credit ease boj ecb another difference ecb boj ecb’s monetary ease generally entail element credit easing. recently, lend rate charge private sector drop credit growth turn positive euro area. nonetheless, small medium-sized enterprise (smes) peripheral country still face restrictive lend criteria, high fund costs, limit access credit volume. for reasons, tltros aim promote financial institutions’ lend activity reduce fund costs, thereby indirectly low lend rate charge private sector. in addition, ab purchase program initiate activate market purchase security promote securitization market bank loans, include smes. the ecb thus continue place priority credit ease bank system yet fully recover financial intermediary function arise global financial european debt crises. by contrast, japan experience decline function cp corporate bond market immediately global financial crisis. that cause boj purchase asset credit-easing policy 2009. however, japan face bank crisis, 2 in speech i deliver italy january 2013, i touch pro con cut ioer suggest positive impact cut correct yen’s excessive appreciation. however, qqe, argument long apply. see shirai, sayuri, “japan’s monetary policy challenge environment,” speech bank italy eurasia business economics society conference hold rome (january 11–12), bank japan, 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 5 balance sheet bank sector generally remain sound. even qqe, smes therefore enjoy accommodative monetary environment, low fund cost availability credit volumes. credit ease become le important element monetary easing. iv. inflation expectation japan euro area let proceed inflation expectation – key achieve price stability target – start economist market-based indicator turn household firms. a. japan’s agenda – restore inflation expectation around 2 percent accord economist whose long time-series data available, inflation expectation stand around 2 percent japan enter era long-standing mild deflation (chart 3). medium- long-term inflation expectation (i.e., five year ahead) remain around 2 percent first half 1990s. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) short-term inflation expectation (i.e., one year ahead) also around 2 percent early 1990s. from around 1992, collapse asset bubble, however, rate change cpi begin drop, turn negative around 1999. the first half period coincide decline trend real gdp growth rates. since rate mostly low potential gdp growth rates, decline trend, output gap deteriorate significantly, generate downward pressure actual price (chart 4). short-term inflation expectation drop line actual price performance: turn negative around 1999 subsequently fluctuate 0 percent qqe.3 one interest feature medium- long-term inflation expectation unstable second half 1990s 2012, year-on-year movement range around 0.5 percent 2 percent. it evident inflation expectation insufficient raise rate change cpi short-term inflation expectations. inflation expectation thus fully play anchor role. the boj’s expression price stability may attributable instability medium- long-term inflation expectations. in 2006, boj introduce concept understand medium- long-term price stability describe price stability as, term year-on-year rate change cpi, approximately 0 2 percent median 1 percent. the boj’s description clarify somewhat 2009 positive range 2 percent lower, midpoint around 1 percent, thereby eliminate possibility 0-percent price change. in 2012, boj introduce price stability goal medium long term, describe positive range 2 percent low term year-on-year rate change cpi, set goal 1 percent time being. despite statements, wholly clear whether boj ultimately purse 2-percent level low one. against background, boj adopt 2 percent target qqe 2013 restore medium- long-term inflation expectation back around 2 percent – level achieve 20 year earlier. since introduction qqe, medium- long-term inflation expectation economist inflation swap rate (implied five-year forward rate, five year ahead) rise moderately remain around 1 percent today. nevertheless, 2 percent target remain distant (chart 3). from japan’s experience, essential first make continuous improvement output gap thereby steadily raise rate change cpi. in regard, output gap 3 it must note year-on-year rate change cpi, well short-term inflation expectations, rise substantially, owe consumption tax hike 1997 2014, surge commodity price early 2008. 6 bi central bankers’ speech estimate boj turn positively 0.1 percent january–march quarter 2015. after temporary deterioration project april–june quarter, output gap expect gradually improve positive territory july–september quarter year increase upward pressure prices. the change core cpi (all item le fresh food) currently 0 percent. however, cpi exclude food energy 0.6 percent, exceed core cpi. the proportion item whose price rise among core cpi-composing item increase around 65 percent (chart 5). moreover, price hike accompany increase sales. for reasons, fair say deterioration underlie trend prices. the boj project rate change core cpi begin rise second half fiscal 2015. once rise trend core cpi become stable, inflation expectation project rise gradually toward around 2 percent. b. euro area’s inflation expectations: broadly consistent price stability target by contrast, euro area, medium- long-term inflation expectation economist le stable around 2 percent since initial phase adopt euro (chart 6). this evident two ways: one rate inflation already move around 2 percent year prior euro adoption; ecb initially define price stability inflation rate 2 percent medium term. medium- long-term inflation expectation appear stabilize firmly ecb clarify definition 2003 inflation rate below, close to, 2 percent medium term. this situation change somewhat 2012, rate change harmonize index consumer price (hicp) begin decrease continuously. the decline occur across wide range good service face re-deterioration output gap price drop various commodity (charts 7 8). nevertheless, hicp exclude food energy remain around 1 percent. follow decrease hicp, short-term inflation expectation decline significantly, whereas medium- long-term inflation expectation decrease moderately; currently stand around 1.8 percent. the inflation swap rate (implied five-year forward rate, five year ahead) strengthen decline trend mid-2014 reach around 1.5 percent early 2015, trigger concern risk disinflation. thereafter, inflation swap rate increase moderately recover around slightly 2 percent, owe impact ecb’s asset purchase program (including announcement effect) greater-than-expected performance economic activity prices. but recently, gap target somewhat widened, partly owe recent re-drop crude oil price (chart 6). a recent decline inflation swap rate also observe japan. this might reflection decrease inflation risk premium associate decline oil price rather decline inflation expectations. c. gap households’ price perception price performance japan: different feature euro area i would like turn households’ price expectation spend patterns. owe lack comparable data, i use short-term data (about one year ahead). from boj’s opinion survey general public’s view behavior, follow data available june 2006: (1) perception diffusion index (di) present price level (the present price perception di); (2) one-year-ahead price di; (3) one-year-ahead spend di. from european commission’s business consumer surveys, i use follow data 1999: (1) price trend di previous twelve months; (2) price trend di next twelve months; (3) spend expectation di major purchase (such furniture electrical electronic devices) next twelve months. bi central bankers’ speech 7 a commonly observe feature, household japan euro area tend perceive present price level represent increase – except short period immediately global financial crisis – tend expect high price level one year ahead (charts 9 10). moreover, household commonly tend expect spend le near future. from features, may say household plan reduce spend one year ahead expect tight budget result expect high prices. a different feature evident regard relationship actual price performance households’ present price perception (as well one-year-ahead price expectation). in euro area, households’ present price perception price expectation dis roughly line actual price performance. by contrast, japanese households’ present price perception (except short period immediately global financial crisis) price expectation dis remain positive even mild deflation prevail 2009 mid-2013. more recently, despite rate change core cpi drop around 0 percent, rise trend present price perception di firm relatively high level price expectation di sustained. thus, japanese households’ price perception expectation constantly differ movement official price statistics. on front, know japanese households’ price perception expectation heavily affect price movement daily necessity gasoline, result upward bias. this could interpret sign strong defensive action anticipate tight budget. if so, household may perceive rate actual inflation much high 2 percent process approach 2 percent target, regard price rise unacceptable. thus, important boj promote public understand objective achieve moderate price rise sustainable increase household spending. additionally, households’ tolerance price rise need improve accordance sustainable income rise. d. euro area firms’ price expectation become comparable japan with respect firms’ price expectations, sale price expectation di three month ahead available boj’s tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) european commission’s survey (chart 11). one interest find japan, firms’ sale price expectation di fluctuate negative territory since first half 1990s, rate change cpi remain positive. among firms, di manufacture firm remain negative today even though improvement global financial crisis. by contrast, euro area’s sale price expectation di mostly move positive territory global financial crisis, suggest european manufacture firm find relatively easy raise sale prices. however, especially 2012, european debt crisis deepened, sale price di become sluggish since remain around 0 percent. this imply european manufacture firm find challenge raise sale price similar position japanese firms. an exception germany, sale price expectation di remain positive territory despite drop present sale price di. this may indicate german firm continue provide differentiated, high value-added product firm euro area. with regard sale price expectation di non-manufacturing firms, di japan turn moderately positive qqe, remain positive although low. the sale price expectation di euro area become stagnant – albeit large fluctuation – follow european debt crisis. in three non-manufacturing sectors, current dis service retail trade moderately positive, albeit low levels, like japanese firms. the di construction mostly significantly large negative territory since global financial crisis. in case germany, sale price expectation di service show remarkable recovery already exceed pre-crisis level. nonetheless, di retail trade recently low level, although moderately positive, suggest 8 bi central bankers’ speech consumption activity yet fully recovered. the di construction sluggish often negative even global financial crisis; current level low. e. conclusion in euro area, short-term price expectation household firm drop financial crisis currently stagnant; medium- long-term inflation expectation economist market-based indicator somewhat below, roughly line with, price stability target. this may suggest sluggish households’ firms’ price expectation temporary expectation eventually begin rise economic condition improve. in japan, medium- long-term inflation expectation economist market-based indicator remain around 1 percent. this partly price rise trend – except oil price – seem settling. this may imply firms’ short-term sale price expectations, although still low, may begin rise recovery process improves. moreover, households’ price expectation tend substantially high owe upward bias, deviate substantially actual price performance. however, upward bias may correct future households’ tolerance price rise gradually improve together sustainable income rise widespread understand 2 percent target. that said, important boj maintain accommodative monetary environment support economic recovery make great effort increase public awareness target boj’s intention. thank much kind attention. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central

bank china school finance, tsinghua university, beijing, 22 september 2015. * * * 1. introduction dear professor li, dear professor kang, lady gentlemen, i delight opportunity beijing talk europe euro – background particular feature european monetary union, pitfalls, place europe great strain, challenge need overcome europe remain reliable player. european monetary union peculiarities, make difficult compare single currency area. it one aware particular feature historical backdrop currency area emerge possible understand cause crisis euro area – step need overcome them. in presentation, i attempt view european unification, stable european monetary union prosperous euro area eye realist. however, walter hallstein, first president european commission, apparently special kind realist mind said: “whoever believe miracle european matter realist.” i come back end speech. 2. european unification lady gentlemen, a unite europe major significance germany. this germany integral part europe also german feel particular obligation promote european unification. the reason largely historical. a glance back history show important mutual understand amicable relation country europe. the first world war break 100 year ago. this war etch memory many europeans. the grim consequence war still fresh minds: disturbingly high number civilian military victims, wartime economy, hundred thousand impoverish starve death survivor deeply traumatised. this list could go on. and second world war begin 21 year end first world war. it war unprecedented crime perpetrated, million leave dead europe subsequently divide two blocs. after suffer much hand war, west european country strive deep european integration, unite europe. the reason many varied. secure peace within europe undoubtedly dominant rationale. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the relationship european neighbour france germany play key role context. hostility two nations, overt latent, persist centuries. this so-called “franco-german enmity” surmount wake devastate second world war develop time franco-german friendship, engine drive process european unification integration. however, belong community value particular importance germany follow hitler dictatorship holocaust. konrad adenauer, first chancellor federal republic germany, express follows: “the unity europe dream few. it become hope many. today become necessity us.” but also desire sustainably improve europe’s economic prosperity. it incidental european integration begin step economic integration. after second world war ended, progress make various fronts, culminate initially single european market. the foundation single european market “four basic freedoms”: free movement people, goods, service capital. but become evident early stage economic integration europe could really take accompany stable single currency. a far back start 1970s, exist plan establish european economic monetary union fully implement 1980. ultimately, progress rapid all. no serious attempt establish monetary union make jacques delors take presidency european commission late 1980s. the maastricht treaty late sign eu member state 1992. 3. european monetary union regulatory framework in 1999, long-cherished dream european monetary union become true, mark major step towards deep european integration. introduce single currency tangible benefits. price good could easily compare throughout member states. exchange rate risk eliminate transaction cost fell. this turn promote trade, within monetary union also rest world. money capital market converge further. and, last least, euro bring period remarkable price stability member states. at point, important understand european monetary union thoroughly unique single currency area. while 19 sovereign state within commit comply single monetary policy, remain responsible fiscal economic policies. this mean single monetary policy, clear objective ensure price stability, accompany 19 national fiscal policies. a see, principle subsidiarity constitutive europe: many decision possible continue make national, even local, level. bi central bankers’ speech 3 former unite state secretary state henry kissinger highlight eu’s complex structure asking: “who i call i want call europe?” nowadays, would call 19 telephone number discus fiscal policy matters, 19 national government make decision regard public spend borrow require finance purposes. the universal rule political process easily lead increase spend and, result, excessive borrow well apply far monetary union independent national fiscal policy central governments. this because, monetary union, negative effect sharp rise debt one country spill over, least part, member states. why case? generally speaking, rule apply private borrower also apply country: high debt burden, low creditworthiness. so, properly function capital market, country indebted generally require pay high interest sovereign debt. however, thing different monetary union, capital market participant assume member state belong “inseparable union common destiny” part help financially emergency situations, form kind joint-liability scheme. a result, debt interest rise individual, indebted country, usually also member states, expect provide solidarity financial assistance. yet, country create debt, interest rate tend rise le strongly. monetary union, therefore, hold incentive individual member state run high debt negative effect great indebtedness – mean high borrow rate – partly bear member states. this compare overfishing sea it, too, affect community neighbour country well country cause problem. the architect monetary union well aware problem incentives. which exactly take precautions. it was, therefore, lay start treaty maastricht country forbid assume debt another country community states. in words, lay foundation general bail-out principle. the maastricht treaty is, thus, guide principle individual responsibility, balance liability control. in concise word german economist walter eucken: “whoever reap benefit must also bear liability.” or, down-to-earth terms: whoever orders, pays. an additional security threshold monetary union stability union prohibition monetary finance governments. the central bank eurosystem, european central bank 19 national central banks, forbid directly finance euro-area countries. in order ban monetary finance government implement practice, independence eurosystem political instruction enshrine time. 4 bi central bankers’ speech political decision-makers cannot, therefore, force central bank eurosystem grant member state loan directly purchase sovereign paper. ultimately, measure could contravene mandate ensure price stability, cause last harm eurosystem’s credibility thus foundation successful monetary policy. germany has, past, bad experience central bank free political lobbying. for example, expenditure arm first world war finance directly central bank, essentially cater need government. the consequence complete devaluation reichsmark. by contrast, independence eurosystem firmly anchored. first, institutionally, prohibit national supranational institution issue ecb national central bank instructions. and second, functionally, award sole prerogative regard strategy measure ensure price stability eurosystem. the independence central bank safeguard specific debt ceilings, intend prevent member state accumulate excessive debt. a country’s public deficit suppose exceed maximum 3% gdp within one-year period. moreover, country’s overall sovereign debt go beyond 60% annual gdp. these rule design prevent government exert pressure monetary policy makers, low interest rate allow government borrow cheaply. or due fact exist debt devalue high rate inflation. so far good. 4. crisis however, thing turn differently expect – carefully draft financial policy rule comply with. most country far balance budget, public deficit often even exceed three-percent threshold. debt level member state often low either. the exact opposite case country matter. at time, market participant trust sufficiently bail-out principle i touch earlier. despite large difference debt level economic development among euro-area member states, align risk premium great extent, which, turn, lead already strongly indebted country become indebted. in end, confidence capital market vanish regard whether future crisis country would still able service sovereign debt accordance rules. this culminate investor grant country loan high interest margin withhold altogether. at time, become clear country late hit crisis fail set sound sustainable economic structure beneficial growth. instead, enterprise household often take advantage substantially low interest rate result join euro area run great amount debt. and rather invest money expand competitiveness, use private government consumption. bi central bankers’ speech 5 wage increase considerably large extent productivity, price competitiveness erode result. and last least, cheap loan capital inflow fuel real estate bubble ireland spain. this “special boom”, cause low interest rates, anything sustainable spark crisis europe. although, precise, “the crisis” conglomerate various crises, encompass financial market crisis, economic crisis sovereign debt crisis. above all, however, crisis confidence, complexity also reflect fact euro area battle overcome crisis seven year now. 5. overcome crisis how finally achieved? or, put differently, lesson learn crisis? to win back confidence lose return path sustainable growth, need tackle root cause crisis instead treat symptoms. the economic situation euro area may recovering, still structural challenge resolve. and cause crisis eliminated, cannot sure pop again. the recent discussion greece show well. 5.1 measure member state first all, crisis country must eliminate cause crisis home. for one thing, ensure public debt sustainable. this need do consumer investor confidence return. indeed, say goes, “you can’t borrow way debt crisis”. therefore, last confidence build foundation sound public finances. in addition budgetary rigour, member state also need implement growth-enhancing structural reforms. many already set motion result sovereign debt crisis. a such, structural budget deficit significantly lowered, deterioration international competitiveness also largely reversed. but still way go term make labour market flexible, liberalise good service market cut bureaucracy. to begin with, adjustment process burden economic recovery many crisis countries. however, subsequent positive growth effect make this. spain, particular, currently experience first-hand already reap benefit structural reform implemented. since 2009, structural budget balance improve roughly seven percentage point labour market make flexible. both achievement decisive factor enable spanish economy lift recession quite time ago exhibit current strong growth. the oppressively high level unemployment also gradually decreasing. the benefit spain high come year remain fully faithful reform process. 6 bi central bankers’ speech there say i like practically pass chinese proverb germany. it reads: “when wind change blow ... people build wall people build windmills.” well, spanish build quite windmill recent years. in first half year, world’s attention focus greece much great extent spain successful reform process. in light refusal greek government accept bail-out conditions, due acute finance needs, even speculation whether country would potentially leave euro area even european union itself. this risk since vanished, thank adoption august third assistance programme greece, subject strict condition temporarily resolve country’s fund bottleneck. however, payment contingent greece fulfil conditions. in addition, central challenge face greece lie implement structural reform measure great competitiveness well achieve sound government finance long term establish function administration. only greece overcome current period weakness embark path growth. 5.2 reform regulatory framework however, aside unsound development european periphery countries, euro area’s regulatory framework also need strengthened. the principle align liability control must rigorously enforced. this because, course combat crisis, element joint liability increasingly expanded. this, turn, severely disrupt balance liability control. the crisis country grant large-scale emergency loan member state european stabilisation mechanism. but eurosystem also reacted, example low interest rates, also loosen requirement monetary policy collateral. in addition, eurosystem acquire government bond crisis country capital market order ensure monetary policy uniform impact. however, propel eurosystem deep uncharted dangerous territory, blur boundary prohibit monetary finance governments. that said, party well aware monetary policy unable resolve crisis euro area, merely buy time policy maker implement necessary measures. in order permanently safeguard monetary union union stability, important bring liability control back balance position. essentially, do two ways: either euro area evolve genuine fiscal union, fiscal tax policy coordinate centrally european level ... ... maastricht framework 2.0 establish principle individual responsibility reinforced. however, i see majority euro-area country support communitisation fiscal tax policies. at current juncture, reinforce exist regulatory framework strengthen principle individual responsibility therefore seem like realistic way bring liability control europe’s monetary system back equilibrium. bi central bankers’ speech 7 europe already take step right direction regard. for example, refine fiscal rule require balance budget even slight surpluses. in addition, procedure introduce identify rectify macroeconomic imbalances. however, rule need enforced. and clear deficit. “flexibility” european commission’s new watchword come interpret fiscal framework implemented. and scope flexible interpretation actually widen past year back change budgetary rules. however, sustain economic growth cannot build foundation resurgent expand public debt. for i already mentioned, last confidence long-term growth possible sound public finances. lady gentlemen, thus far i touch two key area lesson learn crisis: first, individual country need implement reform second, need strengthen strictly adhere regulatory framework liability control national level balance – envisage euro area start. 5.3 european bank union moreover, crisis unfolded, financial system expose achilles’ heel, europe international scale. a result, step take g20 level tighten banks’ capital liquidity requirements, thus give rise basel iii. compound this, weakness identify europe’s bank supervision structures. national supervisor often find ass country’s bank system favourably, effect fail bank stumble state drag one another down. only destroy harmful nexus bank government able manage contagion effects. and nascent european bank union come play. it represent major step towards deepen european integration consist two elements: the single supervisory mechanism (ssm), operate aegis ecb, place 12 months. it purpose ensure consistently high supervisory standard prevent banks, early stage, get difficulties. but problem cannot entirely rule out, even stringent regulatory regime. after all, possibility failure hallmark market economy. it therefore important able allow bank fail without government – thus also taxpayer – foot bill. for bank must also subject liability principle, without market economy function properly. this rationale behind launch european single resolution mechanism (srm) 2016. the mechanism make sure non-viable institution withdraw market orderly fashion provide jeopardise financial stability. and do accord clearly define liability cascade. 8 bi central bankers’ speech if bank wind future, shareholder creditor first line bear costs. only source fund prof insufficient recourse single resolution fund finance entire european bank sector. and last resort taxpayer respective country, even member states, call upon help shoulder burden. in words, begin 2016, institution subject supervision european level also resolve level. this facilitate close european integration. together, two constructs, ssm one hand srm other, form meaningful whole, liability control balanced. 5.4 abolish preferential treatment government bond if close tie government bank loosened, future loan sovereign must long deem free risk regulatory terms. it follow government bond henceforth treat similarly loan enterprise households, mean back capital commensurate risk. and limit also need apply exposures, case loan private debtors. this would prevent risk become concentrate banks’ balance sheets. these topic deliberate basel committee bank supervision european economic financial committee, rightly so. i appreciate capital requirement large exposure limit make task finance government complicate consequently expensive. thus, gradual phase-ins undeniably good idea. however, reason refrain change. 5.5 sovereign insolvency code look ahead, additional area new regulatory provision required. in extreme cases, sovereigns, too, must future able declare insolvent, liability principle also apply them. otherwise, eurosystem could come pressure finance cash-strapped government knock-down terms. so happen sovereign defaults? it doesn’t mean country concern disappear map way company might. rather, government question find long able service debt contractually agreed, normally mean debt restructured. the legal basis would provide sovereign insolvency code. in opinion, essential prerequisite enduringly sustainable regulatory framework fiscal policy remain national responsibility. 6. conclusion lady gentlemen, in presentation, i shine light history european integration crisis euro area. i also look towards future, outline challenge lie ahead might best deal them. the significant aspect follows. it member state hold key sustainably overcome crisis europe. bi central bankers’ speech 9 the european bank system, member state european regulatory framework make crisis-resistant euro area return path sustainable growth. a i mention early on, there’s plenty good news three levels. but doesn’t mean declare crisis over. the adjustment process crisis country likely continue quite time. the tighten regulatory framework need apply forcefully practice additional measure introduced. ultimately, way overcome crisis ... ... gradually rebuild confidence. but possible euro area consistently maintain stability course. a far euro area concerned, i see reason overly pessimistic. what matter member state continue muster rigorously tackle root cause crisis. i begin speech reference walter hallstein’s conviction effect that: “whoever believe miracle european matter realist.” but i stand regard quotation speech come close? well, i see things, need miracle europe today. the foundation achieve stability euro area already place. however, need enhance important respect rigorously enforced. it walk park. but neither stuff miracles. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: digital darwinism financial industry – supervisor’s perception speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, speech eb (ebs university business law) symposium, oestrich-winkel, 18 september 2015. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman thank opportunity contribute eb symposium. a bank supervisor, i happy share think digital darwinism financial industry. 2. digital transition evolutionary perspective dinosaur often-used mean illustrate “darwinism” works. we still don’t really know creature – rule earth million year – suddenly become extinct. some make volcanic eruption responsible; others cite meteorite sharp drop sea level possible explanation. in case, assumption dinosaur cease exist could cope new environment adapt quickly enough. apply diagnosis financial sector, bank reign throughout last centuries, suppose digital transition indeed constitute new environment banks, one may pose rather provocative question: bank dinosaur one day become extinct? you may guess i share doom scenario, let start describe view evolution bank business. the digital era may indeed consider new environment banks. digitalisation financial sector irrevocable change come due several factors. first, digitalisation financial sector fuel development highly effective, state-of-the-art technology like broadband networks, advance data process ubiquity smartphones. and premise common virtually technological advance market economy last centuries: product become available, sooner late create demand put market force action. that mean technological social change intertwined. bank customer become increasingly open digital banking. think innovative concept online video consultation services, digital credit brokerage incorporation social medium banking. bank still “people business”, it’s long reduce proximate personal relationships. so plenty demand use technological potential digital banking: cheap quick automatise processes, solution complex financial issues, service tailor customers’ individual needs. a fundamental challenge bank face business fields, may expect sudden rapid change game played. one rather obvious case point payment services. service provider paypal apple implement payment system gear consumer digital environment. once customer become use new way paying, competitor offer similar product certainly difficulty try convince customer switch providers. the pioneer may decisive advantage. now, evolutionary terms, question whether bank adapt quickly enough. bank use it decades, fast-moving time present wholly new possibility use: p2p lend become feasible, internet mobile application sprout 2 bi central bankers’ speech internet giant google facebook cultivate “big data” methods. these enterprise grow – time – entirely new perception business, work life. and appropriate staff. that may crucial. it one thing build new ideas, quite another incorporate company dna. traditional banks, hand, typically digital dna. theirs analogue world refine knowledge bank decade build customer relationship base trust. think area like investment advice corporate finance well banks’ business generate synergy business strands. the question is: part knowledge still valuable part bank need reframe? however, cannot predict financial sector look ten years’ time. there many “unknown unknowns”. still, recur fallacy reduce evolution narrow one-way street. if new market entrant whose business well-adjusted digital environment, bank incline imitate behaviour. but – clear – one-size-fits-all strategy digital banking. a industries, always demand differentiate strategies, example individual personalise service oppose algorithm-based advice. also, surprise see focus return key component bank business: establish safety trust. furthermore, digital age simply redistribute market share fix revenue pie: also entirely new opportunity desirable businesses. convenient bank valuable. bank could benefit this, either great customer loyalty additional business volume result extra services. win-win scheme also conceivable credit markets. “big data” method generate highly informative individual risk profiles. this could enable bank extend loan private customer small business would otherwise receive financing. even investment counsel could benefit. video-based consulting, example, reflect modern life style customers; may also reduce cost bank render branch office unnecessary. other keywords digital open “co-creation”, customer participate development products, “multichannel banking”. but aim today present all-encompassing overview digital bank business ideas. instead, let u move one step back look big picture. reshape financial sector doesn’t need leave new market entrants. this creative challenge also take establish banks. supervisors, too, interest see bank engage innovation enhance functionality financial sector stabilise profitability medium long run. to sum up, “open end” evolution digital financial sector. if ask diehard evolutionist forecast future, merely point trial-and-error process eventually give u answer. for individual company, course helpful. a bank supervisor, i incline attempt market forecast. still, bottom line bank line think i outline earlier, namely appropriate neither blindly imitate stick old habits. the message every player financial industry simple: rather catch off-guard, bank participate actively shape future bank services. a new game played, new strategy need develop execute decisively. 3. cyber risk – evolutionary attachment digital bank along digitalisation industries, another evolution warrant attention. it development neither intend visionary trailblazer digital world beneficial. i refer evolution cybercrime. bi central bankers’ speech 3 while cannot predict bank look ten twenty years’ time, almost certain risk fraud, theft manipulation bank cyberspace continue rise. the reason straightforward: digital channel use steal lot asset comparatively little effort today. nowadays, large proportion banks’ asset value-generating capability store hard drive servers. the technical infrastructure facilitate manage bank account grant access money. but also provide access vast source data. there several incident recently truly large-scale data theft. company secrets, too, stake. if, example, trade algorithm bank become know others illegal activities, could exploit market, cause huge loss banks. in way, politically motivate act sabotage jeopardise trust financial function integrity. look side cybercrime, potential attacker – often access far powerful weapon convenient access internet. target attack it system originate anywhere world. hacker often need little laptop internet access. why expect continuous evolution field? attack vehicle like computer virus differ widely may target chink bank’s defence, rather human virus attack biological systems. it logic follow arm race criminal law enforcer trace human history, take place digital weapons. what make evolution dangerous still face highly complex digital world progress constantly make technology innovations. but, crucially, cannot risk trial-and-error process here. once easy point attack identify it infrastructure, word quickly spread criminal world try exploit weakness. on top this, need bear mind cyber general it risk technical nature. the human factor often play crucial part. employee may act gross negligence, may trick trojan horse phishing mail. in complex it systems, even small system error quickly cause enormous damage. the error-prone human factor eliminate instal appropriate system control incentives. in today’s world, important management task. 4. adaptation managerial task before it-related problem come affect core digital economy, commonly shift it department. but approach it risk outdated. awareness digital risk set strategy leader’s duties. if business crucially rely digital processing, strategic decision company level require knowledge understand risks. besides, frequently observe bank find difficult reorganise it systems. while complete, “big bang” overhaul may preferable, often meet resistance many part company. to avoid lock outdated structures, bank consider expect short-term benefit design it strategy. furthermore, digital world demand banks’ manager something i would describe unbiased attentiveness towards new technologies. if bank don’t think “digitally”, they’re go find difficult compete digital customers. they reassess client relation even rethink different lifestyle social trends. the individual need wish customer pivotal ever before. take look social networks, online shop even information research – consumer already use need cater for. consequently, bank get habit look thing customer’s perspective. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let u also bear mind competition become global transparent, competitor diverse. in addition fintech companies, industry strong it focus one step away bank world. this mean line industry become blurred. now ever, bank need aware competition review refine strategies. from evolutionary perspective, adaptability another essential attribute. the digital world welcome experimentation, prone sudden trends, constantly changing. although bank industry may always subject constant movement, adaptability definitely become important. so flexible it infrastructure support adaptability, example, vital. business model also open flexible structure. just think “digital ecosystem” strategy bank deploying. 5. towards resilient sector a bank supervisor, i wholeheartedly favour goal stable sector. but understand adopt static view towards stability. for workable financial industry, decisive whether service provide offline online, human automate services. our yardstick need measure whether sector continue fulfil duty towards real economy, transform risk provide payment financial services. that’s mean resilient financial sector. to end, ensure “dead ends” digital evolution financial industry. i refer it-related risk particular. if rely computer digitalise processes, make sure reliable trustworthy. sector-wide reputation functionality stake. nowadays, customer’s personal payment information store bank multitude service provider retailer well. how bank ensure safety payment service cyber-attack retailer’s network third-party vendor? combine effort see insurance. you never know next victim attack. and attack don’t stop borders, cooperation kind also need global level. in interconnect therefore interdependent financial sector, strengthen common defence also banks’ interest. 6. conclusion let restate view “digital darwinism”. adaptation digitalise financial world simply require bank develop new ground-breaking ideas. it well-adjusted strategy – mean it’s race development departments, leaders. a supervisor, i therefore urge interpret digital competition race merely advance technologies, right mix. this i favour compare bank dinosaurs. traditional bank may typically pre-digital dna, capable learning, adapt digital landscape cooperate technological pioneers. and bank need find strategy. bank business irreplaceable ever before. so change? business success continue hinge entrepreneurial skills. in increasingly digital finance sector, role bank still serve real economy. and bank base trust. to keep mind key ensure thrive stable financial sector. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: interest rate reversal unite state german bank introductory statement dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, annual meet verein für socialpolitik, münster, 17 september 2015. * * * lady gentleman the british rock band the alan parson project chart 1978 single entitle “what go ...”, first two line read follows: “what go up, must come / what must rise, must fall”. these word wisdom also worth heed financial market – indeed, they’re secret successful trader. but interestingly, precise opposite also hold true financial markets. so, could equally say: “interest rate fall, must rise again.” but now, euro area still midst protract spell low interest rates. it go without say low-interest-rate environment make felt bank – particularly whose business model reliant interest income. so it’s surprise many german credit institution struggle weak earnings. that’s topic agenda quite time now. incidentally, get good idea german bank cop currently low level interest rate next week – 18 september, precise, bundesbank bafin release find joint survey low-interest-rate environment. what bank do? in nutshell, bank act meagre state earn present reflect business model tap fresh source income. while the alan parson project might point, live ever-diminishing resource simply sit tight interest rate reverse isn’t i would consider right course action. that’s interest rate euro area likely remain low time come – low rate inflation, modest economic outlook ecb’s forward guidance suggest much. the picture different one across pond. for extent purposes, unite state already begin edge towards monetary policy exit back may 2013. that u federal reserve announce plan “taper” bond purchase programme. so possible interest rate hike would represent return conventional monetary policy terrain. and much time interest rate move matter subsequent interest rate path feed follows. what would return normal policy rate condition unite state mean euro area germany’s banks? since 2013 observe policy divergence unite state euro area two knock-on effects. first, differential u euro-area interest rate widened; second, euro exchange rate dwindled. this trend gain traction early year eurosystem announce large-scale purchase government bonds. that increase spread u treasury german bunds send euro plummet dollar. so german bank need remember even feed raise policy rates, spell low interest rate euro area look set continue. remember i say minute ago – sit tight hop best simply isn’t option. and far possible exchange rate volatility concerned, bank might theoretically expose currency risk. two factor play role here. the first banks’ fund gap dollars. that gap measure excess bank’s u dollar asset u dollar liabilities. the big overhang, expose bank exchange rate risk. the second factor 2 bi central bankers’ speech mismatch maturity asset liability denominate u dollars. this maturity mismatch measure exchange rate risk interest rate risk. at onset global financial crisis 2008, fund gap maturity mismatch german bank large indeed. when forex market dry german bank get cut u dollar funding, central bank step lend help hand. since then, ecb, name one, provide swap facilities, take-up virtually non-existent. german bank reduce vulnerability since days, slash fund gap downsize stock u dollar assets. what remain substantial, though, scale maturity mismatch u dollar investments. however, actual risk exposure relatively small, german bank day much good hedge currency risk year ago. all all, then, expect interest rate reversal unite state unlikely impact strongly german bank – it’s move come entirely blue. and that’s point worth noting, three quality crucial exit accommodative monetary policy – transparency, predictability communication. we unlikely see turnaround euro-area interest rate near future. in closing, i would like quote the alan parson project: “someday, you’ll know are”. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview neue zürcher zeitung interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, neue zürcher zeitung, conduct m claudia aebersold szalay mr peter a fischer publish 19 september 2015. * * * mr praet, chief economist ecb past four year now. during period, policy ecb change somewhat. doe make difference chief economist ecb is? both president chief economist changed, change period economic environment find ourselves. at onset crisis 2007, still think simply deal external liquidity shock. so, central bank across globe react accordingly, time ecb also focus provide liquidity banks. i still remember headline back then, say ecb provide €100 billion liquidity, seem incredible sum time. the crisis nonetheless escalated. yes, quickly turn credit crunch, 2012 escalate euro crisis. however, come back first question: circumstance change dramatically; identity chief economist play minor role sense. ecb decision “one-man show”, rather result discussion amongst member govern council. that open, professional collegial exchange, basis ecb’s govern council make decisions. you give impression, however, take anglo-saxon approach, whereas two predecessors, issing stark, rather tradition deutsche bundesbank were, therefore, stability-oriented thinking. i would firmly disagree. i entire executive board ecb utterly commit price stability. that mandate, task enshrine european treaties. we see price stability symmetrical; work directions. we fight inflation – price rise quickly – determination price rise slowly. and policy certainly successful term counteract fear deflation, i like think. all policies, include le conventional ones, aim maintain price stability. by way, time predecessor otmar issing, ecb define precisely mean price stability: below, close to, 2%. however, issue purchase government bonds, true break past tradition. your predecessor strictly it, whereas mario draghi clearly favour purchases. who know predecessor would do position. they situation key interest rate reach low limit, thereby leave hardly room manoeuvre term interest rates. however, i sure would also do everything necessary fulfil mandate. besides, also government bond purchase programme former president jean-claude trichet, much small current one. critic say ecb go far that, ultra-expansionary policy, sow seed next crisis. we well aware fact expansionary monetary policy entail risk financial stability. we are, nonetheless, convince act right way, 2 bi central bankers’ speech follow mandate. a see strong rise lending, sign widespread speculative bubbles, risk financial stability currently limited. but monetary policy take much burden politics crisis. it true much weight place monetary policy manage crisis. i would also like stakeholder take responsibility respect. but change fact ecb must act first foremost order fulfil mandate. the euro area give good impression crisis? one big problem architecture euro area yet complete. we simply yet institution need quick effective crisis management. the euro area already important principles, bail-out clause, prohibition monetary finance no-exit clause. but serious design flaw also become apparent, nurture excess contribute scale crisis. and several member state face financial difficulties… … right structure place order deal them. no efficient mechanism to, necessary, refinance public private debt restructure resolve trouble banks. nor supranational institution position so. except international monetary fund. yes, imf, start with, many people europe happy imf involve euro area. i always favour imf board, europe, simply institution could take role. in meantime, institutional framework improve euro area? yes, much so. we european stability mechanism, make good progress bank union, european supervisory mechanism. that important step follow. the euro area need integration. wa absence institutional framework main problem behind crisis? one main problems. the problem government euro area little fiscal room manoeuvre order respond crisis. exactly, government save. wa austerity wrong, force government save? no, return sound national budget necessary, because, sovereign debt crisis, question regain confidence public finance euro area order curb speculation break-up euro. but, course, fact government little fiscal room manoeuvre lead worsen crisis mean ecb even still fulfil mandate. now ecb even pursue quantitative easing, and, past six months, buy government bonds. thus far, ecb purchase good €400 billion worth assets, autumn 2016, suppose amount €1 trillion. what assessment six months? the ecb’s purchase programme success. it already effect term inflation expectations, example, recover again, term general finance conditions, ease somewhat. but mario draghi already talk expand programme. he repeat say beginning, i.e. programme flexible adapt necessary. bi central bankers’ speech 3 be point already think expansion? the important thing emphasise readiness resolve act necessary. at moment, would premature, risk world economy grow significantly. we low economic forecasts, simply want ready act circumstance demand. be optimistic economic forecast spring? we accuse that, i don’t think so. the downward adjustment september large mainly due correction emerge markets. the economic recovery euro area intact. on thursday, u federal reserve system decide raise interest rates. doe decision make life easy difficult ecb? the euro area different cyclical phase u economy. therefore, monetary policy cycle also synchronised. nonetheless, share concern prospect global economy. if judge shock sufficiently severe persistent weaken inflation outlook euro area, would hesitate act. how much growth potential euro area lose crisis? the potential already weaken onset crisis, productivity growth slow down. the crisis make everything even worse, today euro area much low growth path. but monetary policy cannot change that. monetary policy cushion problem by, example, make liquidity available thereby help avoid bank crisis. monetary policy cannot create sustainable growth. for that, necessary intelligent structural reform strengthen growth potential economy. however, task central bank, governments. what latter specifically? they must undertake structural reform lay foundation high productivity growth. europe need intelligent reforms. but reform seem take long time. you pessimistic. we see encourage sign euro area, particularly country like spain ireland, also portugal. italy admittedly late start reforms, right track. be also confident greece? the situation greece still difficult, new programme make step forwards. and new programme bring relief? the programme indeed demanding, convince reform help greece create growth make way crisis. however, view forthcoming elections, i wish add anything that. let u focus switzerland. it clear policy ecb strong influence small, open economy like switzerland. be still possible swiss national bank pursue independent monetary policy? there doubt every monetary policy also impact currency areas. however, big impact switzerland come ecb, policy euro area countries. the weak crisis management politician 4 bi central bankers’ speech euro area lead investor seek safe haven switzerland, strongly push price swiss franc. and expansionary policy ecb play role? i believe policy help allay fears, thus tend rather reduce flight swiss franc. when euro area better, swiss franc le upward pressure. be make easy yourself? the ecb take responsibility crisis thereby help reduce uncertainty financial market even avoid panic. in so, also take pressure currency like swiss franc. naturally, would much effective european government also do good crisis management. but ecb’s quantitative ease also weaken euro thereby strengthen swiss franc? bear mind swiss national bank also introduce kind quantitative ease expand balance sheet – long did, way. in spite policy, long time inflation rate switzerland even low euro area. it difficult central bank situation avoid appreciation currency long term. should also rule govern orderly exit euro area? i believe need crisis management system resolution mechanism overindebted institutions, whether private public. what euro area look like end period office ecb? we inflation rate below, close to, 2%, policy achieve goal. and bank union complete, mean resolution regime deposit protection fully europeanised. for me, precondition well-functioning monetary union. in four years, europe much healthy state today. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: rid commodity cycle – resource canadian economy remark mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, calgary economic development, calgary, alberta, 21 september 2015. * * * i would like thank bahattin buyuksahin, brigitte desroches, kun mo konrad zmitrowicz help prepare speech. introduction this isn’t first time governor bank canada come calgary talk commodities. i suspect won’t last. it’s obvious discussion topic alberta, resource make quarter economy. of course, rich aren’t unique alberta. natural resource big economic story country since time european contact. today, canada major exporter natural resource among g-7 nations. oil one part story – also major producer exporter coal natural gas, base precious metals, mineral potash, agricultural forest products. because canada endow wide variety resources, we’ve learn deal large swing prices. i don’t mean usual high degree volatility common among many raw materials. i’m also refer long-term swing price often call “super cycles.” what’s important remember long-term swing drive fundamental economic law supply demand, well continuous technological progress affect output consumption. the pattern familiar. a large persistent increase demand lead sustain upward pressure resource price number years. the high price act incentive boost supply, company act by, example, invest new capacity find method increase efficiency. while high price certainly spur research development, technological progress constant theme natural resource industries. such advance uncover way raise output low production costs. and it’s progress inflation-adjusted commodity price generally trend low 200 years. the investment lead increase output take years, decades, complete. but, time, high output generate investment combine stabilize demand bring period downward pressure prices. face low prices, company may scale back investment production. ultimately, low price encourage demand, reduce investment crimp future supply, lead high prices. and producer ride price cycle again. any economy rely natural resource naturally challenge large movement prices. these shock swing national income; also force business make decision way resource capital labour allocated. these decision often lead difficult adjustments, necessary maximize economy’s potential. while abundance raw material may complicate management company conduct economic policy, it’s far good country resource them. even price falling, recently, endowment represent store value source future riches. what i’ll rest time today talk global force drive recent swing commodity price look may evolve year 2 bi central bankers’ speech come. then, emphasize uncertain outlook be, i’ll talk alternative scenario could dramatically alter future producers. finally, i’ll revisit lesson policy-makers business leader apply today future. global force work let’s take look back resource price past 15 year so. we saw large persistent increase demand, spark rapid economic growth emerge markets. in china, world’s populous country, economic growth average 10 per cent annually 2001 2011, period include global financial crisis. chinese growth mean enormous demand rise price many canada’s resources, particularly coal oil, well base metal copper, nickel aluminum. a million people emerge market leave rural area cities, demand increase build material iron ore use steel, support prices. although financial crisis lead price declines, many raw material rebound sharply. by april 2011, bank canada’s commodity price index reach post-crisis peak. however, rapid growth tend moderate expansion matures. chinese economic growth ease average 7.5 per cent since 2012, authority try engineer sustainable domestically orient expansion. similarly, india, saw annual gdp growth near 9 per cent 2005 2010, also moderate since 2012. while it’s true cool growth rate impact prices, shouldn’t forget emerge market still important source demand. indeed, since start decade, chinese economy, world’s second-largest, double size measure current dollars. in term supply, we’ve also see response put downward pressure price metal energy goods. for example, iron ore supply continue expand despite low prices, thank impact multi-year investment make price higher. these investment lead expand capacity low-cost area australia brazil. now let say word oil prices. this topic obviously great importance alberta impact employment overall economy. but it’s also important canada whole, give implication national income interprovincial trade, well industry’s sizable influence business investment. why oil price fall much? the main reason supply rise sharply, thank primarily technological advance oil extraction everywhere. this include oil sands, tight oil bakken deposits. consider particular technological progress enable producer tap tight oil reserves. output unite state alone, essentially didn’t exist 2008, reach 4.2 million barrel per day last year. that increase roughly equivalent oil canada produce year. give dramatic drop price past year, bank spend lot time speak business leader try gauge precisely react. at start year, oil company say intend cut investment 30 per cent. price didn’t recover much forecast time, company subsequently tell u would cut investment intention 40 per cent. currently, base discussion i’ve past couple weeks, many firm still revise longer-term expectation oil prices. the bank continue ass impact may investment spending. what mean evolution oil price hard say. the bank’s usual practice assume projection oil price remain stable use economic model test alternative scenarios. i know many company same. but risky: bi central bankers’ speech 3 vast majority oil transaction financial, rather producer users, price tend volatile underlie fundamentals. before i move on, let emphasize point. low price base metal oil today mean long-term investments, may take year complete last decades, somehow mistake. without investments, would never able capitalize high prices, boost canada’s aggregate income. what matter give investment price evolve life project, impossible know long-term investment decision must made. from end 2008 end 2010, price copper tripled, oil nickel price doubled. if believe market forces, movement represent clear signal invest expand output. those able recognize opportunity, make adjustment exploit high price rewarded, increase income bring important benefit canada’s economy. alternative scenario need flexibility now let spend time talk future. the price cycle i’ve sketch may appear fairly predictable. but history repeatedly show new technology quickly upend assumption future demand supply. for example, back 1970s, prediction world would run copper end century. the people make forecast foresee copper wire, long staple communication infrastructure, would replace fibre-optic cable, glass thread make silica. this technology help reduce demand copper, essence extend supply. similarly, digital photography dramatic impact photo-processing industry. twenty year ago, idea everyone would carry around telephone also good-quality camera ridiculous. people take picture camera load film take film developer. the process consume lot silver. back then, didn’t anticipate emergence digital photography, might expect source demand would continue indefinitely. instead, accord washington-based silver institute, use silver photography peak 1999 fall almost 80 per cent since. it’s sort technological advance make prediction future demand supply difficult. but it’s also technological advances, combine canada’s many gift natural resources, generate opportunity secure future prosperity. our good remain demand; continue lumber houses, metal industrial production oil use plastic – it’s hard imagine canadian road won’t continue need new asphalt repairs. further, it’s important remember canada’s endowment extremely diverse. while cycle base metal oil turn lower, still substantial demand that’s support price many agricultural goods. a i noted, continue growth emerge markets, population become increasingly urbanized. in north america, 82 per cent population life urban areas. that compare 55 per cent china, 30 per cent emerge market india. this trend toward urbanization likely continue. with come grow demand good link household consumption – particularly agricultural products. consider hundred million people climb income scale india china. their change diet imply much strong demand traditional protein sources. it also imply demand input fertilizer, animal feed, fish feed, oilseed specialty crop lentil chickpeas. indeed, late traffic figure port metro vancouver show sharp growth shipment wheat specialty crops, solid gain meat, poultry potash. 4 bi central bankers’ speech canada particularly well place tap grow demand fish seafood. canadian seafood export china first half year grow 11 per cent compare period last year. to take one example, 60,000 lobster fly halifax shanghai every week, aid advance ship production technology. thank part demand, lobster price rise sharply. in term aquaculture, however, appear considerable growth potential. while mussel farm output grow 35 per cent 2009 2013, farm salmon production plateaued period 100,000 tonne year. canada coastline country world. yet volume seafood output dwarf country norway, produce seven time much canada does. i’ll leave others figure best tap potential resource. rare earth minerals, 17 element use high-tech product cell phone hybrid vehicles, represent another potential source growth canadian time. it’s impossible know certainty opportunity emerge 30 year now. what new technological advance lie horizon? consider, example, future water desalination. right now, process remove salt sea water energy-intensive economically feasible large scale. but perhaps one technological breakthrough away solve problem. imagine impact chronic drought plague western north america australia could ease desalinate ocean water. the point exercise emphasize uncertain future is. businesses, consumers, government – must plan future base best information have. at time, natural uncertainty require u flexible adapt circumstance change rapidly. in concrete terms, mean business leader must aware risk involve resource production, manage risk best can, ready react market signal seize opportunities. history show company nimble one best poise thrive time. policy-makers help effort encourage economic flexibility. this mean allow necessary adjustment take place frustrate flow investment labour one region another. canada’s labour market show impressive flexibility oil price rising, worker flock alberta fill demand. and, late business outlook survey, bank saw evidence labour shortage ease region interprovincial worker return oil patch. policy lesson before i conclude, let say word monetary policy fit picture. there lesson take previous price cycles. the important value monetary policy framework. we can’t much resource price shocks. but policy help economy adjust them. in particular, float exchange rate help absorb impact price movement send signal facilitate adjustments. think back previous decade. from 2002 2012, oil price go us$25 per barrel us$100 per barrel, lead jump national income. over period, canadian dollar appreciate record low around 62 cent u.s. parity, help reduce inflationary risk come strong growth increase income. similarly, past year, oil price canadian dollar fall sharply. the float currency help reduce disinflationary risk come cut national income. further, allow currency float free bank canada concentrate single policy tool single target, inflation. if try offset bi central bankers’ speech 5 currency movements, would end frustrate natural shift economic resources. by focus mandate keep inflation low, stable predictable, bank build credibility, canadian well-anchored inflation expectations, even face large price swings. for example, see big move energy costs, price gasoline, little evidence consumer begin adjust overall inflation expectations, either upward downward. why important? since canadian see commitment target credible, make much easy u reach mandate goal without need big swing output interest rates. those recall experience oil price shock 1970s remember subsequent effort require bring inflation control. without credible target unanchored expectations, inflation soared. extremely high interest rate need get price increase back control. another point remember swing commodity price affect normal relationship total inflation rate core measure inflation use operational guide. for example, total inflation currently push impact low energy costs. in contrast, core inflation, strip volatile inflation components, face upward pressure recent decline exchange rate boost price import goods. however, expect one-off effects, and, such, would look them. a note july monetary policy report, temporary factor strip out, underlie trend inflation canada range 1.5 per cent 1.7 per cent, target 2 per cent. give complications, bank look measure core inflation part regular review inflation-targeting regime. next year, answer question whether bank continue focus one pre-eminent measure core inflation and, so, whether current core measure remain role. in interest rate announcement early month, bank note resource sector continue adjust low prices, complex adjustment take considerable time. our inflation-targeting regime help facilitate adjustments. canada see movie – we’ve manage well past, i’m confident continue manage well future. conclusion it’s time conclude. a albertans know well, hard ride cycle raw material prices. but resource price fluctuation affect countries, whether consumer producers. canada fortunate both, shouldn’t ignore resource bless with. natural resource bring opportunities. over years, canadian use endowment build prosperous economy. we continue so. and rather resist market forces, canadian heed signal send price movements. we’ve adjust rise prices; adjust fall ones. these adjustment never easy. they often difficult painful affect individual families. but necessary. for part, bank canada continue promote low, stable predictable inflation. do best contribution make help promote strong, steady economic growth flexibility need ease adjustment help resource-rich country thrive. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jessica chew cheng lian: integrate risk management approach maintain resilience & sustainability speech m jessica chew cheng lian, assistant governor central bank malaysia (bank negara malaysia), business continuity management conference “integrated risk management approach maintain resilience & sustainability”, kuala lumpur, 15 september 2015. * * * i would like thank disaster recovery institute, malaysia sterling risk solution invitation speak business continuity management (bcm) conference. today, ability corporation effectively manage risk become key factor determine agility resilience businesses. business imperative change dramatically risk management become significant part organisation sheer necessity – largely drive regulation, desire avoid costly sanctions, respond increase environmental political risks. in lead organisations, successful integration risk management strategic commercial decision-making create important competitive advantage likely sustain long term. this distinct organisational strength one cannot easily replicate simple reason build maintain complete organisational response strategic risk management, unlike say introduce new product market strategy, something accomplish within short period time. this morning, i would like talk change see practice risk management reflect important priority risk management observe work bank negara malaysia financial industry. i offer brief perspective business continuity management close final think prospect insurance industry malaysia contribute towards advancement risk management capability across malaysian businesses. change practice risk management since financial crisis, risk management practice come intense scrutiny. the spectacular failure risk management lead crisis prompt deep reflection go wrong risk management system practice – least among company invest heavily sophisticate risk measurement management system ultimately fail detect control risk exposures. close home, business malaysia currently face set challenge business condition likely find ill-prepared respond challenges, important implication future prospects. so learn change practice risk management experiences? a first observation mind concern importance build strong risk culture support governance arrangement explicitly align firm’s risk appetite. it strike that, last five years, global standard set body basel committee bank supervision move address risk culture, risk appetite set risk governance explicitly regulatory standards. this case prior crisis, emphasis predominantly place risk management process systems, believe ought sufficient. organisation largely fail take account behavioural bias play important role senior management decision ultimately affect risk company will take tolerate. these decision include performance target set staff, incentive structure designed, stature resource provide risk management function within organisation – create constant uphill struggle risk manager meaningful impact risk outcomes. to illustrate point, report publish 2 bi central bankers’ speech office financial research unite state observe much advancement risk management last decade result highly analytical-focused discipline, largely ignore fundamental driver risk-taking root subtle behavioural characteristics. within financial industry, financial institution malaysia require establish well-resourced independent risk management function report directly board risk committee, take active measure promote prudent risk culture organisation. this include properly design incentive structure must reflect risk outcomes. financial institution also require regularly review risk management methodology process account change business environment. this aim ensure risk management become something one check box list forget about. a second notable observation broad focus risk management. while financial risk remain key focus risk management practices, risk reputational, human capital environmental concern equally significant repercussion firm’s business. recover reputational damage hugely expensive endeavour, take long time, success often assured. we observe work institution take broad view risk management areas, conversation around role risk management senior management board level likely shift beyond avoid losses, enhance strategic opportunity improve institution’s competitive position. this mutually reinforce effect direct resource towards risk management create good synergy business risk functions. while firm acknowledge importance reputational, human capital environmental risks, action however generally measure up. many company still weak succession plan place remain vulnerable key-man risks. few company robust risk management framework incorporate measure product service affect well-being consumer consumer treat fairly, long legal exposure contained. and effort adopt triple bottom line approach report firm performance begin gain traction. within asia, few 10 bank institution today subscribe equator principle assess manage environmental social risk projects. clearly gap exist risk management practice whole-of-business approach fully embrace broad aspect risk remain large. regulation great shareholder activism remain important driver change, view, new breed risk manager effectively integrate traditional emerge risk perspectives, speak perspective compel cohesive way organisation’s key stakeholders. a third observation i want make today relate increase importance view risk longer-term horizon, imagine unthinkable. i mention together reason. when one focus look backward forward reasonably long horizon, universe unthinkable become small vision le likely blinker limit experience recent past. we also likely become open broad possibility new emerge risk horizon. in world creative arts, often say limit imagination. i think say risk management. if stretch imagination little further, high chance risk management proactive anticipate future problems, especially problem may never encounter before. this require risk manager go beyond estimate probability risk event occurring, allow great role uncertainties, matter remote, feature prominently risk management approaches. while easy say done, innovation like reverse stress test increase degree internal external collaboration go bi central bankers’ speech 3 construct stress test scenario positive indication firm respond challenge. on score least, risk management increasingly prove art exact science. organisation also continue face significant challenge effort break risk silo achieve integrate view organisational risk adequately take account operational dependency common exposure significantly amplify risk outcomes. a key challenge often overlook failure effectively integrate human resource management strategy enterprise-wide risk management goals. this create significant inertia, organisation often fall back manage risk silo default position. successful organisation recognise silo fundamentally cultural phenomenon. if build nurture people within organisation always attune risk may affect organisation, whatever nature origins, good chance system, process framework constraint easily overcome le likely inflict major loss organisation. when face challenge business financial condition highly dynamic environment, always important excellent people excellent models. bcm part enterprise risk management this bring specific area business continuity management, bcm. a paper publish 2008 charter management institute unite kingdom find 76 percent survey respondent report business continuity management see important organisation le half reveal specific business continuity plans. there several reason i get here, major one lack metric measure success absence major institutional crisis. one commentator put way – return investment simply business stay open. two contrast example bcm help underscore point. investigation japanese government fukushima tsunami disaster reveal material inadequacy handle complex risk associate manage nuclear power plant. this demonstrate poorly execute emergency procedure evacuate resident incident. consequently, operation power plant suspended. in contrast, 9/11 attack world trade centre, sustain commitment large multinational financial service provider strengthen bcm continuously improve evacuation procedure almost decade, enable reduce time take evacuate employee four hour 45 minutes, save thousand lives. within financial sector, key focus reform since global financial crisis development recovery plan aim protect continuity critical function core business line situation financial stress. work also initiate implement malaysia. financial institution expect develop menu option recover event severe stress order restore business stable condition. these plan must regularly update reflect change firm’s business model operational arrangements. at basic level, recovery plan help financial institution good understand operational financial interdependency affect recovery option available institution. some institution find process operation become far complex support credible recovery strategies. these institution take consider step restructure part business achieve wide option recovery. indeed, important development emerge recent period explicit consideration implication recovery plan key strategic decisions, decision hub operation particular location service provider. a much organisational resource put enhancement business continuity management, important business always keep mind inherent limitation 4 bi central bankers’ speech business continuity plan lull false sense confidence plan may provide. scenario feature plan often base assumptions, simplification reality best. such scenario always rigorously challenge account change conditions. business recovery resumption action also contemplate range condition build agility within organisation execute required, potentially untested, responses. firm expect rarely get point precision scenario plan bcm responses. this mean bcm necessarily reduce exercise futility. a commitment continuous improvement bcm almost certainly likely prepare firm good disaster tail risk event even specific event exactly contemplated. this organisation naturally good come together crisis, would able leverage core element response plan already develop tested. the world today encounter extreme disaster epidemic unpredictable weather-related calamities. in country, bad flood disaster experience decade last year saw 250 thousand people displace estimate cost two billion ringgit repair damage infrastructure. this present sober reminder responsibility corporation ensure well prepare remain resilient calamities, survival, interest employee community depend them. role prospect insurance industry advance risk management the cost associate negative tail-risk event escalate business network grow complexity. the use insurance continue important way company reduce cost transfer risk insurance providers. insurer well-placed assume risk give long stand history risk analytics enable effectively exploit law large number benefit risk pooling. among emerge economies, however, still sizeable protection gap spite increase frequency severity weather relate disaster natural catastrophes. in 2014, insure loss asia cover 10 percent total loss incur result natural man-made disasters. combine insurance premium write emerge market account 18 percent global premium 2014, 82 percent record advance economies. give concentration growth development emerge economies, go forward, extent under-insurance concern. in many economies, effort aggressively pursue increase awareness importance insurance protection help one manage risks, develop effective insurance market meet needs. the insurance industry malaysia currently stand crossroad implement important reform introduce bank negara malaysia general life insurance sectors. the objective reform enhance competitiveness industry, ensure continue resilience, encourage great innovation solution offer household business good manage risks. to end, two aspect reform significant. the first progressive strengthen prudential standard aim improve underwrite risk assessment capability within insurance companies, substantially strengthen incentive insurer differentiate market. the second structural change introduce reduce market distortion drive efficiency improvements. beyond domestic borders, bank also continue pursue liberalisation cross border provision insurance certain sectors, marine, aviation good international transit (mat) sector, enhance capacity reduce cost businesses. this primarily advance regional integration plans, focus particular asean. take together, reform expect result wide product offer delivery channels, service quality improvements, great market transparency, differentiate price reflective risk. bi central bankers’ speech 5 this help risk manager decision purchase insurance increasingly drive wide consideration go beyond intention transfer risk. significant advancement risk management practice financial innovation substantially broaden action risk manager take control risks. for many companies, insurance solution long view only, even important, way reduce risk exposures. the insurance reform allow industry good respond change demand drivers. importantly, also create opportunity build strong partnership corporate risk managers, insurance company insurance broke elevate risk management practice generally. this include wide role envisage industry provide risk advice clients, initiative advance quality coverage risk information useful risk manager across broad spectrum areas, information hazard exposure, demographic change technological risks. conclusion in conclusion, maintain delicate balance extreme risk aversion well-reasoned risk taking, essential business grow prosper, always involve difficult judgements. we careful ensure advancement risk management practice serve sharpen, blunt, judgements. this require investment people process firmly support good information, confidence strong risk culture, compel risk manager ensure organisation become complacent, remain focus best prepare possibility. bi central

gentlemen! i grateful phd chamber invite deliver keynote address important theme “financing india’s growth- way forward”. i happy note effort make phd chamber promotion industry, trade entrepreneurship research-based policy advocacy role. the summit today, i feel, important step journey. i also understand phd chamber crisil combine prepare knowledge report highlight key issue essential finance india’s growth i compliment efforts. i trust recommendation make therein would positively impact economic growth development country. 2. in address today, i intend talk india’s growth potential, suitable model india’s growth, key challenge undermine achievement potential growth rate way forward overcome challenges. let me; however, begin overview global economic situation india stand present. global overview 3. the global economy presently dominate four themes- chinese slowdown, impend rate hike u federal reserve, large-scale slump global commodity prices, especially oil continue sluggishness economic recovery. look advance economy (aes), growth virtually stagnant japan 0.8% continental europe slat report marginally high growth 1.5% 2015. the recovery north america, include usa modest uk likely witness modest 2.4% growth 2015. 4. the emerge develop economy (emdes) also witness significant slowdown growth. china’s growth rate likely fall 6.8% 7.4%, russia (–3.4% 0.6%) brazil (–1.5% 0.1%) set go negative territory view recessionary pressures. of brics nations, south africa estimate grow high 2.1% 1.5%. against backdrop negative modest positive growth rate large economic powerhouse major emdes, india’s economy poise grow 7.6% potential even high growth rates. the outlook growth india improve gradually. the business confidence remain strong initiative take union government begin find traction, expect private investment consumer sentiment would revive. we rbi firmly believe moderate inflation essential ensure sustain high trajectory growth. that bring u question “what growth potential?” india’s growth potential 5. this question subject active debate academic policy research circles. literature / research paper put vary estimate country’s potential growth rate notwithstanding methodological issue surround estimation potential output, lead considerable uncertainty. there is, however, fair degree 2 bi central bankers’ speech unanimity indian economy currently grow potential close negative output gap (i.e., actual growth minus potential growth) priority. 6. what hold india back attain potential high growth rate? since conference theme “financing india’s growth – way forward”, i would like start basic question: be availability finance constrain growth? financial sector mean sub-serve need real economy cannot drive growth itself. we see pitfall financial economy race ahead real economy form global financial crisis. i would argue availability finance, far, much small problem account structural problem rate growth achieve potential levels. it contextual mention per world bank’s “doing business 2015” report, country languish 142nd rank amongst 189 country overall ranking; parameter ease “getting credit”, fair comparatively much good 36th position. 7. a deliberate way finance india’s growth, let place pertinent point reflection begin talk growth model. what kind growth want? 8. the growth model pursue also subject great debate amongst policy makers. should manufacture driven, export-led growth, infrastructure lead growth one drive domestic consumption? in fact, model respective plus minuses. we example current chinese meltdown asian financial crisis late 90 which, part, result heavy investment infrastructure creation cease provide positive return beyond point much reliance export-led growth. perhaps, might want equitable mix – growth lead increase domestic consumption, investment infrastructure manufacturing. i believe well past period could focus exclusively world manufacture hub drive growth. to mind, would well aspire growth model predominantly focus domestic manufacture global service delivery, would much sustainable. it also essential realize growth sustainable inclusive nature outlook. the inter se disparity skewness development regions, community etc., neither desirable good society. key challenge growth 9. have discuss potential growth rate india model growth would like pursue, let highlight key challenge achievement potential growth rate. although also certain socio-political reason slow growth, economic stand point, i feel follow major challenges: • lack investment infrastructure- physical financial • high level financial exclusion • skill gap, implication employability • decline gross capital formation & dwindle domestic save rate what need done? 10. government well rbi mindful challenge take step overcome sustainable manner. it also worth emphasize need fine balance strike promote investment “capital intensive” “labour intensive” companies, whether industry service segments. this necessary keep view sheer number educate workforce country. over period time witness contribution service sector go significantly bi central bankers’ speech 3 around 57 % gdp. the recent growth output service sector largely attribute rapid development skill intensive service like information technology (it) it enable service (ites) sectors, e-commerce professional service segments, mostly orient towards external market. there question raise quality sustainability service-sector growth also potential future growth. however, i believe government’s thrust digital india skill development continue support expansion both: modern service like e-commerce, communication finance also traditional service like trade, transport storage, etc. urban migration 11. a crucial piece growth continuum would emerge continue migration people urban areas. this would fuel demand housing, transportation, electricity, education, healthcare facilities, etc. governments/ municipal body would also need invest creation roads, sewage systems, water supply facilities, etc. while focus impend urbanization critical, rural economy continue remain area focus 60% people would continue live rural areas. focus rural economy financial inclusion 12. income level rural area could improve land reform like consolidation fragment landholdings, turn support modern harvest methods, train rural people undertake non-farm activities. effort enhance credit absorption capacity must supplement financial literacy, vocational train initiative efficient crop insurance framework. 13. rbi long focus inclusive growth policy like selective credit control, priority sector lend norms, lend weak section society, service area approach financial inclusion drive recent past; detail well know audience. rbi’s policy expansion branch network rural semi-urban center also part initiative. there need leverage upon effort channelize save deploy productive asset creation. the two newly license full-service banks, eleven payment bank soon license small finance banks, would provide impetus accessibility finance render credit intermediation process efficient, thereby contribute sustainable inclusive growth. focus sme finance – key driver future 14. while subject inclusive growth, pertinent talk msme sector, potential foster strong growth create local demand drive consumption. presently, msmes contribute nearly 8 per cent country’s gdp, 45 per cent manufacture output 40 per cent exports. they provide large share employment agriculture nursery entrepreneurship innovation. acknowledge importance sector economic growth, both- government india well rbi take measure enhance flow credit sector. on part, rbi launch several initiative regard. to specifically address issue delay payment msme sector, treds conceptualise authorise electronic platform facilitate discount invoices/bills exchange msmes. on hand, part capacity build msme division bank develop entrepreneurial sensitivity, rbi recently launch target train programme functionary commercial banks. government india also recently lay framework revival rehabilitation msm enterprises. the initiative government india i.e. “make india”, “skill india mission” “digital india” also tie neatly provide push sector. 4 bi central bankers’ speech role bank finance growth 15. traditionally, like emerge markets, indian economy bank-dominated. so whether project development, work capital need corporates, bank primary source credit. though primarily bank suppose undertake maturity liquidity transformations, limitation extent asset-liability mismatch run books. the large scale distress witness banks’ infrastructure portfolio also raise issue ability critically appraise projects. the typical role bank mature market originate loan distribute will player market. they predominantly undertake work capital finance provide structure financial solution clients. they also act market maker various financial sector products. with gradual widen deepen financial markets, would fair expect bank also gradually shift focus sme retail client leave long-term resource contribution player include pension funds/ insurance company long-duration liability balance sheets. 16. there another factor relevant context. while banks’ ability dispense credit depend upon capital position, also guide viability project funded. risk aversion stem stress financial asset one reason restrain bank credit growth recent times. have borrower meet obligations? 17. i raise issue borrowers’ obligation many occasion cost repeat myself, i would like emphasise point more. while quest grow understandable, borrower cannot exclusively rely bank fund finance growth, without commit funds. the labyrinthine maze several large infrastructure project fund point extremely low negligible level equity contribution lead extremely high level leverage virtually skin game promoters. there visible pattern here. the last years’ growth largely account infra projects. these project launch handful promoter thin equity i allude earlier. i suspect small group run even thin level equity contribute fair share revival stall projects, talk commission new projects. so, obvious everyone momentum continue either find fresh equity make way others contribute equity exist project also new ones. 18. it also pertinent mention present legal system facilitate easy closure/takeover unviable firms. in order overcome problem salvage value firm distress, imperative take measure early enactment bankruptcy code. creation central authority resolution financial firm distress also need early finalization. 19. high level debt accumulation corporates encourage part availability low-cost, abundant flexible debt, facilitate search-for-yield environment create extraordinary policy measure undertake us, uk, euro area japan. several corporates increase leverage, borrow foreign domestic currencies. a corporates, mindful global uncertainty, given. the interconnectedness market lend volatility. the entity significantly high unhedged forex borrow likely face maximum distress. governance reform 20. india would continue need external capital growth hence, must create conducive environment boost investor confidence, include stable, efficient bi central bankers’ speech 5 predictable legal, taxation audit framework along credible credit rat regimes, amongst others. conclusion 21. i shall conclude reiterate point i make earlier. persistently weak economic condition global domestic market perhaps single important reason moderate growth recent time rather availability finance productive purposes. go forward also, availability finance constraint consider india’s attractiveness major investment destination global investor community. however, path potentially high sustainable growth essentially high save infrastructure investment, need ably support environment macroeconomic financial stability. it essential, therefore, sustain momentum gradual economic reform i allude earlier. both, rbi government would collectively work towards create necessary enablers growth like moderate inflation, stable exchange rate, fiscal consolidation, predictable legal/taxation audit regime. early resolution impasse land acquisition, enactment gst bankruptcy code would also provide strong leg investment climate country drive growth. strengthen pace financial inclusion financial literacy, efficient better-directed public spending, particularly social sector (education health) skill-development would equally significant step towards goal. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: interview thomson reuters interview mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, thomson reuters, conduct mr paul ingrassia, mr balazs koranyi mr john o’donnell 14 september 2015. * * * be quantitative ease working? it work effective many ways. the ultimate metric ass success inflation rate normalization around medium term target. that achieve improvement financial condition general, effect policy expectations, cost capital, rebalancing portfolios. all channel working. since last year, lend rate bank go 70 basis point several vulnerable periphery countries, like italy spain, 100 basis points, whereas main policy rate go 20 basis points. for first time since 2009, survey smes, number firm report access credit improve high firm say opposite. after year negative growth rates, credit private sector grow annualized rate 2 percent. so, good indication policy improve financial conditions. still, you’re contemplate change asset purchase programme. what would trigger change? we say january aim achieve sustain path inflation towards objective far objective right now. we want achieve sustain path. we think relevant remind everyone say begin would keep policy achieve goals. many people say there’s whole lot still do. how would respond them? we say last press conference size, composition duration present large scale asset purchase programme changed. the total amount purchase represent 5.3 percent gdp euro area, whereas feed do represent almost 25 percent u.s. gdp, bank japan do represent 64 percent japanese gdp u.k. do 21 percent uk’s gdp. so far major central bank do use instruments. but benchmark, i mention illustration. there scope, necessity there. if price oil continue go (it cannot go indefinitely), see jump inflation last quarter year. but may month negative inflation. until see reason doubt programme work. the staff projection recent, predicate completion whole programme foresee inflation 1.7% 2017. but prepare contingency. what monetary policy growth potential growth? monetary policy affect growth via financial conditions, affect expenditure decisions, investment aggregate demand. what difficult monetary policy affect potential growth. that depend much growth labour supply, technological progress, increase productivity, organization production. that’s supply side. the effect monetary policy indirect. europe big problem low potential 2 bi central bankers’ speech growth. it start demography: work population decreasing, productivity increase even compensate it. potential growth low present conditions, fear protract period low growth. this prospect protract low growth share advance economies. so europe term supply side reforms, investment, productivity growth get situation. be embrace immigration important europe? in general yes. but two dimension this: one medium long term issue immigration demographic developments, short term crisis refugee raise lot logistical issues, among others. to me, it’s clear immigration one thing improve demographic potential europe, necessary, european think care welfare future generations. the size work age population euro area decline 0.6 percent year 2030s. that’s huge. to change demographic trends, promote birth enough, also do immigration, corrected. if not, we’re create great difficulty growth welfare future generations. this acute problem year europe sort collective demographic suicide one think this. in short term, backlash immigration dramatic. it’s unemployment rate europe high 11 percent, destabilize continent. in human social terms, cost enormous reaction see immigration stem that. it important reduce unemployment slack economy. fortunately, present situation, price stability objective engineer growth go hand hand. doe slow wage growth present challenge euro zone? country adjusting. now several country growing. there country core euro zone one could see wage could grow more. wage subdue spite recovery. this end recovery continue help late inflation rate normalize. what outlook global economy china? the situation uncertain. there three source uncertainty. one strength recovery u.s. we need strong recovery u.s. another one china. we need china able stabilize situation keep growing. then uncertainty reaction emerge market normalization interest rate u.s. if recovery u.s. strong look right now, important thing world economy. china still stabilize situation keep growth 6 percent achievable short term. the uncertain situation emerge markets. we don’t know impact interest rate normalization corporate bond market countries. be witness structural shift global economy? china country could continue grow forever 9 10 percent year. growth country bind decelerate. it structural shift. the potential growth emerge market still there. what difficult envisage acceleration growth advance economy level use crisis. we face sort configuration quite time. this mean unemployment would continue increase may enough growth push bi central bankers’ speech 3 unemployment healthy levels. there growth (1.5% euro area, 2.5% us) accelerate, depend international environment. but see sort potential growth while. could europe experience japan experienced? i don’t think so. the development wage always different japan. there rigidity wage recession (in europe) important factor i never really fear would actual deflation europe. wage flexible japan. most euro area gdp come service inflation service basically wage developments. it difficult go situation deflation europe. that’s difference japan. will divergence continue euro zone? no. we saw initial phase catch convergence. then come crisis. if look development economy u.s. europe, recovery similar 2011. then europe double dip recessionary adjustment. after painful adjustment many reforms, ireland, spain, portugal, slovenia cyprus grow fast euro area average first half year. the exception italy grow slightly le average. we growth again. we need strengthen confidence peripheral countries. that achieve deepen integration. the greek turmoil raise doubts. these doubt close additional institutional reforms. what doubt raise euro? it raise doubt market country like greece could cope challenge monetary union. there never doubt among majority member countries. we maintain euro irreversible. legally, country expelled. the actual prospect happen never real. do fear people europe may lose faith institutions? at ecb, utmost within mandate. we aware excessive expectation central bank do. unemployment destabilize continent. european value erode several country result fear unemployment creates. it policy maker job. doe change stance federal reserve implication market volatility become permanent feature? we don’t know reaction market be. monetary policy fine tune volatility financial markets. we medium term objective help stabilize expectations. central bank independent financial market follow fluctuations. excessive volatility good sign uncertainty. there new situation now. market liquidity, facility buy sell without affect price much, reduce crisis. market maker reduce inventories. business seem le profitable. regulatory reform make liquidity bite le cheap. market adjust situation lead volatility. be capital control compatible monetary union? they temporary. the situation greece agreement programme, stabilized. we would expect new government show strong ownership 4 bi central bankers’ speech programme. the situation liquidity bank sector improve greece agreement reached. the stage set gradual dismantle capital controls. they eliminate cyprus. be confident imf join bailout greece? the imf endorse policy include memorandum. to join new programme, imf two conditions: one debt sustainability ownership programme greek authorities. regard debt sustainability analysis, discussion take place time first review. you see various analysis show cannot consider debt sustainability analysis term debt ratios. a big part greek debt concessional term quite period time. everyone expect convergence analysis possible. a haircut refuse member state i certainly hope necessary view numbers. the one dig numbers, sort conclusion seem emerge. that’s matter negotiations. bi central bankers’ speech 1 r gandhi: asset reconstruction npa management india keynote address mr r gandhi, deputy governor reserve bank india, “the economic time remodel india – asset reconstruction & npa management summit”, mumbai, 15 september 2015. * * * assistance provide shri a k choudhary, smt. chandana dasgupta shri b. nethaji gratefully acknowledged. lady gentlemen, very good morning. 2. it indeed pleasure present interact important issue management non-performing asset india. such event quite important especially surge stress asset bank recent times. current position 3. however, look little far back, asset quality indian bank system like this; actually improve significantly since implementation reform bank sector introduction prudential norms, enactment securitisation reconstruction financial asset enforcement security interest act 2002, credit information company act, etc. the gross npa ratio steadily decline 15.7 per cent 1996–97 2.36 percent 2010–11. however, amount non-performing asset witness spurt subsequently march 2015, 4.62 per cent gross advance bank comparison 2.36 per cent gross advance march 2011. the growth npa much high growth advance last four years. in addition, ratio restructure standard asset gross advance grow 6.44 per cent end march 2015 5.87 per cent gross advance march 2014. the total stress asset (i.e., npa plus restructure assets) march 2015 11.06 per cent gross advances. 4. the sharp increase stress asset adversely impact profitability banks. the annual return asset come 1.09 per cent 2010–11 0.78 per cent 2014–15. consider effect capital liquidity position bank, urgent need bank reduce stress asset clean balance sheet l become drag economy. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 5. manage asset quality always important become prominent objective especially period economic downturn. recognise importance effective asset quality management, reserve bank issue various guideline banks, time time, various aspect asset quality management. preventive management 6. reserve bank advise bank management credit risk receive top management’s attention process encompass: a) measurement risk credit rat / scoring; b) quantify risk estimate expect loan loss unexpected loan loss c) risk price scientific basis; d) control risk effective loan review mechanism portfolio management. 7. further, reserve bank also advise bank put place robust credit risk management system sensitive responsive various factor affect credit risk. the guideline entail involvement top management, include board director bank actively manage credit risk banks. bank require put place proactive credit risk management practice like annual / half-yearly industry study individual obligor reviews, credit audit entail periodic credit call documented, periodic visit plant business site, least quarterly management review trouble exposure / weak credits. recent regulatory initiative 8. recently, in january 2014, reserve bank india release comprehensive “framework revitalise distress asset economy”. the framework outline corrective action plan incentivise early identification problem cases, timely restructure account consider viable, take prompt step bank recovery sale unviable accounts. in addition, address issue information asymmetry also identify problem early, central repository information large credit (crilc) collect, store, disseminate credit data lenders, set up. under arrangement, bank report credit information, include classification account sma crilc borrower aggregate fund-based non-fund base exposure ₹50 million them. bi central bankers’ speech 3 9. while proper credit risk management important manage asset quality, another issue equally important proper structure credit facility extend various borrowers. while grant credit facilities, bank set realistic repayment schedule basis proper analysis cash flow borrowers. this would go long way facilitate prompt repayment borrower thus improve record recovery advances. a “one size fit all” approach provide plain vanilla loan client may interest bank well customers. 10. in order effect structural change way project loan grant banks, consider need facilitate bank offer long term project financing, may ensure long term viability infrastructure core industry sector project smoothen cash flow stress initial year projects, reserve bank issue guideline flexible structure long term project loan periodic refinance option. reserve bank also introduce concept “standby credit facility” fund cost overrun projects. such “standby credit facilities” sanction time initial financial closure; disburse cost overrun. at time initial credit assessment borrower / project itself, cost overrun assessed, agree disburse eventuality cost runs, debt equity ratio, debt service coverage ratio, fix asset coverage ratio, etc. determine accordingly. thus, may need borrower approach bank late stage additional finance. restructure / rehabilitation 11. however, despite proper credit appraisal proper structure loans, slippage asset quality may unavoidable, especially economic cycle turn worse. hence, weak account identified, bank need consider various remedial actions. one remedial option restructuring. in spite best effort intentions, sometimes borrower find financial difficulty factor beyond control also due certain internal reasons. for revival viable entity well safety money lend banks, timely support restructure genuine case call for. the objective restructure preserve economic value viable entity affect certain internal external factor minimize loss creditor stakeholders. 12. such support borrower temporary financial difficulty need contingent upon retention asset classification status “standard”. there tendency among bank withdraw support account classify npa. mere classification account non-performing asset need result withdrawal support viable borrowal accounts. the purpose asset classification provision present true picture bank’s balance sheet stigmatize account / borrowers. however, consider support account stress, bank make proper distinction willful – defaulter / non-cooperative / unscrupulous borrower one hand, hand, borrower default debt obligation due circumstance beyond control. 13. a may aware, reserve bank withdraw special asset classification benefit available restructure asset effect april 1, 2015 align norm restructure international best practices. subsequent sudden drop asset “restructured” seem bank become choosy restructure loan borrower stress. one reason cite drop restructure asset “banks incentive restructuring”. we feel decision bank restructure drive motivation revive account temporary financial difficulty preservation economic value viable entity interest creditor borrowers, rather merely concentrate asset classification provision benefits. 4 bi central bankers’ speech recovery / exit 14. a first step towards effective recovery / exit framework account beyond revival, bank well -defined loan recovery policy set manner recovery due depend upon circumstance account. bank may resort either opt legal avenue non-legal avenue exit account. bank may enter compromise settlement term board approve policy compromise settlement npas. however, adequate care take ensure compromise settlement do fair transparent manner. bank may also sell npa bank (which happen outside sarfaesi act). there bank good recovery expertise see instance purchase npa banks. 15. in event failure mention measures, bank could resort file suit debt recovery tribunal invoke provision securitisation reconstruction financial asset enforcement security interest act, 2002. an alternate option enforcement security interest sell npa securitisation company / reconstruction company (scs / rcs) register sarfaesi act. sc / rcs expect specialize task recover reconstruct

“roundtable monetary policy low growth, low interest rate environment”, istanbul finance summit, istanbul, 8 september 2015. * * * the role interest rate – short- long-term, nominal real – pervasive modern economies. change interest rate affect: value wealth accumulate savers, propensity save, finance cost borrowers, evaluation investment projects, sustainability fiscal debt, stance monetary policy. and list could go on. we know many advance economies, short- long-term nominal interest rate historically low levels. and low several year now. this environment view merely consequence central banks’ reaction global financial crisis; long time perspective, also end point trend. some data: since early 1990s 10-year nominal yield government bond decline 10 percentage point uk, 9 euro area, 6 u japan; short-term nominal interest rate follow similar pattern though large volatility. how come? what associate risk policy changes? in try answer question let first recall nominal interest rate view sum three components: 1) real interest rate, 2) expect inflation, 3) term premium. economic theory tell u real interest rate price equate supply save demand fund aim finance investment. supply demand, turn, determine factor preference household smooth consumption across time productivity capital. the expect inflation term premium component nominal interest rate self-explaining: buy long term bond i want return could compensate potential loss future purchase power, risk potential capital loss i need sell bond prior maturity. a lot influence factor involve here: expectation future economic growth inflation; degree risk aversion; financial market volatility, domestically abroad, since capital market become globally integrated. which factor explain current low interest rate environment? i would indicate two set factors: transitory, structural. the latter particularly important, since may suggest current environment long-run phenomenon, bind stay u quite time. the transitory factor evident: first expansionary monetary policy stance put place many central bank response global financial crisis, and, euro area, also sovereign debt crisis. we know central bank advance countries, policy rate reach zero low bound, enrich monetary policy toolbox various unconventional measures, important visible one program security purchase (qe). another transitory factor de-leveraging private sector. in part due financial regulation become much strict crisis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and come structural factors. they summarize follows: excess desire save desire investment, lead low economic growth real interest rates. this essentially secular stagnation hypothesis propose last year larry summers.1 barry eichengreen, one prominent economic historian times, recently write illuminate article topic.2. he discus four possible explanations. 1) high save rate emerging-market economies. this well-known global save glut hypothesis put forward year ago ben bernanke.3. the idea emerge countries, china particular, social protection system limit weak household feel force increase precautionary saving. 2) the decline relative price investment good (machinery, equipment, icts), thank technological progress. for give investment project, fall relative price investment reduce demand funds. with le investment spend chase savings, result low real interest rate and, potentially, chronic excess desire save desire investment. 3) a low rate population growth, advance economy also emerge markets. it reflect slow growth labor force, turn require le investment. 4) the fourth possible explanation controversial one. the idea pace scientific technological invention slow down, since golden xx century electricity icts, never recover, cause correspond permanent scarcity high-return investment opportunities. robert gordon supporter pessimistic view.4 personally, i don’t believe fourth factor: innovative capability humankind always catch philosopher economist surprise. but three factor serious deserve addressed. let briefly touch upon policy implications. nearly eight year onset financial crisis, global growth disappoint average, high variance across country regions. the u.s. recovery continue sustain pace, growth euro area japan currently still modest, though expect pick up. emerge economies’ growth decline fifth year row 2015, although economy continue increase share global gdp. against outlook, monetary policy stance across major economy may become asynchronous come months, federal reserve actually start announce normalization process. the big question is: much transitory transitory factor explain current low interest rate environment? what happen monetary policy normalizes? or structural factor prevail keep real nominal interest rate low forever, least long time? 1 summers, h. l.

area keynote speech mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, pension fund conference, organise netherlands bank, bussum, the netherlands, 10 september 2015. * * * i would like thank jonathan yiangou, john hutchinson katri mikkonen contribution speech. lady gentleman thank much invite address conference. over last year condition fix income market been, standards, highly unusual. policy interest rate euro area fall close 0% – negative case deposit facility – see 10-year german government bond yield drop low 0.075%, one point 36% euro area euro-denominated government bond negative territory. and though interest rate retrace way back since mid-april, clearly remain historical lows. for investor whose business model centre around fix income undoubtedly challenge environment. i am, course, aware challenge pension fund sector particular facing. what i would therefore like focus remark today ensue question: condition allow rate rise back level that, look retrospectively, consider “more normal”? my answer summarise follows. very low interest rate much choice central bank reflection economic malaise global euro area economy. some driver malaise secular, challenge public policy affect. but others relate demand condition appear weak even compare long-term potential growth rate already disappointingly low. such persistent economic slack relative potential reverse target measures. that include tackle cyclical headwind drag aggregate demand; facilitate process balance sheet repair; remove structural barrier high real growth prospects, reinvigorate demand expectation confidence channels. the role monetary policy mainly provide countercyclical stabilisation economy go transition. when economy weak, all, disinflationary pressure increase, counter deliver mandate. the monetary policy measure currently place euro area follow this: decide direct result euro area inflation rate well comfortable level persistent weakness economy. and meet objective, support growth inflation, turn create condition interest rate “normalise” more. of course, level rate return future dependent upon degree secular drivers, currently depress rates, reversed. challenge low interest rate environment let start, however, briefly touch challenge current situation pose pension fund sector, well insurance sector give similar focus fix income asset prevalence long-term liabilities. large euro area insurer show quite reasonable profitability,1 albeit aggregate picture mask substantial heterogeneity 1 see ecb (2015), “financial stability review”, may. 2 bi central bankers’ speech across country type business. small medium-sized, non-diversified life insurer high policyholder guarantee typically highly expose low yield find business model pressure. for pension fund impact low interest rate strong maintain define benefit schemes. the challenge insurance sector underscore mix performance stress test undertake 2014 european insurance occupational pension authority (eiopa).2 while top 30 european insurer fulfil solvency ii requirement baseline scenario, 14% participant – mainly small firm represent 3% total asset sample – so. the similar exercise currently conduct eiopa pension fund provide valuable insight strength vulnerability sector current market environment, issue which, present, data relatively scarce. the challenges, however, limit sectoral level. how insurance company pension fund adjust low interest rate environment could also wide implications. with total asset €9 trillion, strategy employ cope low investment return could clearly spillover effect financial market broad economy. one dimension adjustment could relevant relate reallocation portfolio towards high return assets. “healthy risk-taking” – borrow famous expression coin ben bernanke – heart monetary transmission. when central bank low short-term interest rate normal times, financial entity respond shift portfolio allocation precisely direction need advance objective monetary policy: reinforce duration exposure step risk-taking general. by so, amplify stimulus central bank introduce intervene otherwise narrow relatively unimportant market segment – overnight interbank market. it via transmission mechanism monetary policy effective produce generalise ease financial conditions. but said, long low rate persist, watchful healthy diversification morph under-appreciation risk may create fragility road. this could impact broad swathe market participant give importance insurance pension funds, particular provider long-term funding. data large euro area insurer provide evidence re-risking via gradual rotation portfolio towards bond vulnerable euro area country emerge markets, maturity extension, although indication yet excessive risk-taking. another dimension adjustment could broad effect relate possible change save behaviour generate strong incentive risk-shifting towards policyholders. while move towards unit-linked define contribution policy might increase resilience insurance pension companies, could increase uncertainty future benefit thus raise precautionary save among several cohort people. data suggest, however, dimension adjustment remain contained. unit-linked insurance define contribution pension still constitute 20% life insurance policy pension euro area, pace growth remain slow. in addition, survey result eiopa indicate insurer adjust largely focus diversification non-life asset management business low guarantee rate new policies.3 2 eiopa (2014). “eiopa insurance stress test 2014”, available https://eiopa.europa.eu. 3 eiopa (2014), “low interest rate environment stock take exercise 2014”, available https://eiopa.europa.eu. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a third potentially problematic dimension adjustment relate incentive increase concentration reduce costs, bring financial stability concerns. in europe, handful large insurer – part financial conglomerate – already play central role financial system, although individual link bank market participant currently seem over-concentrated.4 the creation ever large champions, however, could change picture. the work conduct financial stability board global systemically important insurer (g-siis) thus highly topical, also important european perspective. understand low interest rates5 in environment, i appreciate industry may call high interest rates. after all, simple solution challenge face sector would seemingly interest rate rise quickly possible. but important understand interest rate low. and close examination reveal underlie driver much central bank policy global euro area-specific economic factors, secular nature others associate legacy post-lehman financial crisis. to comprehend point, useful decompose long-term nominal yield four components: expect inflation term asset; expect path short-term real rates; inflation risk premium real term premium, together represent compensation require investor hold long-term bond oppose roll short-term securities. all component contribute low long-term rate observe today. from long-term perspective, nominal yield long-term bond decline trend major advance economy since 1980s. improvement monetary policy framework play role this: commitment low stable inflation, adoption explicitly quantify price stability objective (or targets) increase number central banks, bring long-term inflation expectation compress inflation premia, contribute low nominal yields. but decline nominal long-term rate also explain real component: expect real rate well real term premium. part decline real interest rate account long run, secular forces; part due cyclical dynamics. if one take textbook solow growth model organise device different force drive real interest rate long run, ultimately pertain productivity population growth, save behaviour. the intuition force determine investment therefore demand loanable funds, match savings. see long-term, growth rate total factor productivity (tfp) slow euro area decades. population growth also decline 0.7% early 1970s around 0.3% recent years. and look distant future, downward pull adverse demographic could accelerate: model-based simulation suggest demographic trend – notably rise supply fund provide age population – could result significant reduction real rate long-run.6 4 alves, i., j. brinkhoff, s. georgiev, j.c. héam, i. moldovan m. scotto di carlo (2015), “network analysis eu insurance sector”, esrb occasional paper no. 7 (july). 5 for section see chart 1–12. 6 kara, e. von thadden, l., interest rate effect of demographic change in a new keynesian life-cycle framework, macroeconomic dynamics, forthcoming, (published online: 14 july 2014.) 4 bi central bankers’ speech on top gravitational pull secular forces, cyclical factor weigh real interest rate directly link global financial crisis. notably, euro area still work way “balance sheet recession”, situation severe debt overhang set condition sharp downturn, turn create need substantial deleveraging prolong length slump. this product pre-crisis period where, misread sign decline productivity growth, firms, household case government accumulate excessive debt basis overly optimistic real income expectations. the result excess save post-crisis period cause need three sector repair balance sheets, over-indebted firm household country confront high credit premia, depress investment. investment indeed remain well pre-crisis levels. the damage cause economy dynamic massive. youth long-term unemployment rise significantly euro area, “hysteresis” effect estimate notably reduce labour supply. this fee back slow potential growth rate, potentially time, give strong sectoral dimension crisis need extensive re-skilling reallocation workers. slow potential growth also couple heighten uncertainty, discourage new investment projects. the upshot continuous decline long-term growth expectation euro area, add downward pressure real rates. such post-debt crisis effect visible many advance economies, contribute low level global interest rate see today. but would agree negative impact crisis strong euro area jurisdictions. the reason certain feature euro area make work debt crisis hard protracted, namely institutional structural weakness national euro area levels. the absence integrate euro area bank system one weakness. the great moderation – euro-specific misrepresentation type risk investor expose accept finance imbalance member monetary union – encourage formidable expansion cross-border bank activity prior crisis. yet despite illusion integration, euro area still effectively consist multiple juxtapose national bank systems. large save investment gap within monetary union therefore finance mainly short-term bank debt, create latent vulnerability “sudden stop”. when cycle turned, little scope risk reallocate across union – also due lack formal macroeconomic risk-sharing mechanism architecture treaty institutions. worse, bank vulnerable country remain heavily expose sovereigns, bank sector fact amplify crisis via “diabolical loop” bank sovereigns. in way structure euro area bank sector interact incomplete construction institution aggravate financial fragmentation credit constraints, thereby magnify impact balance sheet adjustment economy. other mechanism could cushion shock also turn unavailable. the possibility sequence macroeconomic deleveraging, public sector leverage private sector deleverages, hind fragile public finance enter crisis weak fiscal framework could maintain market confidence public debt. fiscal policy therefore largely pro-cyclical, sector deleverage simultaneously context weak nominal growth. way accelerate balance sheet restructure minimise fallout economy also inoperative due shortcoming legal framework many countries. in particular, weak national insolvency framework slow judicial system make write-off resolution bad loan negligible source debt reabsorption euro area, bi central bankers’ speech 5 especially compare post-crisis experiences, u uk. all contribute continue save investment imbalances. the final component affect long-term interest rate term premium. here longer-term force mingle cyclical dynamic connect financial crisis push nominal interest rate down. term premia euro area suppress – include crisis – supply demand imbalance safe asset global level, especially increase demand foreign investor interact shrink supply highly-rated security denominate euro, owe crisis-time downgrade certain sovereign issuer progress fiscal consolidation aaa issuers. more recently, regulatory change basel iii boost demand safe asset even further. safe-haven flow period financial unrest also exacerbate effects. the role monetary policy7 monetary policy certainly contribute reduce interest rates. yet policy understand response challenge context. monetary policy cannot affect secular force weigh euro area economy, provide answer institutional structural questions. what must do, however, respond weakness aggregate demand disinflationary pressure creates. that essentially course steer policy since 2008, fact remarkable that, give strength headwinds, inflation remain relatively stable. we always address sign de-anchoring inflation expectation determination. this testament role monetary policy preserve nominal anchor. give depth length crisis, however, anchor could provide conventional monetary policy alone. the short-term interest rate eventually run effective low bound, reduce potential rate cut support economy. and even short-term rate become constrain way, also, unlike economic areas, deal serious disruption transmission policy cause financial fragmentation euro area. we therefore choice resort unconventional measure ensure price stability environment. operate bank-centric economy, main focus unconventional measure early phase crisis ensure transmission policy across bank institutions, context generalise collapse interbank market. then, fragmentation become pronounce along national line post-debt crisis phase start 2011, focus shift ensure adequate liquidity bank sectors. by middle last year, however, become clear measure adopt provide liquidity backstop bank become le effective, term pass-through credit condition real economy, bank actively deleveraging. we therefore adopt target long-term refinance operation (tltro), part credit ease package, order create incentive bank lock-in low long-term central bank fund originate cheap loan real economy. after launch credit ease summer 2014, inflation picture materially worsened. throughout second half year macroeconomic outlook deteriorate underlie inflation dynamic weakened, begin spillover long-term inflation expectations. that fall inflation expectation also correspond rise real interest rate – effective monetary tightening. face grow disinflationary risks, scope rate cut exhausted, point move asset purchase 7 for section see chart 15–17. 6 bi central bankers’ speech main tool expand monetary policy stance. this context launch expand asset purchase programme (app). we generally satisfy measure work far, continue monthly asset purchase end september 2016, beyond necessary, case see sustain adjustment path inflation consistent price stability objective. notably, asset purchase contribute compression term premia, currently negative accord several model-based estimates. our measure also positive impact transmission. banks’ intermediation capacity strengthen via incipient improvement asset quality increase profitability. bank lend rate household non-financial corporation (nfcs) converge downwards across euro area countries, bank participate least one tltros reduce lend rate nfcs – include smes – non-participating banks. and july 2015 bank lend survey show improve lend conditions, expect support recovery loan growth. bank far able buff borrower high rate face market follow recent re-pricing financial markets. the improve macroeconomic environment low cost face banks’, amount provision require non-performing loans, thereby allow pass-through high cost finance borrowers. still, credit start low base volume aggregate remain relatively weak. the justification credit ease therefore remain much place. moreover, govern council remain vigilant recent volatility materially affect broad array financial condition therefore lead unwarranted tighten monetary policy stance. on real side, measure feed domestic demand, observe deceleration pace economic recovery. the late ecb staff projection see low growth 2015, 2016 2017 well slow increase inflation rate compare previous exercise june. the weak growth outlook primarily reflect slow growth emerge markets, downward revision inflation largely explain low oil prices. on account external environment, risk euro area activity inflation downside, risk intensify since cut-off date 12 august technical assumption underpin projections. in context, govern council closely monitor risk inflation outlook medium-term. it emphasise willingness ability act, warranted, use instrument available within mandate. in particular, asset purchase programme contain sufficient flexibility adjust size, composition duration. to sum up, low interest rate ultimately consequence weak secular trends, couple cyclical consequence complex debt crisis, exacerbate monetary union institutional structural flaws. “normalisation” therefore central bank raise policy rate remove accommodation provide unconventional policy measure – would result tight monetary policy stance make situation bad – address underlie driver hold real rate inflation expectation down. address structural institutional challenge monetary ease alone cannot achieve this. certainly, policy create pre-conditions rate rise back towards normal levels. when expect real rate expectation economic growth – see present – incentive entrepreneur capitalise differential invest new projects, increase demand funds. income also rise fast debts, support fast deleveraging reduce supply funds. but monetary policy necessary condition “normalisation”; sufficient one. bi central bankers’ speech 7 if monetary policy full effect economic cycle, need support policy help dislodge negative sentiment euro area’s prospect induce high investment. it surprising, example, business currently perceive limit excess capacity, despite large estimate output gap. expectation long-term prospect also depressed. if pessimism persist, would risk low investment high unemployment enter feedback loop, increase likelihood economy settle form “underemployment equilibrium”. cyclical drag would become structural. in view address situation three parts. the first boost euro area’s long-term growth prospects, give demographic come chiefly raise tfp. the determinant tfp growth complex, broadly speak function within-firm across-firm efficiency. the former relate well firm innovate adopt new technology, latter relate well capital labour reallocate productive firms. structural reform decisive cases. oecd research find structural factor produce considerable difference productivity diffusion frontier firms8 well responsiveness labour capital innovative activity.9 the second part accelerate process private sector debt workout within euro area. raise productivity growth would certainly support this, insofar high long-term growth increase future debt service capacity. but reduction numerator debt ratio – nominal debt – must also part equation. the provision non-performing loan part comprehensive assessment take u halfway towards solution. what key written-down loan quickly restructure efficient insolvency regimes10 work privately deepen market distress debt. the capital market union project could important catalyst ultimately induce convergence areas. the third part address institutional incompleteness monetary union. there several dimension this, lay recent five presidents’ report, priority complete bank union integration euro area bank sector. this could direct impact investment, insofar encourage financial reintegration reduce credit frictions. institutional reform also necessary, would act statement intent behalf member last commitment euro area. progress three front would go long way towards remove factor prevent high sustainable growth. it would also accelerate normalisation interest rate away low levels. conclusion let conclude. what i try explain today central bank policy interpret cause low interest rate rather consequence economic malaise disinflationary pressures, central bank aim forestall. that say, simply mirror image global euro area specific factor pull long-term nominal real interest rate low levels. address factor determination accelerate process “normalisation”. 8 oecd, “the future productivity”, oecd policy note, 2015. 9 andrews, d., c. criscuolo c. menon (2013), “do

able speak another ceda function, particularly one melbourne. a central theme reserve bank australia’s (rba) communication past year australian economy period transition: transition big resource boom century something bite normal. the sheer scale resource boom mean transition challenges. and challenge compound happen beyond shores. a second theme communication, however, reasonably successful transition possible, indeed, probable. this assessment reflect positive fundamental economy, well underlie flexibility. this flexibility help u deal upswing resource boom help u deal downswing. and third theme communication monetary policy help adjustment, likelihood successful transition would boost lift underlie productivity growth increase expect risk-adjusted return capital formation – physical capital human capital. today, i would like take opportunity touch three themes. i think useful start recent development global economy, particularly china, form important backdrop adjustment go through. and i would like focus ongoing adjustment economy. global development so, first global backdrop. perhaps main news past month china. in particular, two development chinese financial market catch people’s attention. the first sharp decline chinese equity market second decision chinese authority allow renminbi depreciate u dollar. in chinese equity market, price fall almost 40 per cent since mid june (graph 1). this fall reverse around two-thirds increase occur previous year. the reason early increase entirely clear. one possible factor ease restriction margin financing. another expectation chinese citizen future capital gains, perhaps equity market open increase investment overseas. a third weakness residential property markets. whatever reason, often happens, thing go far. many investor think increase equity price would keep go many borrow money get big stake rise market. a bubble developed. and burst. while attract much attention, movement chinese equity market likely limit implication overall chinese economy. in term exchange rate, much past years, renminbi move closely u dollar (graph 2). this mean u dollar appreciated, 2 bi central bankers’ speech chinese currency; trade-weighted basis, renminbi appreciate around 15 per cent mid 2014 end july year. with u chinese economy different phase business cycle, unsurprising chinese authority might come conclusion great flexibility renminbi u dollar warranted. notably, move direction also consistent authorities’ long-standing goal transition market-determined exchange rate. while change chinese exchange rate also attract much attention, magnitude change need keep perspective. at around 3 per cent, recent depreciation hardly line short-term movement sometimes see among major freely float currency world. these development chinese financial market coincide sign slow chinese economy. many recent indicator – include industrial production, fix asset investment retail trade – somewhat soft early year (graph 3). the true various business survey chinese exports. in contrast, one area look little positive late residential property market. in large cities, property price increase again, although construction activity yet pick noticeably. over past month, news china significant ripple effect global equity markets. volatility pick many major equity market around 10 per cent level month ago. volatility also pick commodity market commodity price also low month ago. it noteworthy though increase volatility equity commodity market lead dislocation financial markets. in particular, deterioration fund market credit spread mostly move relatively narrow range. this recent focus development china has, understandably, throw spotlight outlook chinese economy. assess outlook complicate fact china simultaneously adjust slow growth potential output deal relatively soft phase business cycle. the slow potential output growth – extraordinary period sustain double-digit growth – inevitable and, indeed, widely expected. it has, however, bring sharp focus structural challenge face chinese economy. these include: • challenge shift investment-led consumption-led growth • challenge liberalise market important factor production – include labour, land, capital energy • challenge demographic change, chinese working-age population decline overall population age • challenge deal various strain distortion financial system property market. at various time chinese authority acknowledge challenge range plan develop deal them. however, successful plan ultimately turn yet seen. there doubt economic outcome china past decade remarkable, hundred million people lift poverty. the challenges, however, get easier, authorities’ recent handle stock market crash lead ponder general direction chinese policy, include likely pace reform across economy. this issue bear close watch month ahead. from cyclical perspective, chinese authority take number step recently support growth. increase spend infrastructure one these. nominal benchmark bi central bankers’ speech 3 interest rate reduced, although inflation declining, real rate tend rise past year (graph 4). reserve requirement bank system also lowered, although design offset withdrawal liquidity take place chinese authority sell foreign exchange reserve response private capital outflow china. the depreciation renminbi u dollar also expect provide support, margin, chinese economy. so, overall, complicate picture present australia’s large single trade partner. we become use extraordinarily strong growth china get use something little le extraordinary, also remind china business cycle. nevertheless, remain case still significant mutually beneficial opportunity deep economic relation australia china. a nation, need keep eye opportunities, while, time, understand manage associate risk best can. elsewhere, recent economic data mostly slightly positive tone. the u economy record above-average growth unemployment rate around estimate full employment. in europe, economic news recently tend bite good early year recovery, sorts, take place there. in india, too, growth momentum look improved, although number country east asia, domestic demand export growth slowed. for globe whole, economic condition continue support decline oil prices. in addition, drag fiscal consolidation lessen several countries. monetary condition also remain accommodative. at point long, hope u economy sufficiently strong federal reserve begin process normalise interest rate there. a strong u economy good rest world, although financial market development need watch carefully give policy interest rate unite state zero almost seven year now. put together, rba publish late forecast bite month ago, expect gdp growth trade partner around average next couple year (graph 5). while recent news global industrial production softer, balance, recent data change general outlook materially. we still expect gdp growth trade partner average around 4 per cent 2015 2016, although give recent development east asia risk around central forecast tilt little downside. the domestic transition i would like turn adjustment domestic economy. the broad story well known. over past decade, australia experience extremely large external shock form resource boom (graph 6). this shock three phases. the first phase large increase commodity prices. the second large increase resource sector investment. and third phase large increase resource sector production exports. while various phase overlap times, much third phase, high production generate increase exports, commodity price much low year ago resource sector investment return normal levels. during first two stage significant reallocation resource within australian economy. this important avoid overheat characterise 4 bi central bankers’ speech previous resource booms. but adjustment back way take place, time. indeed, term trade decline almost four year now, peak second half 2011. over period, global supply commodity increase substantially new investment project come stream past four years. largely result, price export relative import fall around 30 per cent. this decline bring term trade back around level mid 2000s, considerably high average 1990s. the peak mine investment occur around year peak term trade. in mid 2012, mine investment reach record high around $30 billion per quarter. since time, fall significantly around $20 billion june quarter year. further decline still lie ahead project completed, although end large decline look come sight; current forecast mine investment decline around $10 billion per quarter end 2017. if turn case currently roughly halfway decline mine investment. in contrast, ramp-up resource sector output still way. over past three years, resource export 20 per cent annual increase around 9 per cent expect next couple year lng production increases. while inevitably degree imprecision estimates, increase lng export expect boost gdp growth average around ¾ percentage point 2016 2017. through third phase mine boom, economy overall grow annual rate 2 2½ per cent (graph 7). the quarterly read gdp continue affect fluctuation mine production due weather. but look volatility, data june quarter suggest economy continue grow similar rate past years. most recent indicator also consistent moderate expansion australian economy. measure business condition improve average. the unemployment rate little change past year demand labour increased, rise employment relative working-age population. the house cycle remain upswing household consumption grow moderately (graph 8). for many community, fact growth occur moderate pace disappointing. growth slow become use to, slower, i think, capable of. and, term incomes, compound decline price resource exports. a result, little growth real income per caput year now, decade half strong growth. while disappointment understandable, lose sight fact economy show considerable ability adjust, way preserve overall economic financial stability. we adjust upside huge positive international demand shock without overheat adjust downside still manage grow moderate rate. this significant achievement testimony underlie flexibility economy. this flexibility give u come confidence future. an important element flexibility exchange rate (graph 9). when term trade initially start fall decline mine investment clearly sight, exchange rate relatively slow adjust. on number occasions, rba draw attention this. but exchange rate adjust considerably adjustment continue recent weeks. just appreciation help stabilise economy upswing boom commodity price mine investment, depreciation help downswing. bi central bankers’ speech 5 one example tourism industry. a relative cost overseas travel increased, australian holiday domestically people visit shores. encouragingly, see sign change travel pattern prompt pick-up investment tourism industry. in particular, noticeable increase stock work do construction hotel relate accommodation (graph 10). the rba’s liaison tourism-related business suggest increase investment area likely come years. condition also improve number sector sensitive exchange rate. another element flexibility labour market, term labour supply wage (graph 11). during upswing, population growth pick noticeably, partly due rise immigration. this help alleviate pressure labour market would otherwise occurred, especially area skill short supply. in downward phase, population growth slowed, partly due immigration. aggregate wage growth also moderate significantly. this play role generate sufficient employment growth recent time keep unemployment rate steady despite below-average growth overall economy. a third element flexibility monetary policy. a rba frequently noted, entirely appropriate that, period term trade mine investment declining, monetary policy accommodative. monetary policy help support growth overall economy even work quite way did. this support clearly evident interest-sensitive house construction sector, investment increase 7 per cent past year. the strong house market also positive ripple effect part retail sector. so, together, flexibility exchange rate, labour market monetary policy help cyclical adjustment economy. the miss ingredient continue lift non-mining business investment, still wait convince sign pick-up. the late read australian bureau statistic firms’ capital spend plan outside resource sector show slight improvement early readings, material lift non-mining business investment still seem way away. in time, though, expect adjustment see cyclical variable – exchange rate, labour market interest rate – help create environment lead increase investment. but clearly limit here. a low exchange rate, low growth wage low interest rate basis sustain increase investment output. they certainly help adjustment phase, ultimately good increase investment drive high expect return rather low cost finance low wages. this focus improve climate business investment important. there magic bullet here, surely investment climate would improve strong focus business government innovation, productivity, human capital entrepreneurship, topic i speak previous occasions. thank i would happy answer question might have. 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph

australia, actuary institute “banking change” seminar, sydney, 16 september 2015. * * * i go talk three key current issue financial markets, namely bond market liquidity, long-term interest rate china’s exchange rate regime. all three important bear financial market price round world, include australia, probably quite time come. they may sound interrelate i tie together end. bond market liquidity i start bond market liquidity. if read financial market medium past year, would hard-pressed avoid read article bond market liquidity. indeed, one best financial market commentators, matt levine, devote section column “people worry bond market liquidity”.1 notwithstanding fact column publish daily, little problem find material write issue. so today, i would like provide matt levine material throw hat crowd ring. though first time, year ago i talk issue.2 so revisit issue today? here reasons: first, one year on, noteworthy liquidity “events” bond market, include awkwardly name “flash rally” u treasury 15 october 2014, day i give speech last year. second, much anticipate first increase feed fund rate designate critical test case state liquidity bond market. third, equity market experience volatile month august, bond market were, somewhat surprisingly, relatively stable (as matter, major foreign exchange rates). that serf highlight fact liquidity volatility relate thing. so exactly i mean bond market liquidity? generally i would take mean ability transact bond market without material influence price. for example, i want sell hold australian government securities, much i able sell, time period, without significant impact market pricing? this question highlight two points: quantity dimension time dimension liquidity. if i try sell security once, impact market likely large i break order small piece sell period time. however, i latter sell gradually, risk market price move period time, news people’s transaction i don’t get good overall price. 1 see example, <http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015–06–03/people-are-worried-about-bond-market-liquidity>. of late, also occasional column people worry bond market liquidity. 2 “volatility market pricing”, speech citi’s 6th annual australian new zealand investment conference, sydney, 14 october 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the quantity time element liquidity often conflate discussion bond market liquidity. hence hear currently simultaneously best time bad time liquidity bond market. bond market liquidity “top book” is, number metrics,3 good ever been. that is, ability sell small parcel bond close current market price good. but “depth book”, ability sell large parcel bonds, nowhere near good, bad quite time. how two developments? this outcome reflect evolution market recent year response technological changes, regulatory change well institutional appetite activity. in term technology, significant increase share electronic trade bond markets. in australian market, estimate electronic trade account around one-third trade australian government security market (though considerably le domestic bond markets). in us, share electronic trade much higher, half turnover. with increase electronification market come high-frequency trade firms. these firm provide increase liquidity top book, necessarily contribute depth book, give preference trade small size, well many cases, inability trade large size balance sheet constraints. they contribute low transaction cost (in term bid-ask spread) small orders. but question mark around resilience time market stress. the key structural change shift market share provide immediate continuous liquidity ability warehouse risk don’t capacity warehouse risk. in regard, bond market follow well-trodden path equity market late foreign exchange market increase electronic trade increase participation high-frequency trader (hft). not would regard “equitisation” bond market (or foreign exchange market matter) good thing.4 the report recently release u authority examine “flash rally” u bond market 15 october 2014 highlight issues.5 to remind briefly happen day. about hour slightly weak expect u data release, 10-year u treasury bond yield fell rapidly 16 basis point six minute (that price go up, hence flash rally) reverse course almost retrace move next six minutes. if take well-timed coffee break 12 minutes, would none wise anything much happened. the report able come conclusion cause occur, though investigation ongoing. but provide information structure u treasury market time, include share high-frequency firms, proprietary trade firm (ptfs) report call them, market. one interest fact one firm relatively high share side market, part sizeable share trade do itself. that is, buy sell u treasury itself. another noteworthy fact price adjustment smooth throughout, gap 3 see “market-making proprietary trading: industry trends, driver policy implications”, cgfs report no. 52, november 2014, discussion analysis various liquidity metrics. available <http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs52.htm>. 4 michael lewis’s ‘flash boys’ bring high-frequency trade equity popular discourse. for role hfts foreign exchange market, see ‘high-frequency trade foreign exchange market’, market committee publication no 5, september 2011. available <http://www.bis.org/publ/mktc05.htm>. 5 see joint staff report: the u.s. treasury market october 15, 2014. available <http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/documents/joint_staff_report_treasury_10–15–2015.pdf>. bi central bankers’ speech 3 prices. so event fit neatly category liquidity event. there prolong dislocation price gap rapidly stay there, often people mind think consequence low liquidity. nevertheless, fact event occur arguably deep liquid market world mean need understand go here. a well impact technology, regulation also significant effect. regulatory change increase cost bank intermediation, hence liquidity provision, many markets, particularly bond market. this see number participant withdraw completely others scale back activities. bond desk bank hold le inventory do historically, give increase cost so. this contribute le “depth book” liquidity, though necessarily le “top book” liquidity. the regulatory change intend effect. liquidity provision under-priced previously over-supplied. regulation increase cost provide liquidity hence decrease quantity supplied. so direction change issue, rather extent change focus debate bond market liquidity. that is, regulation increase cost liquidity provision far result liquidity bond market low? that certainly discussion worth having. but meantime, liquidity bond market today is. it continue evolve go back time soon. so participant bond market need adjust current situation rather simply complain it. if transaction cost higher, particularly transact large size, asset manager bond holder need take account way execute transaction market. for example, discuss above, one solution may execute slowly small parcel sizes. execution certainly need nimble consider past. but perhaps importantly, increase transaction cost term liquidity execution also take account way asset manager construct portfolio. the difference transaction cost across various class need take account. if transaction cost higher, perhaps i transact less. do i really need selling? in cases, i might much choice, need transact may drive mandate i given. but case, discussion least provider mandate highlight high transaction cost implication portfolio. or maybe i need transact redemption flow fund. in situation, i may need think hold high liquidity buff i past. if cost obtain liquidity market bond portfolio high use be, i need think weigh cost hold liquidity balance sheet accomodate potential redemption flows. let turn another concern often express around bond market liquidity, namely that, decline intermediation banks, likelihood market dislocation higher. this often come discussion around consequence feed tighten monetary policy result large sell-off bond markets. the “taper tantrum” 2013 often invoke example. this saw rapid rise bond yield number emerge market follow indication feed go wind quantitive ease program. a i say last year, i think issue much one decline liquidity much decline capacity warehouse risk. in past, large sell-off bond markets, liquidity never great. a bank desire investor catch fall knife. bid-ask spread widen considerably depth book deteriorates. that always case. 4 bi central bankers’ speech however, addition decline liquidity provision, bank le risk-warehousing capacity past. they le able nimble buyer asset whose price believe overshot. in past, bank may pull back price fell, generally among first step buy felt price overshot. this one important aspect i mean warehouse absorb risk. a result regulatory change well risk tolerances, le will able today. many real money investor able move quickly take advantage overshoot prices. the degree discretion generally large. mandate often impose constraint stray far benchmarks, take long time change mandate respond change market circumstances. be participant market able move rapidly agilely perform function today? i’m sure exist i’m sure enough them. i suspect soon find out. if le capacity this, price move large amount remain away equilibrium value longer. volatility higher. in itself, necessarily bad thing. it is. but high volatility, distribution price movement fat tails. overshoot likely long-lasting deleterious consequences. give that, recommend central bank step play role market-maker last resort. without debate merit proposal today, worth point term “market-maker last resort” misrepresent role play here. a market-maker make two-way prices, buy selling. in dislocate market, trade one-way, central bank would buying, wouldn’t sell asset anyone else anytime soon. a appropriate description buyer last resort, risk central bank’s balance sheet come perform role. long-term yield i talk bite issue direct relevance actuaries. be government bond rate still appropriate risk-free yield? be low use stay there? on first question, opinion, answer still yes. ultimately risk-free yield something approximate growth rate economy. on basis, government bond yield still pretty good job. yes, policy action major economy might push yield low might otherwise been. but policy action reflect growth circumstance find ourselves. in australia, partly result policy actions, see foreign hold australian government security increase 75 per cent peak, though it’s bite low now. again, i don’t see purchase distort australian government bond yield, rather reflect reality world live in. so government bond yield around historical low recent years, reflect discount rate use actuarial calculations? how long period low rate go last? i’m go answer question directly. but it’s useful think term economic growth rates. secular stagnation often put forward reason growth rate low use be. there various theory secular stagnation around, number boil proposition rate innovation technological progress low future past. personally i find defeatist, ultimately speculative. we simply don’t know future bring. there quite number time past claim make subsequently prove wrong. maybe it’s right time, i don’t see reason give yet. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in australia, one factor significant influence real growth rate rate population growth. that slow australia late, mean grind believe medium-term growth rate economy slowed, case discount rate probably lower. but order magnitude talk pretty small, order quarter per cent. that well within range error around knowledge long term growth rate economy. that said, i realise quarter percentage point matter lot actuarially compound number years. so sum up, i continue believe government bond yield best measure risk-free yield economy. there reason believe structurally low use be, i find proposition future rate technological progress low pessimistic. china’s exchange rate i say word recent development china’s exchange rate, pick point highlight rba board minute release yesterday, well colleague phil lowe’s speech last week.6 a probably know, chinese authority make notable change foreign exchange rate regime 11th august. on day, chinese authority move exchange rate regime along path market-determined rate, development welcomed. the initial effect chinese exchange rate depreciate around 4½ per cent. this big general scheme exchange rate move (though generate large amount commentary). moreover come context 15 per cent appreciation china’s exchange rate trade-weighted term past year rmb move lock-step u dollar. i want focus one aspect change regime. a part effort limit appreciation rmb decade, chinese authority accumulate us$ 4 trillion foreign exchange reserves. this occur environment sizeable current account surplus combine significant flow capital china well stringent restriction ability chinese citizen invest abroad. however, environment changed, china still run current account surplus, though small year back. most importantly, china experience sizeable capital outflow ease restriction capital flow allow chinese citizen invest abroad. a result, chinese authority late, face capital outflows, intervene hold exchange rate, rather hold down. consequently, china’s foreign exchange reserve decline around half trillion u dollars. we don’t know chinese sell don’t know composition reserve holdings. but probably involve u treasury sovereign bonds. nor know asset private capital outflow china buying. but huge order magnitude certainly first order influence financial markets. one regard chinese reserve accumulation reflect accumulation foreign asset state behalf private sector couldn’t invest abroad. now private sector invest, switch accumulate asset public sector sell holdings. that is, fair part go moment shift hold foreign asset china, necessarily large change total quantity 6 “international domestic adjustment”, speech philip lowe committee economic development australia (ceda) event, melbourne, 9 september 2015. 6 bi central bankers’ speech foreign asset hold china. what matter global financial market difference portfolio allocation public private sector china. conclusion i talk three topical issue financial market today: bond market liquidity, long-term yield china’s exchange rate. all three issue important financial market australia. they currently quite interrelated, rundown china’s foreign exchange reserve probably part comprise sale u treasury sovereign bonds, great liquidity, thereby affect global long-term yields. we see unusual situation risk-off environment associate sale risk-free asset large market participant, rather purchases. on bond market liquidity, decline liquidity is, part, desire outcome regulation. whether fall far debated. but situation isn’t go change time soon. market participant adjust behaviour deal current state affairs. they consider carefully execution strategy function environment low liquidity may also need adjust construction portfolio accordingly. whether change market environment conducive temporary flash crash permanent dislocation remain seen. the latter significantly great concern former, avoid well-timed coffee break. all three issue go u come. so important adjust current environment rather wish something else. bi central bankers’ speech 1 harun r khan: corporate bond market india – framework action remark mr harun r khan, deputy governor reserve bank india, ficci capam 2015, mumbai, 27 october 2015. * * * accompany table find end speech. the speaker acknowledge contribution shri vaibhav chaturvedi shri vivek singh reserve bank india. 1. speak event – panel – leaf sense déjà vu. the fact i speak issue forum three year back 2012 – many forum early – reflect deep-rooted, inertial nature underlie factors. at least 10 year development corporate bond market india focus stakeholder arduous pursuit ‘holy grail’ deliver desire results. in process unfortunately become convenient stick flag policy regulatory intent. every set stakeholder view need do much prognosis end give limit perspective. 2. maybe time dispassionately understand big picture acknowledge ten fundamental fact financial ecosystem exist today: i. bond market globally institutional nature – buy hold kind investors; ii. a sound bankruptcy regime pre-requisite deep bond markets; iii. development bond market need sustain participation long-term institutional investor across credit curve; iv. tax regime financial instrument remain one key driver investor interest; v. development market mechanism infrastructure best enable factor – drive factor; vi. fiscal consolidation lead low sovereign borrow enhance demand corporate bonds; vii. high indebtedness major corporates domestic external source conducive issuance corporate bonds; viii. the centrality bank financial system give stage economic development. the corporate debt market, therefore, cannot play predominant role finance near future; ix. predominant reliance bank system support development corporate bond market, directly indirectly, militate idea bond market de-risking bank sector; x. the corporate debt market cannot look totally detach sovereign bond market. corporate bond market may get fillip interest rate come fiscal deficit target achieved. the play spread across credit curve become attractive. 3. alongwith recognize hard fact come realization many low hang fruit remain pluck – work forward contingent multifarious factor hard policy choices. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 4. there number report corporate bond markets, viz., r. h. patil committee report (december 2005), report high power expert committee make mumbai international financial centre 2007 (percy mistry committee) a hundred small step [report committee financial sector reform (cfsr)] 2009 (raghuram rajan committee), report city london, examine detail various aspect relate development corporate bond market make useful recommendations. it recently decide financial stability development council (fsdc) sub-committee issue need look entirety. an inter-regulatory group already start work direction. the focus group distill key actionable recommendation make early committee suggest time bind plan implementation same. measure take develop corporate debt market 5. take account recommendation make various expert committees, several measure take government india, reserve bank india (rbi) security exchange board india (sebi) development corporate debt market india. the success measure achieve intend outcome has, however, varied. impact measure take capture below: intend outcome mostly achieve • set report platform post-trade transparency • introduction dvp settlement otc trade corporate bond eliminate settlement risk • issue long-term bond bank allow minimum maturity seven year raise resource lend (a) long term project infrastructure sub-sectors, (b) affordable housing. these bond exempt computation net demand time liability (ndtl) therefore subject crr/slr requirement • the investment limit foreign portfolio investor (fpi) increase usd 51 billion last years. limit allocation methodology rationalize withhold tax rate reduce 20% 5% • fpis permit invest corporate debt least 3 year residual maturity • international financial institution like ifc permit float rupee link bond overseas deepen off-shore rupee bond market ifc investor raise rupee invest india. this facilitate development benchmark yield long term corporate bond • sebi allow set dedicate debt segment exchange intend outcome partially achieved/ early say • bank pd allow become member stock exchange trade corporate bond • investment norm bank pd relax facilitate investment corporate bond • final guideline issue partial credit enhancement bank corporate bond • measure take encourage investor interest/participation corporate bond market term liberalize list requirements; simplification procedure bi central bankers’ speech 3 processes, simplify disclosure norm standardisation market convention • rationalisation fpi regulation put place easy registration process operate framework overseas entity seek invest indian capital market intend outcome achieve • introduction repo corporate bond meet fund need • introduction credit default swap facilitate hedge credit risk holder corporate bond reissuance bond permit sebi 6. the measure take reserve bank india, sebi government result considerable increase issuance well secondary market trade corporate bonds. total corporate bond issuance increase around 155% ₹ 2709.46 billion 2010–11 ₹ 4,789.62 billion 2014–15. similarly, number issuance increase almost 77% 4,280 2010–11 10,941 2014–15 (table 1). 7. in comparison economies, size bond market india, however, remain moderate percentage gdp (table 2). 8. it, however, need note development corporate bond market india lag behind comparison financial market segment due certain structural issues. some issue include: • the corporate bond issuance dominate private placement account 95% total issuance corporate debt (2014–15); • issuance concentrate aa rating, largely public sector entity financial institution • a majority issuance concentrate 2–5 year tenor; • limited/narrow investor base. investment mandate institutional investor insurance companies, pension fund provident fund permit large investment corporate bonds; • reissuance bond pick up; • lack functional trade platform ccp facility like nds-om (as available government security market) impede growth secondary market; • market credit risk protection instrument like cd yet developed; • non-standardized stamp duty corporate bond across various state affect issuances. way forward 9. activate corporate bond market require number regulatory measure address macro issue well market micro-structure issues. while create efficient market infrastructure create condition issuer investors, structural issue address long term market evolve financial system get integrate international markets. it would convenient look set issue comprehensive manner. i would like classify possible measure “7i” framework i talk one early speeches. 4 bi central bankers’ speech issuer reissuance bond 10. corporates may encourage re-issue exist bond isin code. this augment market liquidity potentially reduce cost borrowings. though sebi recently allow reissuances corporates, reissue bond corporate. in order encourage reissuances, may need incentive form reduce documentation formalities, le issuance fees, etc. issuance municipal bond 11. an active corporate bond market would enable market municipal bond issue urban local body (ulbs). the potential issue municipal bond assume importance context proposal set 100 smart cities. however, size municipal bond market india rather limit distribute strong municipality ahmadabad, nasik, nagpur, etc. the possible reason could overlap jurisdiction municipal body lead plethora rules; perceive lack specialize project management support ulbs; non-transparent budget account system many ulbs limit exit route investor due lack secondary market trading. 12. to address issue measure could considered, strengthen governance structure municipal issuer ring fence municipal bond funds; provide partial full guarantee central/ state government; mandate escrow account debt service bond proceeds, etc. sebi since issue regulation issue list security municipalities. investor liberalise investment guideline long term player 13. in order encourage demand, investment norm regulate entity may review facilitate active participation corporate debt market. the current investment guideline pension retirement benefit fund may review ownership criterion (public sector / private sector) rat base criteria. they may also permit use interest rate swaps, repos credit default swaps. encourage retail participation 14. participation retail investor corporate bond continue limited. in order increase retail investors’ participation corporate bonds, need encourage issuance zero coupon bonds, provide clarity taxation issues, include provision special quota retail investor debt issue provide reduce transaction cost retail investors. intermediary introduction market make scheme 15. a market make scheme corporate bond could potentially improve market liquidity. but market make illiquid market challenge many intermediary ready take risk make two-way quotes. a viable market make scheme may formulate suitable incentive encourage market participant provide two way quotes. stock exchange may come market make scheme consultation regulators. perhaps role debenture trustee regard may also need explored. infrastructure efficient trade platform corporate bond 16. nse develop dedicate trade platform privately place corporate bonds. there is, however, negligible activity trade platform. although system provide bi central bankers’ speech 5 dvp-iii guarantee settlement, learn system issues, viz. high margin, high penalty default, non-availability issue bond platform, etc. accord market participants, need combine settlement corporate bond repo outright market dvp-iii mechanism par g-sec market order increase traders’ participation. 17. stock exchange could discus market participant make suitable change exist platform encourage trading. if required, may adopt calibrate approach matter explore introduction dvp-ii settlement initial stage move dvp-iii depend development market. 18. an electronic trade platform similar croms platform g-sec announce repo corporate debt. this need take forward quickly. legal framework recognize regulate platform may put place. rat agency 19. rat agency play important role way provide credit evaluation instrument like bond issue corporates. their role come focus internationally global financial crisis certain principle reform rat agency agree internationally. in india also, sebi come certain transparency disclosure norm credit rat agency (“cras”) 2010. cras. base experience, guideline may need reviewed. bankruptcy law 20. a robust effective bankruptcy regime essential development corporate debt market investors’ point view. steps, as, reform bankruptcy law, early resolution bankruptcy case streamline procedure relate insolvency would go long way achieve same. the issue insolvency financial institution establish statute bi-lateral net among bankruptcy also need resolution. one significant step direction set bankruptcy law reform committee shri t. k. viswanathan submit report. the committee come draft legal framework resolve matter insolvency bankruptcy which, fully implemented, far reach impact. early enactment propose legislation follow-up action game changer development corporate bond markets. incentive cap borrow corporate bank capital purpose 21. restrict proportion borrow large corporates bank make corporates use market mechanism (such as, corporate bonds, commercial paper instruments) meet part short term well long term finance need help development corporate bond markets. reserve bank already issue discussion paper “large exposure framework enhance credit supply market mechanism” march 27, 2015. resolve distribution tax relate issue securitization 22. securitization corporate debt instrument would provide big fillip market would improve risk transference diversification provide liquidity issuers. subject income spv tax hamper growth securitized debt. market participant demand taxation structure securitized debt need change distribution tax spv level taxation hand investors. rationalisation stamp duty norm 23. in term provision entry 91 union list, central government power levy stamp duty issue debentures. however, state stamp law also 6 bi central bankers’ speech provide duty issue/transfer debentures. stamp duty law need rationalise provide incentive issuer work already direction. use corporate bond collateral 24. post global financial crisis see large scale use non-sovereign paper collateral central bank

sector development policy bank thailand speech dr veerathai santiprabhob, governor bank thailand, thailand focus 2015 “opportunity growth reform”, bangkok, 2 december 2015. * * * chairman the stock exchange thailand, secretary general the security exchange commission, president the stock exchange thailand, chairman phatra securities, president asia pacific bank america merrill lynch, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, a good morning all. i would like thank the stock exchange thailand, phatra securities, bank america merrill lynch invitation join year’s thailand focus event. i much honor address prestigious group audience, especially investor friend thailand abroad. the title talk morning “monetary policy financial sector development policy bank thailand”. i would like share bank thailand’s role support thai economy venture ahead volatile world. this year, would among u fail notice turbulence financial market worldwide. but probably matter shift global economic force lie heart incident. in first part talk, i explore volatility context “new normal” world observe, instance, stagnant growth low inflation. then i discus implication thailand, move policy navigation bank thailand. financial volatility manifest throughout 2015. let briefly recap them: • only month ago, chinese equity market record one-day steep loss 8.5 per cent trillion dollar wipe global equity market within day. the fluctuation shanghai stock index perfectly exemplify market volatility begin year index rise 60 per cent june, collapse 10 per cent loss august. • there also sharp capital outflow emerge markets, result large emerge market currency depreciations. indeed, institute international finance expect capital flow emerge market turn negative first time since 1988. • on commodity front, brent crude oil price plunge 50 dollar per barrel year, peak 110 dollar one year ago. against backdrop, market participant increasingly concern investment business implications. so bring heighten volatility global markets? i attempt answer highlight two key source volatility. in aftermath global financial crisis, unconventional monetary policy – notably successive round quantitative ease – implement major advance economies. this abundant global liquidity contribute largely strong asset price gain high risk appetites. a major central bank pursue policy flood market liquidity, risk compressed, intentionally otherwise. 2 bi central bankers’ speech recently though, despite ample global liquidity, investor grow worry diverge path monetary policy among major central banks. that is, federal reserve feed poise begin tighten phase european central bank, bank japan, people’s bank china likely continue ongoing monetary ease considerable period time. the implication diverge monetary policy stance asset market weigh mind investor around world. a i shall elaborate, probably excess liquidity per se generate turbulence volatility, prospect exit – reversal – so. in near future, global market brace impact feed “lift-off”, lead grow nervousness markets. although prospect interest rate increase feed widely anticipate ever since taper tantrum 2013, uncertainty time possible impact part contribute episode market turbulence year. after eventual lift-off – whenever may – market turn attention pace monetary tighten – rate increases. the shift market expectation pace prompt volatility go forward. hopefully i spoil morning delve deeply volatility. but, let stress this, monetary policy divergence continue underlie source volatility global regional financial markets. however, issue financial market are, means, disconnect real economy. indeed, volatility arise slow recovery, timid growth outlook global economy, so-called “new normal”. look ahead, global economy expect grow subdue pace major advance economy still grapple impact global financial crisis emerge market economy face sluggish exports. many economist begin refer condition “new normal” global economy global growth weak, global merchandise trade shrink commodity price remain low. an important factor behind global dynamic may attribute china’s attempt rebalance economy, emphasis domestic consumption, le investment exports. while china undergo economic transition, slowdown growth rate inevitable. the repercussion china’s transition quite evident collapse commodity prices, leave many emerge market commodity exporter current account deficit massive sharp depreciations. another crucial driver trend “on-shoring” among major economy – lead structural change global supply chain – country like u china seek source input domestically, rather import intermediate good countries. thus, even global growth robust, unlikely emerge market export growth would recover quite strongly. i would certainly remiss i fail mention another potential risk emerge market could impact real economy; rapid buildup emerge market corporate indebtedness. ultra-loose global monetary policy make much easy firm emerge market raise fund – borrow – especially abroad. however, wake tight financial conditions, emerge market firm face great difficulty repay roll debt. in summary, i highlight two key source volatility: first, continue excess liquidity amid diverge monetary policies, along shift market expectation future path monetary policies; second, global economic transition “new normal” steady state. the process ongoing, probably take time – may smooth – new steady state reached. bi central bankers’ speech 3 lady gentlemen, against backdrop volatile “new normal” world, i turn implication thailand. the impact realize financial market real economy. however, i shall elaborate, thai economy strong buff make relatively resilient external shocks. let start look implication financial market exchange rate. in line trend regional currencies, baht’s recent movement largely influence external factors. any eminent signal fed’s initial hikes, worse-than-expected data come china, would prompt capital outflow emerge markets, thereby weigh currency values. significant outflow could tighten finance condition domestic companies, term “cost funds’ “availability funds”. such interplay several risk factor challenge business manager investor alike. however, international investors, like many here, increasingly selective portfolio decision. they long treat emerge market collectively single asset class, show differentiate emerge markets. a such, even though emerge market may generally move direction, actual adjustment across individual market uneven. in context, degree thai baht depreciation rank within middle regional movement – currency also closely track regional peer – level volatility moderate relative peers. this owe much thailand’s sound external position provide cushion volatility global financial markets, shield economy potential undesirable. an economy strong buff could liken car good suspension, could smoothly go bumpy road global financial market volatility. in fact, external stability front, thailand perform well across several metrics. the current account surplus expect top 6 per cent gdp year, amount 26 billion usd. public debt stay rather stable around 43 per cent gdp. our international reserve stand almost 3 time short-term debt, among high region. the non-resident security hold bond market low 10 per cent, stock exchange thailand account around 30 per cent market capitalization. such relatively low level non-resident participation, compare peers, suggest limit exposure future capital flight. corporate sector’s foreign debt also account 13 per cent total corporate debt mid-2015. moreover, external debt concentrate among large corporations. these large firm tend manage exchange rate exposure well, utilize financial hedge instruments. careful risk management practice among thai corporates financial institution make much resilient volatile movement exchange rate. the thai bank system also resilient, high level capital buff stable loan growth, despite deterioration loan quality. bank closely monitor customers, maintain high level loan loss provision buff bad loans. they also well capitalized, capital adequacy ratio 17.3 per cent tier-1 ratio 14.4 per cent, among high asia. this suggest bank system sufficient capital shoulder unexpected loss, accommodate credit expansion. in addition, profitability help enhance capital base time. last least, inflationary pressure stable due substantial fall oil price last year. headline inflation, though currently negative territory, expect gradually rise, turn positive 2016. deflationary risk remain contain demand continue expand, price non-energy item remain stable trend upwards. such inflation trajectory consistent medium-term expectation public bank thailand’s medium-term inflation target. overall, economy financial system show good sign stability resiliency. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let turn implication real economy begin give positive news, is, economy likely register strong growth momentum next year. tourism continue show good prospect number tourist arrival likely exceed 30 million 2016. fiscal stimulus continue key growth driver. public expenditure expect increase 200 billion baht year, provide support economic recovery, especially construction sector. in private sector, sign investment expansion construction, telecommunications, alternative energy, among others. although may see export contraction 2015, resilient spot certain sectors. export clmv economy experience strong growth, continue show great potential thailand could capitalize. in fact, share export clmv total export par share export major trade partner us, europe, japan. thailand’s export u also poise become firm u economy continue see improvement recovery. our export vehicle parts, electronic-appliance part electronics u expand past months, likely continue growth momentum 2016 line u economic recovery. nevertheless, structural limitation still weigh long-term growth. the recovery export sector continue impede shift global trade structure. some product apparel garment see continue decline competitiveness, others fall technological trend. simply put, thai economy like car whose engine need overhaul. we need structural adjustment growth driver enhance competitiveness sustainable economic growth. the private sector need invest new production technology, improve product quality response change global demand consumer preferences. a mohamed a. el-erian, ceo pimco, say “structural challenge require structural responses”.1 in context, welcome many new initiative government stimulate public private investment upgrade thailand’s value chain. with introduction change board investment’s criterion investment privileges, government gear effort promote high value add industries. it also announce special economic zone order facilitate grow network production, trade, service initially neighbor countries. by expedite growth-enhancing infrastructure development increase ease businesses, government also help promote crowding-in private investment. fiscal reform also pipeline order boost efficiency public spending, revenue collection, public administration. reform state enterprise also vital upgrade country’s growth potential manage strategic asset country, account large share public capital expenditure. all all, car need engine overhaul. the government’s recent initiative form important part uplift car’s engine. in meantime, i assure good suspension system get bumpy road market volatility ahead. lady gentlemen, at juncture – thailand go multi-dimensional reform – bank thailand part safeguard stability, support economic recovery, facilitate long-term structural reforms. 1 el-erian, mohamed a. “navigating new normal industrial countries.” per jacobsson foundation lecture. 10 oct. 2010. web. <https://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2010/101010.htm#p12_100>. bi central bankers’ speech 5 there three main element policy navigation i would like share morning. first, bank thailand ensure ample liquidity system order accommodate economic recovery. a policy normalization feed imminent, risk liquidity withdrawal emerge market increases. we anticipate limit impact overall thai economy market price fed’s initial hike. besides, widely expect feed fund rate would rise gradually on. a now, despite slow economic growth thailand, overall credit private sector continue expand around 5 per cent. furthermore, enterprise issue sizable amount corporate bonds, leverage low yield compare last year. commercial banks’ liquidity position stable. all indication favorable domestic finance conditions. should sudden reversal scenario occurs, bank thailand would make sure liquidity become impediment economic recovery. the bank thailand also ensure “cost funds” accommodative ongoing recovery. the two pre-emptive cut policy interest rate early year, response great downside risk growth, ease domestic cost funds. in addition, low inflationary pressure give room monetary policy remain accommodative. this would ensure overall monetary condition conducive economic recovery. nevertheless, keep cautious eye risk financial stability, especially prolong low interest rate environment. household debt, although stabilized, remain high relation gdp. we continue monitor ass impact low interest rate search yield long-term save behavior. we also vigilant pocket risk may destabilize effect economy, real estate sector. let turn bank thailand’s plan handle increase volatility foreign exchange, second element policy navigation. a matter fact, certain degree foreign exchange flexibility desirable economy allow foreign exchange act shock absorber facilitate real economic adjustments. with weak outlook growth across emerge market economies, expect fed’s policy rate hike, many emerge market currencies, include thai baht, depreciated. in case thailand, relatively strong external financial position well-managed foreign exchange risk exposure public private sector alike, risk substantial foreign exchange debt exposure currently contained. in addition, part capital account liberalization master plan, bank thailand announce early year relaxation capital flow measure bid promote balance fund flows, great flexibility foreign exchange markets. a global financial market continue volatile near term, bank thailand thus remain focus mitigate short-term excessive exchange rate volatility cushion impact would domestic financial conditions, consequently real economy. in long term, however, demand-management macroeconomic policy – fiscal monetary – cannot use address structural problem successfully. a such, bank thailand also gear towards financial sector development order facilitate country’s long-term structural reforms. financial sector development third element policy navigation. the financial sector master plan phase iii aim “competitive, inclusive, connected, sustainable” financial sector. our vision competitive thai financial sector support diverse need fair undistorted price, promote regional trade investments, maintain safety soundness economy financial system. today i hope share highlight key milestones. 6 bi central bankers’ speech five year now, i foresee thai financial landscape look different today, digital bank electronic payment transactions, increase competition nonbanks foreign players. the landscape also contain innovative fintech company provide alternative solution service provider user data analytics, crowd funding, product price comparison services. ultimately, competition increase financial access, low transaction cost economy whole. the bank thailand focus development infrastructure standards, ensure rule regulation clear supportive innovation efficiency. the new payment system act unify relevant regulation currently specify different law enforce various different agencies. in addition, bank thailand support government’s initiative promote nation-wide electronic payment system, including, instance, development “any id” payment infrastructure, promotion debit card usage payment transfer welfare benefits. on connectivity, establishment qualify asean banks, qabs, allow thai bank expand regionally, welcome foreign bank region conduct business thailand. bilateral negotiation several country plan i expect arrangement make end next year. the bank thailand collaborate central bank region promotion local currency settlement trade investments. the appointment cross-currency dealer act clear agent baht ringgit do first quarter next year, negotiation country ongoing. we conscious rule regulation may hind development regional trade investments, work carefully remove obstacle without compromise stability objective. the joint initiative government bank thailand regard treasury center generate interest among large company apply license. these treasury center purchase sell foreign currency hedge instrument company within groups, thereby aid foreign exchange liquidity risk management. multinational companies, well large thai corporation overseas branches, could similarly benefit low transaction cost improve liquidity management. on top tax incentive offer board investment, international headquarter establish thailand eligible provide financial management service affiliate companies, grant treasury center license. rule regulation also need keep innovation order ensure safety reliability financial system, maintain confidence public. to end, bank thailand give full responsibility regulation supervision specialize financial institution sfis, amount around 22 per cent thai financial institutions’ assets. in perform roles, bank thailand apply internationally accept principle standard take account mission, mandate, current condition sfi. the ultimate goal ensure safety, sustainability soundness sfis’ operations, perform core duty long-term benefit thai society. lady gentlemen, it clear world currently change fast. the global economy enter new normal environment. indeed, expect experience great volatility world transition new steady state. look ahead, must fear volatility, mindful associate risk way manage them. so far, robust cushions, thailand fare well external shock compare emerge market economies. this mean complacent. bi central bankers’ speech 7 our country need reform address long-term structural problems, similar powerful engine, enable u reach destination faster. fortunately, though, economy currently equip strong buffers, similar robust suspension system car, smooth ride bumpy roads. lady gentlemen, let assure bank thailand part ensure stable resilient macroeconomic landscape. we accommodate changes, especially financial system, put thailand strong foot competitive position. i confident thailand ride forward much powerful engine deserves. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 minouche shafik: tread carefully speech m minouche shafik, deputy governor market bank bank england, institute directors, london, 14 december 2015. * * * i would especially like thank grellan mcgrath help analysis evidence speech. comment alex haberis, andrew hauser, gareth ramsay, jon relleen, matt waldron, martin weale jam talbot also gratefully acknowledged. introduction in likely first monetary policymaker, i would like begin speech today chart depth tread car tyre – measure busy tyre fit station uk i recently visit south east. generally speaking, deep groove tyre, good grip, performance safety. when recession hit 2008, people begin delay replace tyres, implicitly accept deterioration quality hope save cost (chart 1). what surprising, however, although seventh year recovery, frequency driver replace tyre return pre-crisis levels. this illustrate quite nicely although economy thankfully return normal, cannot blithely assume relationship hold past automatically revert. several stylise fact macroeconomics – idea deep recession follow strong recoveries, idea productivity rely upon increase time around long-standing trend – long since disproven nature recovery uk. and question remain economy operate wake great recession make set monetary policy challenging. in rest speech i would like put forward think one approach decision take face uncertainty. i highlight three themes: proceed caution, consider outcome retain flexibility. i member monetary policy committee, though note follow view may necessarily represent view committee whole. i don’t think member place quite much weight tyre tread depth indicator, probably wouldn’t thank deem bellweather interest rate decision future. 1. proceed caution it 81 month since bank rate cut current level 0.5%. it take lot hard work since generate recovery experiencing. i mean quite literally: weakness productivity witness mean much growth far generate increase hour work rather increase output per hour worked. participation labour force increase recent years, average hour work per week. have demonstrate flexibility, fit people begin enjoy benefit increase real wage growth. for comparison, follow 1990s recession bank rate stay trough 7 month increase again, equivalent number follow 1980s recession 6 months. indeed one look solely measure real economy relative value previous tighten cycle began, would expect mpc already begin raise rate (chart 2). and i must admit get gentle rib dinner table i come home monthly mpc meet say i vote change bank rate again. “all work decide nothing!” say children. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but good reason bank rate remain low long time. first among absolute level bank rate matters, relative “equilibrium” rate would maintain demand line supply economy keep inflation close target. the size nature shock accompany financial crisis mean equilibrium level fell dramatically 2008–09. so far, fact, even cut bank rate record low 0.5% enough prevent unemployment rate rising. and order head deterioration economy, mpc embark programme quantitative ease (qe) design support economy. in total, mpc purchase £375 billion government bond scheme call asset purchase facility (apf). the persistence shock effect – include need ongoing fiscal consolidation, high level household indebtedness, subsequent event euro area – mean equilibrium rate probably recover gradually. and i note point least recovery equilibrium rate likely match fade stimulus qe.1 the second reason reasonable bank rate increase already relationship real economy inflation one would expected: chart 2 show real variable – unemployment – beyond level bank rate raise past, nominal variable – wage growth inflation – below. for example, despite unemployment decline three percentage point peak 2008, headline inflation fall five percentage point period record low –0.1%. this inverse one would expect base simply historical negative correlation inflation unemployment.2 of course much weakness inflation due movement commodity price exchange rate. since 2008 learn movement exchange rate, particular, affect inflation. contrary body literature develop period great stability, change exchange rate large persistent effect inflation effect import prices. that mean 18% appreciation sterling begin early 2013 (as prospect uk economy improve relative trade partners) currently exert significant downward pressure inflation likely continue exert downward pressure several year come low import cost pas supply chain. but weakness inflation explain price thing import – portion3 current deviation target due weakness domestically generate inflation. the big domestic driver inflation labour cost per unit output, order generate inflation target medium term, wage would ordinarily need grow 2 3 percentage point quickly productivity growth. the data noisy, period since recovery began, wedge – know unit wage cost – average 1% (chart 3). of course much period weakness wage relative productivity consistent presence slack labour market. but something puzzle start emerge 2014 – despite significant narrow slack – wage growth 1 a time pass effect early tranche asset purchase level output diminishes. the peak impact gdp asset purchase probably occur 2013. since then, support level activity asset purchase likely waning. at time, value £375bn stock purchase asset decline relative nominal gdp (from 22.5% 20.1%) latter increased. 2 over period 1971 2008 correlation unemployment inflation –0.2. 3 a best tell around ½ percentage point. bi central bankers’ speech 3 seem slow pick up. the early sign 2015 would promising, rate wage growth seem level recent data. wage data volatile short run, recent pause may prove noise signal. but several plausible explanation wage growth might level recently. • the first quite simply number hour work per person per week level recent data, even start decline. this could temporary flatten effect growth rate wage earn per week. • the second nature growth employment seen. it unusually skew towards employee le experience educational attainment occupation tend attract low level pay. these compositional effect tend push start salaries, though shouldn’t affect future wage growth prospects. • a third explanation, one hear bank’s network agents, low level headline inflation may limit upward pressure pay case relatively small nominal pay award sufficient increase real incomes. if important factor, lag headline inflation determination pay award mean could increase persistence weak wage growth time come. this ultimately fade effect energy exchange rate inflation dissipate. • a fourth potential explanation severity recession increase uncertainty accompany last impact decision people take tradeoff make – seem do market tyres. it may be, example, recession still reasonably fresh memories, worker marginally reluctant push kind pay settlement would use 2008, marginally le will take step switch employer order gain high salary. in decide vote monetary policy meet month, i look across wide range indicators. there many sign economy normalise – labour market tightening, consumption growth solid, investment recovering, even productivity growth show tentative sign return. and although downward pressure inflation movement energy price exchange rate prove persistent, permanent effect inflation. but, residual uncertainty relationship real economy inflation – something economist refer “model uncertainty” – instance augur caution set monetary policy.4 the likely outcome wage growth soon resume recovery, alternative state world take long happen. so i judge prudent tread carefully, refrain vote increase bank rate i convince wage growth sustain level consistent inflation return target. 4 the effect uncertainty set monetary policy much discussed. brainard (1967) show policymakers uncertain effect action economy, appropriate move cautiously impact policy certain – strategy know gradualism. data uncertainty another reason policymakers may adopt gradualist approach. one common find data noisier, le aggressive response desirable (rudebusch, 2001; orphanides, 2003). in addition, recently, evans et al (2015) argue delay lift-off face uncertainty strength recovery, give view asymmetric cost associate zero low bound. however, find policy respond gradually face uncertainty general one. for example, söderström (2002) suggest uncertainty monetary policy’s ability return inflation medium term, may call pre-emptive response. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 2. consider outcome in presence uncertainty, wise put one’s egg one basket, rather hedge undesirable state world. that something market participant know well, mean financial asset price reflect think likely outcome, also full range possible outcome probability attach them. so imply literal interpretation market – include government bond interest rate swap market – necessarily true reflection participant expect go happen.5 for example, time produce november inflation report, market yield curve imply first increase bank rate would come march 2017, would reach 1¼% end 2018. a literal interpretation would suggest 33 come 36 month majority mpc member would return home respective dinner table report vote change bank rate.6 an alternative interpretation true expectation market participant bank rate increase quickly that, particularly worry downside risk happy accept low expect return exchange insurance bad outcomes.7 this would consistent risk world economy come fore past year emerge economy grapple twin challenge transition slow potential output growth low commodity prices. although direct trade link emerge economy uk relatively small, indirect effect dramatic emerge market slowdown confidence financial channel could significant. i suspect latter interpretation close reality. personally speaking, downside risk world economy fail materialise, absent shocks, wage growth return level consistent inflation return target i would expect economy warrant path bank rate increase quickly imply market yield curve use condition november inflation report. i think interest note survey economic forecaster – direct measure expect future path interest rate – show expectation fast pace increase bank rate. have say that, i think agents, member mpc, expect future path gradual limited. 3. retain flexibility of course one never know exactly future holds. so time come raise bank rate, important retain flexibility change course need be, either tighten policy quickly originally envisage prepare loosen again. be require respond unforeseen events, mpc would two tool immediate disposal: bank rate qe. past experience give u good dataset gain understand change policy rate transmit economy. base rich literature international estimate period since inflation target began, peak impact inflation generally estimate occur lag 18 24 months, although begin 5 see shafik (2015) broadbent (2015) issue. 6 though propose legislation pass, number mpc meet per year reduce 12 8, line recommendation warsh review (warsh, 2014) 7 the market curve represent mean price distribution interest rates. consideration risk cause whole distribution move relative true expectations. risk also affect shape distribution, though dison elliot (2015) find shape distribution currently heavily influence proximity bank rate effective low bound. bi central bankers’ speech 5 effect within first year. comparison u uk indicate transmission mechanism may bite quick uk us, perhaps reflect prevalence long term fix rate mortgage us. however, estimate generally base experience change policy rate positive – relatively little know transmission negative interest rate begin use quite recently part europe. a qe, confident effective reduce severity impact financial crisis. for example analysis bank staff suggest qe peak impact level real gdp around 2.5%,8 help limit long term impact recession economy. however, knowledge qe affect economy base learn use since 2009 – much limit sample available change bank rate. and may well use different circumstance effect could quite different. in light uncertainty transmission unconventional monetary policies, mpc express preference use bank rate marginal instrument monetary policy time come tighten. specifically, say expect reduce stock qe either outright sale cease reinvestment principal bank rate reach level materially cut. choose focus part tighten cycle solely bank rate margin imply fast increase would case combine tighten via reduction stock qe well. this likely give u ability respond adverse shock use bank rate rather tool inherently le flexible le familiar. base past experience, mpc currently judge level bank rate would provide room material reduction around 2%. a chart 4 shows, 67 106 loosen cycle since bank found 1694 achieve reduce bank rate 2 percentage point less. you could argue case choose level high “around 2%”. to so, however, would extend horizon would expect reach level, implication extend horizon stock qe would hold behalf mpc. give gradual pace equilibrium rate may rise, extension could long. it never intention mpc retain indefinitely stock asset purchase part qe.9 be so, risk maintain large stock government debt monetary policy tool might blur external perception distinction monetary fiscal policy. that could lead doubt independence pursue objective price stability, would represent significant step backward. decision stock gild hold apf always make solely mpc sole pursuit monetary policy objective mandate parliament always remain case. central bank independence show bring great economic benefit form low stable inflation – result stand test financial crisis something treasure. 10 8 joyce, m, tong, m woods, r (2011), “the unite kingdom’s quantitative ease policy: design, operation impact”, bank england quarterly bulletin, vol. 51, no. 3, page 200–12. 9 for example, 2009 letter chancellor request mpc able use asset purchase facility monetary policy purposes, governor, mervyn king say “at future date, i would expect mpc would wish exit strategy buy asset would wish reduce amount asset hold asset purchase facility.” 10 see example alesina summer (1993), klomp de haan (2009) king (2013). 6 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion let sum up. we still learn post-crisis economy behaves, relationship data prove slow reassert may changed. the recent plateau wage growth despite ongoing recovery one example, i wait i convince wage growth sustain level consistent inflation return target vote increase bank rate. in sense, i proceed caution. but i convinced, absent shocks, i see bank rate rise quickly path imply market curve time last inflation report. that say i don’t understand shape yield curve – market participant must consider possible outcome make decisions, yield curve could weigh worry world. whatever outcome, important maintain flexibility respond new data events. the flexibility mpc pursue target independently since 1997 bring great benefits. the mpc also show flexibility develop new instrument qe achieve goals. similarly, monetary policy begin tighten, mpc focus bank rate marginal tool monetary policy, give it’s flexible nature qe. and occasionally, might also consider tyre tread depth, see post crisis economy revert pre-crisis pattern whether need think future bite differently. bi

world economy enter unusually uncertain turbulent period. the recovery follow crisis progress surprisingly slowly many countries, european monetary union periodically expose major strain currently great number question surround development china several emerge market economies, name examples. when storm rag around you, major advantage travel reliable robust vessel. in term economy, often mean well-designed economic policy framework clear credible grind rule provide robustness stability. i would argue swedish economy vessel long time now, highly beneficial us, longer-term perspective well financial crisis. it evident swedish economy currently regard fairly stable study difference long-term yield relation germany. this difference small almost twenty years, occasionally even negative (see figure 1). when compare situation previously, difference quite striking. fundamental reform 1990s crisis provide stability this something many respect thank crisis begin 1990s for. the lindbeck commission, appoint december 1992, note swedish crisis 1990s result unlucky combination international economic downturn, overly generous lend individual policy errors, fact much deep roots.1 in assessment large extent “political institutional crisis”, expose weakness way political system worked. what mean underlie “systemic error” swedish economy – built-in bias towards systematically overly expansionary economic policy, mean chronic problem excessively high inflation, recur cost crisis grow national debt. the lindbeck commission therefore advocate policy follow certain predetermine principles, “rule-based” policy.2 several important institutional structural change implement connection crisis follow year create great stability sustainability economic policy. one comprehensive reform monetary policy directly focus keep inflation low stable, instead of, previously, indirectly maintain fix exchange rate. sweden thereby become one first country adopt inflation targeting. the price stability target late write law interest rate decision delegate independent executive board. another important change creation fiscal policy framework amend budget process. this framework new process aim get grip evolution public expenditure also lead 1 the economic commission (1993). 2 a debate take place point. the swedish centre business policy study (sns) advocate so-called norm-based stabilisation policy since 1985, see heikensten vredin (2012) overview. 2 bi central bankers’ speech average surplus term net lending. the overall aim ensure fiscal policy would desire long-term orientation. flexible inflation target preferable – improvement rule but even though change make swedish economy reliable resilient shocks, affect event past years. the global financial crisis surprisingly low inflation mean number previously accept truth begin call question, lead debate whether economic policy framework develop prior financial crisis modify potentially even replaced. my view completely clear: important u think carefully make comprehensive change swedish economic policy frameworks. we know little world look like future, careful casually abandon something essentially work well. it easy forget previous problem time passes, take grant certain thing simply working. this dangerous approach, however, lead setbacks. dismantle framework do quickly, build one take long time often involve major adjustment costs. in term monetary policy framework, i convince flexible inflation target pursue riksbank central bank today continue effective approach foreseeable future. this mean, however, i oppose form change necessarily think everything remain exactly today. if want something endure, must prepare change it. to continue metaphor i use beginning: important constantly maintain vessel make adjustment improvement require keep function well, even new circumstances.3 i would today like highlight area swedish monetary policy framework grind open discussion, base experience gather twenty year inflation targeting.4 it perhaps mainly experience gain financial crisis increase need serious discussion. if discussion eventually conclude appropriate make certain change within area i raise, would drastic consequence monetary policy framework such. rather, would mean adjustment improvement could accommodate well within exist framework flexible inflation targeting. before i continue, i would like underscore one important thing: member executive board always give view speeches. the idea i express therefore entirely own. the issue i raise issue executive board discuss on, ongoing discussion yet draw conclusions. what i say therefore interpret riksbank's official view issues. i would like highlight two aspect monetary policy framework – target variable potential interval, band, surround target. 3 in canada, work formalise monetary policy framework review every five years. this result “inflation-control agreement” bank canada government. 4 the evaluation swedish monetary policy marvin goodfriend mervyn king behalf committee finance (riksdagen, 2014), assess different area monetary policy framework, undoubtedly stimulate discussion. this evaluation present january. bi central bankers’ speech 3 important follow international debate one aspect debate great deal sweden internationally, i intend highlight here, level inflation target. that issue recently discuss quite thoroughly colleagues, i much add.5 i would like say briefly go discus change target level, i, like colleagues, great sympathy argument international debate central bank raise inflation target argument swedish debate inflation target lowered. the main reason motive usually state main justification rise – target low, inflation expectation permanently low reason, policy rate hit low limit often long periods.6 this mean monetary policy future would find hard counteract recession. however, early today draw conclusion 2 per cent low level inflation target, discussion need continue.7 nor i intend say anything issue debate sweden internationally whether monetary policy use actively attempt counteract accumulation financial imbalances. i also intend comment principally international debate whether inflation target really best monetary policy framework, whether target nominal gdp would preferable, example. a i already mentioned, i think flexible inflation target preferable framework, foreseeable future. in general, however, important u follow fairly intense international discussion monetary policy best conducted. we want avoid end rush home-cooked solution eventually regret find difficult change. however, area i focus – target variable potential interval – primarily refer swedish debate thing ought able change, wish to, without risk major negative consequences. the target variable let therefore begin discuss target variable. since inflation target introduce january 1993, formulate term consumer price index, cpi. the reason cpi choose target variable mainly due fact was, still is, well-known measure price development sweden. the cpi also advantage include large part household consumption, publish regularly well-known statistical properties. however, use cpi target variable occasionally lead number pedagogical difficulties, least recent times. the reason household mortgage rate include cpi. for example, riksbank low interest rate bring inflation up, mortgage rate fall. the short-term effect cpi therefore head “wrong direction”, is, interest rate cut make inflation fall (see figure 2). 5 see, example, skingsley (2015) flodén (2015). 6 when inflation target low, say, 1 0 per cent, inflation vary around level. the nominal interest rate also low average low target. the low interest rate normal conditions, le scope low hit low limit long use stimulate economy. another problem permanently low inflation prove difficult low nominal wage practice, difficult adjust real wage individual company different sectors. 7 simulation dorich, labelle, lepetyuk mend (2015) use model canadian economy indicate target 2 per cent lead result almost good target raise 3 4 per cent, give policy rate complement quantitative ease well active credible support communication. 4 bi central bankers’ speech major direct impact interest rate change make swedish cpi unique this direct impact interest rate change inflation quite unique sweden. the reason effect include household mortgage cost cpi slightly different way country inflation targets. more specifically, attempt measure households’ cost live owner-occupied property, interest expenditure important component.8 the cpi calculate accord roughly principle canada, example, practice interest rate change much small impact cpi sweden.9 in australia new zealand, interest rate change also previously major direct impact cpi, method calculate cpi change country end 1990s way eliminate effects.10 they apply method principally base follow price development new housing, so-called net acquisition approach. in countries, example unite state norway, cost owner-occupied house approximate cost rent comparable property – far le affect interest rate changes. in euro area unite kingdom, target formulate term hicp index (harmonised index consumer prices) include cost owner-occupied housing, operate costs.11 a swedish cpi inflation characteristic, riksbank has, since introduction inflation target, calculate several different measure inflation also regularly let inflation index cpi guide interest rate decisions. the price index play big role recent year cpif, cpi fix interest rate. unlike cpi, cpif directly affect change mortgage rates. cpif inflation, energy price also discount times, function “steering” variable way riksbank normally aim close 2 per cent within forecast horizon. major interest rate change lead substantial long-term effect cpi despite this, target formulate term cpi. a interest rate sometimes go sometimes down, idea difference inflation accord cpi cpif level time. the long-run average two inflation measure same, riksbank aim stabilise cpif inflation around 2 per cent cpi inflation average also end target. deviation measure expect great lasting, occasionally differ cpi inflation far target, could deal clear communication riksbank. so think least. however, even though “long term” case long dead, paraphrase keynes, long enough difference cpi cpif pose problems. interest rate development past year lead major deviation cpi cpif, upwards downwards (see figure 3). the period cut begin december 2011, currently long continuous period 8 see johansson (2015) description interest rate change impact swedish cpi review method use measure cost owner-occupied house different countries. 9 see palmqvist (2013). 10 see reserve bank australia (1998) reserve bank new zealand (1999). 11 in 2003 unite kingdom decide rename hicp cpi. the eu's statistic office eurostat currently investigate possibility include owner-occupied house cost hicp line net acquisition model, unclear whether happen. it worth point – background proposal take rise house price account inflation measure – change house price method limit impact index, impact all. how monetary policy affect change house price (or asset prices) therefore issue must principally handle separately actual measure inflation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 interest-rate cut since inflation target introduced, contribute cpi inflation fall substantially cpif inflation remain near zero three years. correspondingly, cpi inflation push upwards exceed target repo rate approach historically normal level future. an extremely low rate increase cpi inflation therefore tend follow sooner late unusually high rate increase, period sometimes relatively protracted. this could look something like figure 4, example. one could say major, protract interest rate movement lead substantial long-term surge cpi inflation – substantial long-term previously believe would case. risk mislead image uncertainty inflation target this cause difficulties, likely continue future, least term monetary policy communication. one problem focus cpi inflation – entirely unnatural – lead flashy headline medium time time year sweden state deflation. when cpi inflation negative, obviously correct purely technical sense, story behind headline often fail explain large extent result riksbank low interest rate, cpif inflation typically considerably higher. foreign commentator particular therefore often come conclusion swedish economy highly critical situation state real economy deflationist well, weak growth production employment. it cannot rule either kind medium report can, least extent, affect economic sentiment. it course unfortunate kind mislead image take hold simply swedish cpi calculate way is. a potentially serious problem even cpif inflation reasonably close 2 per cent, formal target variable, cpi inflation, could relatively far target fairly long period time. even upward downward deviation level really long term, could long period cpi inflation deviate target – long enough risk confidence inflation target shaken. to put differently, participant economy could begin question whether riksbank truly also stabilise cpi inflation around target stabilise cpif inflation around 2 per cent. and would fairly good grind so, base past event also look ahead. if assume figure 4 cpif inflation continue around 2 per cent 2018, cpi inflation would overshoot target long time, base reasonable assumption development repo rate. even repo rate continue rise level consider normal crisis, instead slow average 2.3 per cent see period 1998–2015, cpi inflation would overshoot target around five year total. if repo rate continue rise, would take even longer, thing equal, cpi inflation return 2 per cent.12 of course problematic formal target variable deviate target long periods, even result conscious policy. time start discussion target variable set background, belief may time open discussion target variable. one option, i personally find appeal fairly natural, face consequence allow inflation measure upon interest rate change direct impact “steering” variable also target variable. the index come mind first case cpif hicp. one 12 the exact course policy rate path obviously crucial term much long cpi inflation deviate cpif inflation. a policy rate rise implement quickly leads, thing equal, great brief deviation equally large protract policy rate rise. 6 bi central bankers’ speech advantage latter index internationally comparable measure, difference compare cpif quantitatively particularly large. it worth point would lead practice particularly major change monetary policy. after all, riksbank already typically aim cpif inflation rate around 2 per cent within forecast horizon. it also worth emphasise purpose change target variable would make easy riksbank hit inflation target. that would hopefully positive side-effect, main purpose would rectify problem cpi target variable gradually become evident. naturally, change target variable must precede thorough analysis replacement would take place consequence could potentially have. my aim simply highlight issue initiate discussion. of course, new target variable would solve every problem measure riksbank would look at. we would need continue analyse different measure inflation get complete picture possible. for instance, oil prices, energy price general, often vary greatly, reason many occasion study inflation measure price excluded. however, i believe big problem would still solve interest expenditure exclude target variable all. before i continue, i would like make comment target variable relation wage formation. this connect assertion significance interest expenditure cpi mean extremely low rate increase cpi inflation tend follow sooner late unusually high rate increase. a seen, period also fairly protracted. if wage formation place lot focus current level cpi inflation, i see risk could create instability wage formation system. a situation similar one 1970s 80 could ultimately occur, whereby wage development vary substantially year year depend current inflation rate, also vary extensively. it would therefore good wage formation base le volatile inflation measure cpi inflation.13 a new monetary policy target variable could hopefully take role. a band surround target when general council riksbank decide introduce inflation target 2 per cent january 1993, also decide tolerance band surround target 1 percentage point below.14 the aim clarify riksbank ability control inflation exactly short term, also aim limit deviation target – intend “tolerate” deviation great 1 percentage point. the size interval determine intuitively appear reasonable. it possible rely past experience monetary policy regime entirely new inflation vary considerably old regime fix exchange rate. the riksbank expect inflation would vary less, unsure much. 13 it could argue wage formation base inflation always 2 per cent, period target cancel long term. however, inflation deviate significantly target long time, difficult wage setter stick this. therefore, wage formation would facilitate inflation target formulate term cpif hicp inflation rather term cpi inflation. 14 until 1999, executive board established, monetary policy decision make general council riksbank. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the interval remain part monetary policy framework long time, finally abolish 2010. the reason riksbank assess time fulfil role serve practical function. in memorandum publish connection decision, note that: “there considerable understand fact inflation commonly deviate target deviation sometimes large 1 percentage point. inflation thus outside tolerance interval without threaten credibility inflation target. such deviation prove natural part monetary policy.”15 so year passed, may justify evaluate period interval. personally, i entirely sure trouble-free riksbank expected, even though i think decision remove interval quite natural taken. debate interval – different kind before? the question whether inflation target surround interval recently gain attention swedish debate. there appear differ view function interval would fulfil, however. the previous tolerance band first foremost pedagogical tool intend illustrate must accept certain, though large, deviation inflation target 2 per cent – point target riksbank always aim for. the interval number commentator advocate recently appear different kind, however. they would prefer could call target range, word target 2 percentage point wide exact figure.16 a target range imply monetary policy focus inflation fall within range 1–3 per cent within couple years, requirement reach midpoint interval. inflation 1 per cent marginally 3 per cent equivalent inflation 2 per cent. if tolerance band, inflation 1 per cent, 3 per cent, instead would “tolerable” unforeseen event mean inflation end there, would something consciously aim for. the idea many commentator seem target range would mean riksbank would feel le force bring inflation 2 per cent, turn would mean monetary policy would need expansionary risk link policy could mitigated. difficult pursue another policy even interval i would like point here, without comment pro con target range general terms, idea appear base part misunderstand motif behind riksbank’s policy. the reason riksbank eager get inflation rise rigid fixation achieve exactly 2 per cent inflation time. it due fact period inflation target gradually become longer, long-term inflation expectation show fall trend still remain target. for reason i note moment ago discuss level inflation target – interest rate hit low limit easily become difficult counteract recession – important avoid inflation inflation expectation fall far get stick level low. this would case even target range 1–3 per cent. inflation inflation expectation creep downwards get stick near low limit range could 15 the riksbank (2010). 16 see example fromlet (2015) lars jonung svenska dagbladet (2015). 8 bi central bankers’ speech problematic inflation target lowered. it thus difficult see riksbank would pursue notably different policy even target range, would grind adjust current policy target range introduce tomorrow.17 this probably also reason central bank country formal target range, canada new zealand, usually aim midpoint range.18 after all, safe way prevent inflation inflation expectation begin slide range attempt keep middle it. in sense, great practical difference target range point target tolerance band. interval good illustrate uncertainty i believe still grind discuss whether swedish monetary policy framework complement kind interval. a i see it, main reason would remind people monetary policy pursue considerable uncertainty, riksbank able fine-tune economy inflation. it could see paradoxical needed, justification interval remove widespread understand case. my impression, however, linger perception monetary policy tool relatively high level precision thing manage use well-calibrated policy rate changes. in discussion monetary policy, many seem assume relatively precise relation interest rate, inflation unemployment, perspective receive much empirical support. this something riksbank probably contribute somewhat, analysis report could give impression. for example, use regularly present different interest rate scenario monetary policy report base effect policy rate change economy inflation calculate relatively mechanically seemingly good precision. the fact effect monetary policy surround major uncertainty cannot calculate good precision something probably need remind people le constantly, case interval useful. the obvious approach case would perhaps reintroduce tolerance band around inflation target. if route chosen, important course give practical significance fulfil kind function, contrast interval remove 2010. one possibility could riksbank undertake explain special report inflation end outside interval whenever occur – roughly way bank england write open letter chancellor exchequer. on one hand, could lead deviation outside band see slightly dramatic, hand could also make deviation within interval le dramatic. i believe latter would advantage see background i say monetary policy able fine-tune inflation. naturally also important breadth band match variation inflation meaningful way. it could question whether case previous tolerance 17 one possibility could long-term inflation expectation would anchor good interval. the debate target deviation could possibly le intense example, turn could lead small fall expectations. this far certain, however. 2 per cent represent clear guideline term target interval, regardless whether interval target tolerance interval, inflation far low limit long time expectation would likely severely affect case. 18 the bank canada aim inflation “at 2 per cent midpoint target range 1 3 per cent medium term”, reserve bank new zealand aim get inflation near “the 2 percent target midpoint” average. bi central bankers’ speech 9 band. it worth emphasise choice target variable important choose breadth band. a reflection figure 3 interval 1–3 per cent would much good suit target variable upon interest rate change direct effect – say cpif hicp inflation – case cpi inflation. the period outside interval measure short-lived deviation smaller. a number report would still need written, would few cpi, would contain meaningful explanation inflation outside tolerance band households' interest expenditure cpi influence riksbank's alter repo rate. but – aim mainly contribute discussion. how interval would designed, whether one, something course need look into. however, also change i believe could make without turn monetary policy framework inside out. the policy inflation target need fixing, potentially improve let briefly summarise i say today. one important message is: “if it’s broken, don’t try fix it!”. in eagerness bring change, often damage good. the aspect i believe break therefore need fix policy flexible inflation targeting, recent decade develop something international standard. this say i think without problem cannot improved. i highlight couple area i believe grind consideration far sweden concerned. one target variable, case i believe consider change index upon policy rate change major direct impact cpi. another interval surround target. the main reason consider reintroduction interval need constantly remind people monetary policy pursue significant uncertainty riksbank able fine-tune economy inflation. i look forward continue discussion issues. 10 bi central bankers’ speech

end speech. distinguish guests, 1. when central banks, u fed, cut short-term policy interest rate near zero create money massive scale purchase bond financial assets, call quantitative ease (qe). 2. it six year since launch qe 2009. after spend total us$3.9 trillion purchase bonds, feed wrap asset purchase programme october 2014. in 10 days’ time, feed decide whether lift interest rates. if does, signal begin normalisation u interest rates. “qe” ineffectual? 3. at end 2009, i initiate guess game several chief economist major commercial investment banks. the question i ask expect feed exit qe. most bet second quarter 2010 earlier. the dovish say q3 2010. a know now, guess wildly mark. to fair, i don’t think anyone expect u recovery slow sluggish. 4. indeed, global financial crisis, u suffer bad recession since great depression 1930s. in desperate bid stave recession, u literally move mountains, include introduce unprecedented qe policy splash us$1.8 trillion 2008 2010 cut tax implement fiscal policy measure prop economy. however, see chart 1, current recovery weak economic cycle past 55 years. the average growth rate 2.2%, half average rate 4.6% previous recovery cycles. (chart 1) 5. a employment, u lose total 8.7 million job financial crisis recession, unemployment rate peak 10%. although employment bottom 2010, 13 million job create since then, represent 4.3 million job compare peak eight year ago early 2008, way behind 8.8 million people add labour force period. in words, u unemployment rate decline 5% recently, mean labour market fully recovered. one main reason faster-than-expected drop unemployment rate dwindle labour force participation rate, average 66% 2007 current 62.4%, low since 1977. this partly explain feeble economic recovery decline potential gdp growth trend u (chart 2). 6. the weak recovery u recent year fell outside expectation many economist fed. because lacklustre growth, qe extend expanded, feed addiction “low long”, “low longer” “low forever”, develop dependence qe market. when feed chairman ben bernanke hint possibility scale asset purchase programme may 2013, market panic episode late call “taper tantrum”. 7. so, present recovery weak previous cycles? this complicate controversial subject. i believe cyclical factor structural factors, household de-leveraging, high home inventory level burst house bubble structural change population labour market, play. 2 bi central bankers’ speech external factor also involved, include european sovereign debt crisis 2011. however, due time constraints, i focus qe may support u economic recovery affect global financial environment. 8. the prevail mainstream view, include major advance economy us, europe japan, well international monetary fund, qe right policy response prop economy stave deflation. they think push interest rate near zero pump large amount money bank system give rise follow positive chain effect – (a) interest expense borrowers, include individuals, corporation governments, reduced; (b) low interest rate central bank scoop low-risk sovereign bonds, investor resort equities, property asset search high yields; (c) asset price rise result, create positive wealth effect spur consumption investment; (d) consumption investment will, turn, stimulate employment. 9. since consensus zero interest rate environment qe right prescription, recovery prove weak expected, natural diagnosis treatment short dosage insufficient, lead expansion qe long period. indeed, case european central bank, treatment go far introduce negative interest rates. be qe panacea side effects? 10. while benefits, flip side qe. i share view economist effectiveness qe partly offset adverse side effect zero interest rate prolongation. here six side effect may possibly arise. 11. first, foremost, zero interest rate qe inflict big loss saver individuals, fund institution reliant interest incomes. deposit rate u drop 3 percentage point average 3.5% 2007. a interest income approach zero mark, many depositors, especially low- medium-income household retiree cut spending. and, say “a saver’s loss borrower’s gain”, case every borrower. for example, negative equity bad credit scores, many u family stick hefty mortgage rates. in hong kong, deposit rate also drop 2 percentage point since 2007. with total deposit hk$10 trillion currently bank system, may wish think potential loss savers. 12. secondly, u family still process de-leveraging global financial crisis result, growth consumer demand remain lukewarm. on corporate front, notwithstanding low borrow costs, many u company reluctant invest domestically expand capacity enhance productivity. in fact, annual growth business investment u average 3.7% since 2009, well average 5.8% past economic expansion cycles. at time, many u corporation spend cash pile buy back shares. in 2014 alone, us$550 billion spend share buyback, bring cumulative amount us$2,500 billion since 2009. a know, share buyback may buoy share price boost earn per-share short run, improve company’s productivity competitiveness, create new jobs. 13. thirdly, u financial system awash liquidity qe feeble domestic demand, excess liquidity soon find way emerge market economy (emes), china, brazil russia, pursuit high returns. between outbreak bi central bankers’ speech 3 global financial crisis peak 2014, total inflow emes estimate us$2.7 trillion, roughly us$1.6 trillion destine asia. in face massive inflows, emes experience currency appreciation, increase money supply, expansion credit bubble, overheat economy asset markets, etc. 14. fourthly, tide eventually turn. currently, strong u dollar imminent normalisation u interest rates, emes confront capital outflows, currency depreciation, sharp fall energy commodity prices. their economy asset market come vary degree downward pressure, adversely affect u advance economies. emes grow much large past decade two. in particular, china’s gdp balloon us$1 trillion 2000 us$10 trillion 2014. more importantly, emes account 55% global gdp since 2009, contribution global economic growth high 80%. so, slowdown emes impediment recovery u advance economies. 15. fifthly, zero interest rate qe indirectly widen income gap. because ultra-low interest rate excess liquidity seek good returns, stock property market rally many part world. this especially true place promise growth prospect like mainland china, hong kong singapore. however, low-income groups, little stock properties, miss altogether. and save deposit account earn next nothing. this exacerbate inequality, result negative implication social stability harmony. 16. sixthly, zero interest rate qe change global investment environment. yield traditionally conservative bond fix income investment declined. for example, 10-year u treasuries’ yield fall 5% 2%, sovereign bond yield eurozone even plunge negative. at time, exchange rate bond price emes experience sharp swing recently. with soon-to-start normalisation u interest rates, distort low-returns high-volatility bond markets, investment environment become even complex difficult. 17. while mainstream think recognise zero interest rate qe without side effects, still believe benefit outweigh costs. only history tell. how hong kong adjust u exit qe? 18. let offer two cent future outlook. the u interest rate quite possibly start normalise next week. the u economy continue grow moderate pace, u dollar remain strong period time. however, hard predict interest rates, bond yields, fund flow asset market react enter uncharted waters, much qe first launched. moreover, economy interact respond external factor differently, thus make difficult predict market responses. nevertheless, one thing certain: period difficult adjustment lie ahead emes. energy commodity price continue suppressed. emes continue witness capital outflows, currency depreciation, economic slowdown downward pressure asset markets. and, hong kong immune. we prepare face period capital outflows, rise interest rate slow growth. asset markets, include property market, also face downward pressure. however, orderly adjustment asset property prices, could provide respite prospective homebuyers business owner squeeze hefty rents. now, i would like take opportunity respond concern link exchange rate system, hong kong dollar appreciate alongside u dollar, thereby weaken competitiveness economy, particular tourism industry, deal blow wobbly retail tourism sectors. i wish point evidence suggest direct linkage recent decline visitor number 4 bi central bankers’ speech expenditure, exchange rate hong kong dollar. the nominal effective exchange rate (neer) hong kong dollar rise 6.6% year-on-year third quarter year, price level tourism-related merchandise service fell great magnitude. for example, price jewellery, clock watch fell 8.2%, average room rate hotel fell 15.3%, offset effect strong hong kong dollar. this clearly show hong kong’s economy sufficiently flexible adjust speedily change markets. 19. in addition, hong kong different emes. we sound robust monetary, bank financial systems. in response large capital inflow past years, get well-prepared introduce seven round counter-cyclical macroprudential measure property mortgage enhance resilience hong kong bank system. we able withstand shock reversal capital flow economic adjustment long remain level-headed. we endow strategic position “hinterland mainland china interface world” “one country, two systems” principle. it true chinese economy experience slowdown, reflect structural shift unbalance growth breakneck speed high-to-moderate growth rate sustainable basis. indeed, sustainable healthy development become “new normal” china reap “reform dividends” remain commit reform liberalisation, move towards modern market-based economy. 20. against backdrop, vast potential hong kong’s intermediary role trade commerce well fund flow china

probably say, little risk overstate reality, way achieve change cost credit monetary policy change significantly since global financial crisis. to fully appreciate extent changes, it’s useful quick recap traditional monetary policy prior 2008. in vast majority countries, name game set stance short term rate –indeed, overnight rate bank lend other. the hope that, influence short-term rate, monetary policy action would fee broad economy affect long term rates, well spread risky form credit end channel policy stance affect cost borrow household firms. in context, perhaps big advance

point mike woodford influential paper present jackson hole year ago, truly make dent rate strategy, central banker likely run temporal-inconsistency problem. this problem basically event long-term rate reduce enough jump-start economy, ex-post optimal policy stance would inconsistent one promise midst stagnation. quote paper: “the future policy one wish people anticipate one central bank motive implement later, make decision purely forward-looking way, basis usual stabilization objectives.” (end 2 bi central bankers’ speech quote) this seem like hard conundrum get away from, probably limit traction type tool strong driver longer-term rates. partly due limitations, central bank also directly tackle term premium purchase large quantity long-term assets. the idea remove duration fix income markets, private investors’ aggregate exposure interest rate risk diminished, lead low require compensation bear risk. of course, logic rely form imperfection and/or market segmentation, significant evidence, include excellent paper present conference, qe measurable impact long-term rate channel. a similar logic apply default risk-premium: extent return safe debt compress central bank purchases, investor tempt reach yield fixed-income markets, mortgages, corporate bonds, emerge market instruments. against backdrop, seem appropriate dedicate year’s conference take stock transformation occur monetary policy, objectives, least tool objective achieved. moreover, introspection seem crucial understand go forward. indeed, likely measure become standard practices, subtitle “unconventional” eventually scratch altogether. in fact, several reason suspect exceptional measure stay. on one hand, might well case witness profound structural change imply new normal much low interest rate accustom –i suspect keynote address larry summer tomorrow may touch upon issues. if so, likely run zlb future business cycles, force central bank tap upon so-called unconventional measure time again. on hand, measure apparently worked. why embrace part standard set instruments? the structure conference follow logic address three main aspect transformation practice monetary policy last decade. our first session include three paper tackle, theoretical empirical perspective, impact unconventional measure interest rate different horizon wide variety securities. here fortunate among presenter dimitri vayanos, gautti eggerston, eric swanson, accomplish scholar dedicate important part research recent year delve deep quantitative effect policies. the second session deal financial stability consideration measures. after all, date several unconventional policy effort begin japan, us, europe elsewhere, none far end –in short, wood yet, claim success might still bite preliminary. the concern ambitious program asset purchase might welcome different investor class asset price push upwards, might prove much difficult orchestrate orderly retreat inevitably rely increase discount rate future income stream priced. this particular true project fund begin due exceptionally low interest rate environment, and/or investment intermediate fund manager care income streams, also (and mostly) short-term price fluctuations. here interest discussion include paper stephen morris, michael woodford, gustavo suarez, enlighten u theoretical aspect keep mind evaluate broad consequence asset purchase programs, well empirical evidence regard effect risk-taking channel quality loan originated. but conference monetary policy develop economies. indeed, security emerge market fit naturally category risky asset expect affect investors’ search yield environment low interest rates, document grow excite empirical literature. this topic bi central bankers’ speech 3 third final session conference, include presentation helene rey, simon gilchrist, elia albagli. this topic particular concern central banker policymakers latam emerge regions, good reason worry consequence u monetary normalization environment exchange rate pass-through put increase pressure inflation targets, time interest rate pass-through put increase pressure subpar level growth. before give official start nineteenth annual conference, let end stress relate perhaps le appreciate aspect event last year changed, i believe fundamental desirable manner, way monetary policy handle communicated. and permit me, i illustrate point use recent chilean experience. in chile, although economic condition far le complex develop countries, also experiment unconventional policy ... frankly, i think experience successful. first, response global financial crisis 2008 bank increase supply liquidity peso dollar – repos swap –, augment extension swap program, broaden range eligible collaterals. they measure design align market rate monetary policy rate mitigate foreign currency liquidity tensions. forward guidance also important tool. with monetary policy rate close zero – cut interest rate 8.25% 0.5% le year – , communicate plan keep low short-term interest rate extend period time. this essential keep medium long term interest rate low. these measure – well exogenous development rapid recovery commodity price – allow economy rebound quite fast mild recession 2009. actually, post-crisis year gdp growth 5% context low inflation. over time, measure eliminated, certainly lesson learn crisis incorporate policy analysis toolkit. among significant i would mention two: first, fact central bank must rapid respond use available tool necessary. second, clear signal believe path interest rate future help efficient transmission monetary policy, particularly turbulent times. in fact, recent period, mark high normal level uncertainty associate grim outlook chinese economy normalization monetary policy unite states, make special effort signal financial market likely direction monetary policy baseline scenario well risk involved. we do increase transparency analysis and, especially, precise communication. of course soon make comprehensive definite analysis cost benefit policy, view extra amount forward guidance positive order achieve smooth economic adjustment difficult times. i thank here, without delay, welcome nineteenth annual conference: “monetary policy asset markets: lesson unconventional measure implication integrate world.” bi central bankers’ speech 1 arjuna mahendran: the late financial crisis sri lanka speech mr arjuna mahendran, governor central bank sri lanka, international research conference, colombo, 7 december 2015. * * * professor yi fu lin, dr. harsha de silva, distinguish delegates, lady gentlemen. welcome 8th research conference central bank sri lanka. i must congratulate dr. nandalal weerasinghe colleague develop tradition small way establish central bank sri lanka international research map meet place profound mind several lead academic bank institutions. this conference small feat organize give participant several part world europe asia include several area strong relationship country, i think great testimony continue tradition evolve central bank term create another center excellence sri lanka. in open remark i think i would perhaps take leaf professor lin’s commentary now, perhaps adapt sri lanka’s situation term structuralism lack professor lin discussed. now look total economy, last five year go fairly challenge period. a professor lin say great recession 2008 immediate aftermath find three strand relatively new economic activism manifest themselves. in first instance saw huge pump-priming effort people’s republic china, wake create perhaps strong commodity price boom see recent history. that i think key take away period china extent prevent world fall depression stimulate economy, professor lin elaborate us, fall line perception time recession develop country well-advised go ahead really stimulate domestic infrastructure construction etc. take slack cause international events. secondly saw major central bank world, include unite states, europe, unite kingdom, japan switzerland, create money unparallel basis calculation date add 8 trillion dollar worth new money create last 5 6 years. that significant. that’s second strand emanate crisis period. and thirdly see call develop economy curious twist economy fate, actually become big creditor world call rich countries, develop countries, actually big debtors. so you’ve turn world upside topsy-turvy today see india along big emerge market effectively lend money unite state america buy treasury fund development. so three stand i think take account really new element international financial architecture bear global economy go perform. so see today global economy different apart i mentioned. first liquidity trap. keynes’s classic liquidity trap alive kick around us. whatever interest rate doesn’t care production consumption much liquidity, 8 trillion i talk about. in context government stimulate economy give monetary policy do heavy lifting, create excess liquidity go forward need new element, xfactor, propel growth forward. you influential commentator like larry summer unite state call another round quantitative ease u feel long term growth path unite state economy still well embed reason partly due demographics. you age population japan, europe unite states, 2 bi central bankers’ speech mean baby boom generation, people bear second world war start retire consume le save consequence probably don’t space consumption lead economic impetus develop country dependent last 30 40 year grow economy export-led strategy. so first question is; export-led strategy relevant give demographic change see advance economies? and secondly give fact advance economy debt – happen great recession nationalize private bad debt house sectors, nationalize it, buy government’s balance sheet consequence western economy effectively net borrower system – gear stimulate consumption create another repeat cycle export-led boom really lift country like china big asian export economy low income status enjoy several decades. that relevant question ask conference. have get look different model that’s i think one key element international economics situation important understand emergence information communication technology principal driver growth, specifically service sector economy use space stimulate growth impetus previously reside manufacturing. now also understand manufacture space largely converge china. the chinese build international value chain last 30 40 year unparalleled term complexity far reach nature unless small country like sri lanka participate value chain sense lose tremendous opportunity. i put sri lanka still integrate adequately international value chain chinese build last 30 40 year effectively, effectively fulfil growth potential last 5 year since cessation internal civil conflict country. the second point i like make rely lot foreign save growth economy. this peculiarity sri lanka resemble country like phillipines mexico, sense large diaspora live overseas fairly high income earner relative level income country i ask dr. weerasinghe, national save rate 25 percent, perhaps 6 7 percent account international save component diaspora. that significant number; mean afford investment rate 26 28 percent perhaps even 30 percent medium term marshal resource effectively create growth impetus engender sustainable growth path time integrate global value chain chinese construct effectively last decades. but several challenge face u near term. first watch american monetary policy maker next weeks. that could potentially create turmoil international market include process could see potential dislocation sri lanka decide reach multilateral agency like imf world bank assist u term shelter protect economy adverse development may occur near future consequence turmoil international capital market u policy maker decide raise interest rates. that one hurdle look at. the second hurdle i would say lack structural change way international, particularly develop country world, manage economic affairs. a lot change see last 5 year monetary policy aggressive ease monetary policy. but fiscal side, haven’t see structural change country like unite state european country take world great recession 2008 consequence house bi central bankers’ speech 3 bubbles. that structural change term improve productivity, reduce size social security program retool economy become productive still start happen don’t sustainable basis global growth grow apace. so question is, complex chinese drive global value chain face difficulty term engender growth, go forward absence structural reform seek country diverse greece italy even ireland start implement mean foster strong growth go forward. that’s go big challenge u next year i think conference would well try give u perspective examine detail structural change global economy impact small economy like sri lanka perhaps give u guidepost term integrate economy global value chain, essential ensure future economic prosperity stability country well-bedded. thank much time morning i thank participant contribution look forward stimulate couple day hall. bi central bankers’ speech 1 nadine baudot-trajtenberg: brief overview change landscape financial market israel remark dr nadine baudot-trajtenberg, deputy governor bank israel, institutional investor conference, eilat, 2 december 2015. * * * it pleasure annual conference large institutional investor israel. today i’d like give brief overview change landscape financial market israel, particularly highlight recent legislation expect affect it. particularly i’d like discus three central issue always present discussion financial intermediation: size system, competitiveness stability credibility. no one quite know optimal size financial sector country. what know large prone crisis, past decade see number example overgrow financial market suddenly often quite unexpectedly deflate rather violently disastrously local economy. if sector small, stunt economic activity play central role channel save borrower (both investor consumers) way sustain economic growth. in addition weaken monetary policy, main avenue transmission mechanism work impact economic activity. the second issue, one forefront public discourse israel, structure market, competitive financial sector is. what typically mean competitiveness necessarily concentrate sector is, rather whether 3 essential characteristic competitive market present: to extent supply appropriate – words, access service restricted? be price adequate – words, consumer get best price service, high interest rate saver low interest rate borrower kinds? be sector dynamic constantly innovate new good service clients? a market characterize often complex products, easily understand compare consumer products, well asymmetric information seller buyer, market unlikely reach “competitive market equilibrium” deliver invisible hand. last least, stability issue intrinsically attach financial markets, market fall rise company part normal course business, something nature financial service make particularly fragile: seductive appeal leverage. anyone taste excessively charm it, thing turn sour impact rest economy large long last – see recently many countries, include develop country presumably well develop regulate markets. the size financial sector relative economy israeli close oecd average. a country switzerland, ireland uk become financial hub export various financial service countries. in case switzerland, service export mostly asset management, ireland’s mostly back office services, uk mostly financial intermediation. the value add financial intermediation israel 5.1% gdp 2013, slightly le 5.4% average oecd countries. 2 bi central bankers’ speech total asset bank sector israel share gdp stand 127% 2014, well oecd median (243%) average (247%). in fact, total asset bank sector share gdp contract past decade peak 147% 2002. at time, asset you, institutional investors, manage grow period 67% gdp 2002 117% 2014. we may know whether financial sector optimal size, figure show israel appear pretty much one would expect be, neither large small – reassure figure overall. turn tricky thorny issue sector’s competitiveness, indicator need make perfect assessment situation, note concentration bank sector substantially high develop countries. perhaps even strike area consumer loans, entirely dominate banks, particularly large bank israel. this always case, bank recede grant credit large corporations, increase credit consumers. indeed past decade, retail credit, include mortgages, grow much fast type credit. over period, institutional investor broaden allocation assets, particularly respect investment abroad grow 8% 19% asset 2005 2015. however, far take much part retail credit market, either mortgage consumer credit. the truth typical large asset manager develop country enter retail lend market. institutional investor israel enter corporate debt market past decade, despite fact sector shrink share gdp period. so know retail lend growing, dominate banks, corporate lend grow share gdp subject competition institutional investor banks. what small businesses? first, importance small business israeli economy similar oecd countries, fact bite larger, constitute 42% business sector gdp – significant part economy could source economic growth. the bank increase volume lend small medium business 36% banks’ business sector credit 44% 2011 2014. an international comparison difficult distribution wide. what pricing? well, small business, high interest rate pays. doe reflect risk involve market power? what clear profitability past 4 year much high household small business sector type credit. even take account year upcycle years, profitability likely affect negatively downcycle, good reason believe high price part due market power. recent legislation regulatory change tackle problem bring institutional investors, small business household credit market well. the establishment credit registry tackle problem asymmetric information, legislation enable securitization allow institutional investor enter retail market indirectly – do many place world – connect institutional capital banks’ ability grant credit, lead expand supply credit low finance costs. bi central bankers’ speech 1 r gandhi: nbfcs – medium term prospect speech mr r gandhi, deputy governor reserve bank india, 1st non-banking financial company (nbfcs) summit, organize confederation indian industry, mumbai, 21 december 2015. * * * assistance provide shri c d srinivasan shri anuj sharma gratefully acknowledged. 1. i happy address first ever cii summit non-banking financial company (nbfcs) deliberate “regulatory paradigm & contour growth – vision 2020”. the context summit organise also apt. world over, awakening, post great financial crisis 2008, existence, contribution, magnitude, significance risk non-banking financial sector. from benign neglect indifference sector, either default deliberate choice, world become anxious seriously concern it. this awaken result enhance attention, monitor regulation sector. therefore, apt sector also notice desire seriously discus prospect change scenario realign renew vision. global shadow bank monitor report fsb – 2015 2. the financial stability board (fsb), come existence post financial crisis, leader g20 country decide convert exist financial stability forum fsb address vulnerability develop implement strong regulatory, supervisory policy interest financial stability. the fsb monitor shadow bank sector closely past five year publish monitor report. i like highlight key find late report, provide worthwhile background set deliberation today. 3. the 2015 report fsb present result fifth annual monitor exercise use data end 2014 26 jurisdictions, together account 80% global gdp 90% global financial system assets. the report include result macro-mapping, include size growth trend monitor universe non-banking financial institution (munfi) estimate, cross-jurisdiction analysis, trend sub-sectors interconnectedness bank system. it also discus narrow measure shadow banking, construct filter non-bank financial activity direct relation credit intermediation (e.g. equity investment funds) already prudentially consolidate bank groups. a result, believe narrow measure accurately reflect size composition shadow bank sector, subject caveat fsb’s resolve refine narrow measure. another change bring time around new activity-based “economic function” measure shadow banking, involve non-bank credit intermediation may pose shadow bank risk (e.g. maturity / liquidity transformation leverage). the five economic function certain entity susceptible run (ef1), lend dependent short-term fund (ef2), market intermediation dependent short-term fund secure fund client asset (ef3), facilitate credit creation (ef4), securitisation-based intermediation (ef5). 4. the main find late exercise follows: the narrow measure i. the narrow measure global shadow bank may pose financial stability risk amount $36 trillion 2014 26 participate jurisdictions. this equivalent 2 bi central bankers’ speech 12% financial system assets, grow moderately past several years. ii. more 80% global shadow bank asset reside subset advance economy north america, asia northern europe. iii. the new classification economic function show credit intermediation associate collective investment vehicle feature make susceptible run (e.g. money market fund (mmfs), hedge fund investment funds) represent 60% narrow measure shadow banking. it grow 10% average past four years. by contrast, level securitisation-based credit intermediation – among key contributor financial crisis – fall recent years. iv. at aggregate level, interconnectedness bank non-bank financial system continue decrease pre-crisis peak. the broad measure i. an aggregate “munfi” measure asset financial intermediary (ofis), pension fund insurance company grow 9% $137 trillion past year, represent 40% total financial system asset 20 jurisdiction euro area. ii. in aggregate, insurance company, pension fund ofi sector grow 2014, bank system asset fell slightly u dollar terms. iii. while non-bank financial intermediation shrink somewhat immediately follow financial crisis, rise past several years. ofi asset 20 jurisdiction euro area reach 128% gdp 2014, 6 percentage point 2013 15 percentage point 2011. it near previous high-point 130% prior financial crisis. iv. emerge market economy (emes) show rapid increase ofi assets. in 2014, 8 emes ofi growth rate 10%, include two grow 30%. however, rapid growth generally relatively small base. v. among ofi sub-sectors show rapid growth 2014 trust companies, mmfs, fix income funds. trust company (mostly base china) continue experience growth 26%, similar past several years. perhaps surprisingly, mmfs experience 20% growth 2014 (largely drive euro area jurisdiction china), follow low negative growth prior three year period. fix income fund fund grow approximately 15% 2014. vi. it note hedge fund remain underestimate fsb’s exercise due fact portion international financial centre (ifcs), number hedge fund domiciled, currently within scope exercise. shadow bank india 5. while world generally refer sector “shadow bank sector”, call “non-banking financial sector”. further, world has, i said, sit perk collar look sector intensely, india understand sector’s relevance risk may pose, way back early 1960s itself, when, 1963, chapter iii b deal regulation non-banking financial institution add reserve bank india act 1934. it recognise non-banking financial activity integral part financial system complement commercial banking; appropriate vigilance due-diligence need regulate sector. bi central bankers’ speech 3 nbfc regulation 6. in free economy, economic agent primarily free undertake economic activity. in normal course, aspire continuous growth. however, certain economic activity have, know, great externality financial sector one externality warrant close regulation supervision interest systemic stability, safety soundness bank financial institution protect consumers. the objective nbfc regulation twentieth century predominantly protect interest depositors. however, nbfcs grow size interconnectedness bank system become visible raise concern capacity disturb systemic stability, nbfcs bring prudential regulatory framework 2006 onwards. 7. while overall approach follow contour describe above, reserve bank, regulator nbfcs keep sector’s potential contribute development identify segment economy accordingly follow developmental bias regulatory framework relate nbfcs. the nbfcs focus niche area business address specific need customers. therefore, reserve bank classify variety specific type nbfcs separately regulate type differently. a date type include asset financing, core investment, loan, investment, micro-financing, factoring, infrastructure financing, mortgage guarantee, etc. activities. further, house finance, insurance collective investment activities, though statutorily define nbfi activities, regulation leave hand sectoral regulator like national house bank (nhb), insurance regulatory development authority (irda), pension fund regulatory development authority (pfrda) security exchange board india (sebi). 8. this approach reflect position non-bank financial system may contribute financial deepen identify segments. the nbfcs advantageous due ability low transaction costs, quick decision make capabilities, customer orientation prompt provision services. in term product service offered, nbfcs complement banks. 9. nevertheless, business model nbfcs inherently risk-prone. weak underwrite standards, enhance risk take capability increase complexity activity cause concerns. 10. besides riskiness pertain business model, nbfcs expose key risk emanate regulatory gaps, arbitrage contagion effect. nbfcs prone systemic risk account concentration exposure specific sectors. also, since entity dependent bank funding, directly indirectly, interconnectedness risk tend higher. their asset-liability mismatch accentuate liquidity risks. all told, risk quickly escalate solvency risk lead systemic risk well. 11. therefore, careful continuous monitor still require detect increase systemic risk factor (e.g. maturity liquidity transformation, leverage) could arise rapid expansion credit provide non-bank sector. reserve bank dynamically make regulatory framework suitable day. certain change framework bring last year deserve recollection. recent nbfc regulation 12. change regulation concern nbfc sector last decade half largely incremental. however, november 2014, detail review entire regulatory framework nbfc sector undertake view transitioning, time, activity base regulation nbfcs oppose current approach entity-based regulation. the bank mindful fact revision impede 4 bi central bankers’ speech dynamism display nbfcs deliver innovation last mile connectivity meet credit need productive sector economy. the broad principle follow frame revise guideline review regulation perspective mandate reserve bank, viz., financial stability, depositor protection customer protection. hence, a) focus address risk exist, b) address gap regulation, c) reduce complexity make regulation simple easy follow, d) harmonise regulation within sector bank limit extent, e) acknowledge may pocket within sector require stringently regulate f) give adequate time nbfcs adjust revise regulatory framework disruption business. 13. consequently, revise regulatory framework nbfcs introduce threshold systemic significance revise total asset size ₹ 500 crore. now, two broad category nbfcs require close attention regulator supervisors. these a) non – deposit accept nbfcs asset size le ₹ 500 crore (nbfcs-nd) b) non – deposit accept nbfcs asset ₹ 500 crore (nbfcs-nd-si) deposit accept nbfcs (nbfcs-d). report regulatory provision accordingly apply good focus systemically important entity efficient allocation supervisory resources. 14. minimal prudential regulation prescribe non-deposit accept nbfcs asset size le ₹ 500 crore. for non-deposit accept company (nbfcs-nd) threshold systemic significance, prudential regulations, capital adequacy credit concentration norms, applicable public fund accept conduct business regulation (fpc, kyc) customer interface. a simple leverage ratio 7 put place asset growth sync capital hold. further, report nbfcs simplify annual return. however, registration section 45 ia rbi act mandatory subject simplify report system along minimum net own fund (nof) ₹ 2 crore. 15. for non-deposit accept company (nbfcs-nd-si) threshold systemic significance nbfc-d, prudential regulation applicable conduct business regulation wherever customer interface exists. in line international best practices, core capital requirement strengthen (existing 7.5%; raise 10% phase 2 years). asset classification norm align bank (from current 180 day 360 day norm loan hp / lease asset respectively 90 day norm phase 3 years). high standard asset provision put place (0.4% exist 0.25% phase 3 years). further, credit concentration norm harmonise various category nbfcs remove dispensation give afcs exceed define norm 5%. (dispensation give ifc idf retain infra loan high value loans) corporate governance standards, viz., fit proper criterion directors, disclosure transparency strengthen professionally manage develop sound compliance culture. 16. in order harmonise deposit acceptance regulation across deposit take nbfcs (nbfcs-d) move regimen credit rat nbfcs-d access public deposits, exist unrated asset finance company (afcs), permit accept deposits, shall get rat march 31, 2016. further, limit acceptance deposit reduce rat afcs 4 time early 1.5 time nof. 17. the principal business criterion (pbc) nbfc-factors revise 50:50 exist 75:75, thereby align provision factor regulation act, 2011. consequently, nbfc whose factor asset factor income 50 percent total asset total income respectively classify nbfc-factors. this expect provide boost factor activity country. bi central bankers’ speech 5 18. in case nbfc- mfis , base recommendation committee comprehensive financial service small business low income household (chairman: dr. nachiket mor), limit total indebtedness borrower raise ₹ 1,00,000/- ₹ 50,000/-. income criterion borrower loan include qualify asset nbfcs changed: borrower rural household annual income exceed ₹ 1,00,000/- ₹ 60,000/- early urban semi-urban household income exceed ₹ 1,60,000/- ₹ 1,20,000/- earlier; ceiling amount loan disburse revise ₹ 60,000/- ₹

nbfc asset percentage schedule commercial banks’ asset increase 7% 1998 14.8% march 2015. there 202 nbfcs-nd-si (assets size ₹ 500 crore above) total asset size ₹14126 billion. the number deposit take nbfcs, include residuary non-banking finance company (rnbcs), decrease 1,420 1997–98 209 september 2015. share nbfc deposit percentage schedule commercial banks’ deposit come 3.34% march 1997 0.30% march 2015. 20. source us fund nbfc sector – position a september 30, 2015 21. loan advance extend nbfcs-nd-si post strong double-digit growth 15.5% 2014–15, contrast slowdown commercial bank’s non-food credit period (chart 4.6). strong growth credit extend infrastructure finance companies, microfinance company loan company contribute sturdy growth loan portfolio nbfcs-nd-si. among sectors, infrastructure, medium large-scale industries, transport sector contribute strong growth credit off-take nbfcs-nd-si. during 2014–15, nbfcs-nd-si raise fund mainly debenture commercial papers. borrow banks, early constitute main source funding, progressively reduced. a notable feature rise exposure mutual fund financial instrument float mainly nbfc-infrastructure finance company (ifcs), loan company (lcs) nbfc-micro finance institution (nbfc-mfis). 22. in recent years, asset quality nbfc sector go vicissitude overall deterioration spread across financial system economy slowed. gross npa per cent credit deploy rise 4.1 per cent end-march 2015. 6 bi central bankers’ speech prospect 23. in opinion, prospect sector medium term go uniform. different segment sector poise different prospect challenges. 24. for example, nbfc-mfi segment go shrink heavily big ten convert small finance bank next one year so. i hasten add yet bring high impetus nbfc-mfis grow, availability space vacate big ten, also capital release many convert nbfc-mfis pay current investor part capital restructuring, renew interest venture capital aim growth prospect conversion future. 25. the infrastructure nbfcs great scope come years, economic growth bring forth new project banks, learn lesson recent past, restrain approach towards projects. if infra-nbfcs structure project careful way, good prospects. 26. a large exposure regime bank apply 2018, nbfcs space market fund loan fund big corporate finance medium term. 27. loan company face enhance consumer protection measures. they require appropriately educate workforce sell right. 28. investment company bright prospects, equity corporate bond market expand, along economic growth careful recalibration bank finance wake basle iii. regulation – the way forward 29. at present, several category nbfcs regulation vary across nbfcs. the committee comprehensive financial service small business low income household (chairman: dr. nachiket mor) recommend merger various category nbfcs, two viz., nbfcs core investment company (cics) move towards activity base regulation. the regulatory framework, put place november bi central bankers’ speech 7 2014, first step direction. go forward, work towards great harmonisation regulation view reduce number nbfc categories. 30. however, reserve bank alive developmental need economy therefore continue approve new type nbfcs economy need them. one nbfc-account aggregator (nbfc-aa) reserve bank announce july 02, 2015. the nbfc-aa provide technology enable solution person view one place position financial asset across institution different sectoral regulators. the guideline preparations. 31. also, reserve bank actively study peer-to-peer lend arrangement slowly gain traction. while recognise need innovative product services, conscious risk may emanate innovations. base detail study, intend bring discussion paper public consultation. 32. there demand regulation relate core investment company need revisiting. this work-in-process. conclusion 33. to conclude, i quote fsb conclude 2015 report. “intermediating credit non-bank channel important advantage contribute finance real economy, channel also become source systemic risk, especially structure perform bank-like function (e.g. maturity liquidity transformation, leverage) interconnectedness regular bank system strong. appropriate monitor shadow bank application appropriate policy responses, necessary, help mitigate build-up systemic risks”. the reserve bank remain commit approach. bi central bankers’ speech 1 r

payment revolution take advantage thereof, need take certain strategic actions. these follows: a) expand acceptance ecosystem: the proliferation digital channel evident mostly tier i & tier ii centre country. in order promote digital channels, incumbent ecosystem include banks, network partner others. to ensure adequate availability digital channel enablers debit cards, internet bank registrations, etc. tier iii tier vi centre well. it critical importance population 6 lakh village country expose alternate delivery channels. some estimate indicate reach average level bric countries, india need 20 million po terminal current 1.2 million. this tall order. b) government initiatives: there attempt move government direct benefit transfer onto electronic channels. i believe 946 million aadhaar number issued, electronic benefit transfer clear strategy promote efficient payment systems. c) interoperability: interoperability digital channel i mention early key driver promote digital channels. the digital channel definition available anywhere & anytime. d) simplicity standardization: end customer need simple way access digital channels. this bring seamless process drive ecosystem partners. and this, standardization processes, right registration delivery post delivery service imperative. e) security: no electronic payment mechanism undermine role security risk mitigation promote digital channels. there continuous concert effort ensure digital channel safe & secure. the confidence customer shall key deepen usage digital channels. 8. with steps, association key stakeholder like reserve bank, government, banks, payment system participant catalyst like npci, reserve bank quite sanguine india reap advantage payment revolution. 9. i wish npci payment community best shape bank future future banking. bi central bankers’ speech 3 4 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: open statement european parliament’s econ committee open statement mr mark carney, governor bank england chairman financial stability board, european parliament’s econ committee, brussels, 7 december 2015. * * * mr chair, honourable member economic monetary affair committee, it pleasure address capacity vice-chair european systemic risk board. maintain financial stability require strong policy frameworks, dynamic understand risks, and, appropriate, co-ordination individual macro-prudential policies. the need coordinate authority within eu particularly important, give unique nature single market high degree integration. in fulfil role, esrb make financial stability policy effective across eu. 1. on openness eu the openness european member state support economic dynamism facilitate trade specialisation, enhance competition, encourage diversification risk-sharing. large market mean wide choice, big incentive innovation, great scope realise economy scale. while openness boost dynamism, also increase exposure shock abroad. financial linkage particular create new vulnerability potential deepen shocks. the esrb help build resilience maximise benefit openness minimise risk entails. in spirit, i would like outline three specific contribution esrb time vice chair. 2. build strong macroprudential framework the esrb promote strong macroprudential framework across union. specifically esrb issue recommendation encourage national legislator establish macroprudential authority within jurisdictions. it handbook operationalising macroprudential policy bank sector embody practical information set policy use newly-established powers. the handbook set best practice instrument instrument basis, suggest indicator guide use, outline legal framework govern them. it also detail potential spillovers. where judge best practice followed, esrb use “soft law” issue recommendation “act explain” basis mitigate financial stability risk curb spillovers. for example, last year esrb give guidance national macroprudential authority set countercyclical capital buff rates. the esrb follow guidance publish assessment implementation 2016 q3. with macroprudential policy still adolescence, esrb help mature. 2 bi central bankers’ speech recent esrb study evaluate case use margining counteract pro-cyclical behaviour derivative security finance transactions. and year, esrb assess value include macroprudential buff within leverage ratio framework. the bank england follow approach ensure leverage ratio complement risk-weighted capital framework way make robust cyclical structural risks. one strength esrb ability harness data conduct analysis across eu member states. in work leverage ratio, esrb collect new empirical evidence show bank sector leverage pro-cyclical aggregate level almost member states. average risk weight tend fall credit boom rise downturns. work eba data, esrb find systemically important bank europe typically low risk weight leverage ratio type banks. take together, theory evidence demonstrate importance dynamic leverage ratio robust macroprudential framework. another way esrb lead identify best practice influence international agenda take macroprudential perspective element financial system support long-term prosperity. for example, examination solvency ii, esrb consider long-term investor like insurer bring diversity stability system. in view, do ensure solvency ii create right framework long-term investment. the esrb provide constructive objective macroprudential perspective input parliament’s review 2018 aspect operation solvency ii. openness put premium share understand risks. the esrb play vital role eu, enhance members’ assessment new evolve risks. the structure financial system change significantly since crisis. virtually net credit growth since bond markets. in tandem, asset management rise 60% globally 80% eu. these trend continue capital market union developed. the esrb currently contribute two way resilient capital markets. first, promote share understand fundamental driver market liquidity. second, gather consistent information nature size risk associate market-based finance. the esrb unique power regard give ability collect information financial participant across eu.1 the esrb currently survey market maker asset manager part broad study risk reduction market liquidity. this work complete mid-2016. the survey draw implication liquidity conditions, include whether open-ended fund liquidity sufficient meet redemption event market stress. 1 of course, esrb must exercise power care precision. and case must compelling. but rapid growth market-based finance satisfy tests. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in similar survey 143 investment funds, bank england find that, aggregate, fund expect able liquidate one day roughly three time estimate dollar corporate bond market turnover; clearly fallacy composition. the esrb survey provide valuable wide perspective. arm insights, esrb help design appropriate policy responses. stress test investment fund sector expect future, complement exist stress test banks, insurer pension funds. the esrb also begin access detail derivative trade report trade repository across union. by pool national expertise leverage esrb’s unique access entire set trades, authority good understand complex web derivative transaction could propagate dampen risk across system. it also ass impact mandatory central clear whether shift risk part system direct clear banks. 3. great openness require share approach manage risk in cases, share understand sufficient; authority also need share way manage risks. the esrb hub relevant authority present, include central banks, bank supervisors, security authorities. through regular dialogue establish update best practice. consider residential real estate. this year esrb’s work emphasise market influence structural differences, loan-to-value restriction tax treatments, across eu. it analysis identify tool authority may use respond different vulnerabilities, range capital measure restriction debt-to-income ratio collateral. key lesson analysis include that: 1. flexibility need design calibration macroprudential tools; 2. single tool combat property risks; 3. tool need appropriate domestic circumstances; 4. domestic policy effective domestic eu financial stability spillover managed. the esrb build framework ass manage spillovers, agree soon operationalised early next year. it central feature reciprocity – eliminate regulatory arbitrage give domestic policy great traction. it member led, but, importantly, back esrb recommendations. compliance “act explain” basis presumption many exposure-based measure (e.g. ltv, lti maturity) reciprocated. this significant. the esrb notify macroprudential action 69 time year, 173 time since introduction crr/crd 2014. although many notice procedural, show direction travel. more country use macroprudential tools, create increase need “clearing house” comprehensive timely. the esrb also evaluate way national macroprudential authority might apply countercyclical capital buff financial exposure country outside eea – tool give esrb union law. that bolster collective resilience global financial cycle spillover outside union. while risk property market reflect national differences, risk misconduct common determinants. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in past five years, misconduct penalty impose eu bank total €50bn. those cost direct implication real economy. at 5% leverage, capital could support €1 trillion lend capacity. more fundamentally, repeat episode misconduct undercut public trust system.2 the esrb’s work help catalyse sensible action begin process rebuild trust. first, propose capture misconduct cost stress test ensure bank remain resilient even severe outcomes. the bank england follow approach recent stress test include additional £40bn misconduct costs. these cost calibrate low likelihood exceed therefore, design, much large amount already provide banks. second, esrb also propose tackle misconduct source increase individual accountability. this do reform remuneration – use variable pay, combine malus clawback, hard-wire strong incentive good behaviour within firms. the uk commit approach tough remuneration regime eu, include long deferral claw backs. however, effectiveness measure across eu temper bonus cap. for example, 2013, ratio fix variable material risk taker major uk bank around 1:3 – mean three quarter remuneration risk individual misconduct. the next year, firm first apply bonus cap, ratio fall around 1:1, overall level remuneration unaffected. prompt esrb, fsb examine impact various compensation tool misconduct, appropriate, recommend improvement next year’s g20 summit. reform compensation necessary sufficient. esrb report rightly stress do hold senior individual account. prompt part esrb, fsb member share experience role bank regulatory power address misconduct approach enhance individual accountability. in uk, implement new regime ensure senior manager right across financial system hold directly accountable failure area responsibility. that buttress clear code conduct, design practitioners, ensure high standard understand all. 4. conclusion all member states, fundamentally eu citizens, stake eu financial stability. the esrb help deliver foundation prosperity. the financial crisis starkly illustrate quickly risk could spill across borders, need wide-ranging reforms, new approach address risks. with leadership, reform programme substantially complete, authority implement maximise effectiveness. 2 bank england survey results. respondent ask view statement ‘i believe financial market work interest society’. possible response were: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. only one third agree strongly agreed. bi central bankers’ speech 5 but durable financial stability require microprudential standard bolster resilience individual firms. it also require macroprudential perspective, flexibility respond shock wherever occur; high standard systemically important firms; increase level resilience risk increase. the esrb help member state fulfil roles, remain alert emerge vulnerabilities. a president draghi recently describe committee, come year, esrb develop assessment macroprudential stance member state complement exist risk monitor focus risk low interest rate financial stability abrupt transition low-carbon economy. thank attention. i look forward comment questions. guy debelle: some effect new liquidity regime speech mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, 28th australasian finance bank conference, sydney, 16 december 2015. * * * thank george gardner, tai lam, david wakeling kelsey wilkins. today i would like discus aspect liquidity regime operation australia almost year now, namely application one important aspect basel iii standards, liquidity coverage ratio (lcr). i describe feature lcr regime emerge past year market development take place since introduction. i also summarise information reserve bank gather relate development, provision detail information asset-backed securities. this information result bank’s stipulation asset-backed security repo-eligible bank’s operations, usable collateral commit liquidity facility (clf), issuer need provide loan-level data detail information security. the lcr full operation australia begin year. in 2013, bank trial run, number balance sheet change already start take place. hence, time get begin year, bank meet lcr requirement, generally reasonable buffer. to remind you, lcr require bank hold enough high quality liquid asset (hqla) cover project net cash outflow (ncos) 30-day stress scenario. bank require calculate maintain lcr least 100 per cent every day. in words, absent severe market disruption, lcr meet time, end quarter (say). while bank undertake extensive model project cash flows, inherent unpredictability lumpiness flows, include around large deposits, well derivative positions. a result, bank decide maintain buff 100 per cent. to date, average lcr industry around 120 per cent bank maintain large buffers.1 to meet lcr, bank make change asset liability side balance sheets. on liability side, past couple years, little change aggregate share deposit wholesale funding, beneath surface change much greater. • liability high run-off rate lcr, deposit hold financial institutions, repriced reflect fact particularly attractive form fund bank. the competition sort deposit particularly intense, indeed opposite often case, bank happy see le sticky form fund leave. • in contrast, competition deposit low run-off rate particularly intense. such deposit include customer number different product institution, mean deposit assess stickier. bank will pay stable form fund see relative rate rise. 1 bank require publicly report information lcr regular basis. bi central bankers’ speech 1 • term deposit actually “term” deposit are, part, unbreakable ahead maturity date (without least one month’s notice). in past, deposit often break ahead maturity date little penalty. similarly, bank make price notice-of-withdrawal account attractive savers, investor require give bank advance notice intent withdraw funds. • bank seek increase average maturity wholesale bond funding. the average maturity outstanding wholesale bond fund increase 3 year around 3½ year since 2011. • there mark decrease use wholesale fund maturity le 30 days. this particularly unattractive source fund banks, need cover fund 100 per cent hqla. hence little incentive offer yield high yield hqla. this evident yield one-month bank bills. the spread one-month bank bill swap rate (bbsw) ois decline markedly begin year (as i note early occasion, repricing leave last minute2) generally low stable since. at one month maturity, see activity bank buy back bill roll residual maturity one month new issuance. on asset side, also number changes. however, unlike liability side, many change take place well ahead lcr come force begin year. we haven’t see many change take place past year. the notable change increase hold hqla banks. to remind you, security eligible high quality liquid asset australian market commonwealth state government paper. because relatively small pool government paper australia, reserve bank provides, fee 15 basis point per annum, commit liquidity facility (clf) address shortfall hqla reasonably hold banks.3 asset use access facility asset eligible collateral

project net cash outflow plus appropriate buff ensure lcr remain comfortably 100 per cent, assess apra $450 billion, project bank could reasonably hold $175 billion hqla securities. for 2016, system liquidity need fall $440 billion, even banks’ balance sheet expanded. this bank seek reduce net cash outflow adjustment liability i describe earlier. at time, base commonwealth state government

clf activated, asset repoed reserve bank. to manage contingent risk, important detail information quality asset also able price accurately determine amount liquidity would potentially provide them. to enhance information available us, since middle 2015, mandatory report requirement come effect asset-backed security repo eligible reserve bank also eligible collateral clf. the require information include key transactional level data, detail tranche information, relationship trust service provider include provide various facility fix float swap. at loan level, require data rmbs include: 62 loan field loan balances, interest rates, arrears measures; 18 borrower field borrower income, employment type, whether investor owner-occupier, whether first home-buyer; 13 collateral field (that is, detail collateral underpin mortgage) include postcode property valuation. these requirement include data commonly use rat agency rmbs investors, data go beyond also include useful information commonly compile before, offset balance borrower income origination. this allow us, along investor asset-backed securities, undertake rich analysis security accurately ass risk price may possible before. in case, allow u undertake risk assessment dependent rat agencies. in addition data fields, issuer also require provide work cash flow waterfall model security provide useful information structural aspect ab case previously obtainable detail read legal documentation. this innovation useful standardise information across securities, allow u verify structural feature deal provide granular haircut price case previously. these report requirement standardise repo-eligible asset-backed securities, mean information require securities. a result, go forward, easy compare securities. we see great benefit industry whole, industry itself, evidence support australian securitisation forum (asf) whole process introduce new standards. the repo-eligibility requirement also direct issuer make information available investor permit users, reserve bank. by large, information provide group provide reserve bank; however, field information provide pose potential risk privacy. hence issuer may redact particular field provide aggregate de-individualised data field instead. since middle year, receive securitisation system around 1 600 submissions, cover around $400 billion assets, include around two million individual house loans. the information update monthly frequency gain much rich view ab market point time, also rich time series. with large panel data set examine market, underlie collateral, evolve time. bi central bankers’ speech 5 with caveat data report still infancy, it’s already apparent many potential benefit data. let illustrate summary information glean first month

lvr origination 70 80 per cent. while still case term current lvr, share noticeably lower. similarly, almost loan lvr great 90 per cent, even though around nearly 10 per cent lvr great 90 origination. that said, bear mind securitised loan tend season non-securitised loan therefore amortise quickly. the season (time since loan origination) securitised loan show graph 5. it show 95 per cent value

sejko, governor bank albania, 9th workshop economic research southeastern europe, tirana, 4 december 2015. * * * distinguish guests, workshop participants, lady gentleman i consider privilege address open 9th south eastern european economic workshop, tirana. in line tradition event, attempt complement need research need policy novelties. please allow say judge contribution presence workshop, i confident event fulfill commitment expectation provide u useful practical lessons. it important emphasize global national economic background event take place difficult times. the global recession remain present. the european core shake event greece, also spain, portugal italy, remain fragile. the recent development middle east add hardship overstretch available resources. therefore, economic activity might take long time return previous glorious days. despite fact region manage remain positive side economic growth, hardship quick reach u well. economic income growth use inflation continue break new low records. central bank receive share challenge hardship well. continuous standard monetary policy ease couple micro macroprudential policy interventions. even intervention like quantitative-easing euro area bring attention implemented, still general economy seem slow react properly. furthermore, issue monetary policy alone. the non-standard intervention (micro macroprudential policies) require special attention resource allocation order properly manage implementation impact general economy. additionally, maintain financial stability require additional central bank prevent possible negative spillover financial sector toward area economy. in short, general economic difficulty place central bank cross-road relation principles, policy management. moreover, even though requirement maintain price stability remain appealing, danger occur inflation. exchange rate fluctuation provide additional hazards, particularly within economy foreign currency transaction dominate. additionally, financial stability challenge present even high levels. credit demand reaction continuous monetary policy stimulus sluggish, reflect poor expectation consumer enterprise future developments. supplementary ease general requirement obtain credit expect impact observe recent dynamic aggregate demand components. unquestionably, financial agent profit make duty search find alternative client traditional end-users unwilling uncommitted new credit. besides that, need finance stimulate end-users search find alternative sources. this raise question strategic level associate credit efficiency allocation informality. allocation deficiency tend intensify time crisis reflect usually condition over-lending certain sectors, probably poor spillover effect rest economy. in meantime, sector truly productive might remain detach financial sources, thus little stimulus move forward. even worse, bi central bankers’ speech 1 sector might address informal lender compensate financial needs. this also activity boom time crisis and, since activity entirely unmonitored financial regulators, could dangerously harm diminish ability financial regulator influence economy large. have mention arguments, i would like return event emphasize challenge mention translate challenge central bank research. i glad issue address different panel workshop. additionally, although yet hear them, i confident policy implication suggest contribution relevant important. the question remains: practical easily adapted? this question involve major challenge research workshop, general. it duty provide balance academic property research practical endeavors. the academic property guarantee standard research enrich methodological novelty point view. furthermore, practical pattern would allow policy maker fully easily implement policy proposal make relevant. this main expectation i event i confident fulfil end two days. without ado, i would like give warmly welcome congratulate good work today. thank you. 2 bi central bankers’ speech daniel mminele: challenge today – opportunity tomorrow keynote address mr daniel mminele, deputy governor south african reserve bank, african central bank reserve management 2020 conference, arusha, 1 december 2015. * * * good morning, lady gentlemen. it indeed privilege invite deliver keynote address prestigious african central bank reserve management conference. i would like thank bank tanzania, allianz global investors, deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit (giz) afford opportunity share think regard challenge opportunity face manage official reserves. thank also create valuable opportunity discus swap note best reserve management practices. the ever-changing landscape financial market pose significant excite challenge reserve managers, change also bring new opportunities, could require rethink way central banker manage official reserves. a always case change, new risk also emerge. this even case consider primary objective capital preservation, historically seemingly simple solutions. in distant past, clear formula achieve capital preservation place deposit aaa– rat counterparties buy highly rat government bonds. however, hold government bond current environment may necessarily guarantee capital preservation. for instance, country germany, negative yield prevail short medium maturity note actually guarantee able achieve capital preservation. how deal negative interest rate one challenge face reserve managers. judge structure agenda speaker conference, i doubt many issue unpacked, help enhance understand grapple extraordinary economic circumstance create today’s try condition reserve manager operate. in remark morning, i touch briefly global economic financial market context; talk recent development reserve management, challenge currently face central bank reserve managers. before exploring, towards end remarks, possible opportunity stem change global landscape, cast eye 2020, i briefly share south african reserve bank (sarb) think approach challenges. recent economic market trend due global financial crisis 2007 2008, coordinate global ease monetary policy effort boost global economy. give severity crisis, probably fair say investor market participant believe would remain policy stance protract period. but game changer come may 2013 commonly refer ‘taper tantrum’, feed chair, ben bernanke, indicate authority may consider reduce pace asset purchases. this start point market need adjust world diverge monetary policies. since then, federal reserve entirely cease asset purchase slowly reduce monthly purchase zero december 2013 october 2014. subsequently, debate shift time rate hike cycle. while unite state (us) bi central bankers’ speech 1 show sound economic performance amid resurgent domestic spending, indication monetary authority need reduce accommodative stance interest rates, market choose focus lack consumer wage inflation. consequently, divergence indication feed official market price expect path interest rates, add uncertainty volatility market. more recently, labour market statistic federal open market committee (fomc) communication see market move bring forward rate hike expectations, chance december hike price around 74 per cent. during period uncertainty u markets, european central bank (ecb) embark quantitative ease consequential negative interest rates. on 18 november 2015, germany issue 2-year bond record low –38 basis points! the spread u 10-year yield equivalent maturity german bond trade around 175 basis points, close historic high 190 basis points. at time, china’s process transition domestic, consumption-driven economy one investment-led rely heavily exports, major factor slow overall economic growth. we acutely aware slowdown adversely affect commodity price export-driven countries, severe repercussion emerging-market economic growth, include african continent. in addition, fall oil prices, partially due downward revision chinese growth expectations, contribute keep inflation tame add deflation dilemma develop markets. today, therefore face divergent monetary policies, u verge increase interest rates, likely follow unite kingdom next, eurozone japan set continue loose monetary policies. this dichotomy present reserve manager clear dilemma: investment u treasury may produce negative return interest rate hike cycle. at time, reserve generally report u dollars, non-us dollar investment expect underperform response expect strong u dollar. this course add complexity face global policy-making investor decision-making. trend reserve management with investment environment clearly become complicated, may useful review recent trend reserve management, globally well continent. accord international monetary fund (imf) data, global foreign-exchange reserve (excluding gold special draw right (sdr) increase us$2,5 trillion us$8,3 trillion, 332 per cent, ten year 2014. over period, total foreign-exchange reserve africa increase us$81,9 billion us$271,8 billion, 331 per cent. this sudden increase reserve accumulation happen isolation. the increase globalisation economic relationship bring requirement hold additional reserves. this many reserve adequacy metric involve ratio either trade data debt level gross domestic product. consequently, economy open up, require reserve hold need increase. such strong growth reserve hold bring number change reserve management practices. accord april 2015 hsbc reserve management trend survey, conduct association central bank publications, central bank continue focus diversification non-traditional markets, australia, canada, scandinavia and, recently, china. central bank respondent survey expect chinese renminbi reach 10 per cent global reserve 2025. in term asset classes, 20 per cent central bank either invest consider investment emerging-market bond equities. furthermore, 10 per cent respondent indicate either invest consider investment exchange-traded funds. 2 bi central bankers’ speech interestingly, survey also point 70 per cent central bank active in, considering, security lending. base interaction colleague central bank continent, recent focus among african reserve manager on: (i) formalise investment decision processes; (ii) introduce use bond future efficient portfolio management; (iii) investigate viability include chinese bonds, onshore and/or offshore, reserve portfolios. work currently way auspex committee central bank governor south african development community (sadc) indicate convergence reserve management practice sub-region africa. the initial research result show reserve management activity region govern proper policy guidelines, nearly central bank adopt strategic asset allocation (saa) frameworks. it also note general approach use tranching construct reserve portfolios. the saa framework determine tranche size relevant. most central bank invest cash, cash equivalent fix income instruments, u dollar euro common currency portfolios. challenge face reserve manager with contextual backdrop, move discus challenge face reserve managers, worth reflect one consequence global financial crisis still grapple today. this deterioration credit quality reserve currencies. since 2008, use standard & poor’s ratings, see japanese government debt downgrade aa a+ u drop aaa aa+. within europe, germany remain aaa-rated, france downgrade aaa aa peripheral european country spain (from aaa bbb+) portugal (from aa- bb) saw even dramatic drop ratings. this narrow high-grade investment universe, requiring, instances, adjustment investment guideline accommodate changes. with issuer consequently fall outside traditional investment universe, find yield-enhancing asset become difficult. these challenge persist continue subdue global economic growth outlook unlikely go away anytime soon. move development recent, reference early discussion diverge monetary policies, key challenge reserve manager face since latter part 2013 around ongoing uncertainty time rise u interest rate negative yield europe. this require reserve manager take stock saa well review tactical strategies. for central bank low reserves, saa tend set along currency pattern foreign trade external debt. while debt obligation tend dollar based, trade pattern vary significantly. i remark early sadc central bank euro portfolio, reflect importance region continent. however, central bank typically invest maturity three-years, part german yield curve negative yield around 40bps. for country large reserve holdings, opportunity enhance return lengthen maturity investment add credit risk portfolio. however, strategy turn bring additional market credit risk portfolio, potentially come conflict overarch objective capital preservation. with expectation high interest rate us, dollar strengthen investor start shy away invest commodities, include gold. accord bloomberg, amount gold hold exchange-traded fund drop 2,633 tonne late 2012 1,494 tonne november 2015. there strike correlation gold hold fund dollar price gold. gold hold fund still substantially high pre-2008 level therefore risk bi central bankers’ speech 3 unwind. for south africa, decline gold price see dollar value gold hold decline us$ 7,1 billion september 2012 us$ 4,6 billion end october 2015. another consequence global financial crisis significant tighten regulatory framework. the new regulatory environment (introduction basel iii dodd-frank) financial market raise concern liquidity, especially fix income markets. the concern stem fact many global investment bank market maker adjust balance sheets, consequently business operate models, order comply new regulation deal associate cost structures. a reserve managers, acutely aware market liquidity develop confident able convert asset cash required. the risk exactly crisis time central bank may need tap reserves, crisis time market liquidity tend disappear. finally, overlook role technology, another challenge reserve manager deal with. with grow complexity investment environment reserve manager require enhance analytical skill capabilities, increase cost technology could stand way proper assessment long-term benefit essential investment. this particularly important central bank diversify new asset class across various currency instruments. it essential reserve manager invest prime technology order receive optimal risk-adjusted return reduce probability negative returns. at sarb, keenly aware benefit risk associate new technology, subject i return moment. the south african reserve bank’s response challenge one step sarb take think best deal expect high rate u include use bond future investment guideline order provide efficient way protect internally manage bond portfolio invest u major markets. secondly, saa diversify allow investment currency high credit-rated liquid bond market low debt gross domestic product (gdp) ratios. for sarb, mean fix income investment canada, sweden, south korea, china. the diversification chinese onshore bond market result strategic view long-term outlook role china global economy economic relation south africa. the chinese bond market also offer good yield together diversification benefit prove valuable. in addition diversification currency universe, sarb include high-rated cover bond mortgage-backed security saa order diversify source return reduce negative impact rise rate overall portfolio. other strategy employ sarb reduce external vulnerability ensure access foreign exchange time stress include negotiate swap line people bank china (pboc) contingent reserve agreement among brics nations. lastly, sarb make considerable investment improve technology acquire new system staff capacity future-proof reserve management function. we undertake comprehensive review system architecture use management gold foreign-exchange reserves. to end, decide replace exist it system new one, appropriate current future needs, enhance reserve management value chain. 4 bi central bankers’ speech potential opportunity reserve manager what opportunity current environment provide think next five year so? firstly, prospect high rate u provide opportunity reserve manager invest high yield safe investments. the indication fomc intend raise rate measure pace help manage risk negative portfolio returns. a central bank tend invest short maturity bond duration three year shorter, ‘sweet spot’ may exist rate expect increase modestly, long maturity investor may shorten duration order avoid losses, keep short end yield curve somewhat supported. a bulk global reserve hold u dollars, doubt initial mark-to-market losses, high rate due course increase yield portfolio. here become important reserve manager focus investment horizon, annual financial account outcomes. after global financial crisis, bond yield develop economy become highly correlate country add stimulus economy order avoid, among things, deflation. consequently, risk adjust return portfolio invest advance economy depress owe loss diversification benefits. the

conference award “governance transformation asean: reform priorities”, manila, 14 november 2015. * * * can self-interest lead great good? prior adam smith1 counter-intuitive say, “yes.” human nature, narrow sense, must, anathema proposition individual naturally uphold common good. but proceed smith’s theory, tap individuals’ natural inclination pursue interests. we motivate see good governance work benefit. self-interest therefore channel nationally desirable ends. another “irony” result - supervise entity compete adopt good governance principles! in so, cooperation regulate entities. competition toward cooperation. this provoke another thought: can regulator partner regulated? i believe so. when standard merely impose top-down, result unsustainable. to sustainability, interest regulator regulate must converge. can granular measurement lead unlimited possibilities? in asean capital market forum (acmf), i believe answer “yes”. since initiation four year ago acmf

lanka’s 65th anniversary speech mr arjuna mahendran, governor central bank sri lanka, commemorate ceremony central bank sri lanka’s 65th anniversary, central bank sri lanka, colombo, 28 august 2015. * * * today important day us. 65 year small period life institution first foremost i must thank keep torch central bank alive well sri lanka last 65 years. i know haven’t length time certainly tradition pass i think preserve well make sure move next generations’ hand good condition. at point, take step back look achieve 65 years. first all, establish 1950, statute enable establishment institution clear, in-terms objective statute le remain unchanged whole period, i think sri lankan term quite record. there haven’t significant amendment monetary law act period objective still remain same; control inflation, promotion financial stability bank sector financial system stability thrust broad economic development whole country, nutshell objective are, clear, unambiguous keep u straight narrow path fairly challenge periods. i think central bank world go sort event through, notably bomb blast know affect us, physical life several colleague family like years. and relate obviously civil strive country go almost thirty years. nevertheless i think central bank maintain financial stability, keep inflation reasonably control, economic development country do reasonably well despite challenges, small measure due effort successive generation central banker stick principle large keep momentum country move forward. so appropriate u take moment accept little bite self-congratulation point time. and certainly, endeavor see promote noble ideal take country institution even high heights, peace country lot hurdle central bank face last three decade behind u gear promote objective institution relatively normal circumstance future. to this, ass three objective mean broad sense i reach last six month regard. first all, look control inflation, i think fortuitously resolve external events. you see global market fall commodity price worldwide. the large country appear last decade, china, indulge lot spend last ten year revive global economy process, commodity price shoot cause small measure problem us. but now, spend boom see, china’s growth slow down. and consequence, also benefit fall commodity price therefore inflation easy control. on financial stability front, i would say bank system look reasonably good shape. that partly bank extremely conservative last twenty thirty year war situation lend aggressively. more recently saw become little aggressive get bite burn agriculture bi central bankers’ speech 1 affect drought last year. then saw big exposure gold pawn activity also affect bank balance sheet slightly. most problem i glad say, seem behind us. so bank system look fairly good shape. finance company pose concern and. i think far many them. we bite liberal in-terms encourage finance company growth last ten fifteen years. a consequence, today cop unusual situation sector. but again, resolve box thinking, able bring sector also control. so all, i think financial system respond favourably. we several infrastructural challenge ahead u make stock markets, bond market foreign currency market work market really respond challenge bring participants, broaden appeal become real instrument channel save sri lankans also people live overseas institution real business benefit flow financial activity grow strong pace grow past. that broad challenge go forward time ensure allow sort excess creep in, situation cause financial disturbance panics. so go challenge go forward us, establish stability clear set rules. remember way financial market evolve historically century basis “rule-based” systems, every player market, whether regulator regulated, abide set rules. and effective way system function. it cannot base whim fancy regulator, government single player market. there even play field, goalpost stick firmly place rule apply, like game football cricket. you cannot change rule go along. that me, essential. so moment try make rule clear market player various forms. we already do markets, foreign exchange market, fix income markets, i think sec try establish rule equity market. once come together i think see significant improvement way entire financial sector operate hopefully main conduit finance development year come. so deal le challenge financial space effort ensure financial stability. but really, third objective, economic development country i wish spend minute today. this area, which, various reason central bank engage disengage year decades. basically, bank take backward step fifteen twenty year ago understandably so, time war rag problem contend with, particularly in-terms ensure stability. therefore central bank pursue aggressively strategy engage rural sector broad development entire country. we le stick basic activity in-terms financial stability optimization inflation control economic development objective take slightly backseat. i think incumbent u really re-engage government, social sector players, sort industry groups, agriculture groups, service sector group really map way forward country grow. when look situation bad, hand lot work done. take instance fact entire northern province contribute 4% total national gdp. that simply unacceptable. we nine province country cannot one contribute 4%. that simply unbalanced, opportunity northern province three branches, trincomalee, jaffna kilinochchi, reason cannot spur bank institution northern province come umbrella really see economic potential region achieved. it simple. we see bank institution work coordinate basis look resource area country has, 2 bi central bankers’ speech whether manpower land unutilized, agricultural potential. i say focus northern province, even southern province. we branch matara, i think lot work done. i recently visit area around hambanthota, i find potential really, still exploited. there factory there, agricultural project funding, nowhere near sort potential achieve particularly since much infrastructure instal area build recent years. i think infrastructure used. we rather comic situation today airport use store paddy mismatch need airport economical need broad economy press problem achieved. so classic example put think cap come solution government. one big advantage central banker decades, man important government institutions. even i look today, institution vary ministry defense, ministry finance like senior central banker work form another. and even legal sector, attorney general’s department work closely us. i think significant role play in-terms capacity build bank sector, several sector vital economy. that challenge remember try participate. i myself, i work institution decade ago, ministry industries, treasury, enrich experience personally. but time, i carry expertise i pick central bank enrich institution well. so tradition continue i think incumbent central bank really use manpower. all concentrate pool brainpower country. i think institution many qualify individuals. we engineers, people sort fields, economics, institution, really build skill sets. one plan i have, i discuss dgs, ags, try deepen skill sets. we identify specific skill set necessary central bank first instance, also broad nation try deepen skill set conscious basis manpower development, call improvement human capital become much entrench become much integrate in-terms national economic developmental effort. just give example, enough accountant government service. when i talk police, cid, attorney general’s department, department accountants. they cannot analyze see balance sheet corporate case, know handle it. there desperate shortage manpower, partly accountant country get much good salary work private sector. now bridge gap? i think give central bank secure service – maybe pay much private sector give security tenure, get epf pension – sort long-term prospect attract good people institution continue basis. i try way fight government get increase wage u also reinstate pension i hope make much attractive people work institution keep move away private sector. but process also develop skill set really organize prepare challenge future. the future i think go look different past country. we reach level normalcy u never experience lifetimes. the year i join institution, 1983, problem ethnic issue started, unfortunately. and rag almost thirty years. so i think u really experience normalcy result, people really prepare take challenge normal market economy look like. hence, really incumbent us, define country, government, people. and propagate message bi central bankers’ speech 3 much forceful in-terms use media, whether newspapers, television social media, bring forward view think future sri lanka look like. obviously consultation government, people, i said, various institution government coordinate u come comprehensive message, use annual report publications, continue project report, view, map future engage government achieved, stress need financial stability, control inflation see economic development take place optimal manner. that i think really challenge us. we imagine future go look like. and moment i think best institution so. so challenge ahead us. it easy change mindsets. remember, lot people country, particularly work government use war situation. for work lives, live war economy. a war economy different economy peace. that, view, change government year new government, try win peace. we war, difficult win peace. why? because mindset stick past. there concept control. you control everything economy include prices. when i say prices, i mean exchange rates, interest rates, price affect function economy. that justifiable war situation. but come peace situation, normal function market economy, re-think, get back first principles, reassess economy work new dispensation. that challenge us, i’m ask join effort try redefine scope everything central bank, see reorient towards win peace broad sense, make financial sector, economy type institution country work effective manner raise growth, potential economy, raise skill levels, importantly, bring ethnic harmony i think amply demonstrate today in-terms religion faith come together propagate message peace goodwill, time hop good sri lanka us, child grandchildren. so simple message, i thank much efforts. i think last six month steep learn curve, come back reorient institution, dear heart. i observe tremendous improvement, in-terms several process never i leave institution 1993. i find still i think sri lanka country great potential. we geographically situate location center fast grow population cohort, globally. a know, last twenty thirty year era china. china grow massively fast-growing population. also east asian country around it, like south korea, taiwan, singapore hong kong mount economic miracle open market make exchange rate competitive basically get huge amount foreign investment. that model work effectively model really open emerge market prosper. but face problem. their population stop grow young, creative worker come workforce in-order make economy continue grow fantastic rate growth achieve several decades; 10–12% rate economic growth. so challenge country around indian ocean. particularly southern indian ocean. the whole saarc region include india, sri lanka, pakistan, bangladesh, even maldives way, look middle east, part middle east prospering, particularly uae, oman, qatar similar country whole african continent, may may know, billion people. this almost size china ten year ago. if africa get go vast store mineral type natural resources, really see transformation part world. this part indian ocean 4 bi central bankers’ speech will, i think, really fast grow region world ten years’ time. but part that, head start in-terms human capital. i travel region intensively nowhere i find quality manpower sri lanka. when i use go pakistan ten year ago, client use tell teacher use ceylon. we famous teachers, even singapore regional countries, ceylonese teacher use go teach 1960s teach child speak, read write english fond memory this. this show ahead curve, ceylon, know in-terms groom teach people basic skills. for instance, senior doctor singapore ceylonese go across, include people judicial sector. the current finance minister singapore tharman shanmugaratnam father sri lankan jaffna go across still member medical faculty singapore university. so head start in-terms human capital. all people know, hunger education, whether go village rich family cities, great hunger education. to strength. we good human capital resource i would wager, per caput basis even india country region. so provide real lead edge. our people world. wherever go, look expatriates, sri lankans country, anywhere world – i caribbean, place like barbados, even find sri lankans. and well professional endeavours. so reach diaspora, i call it, ensure also come help u already within country, sufficient pool people really lead charge, in-terms raise sri lanka’s profile also attract foreign investment resource help country provide leadership region decade ahead. so remember great challenge us, institution go epicenter country’s effort develop itself. president maithripala sirisena visit us, week ago, make clear main objective see people’s income increase. that objective. he spell objective. how achieve that? that sit brainstorm. to key challenge raise productivity. productivity important, output per capita. this key element utilize. we see harness use information technology leapfrog lot time waste useless war end five year ago see really enable make economy grow, leapfrog 21st century, start use it type skill make u modern economy raise productivity level lag last thirty forty years. that i think key challenge focus on, achieve really you. it idea make happen. so thank much again, i wish best next 65 years, i don’t know many u i sure young people join bank certainly large measure time. and i think everything disposal achieve i set out. it really make happen. so thank much god bless you. bi central bankers’ speech 5 delisle worrell: the barbados ibfs sector efficiency international commerce

overstate importance bank union european construction project and, particular, ensure sound work economic monetary union (emu). a true monetary union among sovereign state confine use banknote coin country, denomination trade transaction metric. monetary union require condition liquidity exchange homogeneous across entire area. insofar exchange typically intermediate financial institutions, mean whose liability trade financial transaction settled, appropriate flow liquidity within monetary union demand risk associate liability depend location institution issue them. naturally, achieve homogeneity, bank crisis-prevention management mechanism need along risk-mutualisation arrangement minimise link national economic fiscal condition ability preserve value bank liability jurisdiction. these requirement include single supervisory mechanism prevention tool, single resolution mechanism pursue homogenous treatment bank viability problem common fund make economically feasible, integrate deposit guarantee scheme ensure identical coverage throughout monetary area eligible deposit-holders. we already claim project set bank union include above-mentioned ingredient close become tangible reality. just week back celebrate first anniversary start-up first three pillar bank union project, single supervisory mechanism (ssm); single resolution mechanism, second pillar bank union, way fully operational 1 january 2016. admittedly, certain relevant aspect still set train. first, single resolution fund must strengthen ensure strong enough withstand future bank crises, without destabilise public finance country concerned. further, must step effort move forward third pillar bank union, establishment common deposit guarantee scheme, base proposal release european commission last week. i would like focus today single supervisory mechanism, develop component bank union. in connection, i shall review milestone reach address i consider main challenge ahead us. 2. ssm milestone the first ssm milestone take place precisely assume full supervisory responsibility, entail successfully conduct “comprehensive assessment” significant euro area bank groups. this review help enhance information situation 2 bi central bankers’ speech european bank identify measure could necessary strengthen solvency. in respect, recall spanish bank evidence few incident asset quality review process, entail adjustment little 0.1% risk-weighted assets. this outcome, along limit impact stress tests, highlight fact reform spanish bank system undertake previous year meet objectives. at present, work stress test schedule come year. this test, follow methodology european bank authority, make sample bank – six spanish – cover 70% euro area bank assets. the result publish start third quarter 2016. one main challenge ssm outset make complex governance structure workable. this complexity derive institutional restriction impose treaty, need ensure separation monetary policy prudential supervision function attribute ecb, objective achieve suitable incorporation national authority new framework without impinge ecb’s leadership supervisory decisions. a know, central ssm body supervisory board, responsible plan implementation oversight task submit decision-making proposal govern council, latter may approve object to, amend. the board make 25 members: chair, vice-chair, four member appoint ecb govern council representative national supervisory authority 19 participate member states. the supervisory board intensely involve ssm’s key actions, result competency directly attribute prevail european regulation absence extensive delegation powers. indeed, first year alone, supervisory board adopt around 1,200 decision proposals. this heavy workload, far great habitually case maximum decision-making body supervisory agency jurisdictions, operational challenge high order board far respond considerable effectiveness, maintain high frequency face-to-face meet complement numerous teleconference write procedures. more generally, start-up ssm necessitate major change internal structure ecb national authorities. in case ecb, four new directorate general microprudential supervision created, staff increase assign new function 1,000 employees. at time, national authority make great effort adapt new framework. in case banco de españa, directorate general bank supervision restructure department reorganise create structure mirror adopt ecb, provide smooth interaction institutions. however, significant change creation joint supervisory teams, make employee ecb national authorities. these team basis day-to-day supervision significant bank. they coordinate ecb member staff, assist one several sub-coordinators national authorities, coordinator draw support organisation work management local teams. this admittedly novel design response need combine centralise management framework harness knowledge proximity bank national supervisor provide. it stress two-thirds member team national supervisors. the staff authority also generally entrust lead on-site inspection within jurisdiction. moreover, know, national bi central bankers’ speech 3 supervisory agency keep function relate direct surveillance so-considered le significant banks. this explain start-up ssm mean save supervisory resource national level. on contrary, national authority address considerable challenge pose loss human resource ecb. in case, thank success banco de españa candidate selection processes, approximately one-quarter supervisory

framework pursuit supervisory function ssm. in connection, work perform since outset project define common framework action enable different practice pursue different national authorities, greatly differ supervisory cultures, overcome. this work saw supervisory manual devise process operational methodology described. naturally, certain key aspect supervisory procedure still smoothed. in fact, manual see evolve document, regular update basis experience accumulate need complete convergence towards good supervisory practices. likewise, achieve great consistency regulatory framework, also necessary review national application various option permit european regulations. european solvency regulation – namely directive regulation capital requirement – confer degree discretion upon member state national supervisor implementation specific regulatory aspects. such aspect include timetable progressive adoption new solvency standard grant exception respect compliance certain prudential requirements. this degree national flexibility accept time european legislator complex directive regulation negotiations. naturally, fact diversity rule place hamper supervisory action prevent homogenous treatment bank base objective position. accordingly, recent months, ssm supervisory board work intensely field. their effort see preliminary agreement allow common approach adopt relation application “national option discretions” hand supervisory authorities. the term agreement subject public consultation, process finalise 16 december. i trust agreement, finally approve ecb, may implement open month 2016 that, event, future revision european legislation envisage le room discretion part member states, singleness relevant legal framework bank activity throughout eu may become firmly anchored. to wrap first part speech, allow highlight certain relevant decision take supervisory board first year. among important relate supervisory review evaluation process (srep), first time carry common methodology ssm banks. this process, include quantitative qualitative aspects, determine risk profile significant institution, sufficiency liquidity solvency term profile and, finally, set minimum capital level maintained. the decision capital, adoption 2016 shortly formalised, will, ssm’s significant institutions, entail average capital requirement somewhat high previous year: around 30 basis point (bp), rise 50 bp impact phasing-in capital buff envisage european legislation take account. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a recall, january year recommendation dividend distribution policy adopt bank urge keep conservative dividend distribution arrangement preserve solvency. this recommendation shortly reassessed. in turn, common criterion lay recur decision authorisation acquisition qualify hold credit institutions, assessment fitness properness board members, requirement make capital reduction issuances. finally, i must highlight relevant role play ssm management greek crisis. the ssm monitor situation bank continuously, but, agreement reach european greek authority last summer, entrust determine recapitalisation requirement greece’s four significant institution basis specific comprehensive assessment exercise, whose result recently published. in come months, ssm must ensure recapitalisation bank go ahead stipulated. 3. some challenge that said, i state outset, ssm numerous challenge face near future. i would like mention four particular. firstly, microprudential policy stance seek must clearly defined. the ssm, despite exemplary start-up, still construction criteria, practice specific objective yet reach degree stability desirable. evidently, must shorten transition far possible, bank aware sufficient certainty supervisor’s requirement short medium term can, way, effectively design strategic management measures. true, objective currently hamper still-unstable international regulatory framework. i trust basel committee’s announce intention recent report g20 see regulatory reform next year fulfilled. in event, supervisory realm must make effort specify great precision permanence solvency requirement bank base risk profile, establish certain clear guideline application restriction remuneration capital instrument directors’ variable remuneration. at time, i previously point out, must continue work convergence supervisory practices, move towards good standards, smooth difference still persist across different ssm jurisdictions. for example, national authority traditionally focus review management procedures, others place particular emphasis review classification valuation asset financial statements. these difference supervisory practice involve, turn, heterogeneity professional profile employee various authority share mission within ssm. against background, banco de españa tradition – one i think comprehensively successful – confer high importance supervisory work monitor rigour financial information model use calculate risk-weighted assets. naturally, wish elements, crucially affect supervisor’s capacity properly measure banks’ solvency situation, part common model adopt ssm apply uniformly banks. a third significant challenge concern achieve fruitful framework interaction ssm single resolution mechanism. the regulation set place complex structure europe, include creation resolution agency (the single resolution board) separate institutionally supervisor. this agency grant wide-ranging power respect definition resolvability requirement – include determination minimum volume instrument capable absorb loss – bi central bankers’ speech 5 activation resolution procedure non-viable banks, well selection suitable tool implement them. resolution action direct consequence financial stability, public good ssm seek protect, turn vulnerable banks, precisely require great attention prudential supervisor. accordingly, define effective information analysis co-operation exchange procedure supervisory resolution board crucial prevent dysfunctions, overlap friction hamper proper function bank union. a memorandum understand agency currently draw will, i hope, contribute achieve necessary coordination. lastly, sustain effort order achieve degree cohesion various component ssm effective supervision requires. the ssm directly supervise 122 european bank groups, encompass 1,200 institutions. this do supervisory team draw staff various institutions, highly diverse skill sets, seniority, experience work conditions. evidently, must strive fully develop sense mission component part must contribute, leadership ecb supervisory board, without exclusion unnecessary subordination. that vital maintain motivation commitment ssm supervisory staff, irrespective authority attached. indeed, date show exceptional professionalism. final remark in concluding, i say past year see major headway set bank union place, still way go. we must move ahead set complex european bank industry. specifically, economic activity remain relatively sluggish, price stability subject significant risk and, result this, interest rate hold low levels. against background, bank business feel effect difficulty reactivate credit, modest net interest income impair asset still balance sheets. and compound grow regulatory demand which, though conducive industry’s stability medium term, raise pressure short term profitability. it essential set manager supervisor revise soundness banks’ business model and, particular, capacity generate resource stable manner ensure satisfactory level profitability solvency medium term. that may require correction european bank industry’s excess capacity apparently prevail present. it important authority involve attempt facilitate process – event lead bank – correction come orderly fashion possible. thank much. ignazio visco: the bank italy’s analysis household finance conclude remark mr ignazio visco, governor bank italy, conference “the bank italy’s analysis household finance – fifty year the survey household income wealth financial accounts”, rome, 4 december 2015. * * * andrea brandolini contribute widely remark perceptive suggestion insights. it great pleasure close conference celebrate 50 year bank italy’s survey household income wealth (shiw) – 51 financial accounts. over half century, micro-data former aggregate estimate latter provide essential information economic statistical analysis carry bank italy, inform influence policy-making process. there also personal note, however. throughout long professional life bank, i often rely data. i hope forgive if, conclude remarks, i shall indulge personal memories. prologue: survey forerunner household budget long attract attention social scientists. since mid-19th century many researcher gather detail information expense revenue individual households. these budget data stimulate study consumption behaviour family farmers, manual worker clerks, contribute detection empirical regularity engel’s law. italian economist statistician play crucial role formalise results. in classical article “the early history empirical study consumer behavior”, george stigler refer rodolfo benini corrado gini author first modern statistical demand studies, gustavo del vecchio first estimate, 1912, (food) consumption function. use budget data number countries, del vecchio calculate income elasticity comprise 0.4 0.8, average 0.6.1 the paper present conference neri, rondinelli scoccianti imply income elasticity 0.66, although total expenditure rather food alone.2 a surprise regularity, century later! however useful study consumer behaviour, individual budget cannot tell u much distribution income expenditure. in june 1947, italian minister budget luigi einaudi – still formally governor bank italy, late elect president italian republic – advocate meet constituent assembly need produce report “the standard live italian citizens, incomes, social category divided”. thereafter, einaudi, del vecchio, serve treasury minister, giuseppe pella, finance minister, commission sample survey household income purpose provide sound basis economic policies. the survey conduct istituto doxa, private agency 1 g.j. stigler, “the early history empirical study consumer behavior”, journal political economy 62, 1954, 95–113; g. del vecchio, “relazioni fra entrata e consumo”, giornale degli economisti 54 (n.s.), 1912, 111–142, 228–254, 389–439. del vecchio use italian data, individual budget relatively scarce italy france germany. however, giovanni vecchi recently dig many 11,500 individual budget period 1855–1911, plus another 9,500 year 1965. see s. chianese e g. vecchi, “bilanci di famiglia”, g. vecchi, in ricchezza e povertà. il benessere

1951. by dig bank italy’s archives, recently find survey eventually pay full bank, also design help economist research department. it director, bank’s governor 25 year later, paolo baffi, set letter luzzatto fegiz main purpose survey “ascertaining prevalent opinion allocation give income rise… consumption saving, distinguish former current expense durable good latter direct investment (real estate businesses), financial asset savings”.4 for unknown reason bank’s primary role survey publicised, testify involvement bank italy first attempt measure income consumption behaviour italian households. this involvement remarkable reveal early support bank use representative probability sampling. official sample survey still infancy: become accept statistical agency unite state 1940s start current population survey.5 the bank’s position even significant see background environment necessarily favourable statistical tool.6 the readiness engage new statistical technique example bank’s attitude towards pay attention take advantage development frontier research. the survey continue source innovation. this happened, instance, regard dissemination results: first, 1980s, release anonymised micro-data academic researchers; then, participation since 1990s luxembourg income study, international cooperative project assembly standardisation income data household level. the integration use production statistical data the bank’s involvement (second) doxa survey also noteworthy since show statistical collection conceive closely connect need economic analysis outset. this take granted. still 1985, zvi griliches observe “while economist increase use survey recent year even begin design commission special purpose survey own, general, data collection thus responsibility quality collect material still largely delegate census bureaus, survey research centers, similar institutions, divorce direct supervision responsibility analyze team”.7 the history bank italy’s shiw

carlo azeglio ciampi’s reluctance accept proposal create statistical division within research department grind bank’s economist know best statistic needed, therefore also best suited, potential users, involve production. a good example need dialogue data producer economic analyst credit rationing. in order estimate extent household access credit, require complex set interrelate questions, first ask respondent whether think apply loan, whether actually make application, finally whether get it. credit-rationed borrower household deny loan, grant entire amount requested. on basis long time series start 1989, credit condition confirm ease italy 2014 peak reach 2012, although yet back pre-crisis situation. the rich formulation questionnaire also allow monitor broad concept borrow constraints, consider call article borrow constraint “discouraged borrowers”, household refrain ask loan anticipate application turn down.8 likewise, assessment financial vulnerability over-indebtedness rely detail information analysis combine data income, debt service payment liabilities. this show paper d’alessio iezzi, bartiloro, michelangeli rampazzi discuss conference,9 well regular use shiw data regular analysis macroeconomic development financial stability.10 the anticipation economic agents, whether consumer businessmen, play central role decision make, measurement far straightforward.11 unsurprisingly, household expectation recurrent topic survey. a show alfonso rosolia, household ask already first survey mid-1960s whether anticipate income increase reduction year ahead, would allocate income gain save various consumption items. the eagerness bank’s researcher turn question far sophisticate exercise survey 1989, respondent confront full probabilistic format prospect labour

face answer probabilistic questions. in survey 1989, 57 per cent household anticipate rise income, 6.5 per cent average, many one five household answer. in last wave survey proportion household fail provide answer fell 5 per cent, overwhelm majority, 83 per cent, predict income change one year ahead. this might reasonable give recent income dynamics, may also signal difficulty account uncertain outcomes. there need research, experiment measure expectation worthy exercise. it undoubtedly enhance survey’s reputation. indeed, charles manski include among “major platform methodological exploration substantive research” use probabilistic format elicit expectations.14 manski also mention one survey firm use probabilistic question elicit business expectations: italian survey investment manufacturing. this also carry bank italy since mid-1980s good example cross-fertilisation among different research areas. micro-data necessary complement macro-data elicit expectation measure complex economic concept accomplishment shiw. it main contribution allow u account heterogeneity household characteristic behaviour analysis italian economy. when start mid-1960s, bank italy’s survey provide virtually first detail information budget italian household since doxa survey 1948. it information prove extremely valuable. draw personal experience, i remember use survey data mid-1970s calculate

personal friend many u many year invaluable consultant bank, play crucial role restructuring. albert make two important points. first, argue necessary increase size sample, possibly reduce frequency offset cost increase, order capture behaviour small demographic group (he mind distinguish old person live alone old person live young person). second, stress inability survey measure financial asset liabilities, implicitly suggest serious effort necessary cover variable satisfactorily – although admit special insight so, inability appear “peculiarly italian problem”.19 both albert’s suggestion

even earlier, 1970s,26 although global financial crisis may somewhat modify them. in unite state ratio real asset household disposable income fell back 4.2 2013, although italy still stand 6.6 2014. the increase wealth may reflect accumulation personal save change asset values. but save rate seem show mark increases; anything, country decline trend. so, much substantial rise wealth-to-income

summit financial service industry, manila, 24 november 2015. * * * good morning everyone welcome first cybersecurity summit financial service industry. we bangko sentral ng pilipinas together summit co-organizers bancnet information security officer group please join u today tackle matter cybercrimes. it fact: cybercrime commit financial institution financial consumer targeted. question asked: be widespread? can stop cybercrimes? how protect financial institution financial consumer cybercrimes? distinguish representative financial service industry, technology partners, stakeholder financial sector, need address issue together. digital transformation financial service industry in digital age, transformative power technology evident almost aspect human undertake - modern science, education, health care, financial markets, personal interaction. technology likewise revolutionize bank manner provide service products. financial customer perform bank transaction anytime, anywhere, convenience. we also see adoption technology bsp supervise financial institution call bsfis offer innovative product delivery fast efficient service affordable prices. and technology, financial

one hundred bank across country. indeed, see volume value transaction use e-money e-banking channel grow steadily years. clearly, technology innovation become integral part business consider “must” bsfis survive thrive digital world. however, fields, downside come innovation technology - criminal element likewise evolved. while far widespread, cybercrime exploit advance technology expand, conceal perpetrate criminal activity real world cyber realm. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the cyber landscape indeed, cybercrime spawn global industry skilled hackers-for-hire, terrorist syndicate target critical institutions, infrastructure economies. the philippine spar cybercrimes. consider social medium capital world, philippine radar screen cyber criminal try cyber attack vary complexities. nevertheless, industry cooperation enable u stop capture cybercriminals. for instance, authority arrest foreign national associate cyber syndicate involve atm skimming, credit card fraud, phishing incidents. can stop cybercrimes? well, study indicate cyber attack similar fraudulent activity financial service industry likely continue. but manage risk relate cybercrimes. lady gentlemen. our proper response broaden, deepen escalate anti-cybercrime program activity together. the stake high: institutional personal loss result cybercrime could undermine public’s trust confidence financial institution ultimately financial system. the right mindset so, ensure industry-wide cyber security? how benefit technology innovation manage attendant risk vulnerabilities? well, accord seacen paper , right mindset holistic multi-stakeholder approach manage cyber security must adopted. at bangko sentral, reduce three major theme form acronym pin. a know, pin refer personal identification number must keep secure time owners, prevent unauthorized access accounts. allow share pin mean bsp term fight cybercrime: p proactive, reactive; i information share collaboration; n constant reminder cybercrime not technical issue. i briefly discus themes. p “proactive, reactive” give dynamic technology landscape, room complacency, one proactive. while may take year develop robust effective security infrastructure, may take minute even second cyber criminal breach defenses. and criminal gain access sensitive critical information, could trigger financial losses, business disruptions, damage reputation, even threaten viability institution itself. this call continue cycle rigorous assessment institution’s security versus emerge threat risks. cyber security controls, process procedure must bi central bankers’ speech 3 continuously enhance mitigate weak point achieve high state resilience maturity. this rationale underpin bangko sentral’s policy continuously enhance supervisory framework issuance guidelines, public advisory memoranda, well adoption robust dynamic supervisory program. for instance bsp circular no. 808 issue august 2013 provide framework technology risk management take account robust multi-layered security control cyber-risk prevention, detection response. the bsp also introduce various initiative supervisory enhancement proactive approach cybersecurity supervision oversight. these shall discuss detail late bsp deputy governor nestor a. espenilla, jr. i “information share collaboration” with increase sophistication coordination

cyber attack protect accounts. indeed, cyber security share responsibility, u role play make cyber landscape safer, secure resilient. n “not technical issue” lady gentlemen, cybersecurity achieve merely deploy state-of-the-art security appliance devices. in fact, number organization secure defense subject cyber-attacks. more technical issue, cyber security top priority concern board senior management. cyber security initiative investment must support high level management ensure sustainability adoption across process within organizations. a wise man said, “tone top” define institution’s cyber security culture. give crucial role board senior management play create safe sound cyber security regime, i please see ceos, member board senior management summit. this speak executive walk talk 4 bi central bankers’ speech ensure cyber security; also reflect high degree cyber governance financial service industry. you deserve round applause. part shoot lady gentlemen. we fortunate u summit, distinguish expert deal cybercrimes. also u industry player deeply involve ensure cyber security discus current emerge cyber threat confront financial service industry. also discussion international

kasekende, deputy governor bank uganda, launch 2015 agricultural finance yearbook, kampala, 1 december 2015. * * * hon member parliament, the executive director, economic policy research centre, the leadership team uganda agribusiness alliance representative giz development partners, representative ministries, department agency gou, all distinguish participants, good evening, let begin commend everyone work 2015 agricultural finance yearbook contribution project. before launch yearbook, i would like comment two issue address i believe especially pertinent agricultural policy: first, appropriate role budget second, characteristic support need smallholder farmers. the modernisation agriculture require support government budget supply public good service need farmers. however, budgetary resource scarce hence essential allocate area expenditure generate high social rate return. a demonstrate chapter 1.4 yearbook, fiscal issues, provision tax exemption agriculture agricultural lending, various kinds, deliver few, any, tangible benefit farmer country. any benefit accrue tax exemption mostly capture non-farm sectors, importer banks, pass farmers. this find consistent generally know tax exemption country world; rarely effective difficult target accurately entail substantial loss public revenues. the scope tax exemption curtail 2014/15 budget, step right direction. give findings, remain tax exemption abolish quickly public resource focus area really deliver benefit farmers. public expenditure contribute agricultural development, maximise benefit highly constrain budget resource envelope, spend must allocate efficiently. the priority public spend agriculture good service clearly characteristic public goods, cannot supply market optimal manner. in addition, good benefit smallholder farmer constitute vast majority farmer uganda. example good service agricultural extension service research development. the modernisation agriculture require comprehensive, country wide, agricultural extension services. such service fund predominantly public resources. in addition, budget resource need ensure rural infrastructure, rural feeder roads, adequate support commercial agriculture throughout country. scarce budget resource misallocated provision subsidy marketable inputs, especially benefit mainly large farmers. the second issue i want highlight develop feasible strategy transformation smallholder farming. chapter 2.2 yearbook present interest 2 bi central bankers’ speech find project run one acre fund aim support smallholder east africa; find consistent similar project research region. the support smallholder farmer need enable increase yield raise income holistic. it include technical advice train use improve agricultural techniques, provision improve seed fertiliser together credit purchase inputs, repayment credit align sale farm output, train support post harvest handle storage. with holistic support package, substantial increase farm output income realised. the provision finance alone little help smallholder farmer overcome constraint face raise farm yield market output. unfortunately, small minority country’s 3 million smallholder farm household currently receive type holistic support provide one acre fund similar projects, address constraint face. to modernise agriculture, approach must apply much widely, smallholder benefit. both public sector non government organisation contribute objective, self evident substantial public resource require fund it, emphasis importance properly prioritise public spend agriculture. modernise agriculture one difficult challenge face uganda, give 60 percent labour force rely agriculture primary source income, challenge central socio-economic development poverty reduction. despite country’s abundant natural resources, uganda’s agricultural performance poor; real output growth fail even match population growth rate last two decade labour productivity sector low. modernise agriculture integral uganda’s development plans, objective realised, need well think feasible strategies, focus support smallholder farmers. by highlight constraint face farmer different sub-sectors uganda initiative help alleviate them, agricultural finance yearbook contribute strengthen agricultural policies. i would like formally launch 2015 agricultural finance yearbook. thank listening. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andrew gracie: ccp resolution end too big fail agenda speech mr andrew gracie, executive director resolution bank england, 21st annual risk usa conference, new york city, 22 october 2015. * * * one goal global reform since financial crisis end too big fail (tbtf). this resolution agenda – aim ensure event global systemically important financial institution (g-sifi) fail minimal interruption activity firm critical function broad financial system. and achieve outcome without recourse taxpayer bailouts, public authority force crisis. progress develop new paradigm global systemically important bank (g-sibs) impressive. key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions1 agree g20 leader around time four year ago. statutory regime consistent standard place us, eu japan – fact handful jurisdiction g-sibs headquartered. crisis management group (cmgs) work resolution plan g-sibs. the authority participate cmgs commit senior level resolvability assessment process (rap) resolution strategy emerge g-sibs. these cmgs work towards identify barrier make resolution work removed. often barrier consistent across

consultation document2 minimum standard total loss absorb capacity (tlac) last november commit produce final standard ahead g20 summit next month antalya. this major step road end “too big fail.” additionally, need pursue tbtf agenda type g-sifis, particular central counterparties (ccps). i want spend time today talk – anything – take resolution bank relevant ccps. context ccp resolution ccps form key part global financial landscape. they become ever important since crisis. this continue mandatory central clear introduce around world. address systemic risk associate over-the-counter (otc)

thus, ensure level supervisory intensity match risks, something 1 http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_111104cc.pdf?page_moved=1 2

(april 2014). 2 bi central bankers’ speech supervisory colleague focus on, must also address issue happen ccp fail. this already widely recognised. so need international solution question ccp recovery resolution presents. the large ccps systemically relevant global level, important financial stability multiple jurisdiction due nature business composition member users. they serve multiple markets, dozen clear member different country clear product multiple currencies. a patch-work approach recovery resolution would risk regulatory arbitrage competitive distortion so, whilst fiscal backstop unsuccessful resolution ccp ultimately national one, best answer avoid backstop ever use develop global level. fortunately, work already underway ccp recovery resolution form important part financial

recently, fsb publish 2015 ccp workplan5. a part this, group financial market infrastructure (fmi cbcm), equivalent cross-border crisis management group (cbcm) i chair banks, establish within fsb take

speech 3 issue around continuity portability subject work within fsb course come year. together, initiative improve resilience recovery arrangement ccps member help reduce probability ccp default. but improvement resilience necessary may sufficient. no institution “fail sfe”. ultimately, need credible resolution approach ccps. if do, resolution offer continue benefit help incentivise recovery remove expectation taxpayer compel step in. by contrast, credible regime resolution, run risk weaken incentive manage ccp prudently, well incentive clear member contribute ccp’s recovery get trouble. the benefit resolution market discipline recovery common financial institutions. but insight bank relevant ccps. before go far talk similarities, i note – although go without say – ccps different bank clear member many important respects, include business models, legal structure balance sheets. ccp recovery resolution therefore pose specific issues, i touch today. however, base principle common resolution systemically important institution. perhaps obvious similarity resolution bank ccps common objective: resolution deliver continuity critical economic function without reliance solvency support taxpayer achieve it. for continuity achieve enough financial loss institution fully absorbed; going-concern resource institution, successor institution, must restore sufficient level command market confidence prior post-resolution restructure wind-down. in case banks, mean bank suffer loss erode go concern capital point trigger resolution met, (i) enter resolution; (ii) creditor bail recapitalise firm; (iii) bail-in replicate would happen court-based commercial restructure insolvency. in words, loss allocate accord creditor hierarchy without value destruction create hard stop insolvency. this ensure resolution provide continuity meet safeguard creditor bad insolvency. while essential element resolution, likely play differently context ccp. loss absorb capacity ccp resolution let start discuss loss-absorbing capacity need ccp resolution. the use bail-in tool bank unlock loss absorb capacity non-equity part balance sheet, part would otherwise bear loss insolvency voluntary restructuring. apply concept go go concern resource ccps le straightforward task. unlike bank, ccp’s loss absorb resource sit balance sheet margin default fund form contingent claim members. consistent pfmis, arrangement intend comprehensive least insofar cover loss could arise clear member default. that beg question additional loss absorbency resolution ccp currently unlock recovery cannot unlock already. the question loss absorbency one fsb look at. do need additional resource waterfall beyond exist fund unfunded resources? if additional resource required, initial margin hold ccp make available would suffer loss insolvency? or ccps hold resolution resource instead? 4 bi central bankers’ speech i prejudge debate here. however, i think value clarify mean expression “tlac ccps”. total loss absorb capacity simply short-hand subordinate debt. it instead qualitative judgement credibility feasibility different type resource ccp absorb loss replenish go concern requirements. ccps different liability structure bank therefore assessment absorbency structure appropriateness additional form lac likely different bank same. that assessment lac need consider extent unfunded commitment member rely upon give procyclicality call stress circumstances. it mean assess credibility allocate loss via cash call variation margin haircutting incentive generate clear member client continue clear ccp. and also mean look loss absorbency clear member default also ccp’s capacity absorb loss recapitalise loss spring operational loss cover full loss allocation arrangement members. point entry resolution one issue necessarily intertwine question resource point entry resolution. a i described, resolution financial reconstruction. for effective cannot exercise financial resource firm already exhausted. if decide resource available resolution lie principally within exist waterfall, would suggest resolution authority must ability intervene take action end waterfall. but boundary lie? the uk resolution regime set statutory definition entry resolution point ccp fail likely fail reasonable prospect action take restore viability. integral test principle forward-looking judgement, capable exercise flexibly different point ccp’s distress dependent multitude factor drive eventual decision time. that make difficult pin single universal trigger point possible identify circumstance could indicative boundary reached. those possible scenario could include assessment default management procedure ccp failed, likely fail, absorb loss fully replenish ccp’s resource sufficiently timely manner allow ccp continue operate. that failure might arise legal challenge hind default management process assessment loss allow continue would exceed cap contribution could credibly absorb via means. it could also similarly arise determination realistic prospect successful auction return match book ccp’s rule allocate loss tear contract either yet available undermine financial stability objective continuity full tear-up closure service. so – line key attribute – need possible place ccp resolution loss allocation rule exhausted. these example entry resolution cause clear member default. but non-default loss could also bring ccp certainly possible breach ccp’s regulatory requirement reasonable likelihood replenish capital would present trigger point intervention. i mention incompatibility full-tear objective continuity. but intervention resolution authority cannot guarantee successful auction. to so, may still require partial tear-up force allocation would seem necessary tool resolution toolkit ccp. how loss allocate upon tear-up bi central bankers’ speech 5 go question time intervention whether tear-up take place resource available ccp exhaust it. creditor safeguard ccp resolution intervention resolution authority, especially point default management procedure yet exhaust action cannot take lightly. nor discretion resolution authority deviate exist rule ccp unbounded. appropriate creditor safeguard central ensure effective resolution regime unduly interfere property right undermine value introduce unnecessary uncertainty financial institution’s contractual relationship resolution outside it. perhaps fundamental safeguard creditor resolution action resolution authority leave bad authority intervene firm instead enter liquidation proceeding. for purpose determine no creditor bad off protection6, bank resolution take insolvency counterfactual; recognition fail bank meet condition resolution would likelihood lose licence point resolved, thereby tip insolvency (whether cash-flow, balance-sheet both) already. that insolvency counterfactual require ex post assessment value asset liability firm. that easy task one can, been, credibly undertaken. for ccps task assess insolvency counterfactual likely hard still – particularly must rely upon forecast rest waterfall would unfolded, behaviour ccp’s participant movement market day would follow resolution take place. a liquidation counterfactual must also confront argument ccp would protect insolvency full tear-up. give valuation challenges, i suspect need careful consideration give formulation practical application ncwo safeguard; must end safeguard sufficiently certain capable estimation advance creditor resolution authority able make sensible decision before, resolution. with that, let conclude sum key points: • ccp resolution necessary inevitable part overall post-crisis reform agenda end too big fail. a private, profit-making enterprise ccps must allow fail, but, give systemic importance, many need allow manner maintain continuity critical functions. • have credible resolution regime clear member big step forward help reduce risk clear member default risk ccp failure. • but reliance successful resolution member negate need ccp resolution arrangement capable respond default non-default loss emerge systemic idiosyncratic shocks. • in think underlie objective need ccp resolution regime, many similarity bank resolution forgotten, clearly many difference need recognise that. 6 see section 5 key attribute safeguards. 6 bi central bankers’ speech • effective resolution require ability act promptly point chance stabilise ccp lost. the resolution authority must variety tool disposal enable respond reason ccp failed. it able intervene timely forward-looking way end waterfall – incentive must align want set way promote ccp resilience make recovery work. • in order continue ccp’s critical service resolution, must ability cover loss credibly failure scenario recapitalise ccp’s go concern resource – i.e. capital, margin default fund. how achieve something fsb address share interest maintain stability global financial system realised. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: release financial system review open statement mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, press conference follow release financial system review, ottawa, ontario, 15 december 2015. * * * good morning. it’s pleasure senior deputy governor wilkins today talk december issue bank’s financial system review (fsr), publish morning. let take moment give context report. the fsr highlight key financial vulnerability potential trigger could turn vulnerability risk stability canada’s financial system. the fsr essential complement monetary policy report – together, two report give basis complete discussion monetary policy within risk-management framework. at last interest rate announcement, keep key policy rate unchanged, economy unfold reasonably line late projection october. we also say risk financial stability evolve expected. today’s fsr provide analysis behind assessment. our interest financial stability risk grow since financial crisis, two distinct reasons. first, global regulatory architecture strengthen prevent future crises, system adapt change need well understood. second, persistently low interest rate response crisis fuel new financial vulnerability bear constant monitoring. let start financial stability implication new regulation financial intermediaries. the global financial system clearly safe crisis. this important, mean vulnerability appear worrisome today need assess resilient system. at time, financial system adapt new regulations, must alert new vulnerability might emerge result. a one example, observer contend new capital liquidity rule lead reduce market-making secondary fixed-income market may also responsible occasional liquidity shortfall market gaps. we analyze vulnerability great depth today’s fsr. in fact, prove difficult ass liquidity issue empirically. most available data suggest government-bond liquidity may improve recent years, data tell part story. the bank recently establish canadian fixed-income forum enable continue dialogue, we’ve modify operation help alleviate issues. the govern council belief it’s important continue study matter, pertain government bonds, also asset classes. give new regulatory architecture, may know resilient market liquidity there’s true stress event. let turn vulnerability create persistently low interest rate canada. the post-crisis situation quite naturally fuel accumulation household debt, well heighten activity house sector. we observe element risky financial behaviour, two vulnerability main focus time continue grow importance since last fsr. in term household debt, income growth hasn’t keep pace increase borrowing, since mortgage growth continue rise. more borrow expected, give reduction policy interest rate early year. it’s important remember rate reduction increase vulnerability margin, they’ve also mitigate risk 2 bi central bankers’ speech financial system help offset decline income employment tie drop commodity prices. our analysis show increase number highly indebted household canada, i mean whose debt 350 per cent annual gross income. not highly indebted households, also carry grow share household debt. these people likely live british columbia, alberta ontario, house price gain largest. the govern council’s read situation vulnerability quite highly concentrate – 720,000 household fall vulnerable category. in term house market, continue see regional market evolve along different tracks, we’ve indicate before. activity energy-producing region alberta, saskatchewan, newfoundland labrador decline noticeably, expect follow decline oil prices. the house market toronto vancouver see renew momentum, drive strong employment growth migration, interprovincial international. the govern council’s base-case scenario continue constructive one: house activity stabilize line economic growth driver growth economy switch household spend non-resource exports. however, recent momentum price toronto vancouver may increase likelihood correction house prices, could affect vulnerable households. unsurprisingly, house price correct oil-producing regions. a past, illustrate certain trigger could turn vulnerability full-blown risk canadian financial system. risk assess fsr (1) severe recession would reduce households’ ability service mortgage cause broad correction house prices; (2) unexpectedly sharp rise global risk premium could spill cost domestic financing; (3) economic financial stress emanate china emerge markets; (4) downside risk resource pricing. these risk mean exhaustive rather use illustrate potential consequence vulnerability identified. other possible trigger might include large-scale credit event global resource sector sovereign credit event, example. the govern council acknowledge certain vulnerability still edge higher, overall level risk pose canadian financial system remain roughly unchanged since june report. in regard, recent change canadian authority rule mortgage finance help mitigate risk move 2016. finally, i’d note fsr feature report take close look aspect canadian global financial systems. with issue, there’s report analyze microdata relate household debt, well review mortgage securitization canada. these important useful reports, i hope you’ll take time read them. with that, carolyn i happy respond questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 takehiro sato: recent economic financial development monetary policy japan speech mr takehiro sato, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, nara, 7 december 2015. * * * the chart find bank japan’s website http://www.boj.or.jp/en/whatsnew/index.htm/. introduction thank give opportunity exchange view people represent political, economic, financial community nara prefecture. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan’s osaka branch. in today’s speech, i begin focus recent economic financial development japan abroad, well bank’s monetary policy. i touch briefly economy nara prefecture. follow speech, i would like hear view actual condition local economy bank’s conduct monetary policy. i. recent economic financial development japan abroad a. overseas economy overseas economy – mainly advance economy – continue grow moderate pace, despite slowdown emerge economies. in situation commodity energy price remain sluggish, growth rate emerge commodity-exporting economy risen, advance economy affect partly decrease investment relate resource development. this presumably mean decline commodity energy prices, first expect favorable effect world economy whole, due supply factor also influence certain degree demand factor; namely, decline demand china emerge economies. regard supply factor, textbook view supply automatically adjust price mechanism appear necessarily fit reality, resource developer continue operate price breakeven point order recover sink cost, example. consider situation, difficult short term envision scenario commodity energy price recover remarkably expect situation growth rate commodity-exporting economy would increase. therefore, even emerge economy gradually move deceleration phase due favorable effect growth advance economies, pace increase growth rate world economy whole may continue accelerate moderately. recently, international monetary fund (imf) also fairly consistently revise downward forecast global growth world economic outlook (chart 1). although chinese economy slow somewhat, mainly manufacture sector, service sector firm (chart 2). under authorities’ strong commitment support growth, economy expect broadly follow stable growth path, albeit growth rate continue slow somewhat, authority proactively carry policy measure support economic activity fiscal financial side (chart 3). however, sign deflationary pressure asset price adjustments, show gdp deflator turn negative gdp statistic july-september quarter, warrant attention. the key realize stable growth whether economy shift investment- export-driven domestic demand-driven, accompany structural reforms. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i see downside risk outlook i described, note follow three points. first, growth world economy disproportionately lead drive unite states. the expansionary phase u.s. economy already last around seven year since global financial crisis, represent fourth long period expansion postwar era, perspective economic cycle, say expansionary phase maturing. of course, pressure balance sheet adjustments, pace recovery global financial crisis moderate compare past recovery phases, make simplistic comparison term duration expansion may problematic. however, wage growth – far lag – gain momentum slack labor market diminish gradually, seem necessary keep mind risk economy may enter adjustment phase due narrow margin firms. under circumstances, federal reserve intend normalize monetary policy moderate pace. i would like watch normalization interest rate play relation duration expansionary phase. second, europe, remain various adjustment pressures; addition, refugee problem emerge serious challenge. for example, agreement sort reach among relevant country greek debt problem around middle year. this suppose inject capital bank early date order maintain financial system stability, drastic measure reduce sovereign debt yet drafted. in situation, fair possibility debt problem attract attention again. moreover, influx refugee likely increase fiscal burden european country moment. third, emerge commodity-exporting economies, pace recovery may slow whole, albeit difference across country regions, slump commodity energy price prolonged, outflow fund economy escalate global financial market due interest rate hike unite states. in particular, i concern impact may hit fiscal position oil-producing country possibility geopolitical risk grow slump crude oil price prolonged. b. global financial market the global financial market grow risk-averse toward summer 2015 factor concern slowdown chinese economy. although concern remain, improvement market’s risk appetite due last month’s employment statistics, show steadiness u.s. economy, proactive stance european central bank (ecb) additional monetary easing. although heighten expectation among market participant interest rate hike implement unite state federal open market committee (fomc) meet december, sign far risk aversion trend flare again, federal reserve carefully engage communication market participants. while remain concern outflow fund emerge market may trigger interest rate hike, i expect first hike since global financial crisis welcome event symbolic u.s. economic recovery, also lead dispel uncertainty hang global financial market long time. look forward, first point keep mind circumstance impact decline market liquidity. the exchange rate reform chinese yuan presumably direct trigger global turmoil occur summer, issue regard chinese currency monetary authorities’ communication point various occasions. however, fundamental level, i sense global financial market affect certain degree fact market liquidity decline risk take major market maker constrain full-fledged enforcement so-called volcker rule since july, consequently presence technical player – is, player engage algorithmic trade high frequency trade (hft) – grow amid thin summertime trade volume. i feel necessary carefully bi central bankers’ speech 3 monitor whether something trivial could lead market instability summer also times, end year quarter, liquidity tend decline due various constraint impose regulation (chart 4). second, possibility u.s. dollar fund cost hover high level due structural factors. the cost convert yen u.s. dollar swap market increase basis swap spread widened, expectation interest rate hike unite state mounted, addition usual end-of-year strengthen demand u.s. dollar fund (chart 5). while i assume japanese bank already make effort enhance stable foreign-currency fund base expand overseas business, i feel necessary carefully monitor situation. the bank, cooperation federal reserve, backstop place form u.s. dollar funds-supplying operations, i would like reemphasize importance financial institutions’ effort secure stable fund base. the third point impact additional monetary ease ecb global financial markets. in europe, presence negative interest rate already become prevalent country relation currency policy, even deposit rate reduction ecb negative rate. the ecb’s recent deposit rate reduction expect escalate situation. the yield curve germany, use benchmark, temporarily turn negative respect bond maturity six seven years. i keep close watch interest rate formation, couple interest rate hike unite states, affect flow fund global financial markets, whether flatten yield curve undermine sustainability government bond purchase ecb perspective sustainability bank’s purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), i describe later. c. japan’s economy look development japan’s economy, indicator relatively weak april-june quarter july-september quarter, particularly industrial production side, real gdp decline two consecutive quarter (chart 6). give situation, views, mainly among overseas media, japan’s economy technically enter recessionary phase due slowdown emerge commodity-exporting economies, particularly china. that said, back increase receipt income overseas business reflect yen’s depreciation, well improvement term trade due decline energy commodity prices, firm see record profits, consequently reflect gross national income (gni) gross domestic income (gdi) clear increase trend compare gdp. the mechanism aggregate income formation relatively robust business sentiment high level (chart 7). thus, seem economy resilient recently exogenous shock certain extent, slowdown overseas economies. in fact, despite relatively weak indicator export industrial production, domestic demand maintain resilience, mainly private consumption, virtuous cycle income spend continue operate whole. final demand also remain firm july-september quarter. this contrary economy experience 2007 global financial crisis occur 2008, japan’s economy actually enter recessionary phase trigger slowdown overseas economy term trade deteriorate surge energy commodity prices. let add thing export industrial production. real export pick slightly recently, albeit rise concern slowdown chinese economy (chart 8). this suggest divergence volume export trade statistic figure real exports, might attributable rise export good relatively high value-added – electronic part device – observe july-september quarter, reflect product life-cycle mobile phones. moreover, strength import also reflection firmness domestic demand. meanwhile, although 4 bi central bankers’ speech july-september quarter represent second consecutive quarter decrease industrial production, expect pick october-december quarter, mainly due increase production automobiles. we currently puzzle situation export le flat industrial production post relatively clear decrease business sentiment generally stay high level. however, firm business sentiment evidence “mirage demand,” commonly occur economic recession, take place, weakness industrial production might due base year statistic production set 2010, revise while, thus make difficult fully reflect increase weight good high value-added bring recent change production structure. that said, unclear whether virtuous cycle income spend strongly work. for example, although firms’ fix investment plan high levels, coincident lead indicator shipment capital good machinery order suggest actual business fix investment sluggish, real business fix investment gdp basis assess le unchanged, even fall marginally (chart 9). in addition, firm still seem negative stance toward increase spend could lead expansion fix costs, see fact base pay increase two consecutive year pace remain moderate (chart 10). one reason behind firm maintain cautious stance toward spend would deflationary mindset dispel broad sense. in addition this, even though corporate profit register record high recently, due increase sale volume, rather increase foreign exchange gain income overseas business reflect yen’s depreciation, well decrease input cost stem decline commodity prices. therefore, firm consider improvement profit indicative permanent increase income, remain cautious expand fix costs. in words, growth expectation profit may rise much. in effort assist firm financial side, bank take initiative create accommodative financial condition through, example, fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth. in raise growth expectations, however, many issue beyond scope monetary policy, i consider important government make strenuous effort change firms’ households’ expectation steadily implement growth strategy. in relation firms’ stance toward spending, i also would like touch annual labor-management wage negotiation spring 2016. a sustainable rise workers’ base pay one key point achieve steady recovery household consumption expenditure raise people’s medium- long-term inflation expectations, appear remain low u.s. european economies. thus, i pay attention whether base pay see rise third consecutive year annual labor-management wage negotiation spring 2016. although japanese trade union confederation (rengo) present basic stance toward next spring wage negotiation – namely, demand base pay increase 2 percent – uncertain rise underlie trend inflation outlook price reflect base pay. i therefore expect government take initiative deregulate labor market firm find easy decide base pay increase. d. price let turn development prices. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food 0 percent recently due decline energy price (chart 11). the year-on-year rate increase cpi item le fresh food energy, hand, 1 percent recently, ratio increase decrease item cpi year-on-year rate change trim mean increase moderately. in addition, people’s medium- long-term bi central bankers’ speech 5 inflation expectation appear rise whole, albeit weakness, partly due change behavioral pattern firm household since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). give factors, bank view underlie trend inflation rise steadily. i aware various view ass underlie trend inflation. in situation price indicator affect significantly recently short-term fluctuation energy prices, sound reasonable look cpi exclude energy prices. nonetheless, i describe later, i believe necessary closely examine wide range price indicators, include wages, recent rise cpi item le fresh food energy might attributable households’ acceptance price rises, mainly daily necessities, bring decline energy prices. with factor mind, i would like discus recent development cpi item le fresh food energy. there view recent rise infer yen’s depreciation observe since expansion qqe end-october 2014, rise peak turn fiscal 2016 depreciation expected. i would say, however, seem unreasonable explain recent development cpi item le fresh food energy consistent manner yen’s depreciation alone, price food product durable good – lead recent rise cpi item le fresh food energy – resume clear uptrend recently yen’s depreciation trend generally last since around introduction qqe april 2013. i consider recent rise actually attributable fact household readily accept price rise back moderate improvement employment income situation well decline energy prices, firm accordingly take somewhat aggressive stance set high prices. yet, uncertain whether household continue accept price rise effect decline energy price dissipate. moreover, depreciation yen expected, likely price food product durable good stop rising. in view possibilities, key whether year-on-year rate increase cpi item le fresh food energy remain stable around 1 percent likely lie whether rise service price – lag recently – would start observe follow wage negotiation fiscal 2016. there uncertainty future development wage negotiations, i mention earlier, also downside risk whether price rise daily necessity durable good lead rise service prices. in opinion, however, possible generally maintain annual growth pace around 1 percent throughout projection period, exclude effect decline energy prices. a member policy board – responsibility ensure price stability – i make effort present probable scenario october 2015 outlook economic activity price (outlook report). in view, whether underlie trend inflation jump 2 percent depend whether people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation jump around 2 percent, suggest people’s expectation unlikely become bullish within projection period wage yet rise level. ii. future conduct monetary policy a. qqe it two year eight month since introduction qqe. my evaluation policy that, evidence economic market development period, intend purpose promote conversion deflationary mindset gradually achieved, although still halfway toward accomplish goal. meanwhile, october 2015 outlook report, project time reach price stability target would delay around second half fiscal 2016 (chart 12). i aware that, consequently, various view bank’s commitment achieve price stability 6 bi central bankers’ speech target 2 percent stable manner early possible time, time horizon two years. give situation, i find necessary go i explain bank’s commitment, would also like share think again. i consider commitment roll target. it intend achieve specific price level within specific time frame rather achieve price stability target early possible time time horizon two years. i also regard price stability target flexible concept certain range upward downward deviation actual inflation rate target. i believe commitment reasonable framework inflation target adopt central bank major countries. in fact, development price depend, example, crude oil price short term, inflation expectation affect underlie trend inflation susceptible monetary policy well factor cannot necessarily control directly conduct monetary policy, outcome wage negotiation growth expectations. a i state before, price reflect state economy variable directly operate central bank. therefore, policy conduct aim specific inflation rate within specific time frame seem unreasonable first place, central bank persist achieve aim, may risk credibility undermined. let reiterate significance achieve price stability target 2 percent. the price stability target set base cpi items, reference figure capture underlie trend, bank use cpi item le fresh food present policy board members’ projections. however, unlike case europe unite states, cpi entail statistical problem stickiness fee public service high private rent impute rent structurally exert downward pressure it. thus, cpi, include official statistic compile government, seem deviate recently line people’s perception inflation reflect price rise daily necessities, shown, example, university tokyo daily price index sri-hitotsubashi consumer purchase price index. in particular, year-on-year rate increase sri-hitotsubashi unit value price index – factor firms’ strategy maintain sale price make frequent change product – around 2 percent recently, represent somewhat acceleration cpi item cover index (chart 13). if bank conduct monetary policy focus cpi official statistics, situation people’s perception inflation level exceed growth rate, possibility people would come feel excessive rise prices, could cause many distortion sentiment actual spend behavior (chart 14). what matter inflation rate rise balance wage level economic activity increases. with factor mind, i would like reemphasize achieve 2 percent term year-on-year rate increase cpi item ultimate goal price stability target, rather achievement assess flexibly various aspect examine wide range price indicators. b. continuation qqe meanwhile, seem market participant still hold expectation expansion qqe. i believe might attributable interpretation price stability target, i explain earlier, also think regard effect qqe; namely, ease tighten effect would depend flow – is, amount – financial asset purchase bank. theoretically speaking, however, effect qqe nature strengthen cumulatively progress bank’s asset purchases. this mean that, even bank maintain amount asset purchases, monetary ease effect strengthen long continue purchases. therefore, i hold view bank’s decision monetary policy meet continue current qqe critical term monetary ease effects. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the bank commit purchase jgbs net hold increase annual pace 80 trillion yen. nonetheless, consider amount redemption jgb hold increase, amount purchase gross basis likely rise even current policy commitment. for reason, bank’s presence jgb market could increase further, although also depend government’s jgb issuance plan. give situation, bank’s explanation – namely, massive purchase jgbs carry context conduct monetary policy way finance fiscal deficit – remain fully persuasive, i also would like reiterate government’s commitment toward fiscal consolidation important. a i mention earlier, monetary ease effect appear cumulatively theory, term positive effect side effects, likely ease effect diminish marginally, since pace decline nominal interest rate minimal despite progress bank’s purchases, evidence limit decline longer-term interest rate since expansion qqe end-october 2014. there doubt policy effect always accompany side effects, i believe basic approach decide continuation monetary policy compare examine positive effect side effects. i initially expect qqe, kind shock therapy influence formation people’s inflation expectation massive asset purchases, would continue long time, concern possibility continuation policy cause positive effect decline marginally side effect increase marginally. c. sustainability bank’s market operation a bank continue jgb purchase current pace, amount outstanding jgbs market decrease difference amount government’s net issuance bank’s net purchases. since amount outstanding market limited, bank able continue purchase current pace indefinitely. in reality, financial institution reason hold certain amount jgbs, use collateral, would stop sell hold bank amount outstanding market hit bottom. at point, difficult project critical point likely happen, financial institutions’ incentive sell jgb hold expect depend interest rate level shape yield curve point time. if qqe continue exert intend effect market participants’ medium- long-term inflation expectation rise, yield curve steepen financial institution great incentive sell jgb holdings. on hand, case conversion deflationary mindset make progress market participants’ medium- long-term inflation expectation rise, yield curve would flatten financial institution would strong preference jgb holdings. therefore, bank’s massive jgb purchase involve difficulties, possibility become easy probability realize policy objective rises, whereas bank’s market operation might become problematic realize objective consider difficult. thus, judge necessity continue qqe, i would like take account sustainability bank’s market operations. conclude remarks: economic activity nara prefecture my conclude remark touch economy nara prefecture. compare national average, industrial structure nara prefecture characterize large weight local industry – plastics, rubber, textile – also electrical machinery general machinery. the prefecture also well know production item cha sen (a tea ceremony tool), sumi ink, ink brushes, leather products, soman noodles, well goldfish farming. although economy 8 bi central bankers’ speech nara prefecture show weakness recently term production, moderate recovery underway. production decline mainly decrease electrical machinery general machinery. meanwhile, household sector, active job openings-to-applicants ratio rise moderately employee income previous year’s levels. private consumption recover whole, retail sale remain robust, despite continue weakness passenger-car sale (chart 15). from longer-term perspective, transfer production site nara prefecture locations, include foreign countries, proceed amid intense international competition. in addition dwindle source employment, also critical challenge respond age society couple low birthrate shrink population, reflect nara prefecture’s history development commuter town neighbor large city osaka kyoto. however, i hear nara prefecture already conduct broad-ranging activity cooperation public private sector order deal challenge. for example, initiative become commuter town, prefecture invite business outside promote development local industry create industrial cluster area convenient location close expressway. over period eight years, prefecture succeed invite 205 project factory facilities. in addition, southern eastern part prefecture, large tract abandon farmland exist, agriculture promotion measure implement encourage shift so-called sixth industry, include activity open privately run auberge (restaurant equip board facilities) use local food materials. in april next year, nara agriculture food international college opened. furthermore, nara prefecture abundance tourism resources, include several world heritage sites, number visitor rising, partly result increase foreign visitor recent years. until now, scarcity inn hotel prefecture, rise number visitor fail increase overnight stays, mean tourism resource necessarily utilize sufficiently. however, i hear ongoing project, order resolve shortage hotel rooms, build large hotel site nara city own prefectural government. i hop nara prefecture revitalize economy continue steady effort cooperation public private sectors. bi central bankers’ speech 1 norman t l chan: development e-cheque usage hong kong speech mr norman t l chan, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, electronic cheque (e-cheque) service launch ceremony, hong kong, 11 december 2015. * * * m helen wong, mr allen yeung, mr wong kuen-fai, distinguish guests, medium representatives: 1. welcome official launch electronic cheque (e-cheque) service jointly organise hong kong association bank hong kong monetary authority. for first phase e-cheque service, nine bank start offer e-cheque issuance service, bank hong kong already accept e-cheques deposit customers. 2. traditional paper cheque widely use hong kong, limitations. for example, payer must deliver physical cheque payee, payee must also physically deposit cheque bank. these step involve quite time. besides, paper cheque consume lot paper environmentally friendly. in view this, hkma begin work bank industry develop necessary infrastructure electronic form cheque service three year ago. benefit e-cheques 3. a e-cheques number obvious benefit physical counterparts, i believe become popular form electronic payment soon. i. the e-cheque issuance deposit service available via internet bank platform hong kong interbank clear limited’s portal 24-hour basis. bank customer process e-cheque time. ii. a physical boundary barrier more, payer payee enjoy e-cheque service convenience mobile phone internet bank platform anywhere. iii. e-cheques quick easy use. in simple steps, payer issue e-cheque via internet bank platform. upon receive e-cheque, adopt highly secure digital signature, e-cheques remove need payer’s handwritten signature require paper cheques, reduce risk forgery. v. unlike certain electronic payment fund transfers, payee need disclose bank account number payer order receive e-cheque payment, mean great privacy protection. for payee one account, also enjoy flexibility decide account deposit e-cheque into. vi. corporates institution issue huge volume paper cheque save substantial sum printing, process mail cheques. in hong kong, list company process 2 million physical cheque year dividend payments. both paper consumption mail cost reduce substantially year shareholder agree switchinig e-cheques receive payments. look forward 4. the e-cheque begin development. the hkma continue explore way expand application two areas, namely: 2 bi central bankers’ speech i. cross-border transaction – explore guangzhou shenzhen branch the people’s bank china, monetary authority macao view promote use clear cross-border e-cheques. ii. development e-commerce – explore bank industry use e-cheques support e-commerce portals. while offer additional option payment online shoppers, e-cheques also increase efficiency e-commerce operations. acknowledgment 5. the launch e-cheque reflect continuous effort bank hong kong provide wide range payment services. it also signify hkma’s commitment promote efficiency modernisation hong kong's financial infrastructure. besides, smooth development launch e-cheque benefit immensely great support relevant government departments. i. firstly, amendment electronic transaction ordinance finalise office government chief information officer early 2015, give electronic cheque legal status physical cheques. the pay

provide convenient easy option pay tax demand notes, business registration fees, stamp duty well purchase tax reserve certificates. iii. lastly, treasury also actively help promote acceptance government department e-cheques pay general demand notes. 6. i would like thank involve bring e-cheque service fruition. the hkma strengthen public education programme hong kong association bank increase public understand use benefit e-cheques. 7. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 françois villeroy de galhau: climate change – financial sector pathway 2°c speech mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france, conference cop21, paris, 30 november 2015. * * * lady gentlemen, this conference organise 2°c initiative, oxford martin school france stratégie open cop21, major event i delight participate. i would like make comment topic steadily gain grind climate change agenda, namely way central bank prudential authority take account climate-related issues. this fact relatively new question. we already commit citizen public policy-makers, monetary prudential authority today concern three broad category risk: – direct physical risks, relate increase frequency magnitude extreme climatic events, raise question term insurance costs. – liability risks, relate financial impact stem compensation request suffer loss damage due climate change. – macroeconomic risk relate transition two production models, result disorderly adjustment sector heavily expose global warm become unviable due governments’ climate change commitment. in practice, already observe financial imbalance carbon-intensive industry face rise costs, disruptive technologies, regulatory uncertainties.1 the market value carbon-intensive industry already impacted. and re-pricing may occur rapidly abruptly. what le clear present react development since horizon climate change risk materialise largely exceed traditional horizon economic agents, notably financial players. this mark carney famously refer “tragedy horizon”.2 we agree high carbon price would send right economic signal. but aware difficult international decision-making area. give responsibility, await decisions, follow question thus arise: ensure investor financial intermediary aware actual exposure risks? and prevent misallocation capital carbon-intensive sector strand assets? to address questions, i start stress that, fortunately, financial sector civil society already mobilise (i). next, i discus need public intervention ensure alignment interest (ii). i/ the financial sector civil society already mobilised. 1 cf. moody’s, “impact carbon reduction policy rise globally”, march 2015. 2 mark carney, “breaking tragedy horizon – climate change financial stability”, speech give lloyd’s london, 29 september 2015. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this mobilisation, yield progress, appear occur three main phases. first, major public financial institution forefront movement. this case european bank reconstruction development caisse de dépôts, subsidiary cdc-climat. the european investment bank estimate currently grant 25% loan – eur 20 billion per year – “green” projects. second, aegis unite nations, project launch unep finance initiative, partnership unite nation environment programme 200 financial sector institutions, make environmental sustainability collective responsibility, share best practice establish principle green financing. thank montreal climate change protocol, portfolio decarbonization coalition, signatory investor commit measure disclose carbon footprint portfolios. the objective ambitious: reduce investment carbon-intensive project several hundred billion dollars. lastly, financial institution make direct commitments. french bank insurance company recently announce withdraw support coal industry increase finance renewable energies. paris europlace call creation energy transition fund, would invest french banks, insurer asset management companies, could turn invest eur 10 billion 2020, view finance project improve energy efficiency promote renewable energies. this commendable initiative. ii/ to best align private initiative fight global warming, public good, public intervention nevertheless necessary. for central bank prudential authorities, three question arise: finance –and interaction monetary policy–, information – disclosure–, lastly time horizon –and stress tests–. 1. the question financing: interaction monetary policy? climate change likely affect price good services. it direct impact food prices. but also generally affect growth allocation resources. against backdrop, central bank remain vigilant about, possibly monitor economic consequence climate change. and monetary policy play role contribute smooth rebalancing price structures, line price stability mandate. article 2 european system central bank statute states: “without prejudice objective price stability, escb shall support general economic policy community, view contribute achievement objective community [economic activities, sustainable non-inflationary growth respect environment…the raise standard live quality life]. some would like go step further, use quantitative ease tool help finance energy transition, purchase “green” assets, grant favourable treatment green asset eligible collateral, set dedicate long-term facilities; list possibility long. however, must bear mind ultimate aim monetary policy. it design achieve macroeconomic objectives, sector-specific goals. the underlie assumption direct monetary policy intervention central bank good equip private agent ensure efficient allocation resources. but give central bank would informational advantage. quantitative ease therefore aim promote type asset others merely free capacity finance economy. for instance, current monetary policy encourage investment longer-term projects, good return government bonds, infrastructure energy transition. but one prerequisite: prudential regulation must consistent, may require adaptation framework lay solvency ii insurance directive. i welcome number recent bi central bankers’ speech 3 proposal promote infrastructure make european commission, step right direction. 2. the information challenge: role disclosure the potential risk pose climate change financial sector complex start understand them. the urgent need probably good information. much high-quality work carry recent year improve disclosure climate-related issues. the french act energy transition, enact 17 august 2015, strengthen requirement regard disclosure management environmental risks. article 173 require institutional investor include environmental objective annual reports, particular exposure climate risks, measure carbon footprint asset finance "green” share asset relative set targets. the implement decree act, currently drafted, specify information concern presentation. from broad perspective, aim great clarity: 400 climate-related information disclosure schemes. impose requirement formulate recommendation term information disclosure powerful instrument ensure market discipline, long information target pertinent, evidence number successful examples. at international level, aegis financial stability board, first task force know "enhanced disclosure task force" compose sector representative already issue recommendation 2012 improve, simplify focus communication systemically important bank nature risks. at national level, guide relevance, consistency readability financial statement publish french financial market authority july 2015 another positive example. clarification challenge take seriously. we therefore decided, within financial stability board support recent g20 antalya, set shortly – begin 2016 – another dedicate task force (edtf). it work complete within one year order rapidly ensure effective disclosure climate risk. it formulate recommendation voluntary disclosure, accord harmonise therefore comparable methods. this enable stakeholder public find share financial sector asset link carbon emission sector’s exposure climate risk. 3. the time horizon challenge: gradual implementation stress test stress test integral part risk management financial institutions. it particularly develop insurance reinsurance sectors. model disaster risk capital level – set solvency ii – take account climate risks. but current regulatory framework bank somehow overlook climate change source risk. yet would way handle question time horizon. in respect, act energy transition provide submission end-2016 report implementation scenario stress test representative climate risk banks. however, achieve raise serious questions. two approach possible. either comprehensive stress testing, cover risk associate asset class financial institutions, would allow supervisor monitor total exposure climate risk. or granular stress testing, focus asset specifically expose climate risk, would appropriate analyse specific sector finance needs, finance oil sector. whatever approach chosen, main challenge would take account climate risks, either economic estimate master – gdp observe stress – directly climate variable – rise temperature – would require 4 bi central bankers’ speech develop new method gather new information. this, course, would mean rely expert judgment issues, context financial institution enough experience understand future risks. we work acpr public authority concerned. * * * understand analyse climate risk essential. the regulation currently draw – act energy transition work financial stability board – information disclosure useful tool ensure transition green economy active therefore control. these initiative could also contribute make market participant aware need use discount rate compatible transition green economy. the canfin-grandjean report june 2015 also include many interest avenues. however, must time remain modest. we, public authorities, know everything. and cannot substitute private players, whether financial non-financial. we need ensure new requirement provide right incentive financial institutions, give certain degree flexibility authority create disincentive make headway energy transition process. modest, adaptable, yet determined. because battle current market signal – overly low carbon price overly short time horizon – insufficient ensure full mobilisation. there large number private initiatives. but also need public framework ensure general last alignment interests. we determine play full part, basel paris elsewhere. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sayuri shirai: japan’s economic price development monetary policy – underlie inflation trend inflation expectation speech m sayuri shirai, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, shimane, 25 november 2015. * * * accompany chart find end speech. i. introduction good morning. i feel honor opportunity meet local government official business representative today. let also express sincere gratitude kind cooperation activity bank japan’s matsue branch. today, i would like talk bank’s baseline scenario outlook economic activity price fiscal 2017 well risk scenario, describe october 2015 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report). accordingly, i also present explain views. ii. japan’s medium-term outlook economic activity risk assessment let begin japan’s economic activity. a. outlook economic activity in bank’s baseline scenario outlook economic activity, project growth rate fiscal 2015 revise considerably downward projection fiscal 2016 2017 le unchanged, compare july 2015 interim assessment. nevertheless, domestic demand likely increase export expect continue increase moderately back recovery overseas economies. a virtuous cycle among production, income, spend likely maintain corporate household sectors. firms’ households’ growth expectation potential economic growth also likely rise moderately line continue accommodative financial conditions. in fiscal 2017, rate economic growth likely decelerate significantly – mainly due effect plan consumption tax hike cyclical deceleration business fix investment – still likely remain positive (chart 1). my outlook economic activity somewhat low median policy board members’ forecasts: around 1 percent fiscal 2015; little le around 1.5 percent fiscal 2016; slightly 0 percent fiscal 2017, owe significant decline growth rate, due, example, plan consumption tax hike. let explain detail. for fiscal 2015, projection low july 2015 interim assessment, reflect negative economic growth record april-june quarter (relative previous quarter), mediocre performance thereafter, prospect performance likely continue time being. several factor comprise background outlook. first, i adopt conservative projection real exports, external demand temporarily weak, also consideration give possibility structural change hamper rapid export recovery. the latter point consistent fact industrial production export japanese firm remain sluggish 2 bi central bankers’ speech overseas subsidiary expand rapidly since 2009.1 in particular, shift overseas production, mainly transportation machinery electrical machinery sectors, leave japanese economy general-purpose, production & business orient machinery, information & communication equipment sectors, etc. main engine generate domestic production export growth. the export performance lead sector stagnant, mainly due deceleration economic growth asia. although real export improve recently, partly due release new smartphones, likely le constant time light economic slowdown emerge economies. second, i revise downward projection real private consumption fiscal 2015. quarter-on-quarter growth rate real consumption real retail sale turn positive july-september quarter. however, downward revision attributable (1) moderate real wage growth turn positive july year (2) stagnant development consumer confidence index component next six month – include consumer perception index income growth willingness buy durable goods. nevertheless, look ahead, moderate recovery trend consumption likely maintain nominal wage continue moderate rise trend, amid tighten labor market conditions. third, i revise downward projection business fix investment fiscal 2015 well, owe negative growth record april-june quarter (relative previous quarter). in contrast positive business fix investment plan fiscal 2015 report bank’s tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), actual machinery order capital good shipment remain disappointing; firm may postpone fix investment plan high unexpected cost cause labor shortage rise price construction materials. one positive development, meanwhile, sustain recovery residential investment. the recent problem relate apartment construction wrongdoing yokohama relate problem may dampen investment temporarily. however, i continue project steady recovery residential investment low interest rate environment, since front-loaded increase demand prior plan consumption tax hike gradually materialize. for fiscal 2016, i project relatively high economic growth owe front-loaded increase private consumption residential investment prior plan consumption tax hike, amid favorable employment situation. however, i make moderate downward revision compare july 2015 interim assessment, mainly due lower-than-expected real export growth. my outlook cautious median policy board members’ forecasts, probably i allocate great weight potential loss economic opportunity arise labor shortages, result moderate pace economic growth. in japan, firm good business condition tend feel labor shortage increasingly constrain expand business activities, firm bad business condition tend operate business manage exist employment. this may one reason pace replace nonviable le active firm viable active firm slow, thereby hamper economic growth. b. upside downside risk assessment regard economic activity in october 2015 outlook report, bank point follow risk baseline scenario economic activity: (1) development overseas economies; (2) effect plan consumption tax hike april 2017; (3) firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectations; (4) fiscal sustainability medium long term. on whole, assess risk skew downside. 1 see ministry economy, trade industry, “global shipment index.” bi central bankers’ speech 3 in risk assessment relate economic activity, upside downside risk likely remain balance fiscal 2015 2016. by contrast, risk fiscal 2017 tilt downside. particularly, i find follow risk relate overseas economy important: • in chinese economy, labor force population ratio declines, private consumption internet sale firm, due part continue rise wages. but year-on-year rate increase retail sale first ten month 2015 remain moderately annual target 13 percent. the tertiary sector, i.e., service industries, grow already account 50 percent total value add economy. whether service industry could become engine domestic global economic growth foreseeable future yet see may incur downside risk, give increase number private-sector firm face uncertainty respect finance condition amid cautious lend behavior bank sector. • other asian economy expect see strong growth, lead mainly domestic demand, since pace trade growth global value chain decelerated. however, downside risk development domestic demand could contain large-scale portfolio capital outflow amplify volatility foreign exchange capital markets, perhaps result normalization u.s. monetary policy. • the u.s. economy may achieve greater-than-expected growth business fix investment residential investment expand firmly tandem great growth labor productivity wages. this plausible give deleveraging process make progress corporate household sectors. • in euro area, fragmentation interbank market improve cross-border capital flow increased, partly owe accommodative monetary ease perform european central bank, thereby lead increase lend firm households. in addition, intra-regional competitiveness gap shrink wage growth rate per worker germany maintain high level, around 3 percent, wage peripheral country contain adjusted. the upside risk favorable development may enable euro area generate stronger-than-expected economic recovery. in addition, fiscal 2017, downside risk great considerable uncertainty present relate subsequent decline demand real income plan consumption tax hike. it clear much negative impact could offset “quantitative” expansion public- private-sector fix investment associate tokyo 2020 olympic games, amid tighten labor market conditions. iii. japan’s medium-term outlook price risk assessment next, i turn price outlook risk assessment. a. outlook price in bank’s baseline scenario outlook prices, year-on-year rate change core consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food exclude direct effect consumption tax hikes) likely around 0 percent time being, low july 2015 interim assessment. after that, rate increase core cpi project accelerate toward 2 percent underlie trend inflation steadily rise effect decline crude oil price dissipate. although time reach around 2 percent depend development crude oil prices, project happen around second half fiscal 2016, assume crude oil price rise moderately recent 4 bi central bankers’ speech level. thereafter, japan’s economy expect gradually shift growth path sustain inflation stable manner (chart 1). regard outlook prices, let first present overall picture. although mechanism price rise i assume bank’s baseline scenario, projection remain cautious median policy board members’ forecasts. the outlook throughout fiscal 2017 revise somewhat downward. currently, projection rate increase core cpi likely rise close around 2 percent “from end fiscal 2016 early fiscal 2017” – delay quarter previous projection “toward end fiscal 2016.” let explain outlook detail. my projection price fiscal 2015 core cpi around 0 percent. the slight downward revision july 2015 interim assessment attributable decline crude oil prices. also, delay pace output gap improvement take account actual output gap deteriorate april-june quarter. my projection fiscal 2016 core cpi inflation rise little 1 percent rather cautious compare present previously. this reflect (1) remain effect drop energy prices, (2) delay quarter term time output gap turn positive, (3) delay time inflation expectation begin rise owe slow pace increase prices. thereafter, rate increase core cpi accelerate reach around 1.7–1.8 percent, rise close around 2 percent january-march quarter 2017 (the peak front-loaded increase domestic demand) april-june quarter (the period likely see opportunistic price increase plan consumption tax hike). my outlook fiscal 2017 whole average rate core cpi inflation decline somewhat reach around little 1.5 percent – slightly july assessment – mainly due effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase decline real income. on time respect achieve sustain inflation around 2 percent stable manner, might necessary ass little long time span. this high uncertainty regard effect plan consumption tax hike “quantitative” expansion public- private-sector fix investment associate tokyo 2020 olympic games. moreover, likely take time inflation expectation rise. b. upside downside risk assessment regard price with regard risk bank’s baseline scenario prices, bank highlight follow four factors: (1) development firms’ households’ medium- long-term inflation expectations; (2) development output gap; (3) responsiveness inflation output gap; (4) development import prices. it assess risk skew downside. my risk assessment relate prices, hand, risk fiscal 2015 balance fiscal 2016 2017 tilt downside. in particular, great deal uncertainty relate crude oil price foreign exchange rate developments, could generate upside downside risk price outlook. on hand, downside risk steady increase inflation expectations, key factor raise inflation stable manner, may take place fast projected. on whole, therefore, risk judge tilt downside. c. expression time respect achieve around 2 percent inflation in baseline scenario describe october 2015 outlook report, bank postpone time reach around 2 percent inflation two quarters, “around first half fiscal 2016” describe april outlook report “around second half fiscal 2016.” on front, i oppose expression “around first half fiscal 2016” propose change “in around fiscal 2016” monetary policy meet (mpm) hold bi central bankers’ speech 5 april 30. meanwhile, mpm hold october 30, i support bank’s revise expression. let explain why. due fact median policy board members’ forecast revise downward sharply time, apparently unfeasible achieve around 2 percent inflation around first half fiscal 2016. therefore, reasonable bank change expression. however, give assess risk price skew downside, may appropriate bank use expression allow wide time span reach around 2 percent, “from around second half fiscal 2016 around first half fiscal 2017” – instead “around second half fiscal 2016.” on hand, time express “around second half fiscal 2016” practically correspond latter half intend period proposal april. also, importantly, expression similar present projection could regard le line interpret “around 2 percent” flexibly. base two reasons, i support bank’s revise expression. iv. conduct monetary policy despite downward revision bank’s outlook economic activity price july 2015 interim assessment, i view important bank maintain accommodative monetary environment continue current guideline money market operations. before i elaborate line thinking, make referral contrast trend observe last october expansion quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) implemented, let emphasize price stability target 2 percent pursue price hike; target achieve sustain wage growth expansion private consumption. on front, important ass whether japan’s economy continue face virtuous cycle among production, income, spend operate corporate household sectors. let highlight five viewpoint essential make assessment. first, firms’ business condition current profit favorable previous year. for example, bank’s september 2015 tankan indicate diffusion index (di) actual business condition industry – calculate subtract percentage share firm respond business condition “unfavorable” share indicate business condition “favorable” – improve moderately 7 percent june 8 percent september, contrast decline 7 percent 4 percent period last year. in particular, business condition di large nonmanufacturing enterprise improve 23 percent june 25 percent september – exceed level previous year (dropping 19 percent 13 percent period). project current profit favorable well. the september tankan show year-on-year rate change project current profit industry fiscal 2015 record 3.3 percent (4.0 percent manufacture 2.7 percent nonmanufacturing). the profitability outlook show complete change fiscal 2014 report september last year, rate change project profit minus 4.0 percent (minus 2.6 percent manufacture minus 5.1 percent nonmanufacturing). furthermore, let plot relationship year-on-year rate growth project current profit sale industry fiscal 2015 september 2015 (chart 2). this show relatively large number sector position first quadrant (positive territory growth current profit sales). generally, growth current profit much great sale – reflect improvement term trade (caused plunge commodity price crude oil) well profit revaluation dividend overseas high yen-based export prices, drive yen’s depreciation. noticeable development rate growth current profit sale (1) food; (2) accommodations, eat & drink services; (3) service individual great fiscal 2014 report september 2014. the food sector, 6 bi central bankers’ speech include manufacturing, project export sale growth 5 percent domestic sale growth 3 percent – suggest domestic private consumption quite solid well. the aforementioned data indicate domestic demand recover adverse effect consumption tax hike april 2014. second, risk return deflation consider low give price wide range consumption items, exclude energy, rising. while bank ass underlie trend inflation base various indicators, typical indicator mainly core cpi trim mean. both exclude temporarily volatile item order grasp trend behavior prices. they often utilize project future price owe relatively high predictive power. the difference core cpi always exclude item tend show high volatility consumption basket weight. in contrast, trim mean look price change every month item cpi eliminate certain fraction (e.g., 10 percent) extreme observation end large small changes. thus, item eliminate month could vary month month. the bank us cpi item le fresh food, “core cpi,” determine medium-term outlook price outlook report. energy price include core cpi statistically significant impact cpi movement long term. however, sharp fall energy price since latter half previous year amplify volatility core cpi, become important ass underlie trend inflation comprehensive manner, core cpi also multiple indicators. a one indicator, bank begin release “cpi item le fresh food energy” monthly basis. while rate change core cpi around 0 percent recently, cpi item le fresh food energy rise 1.2 percent lately (chart 3). moreover, trim mean increasingly become important since indicator automatically remove highly volatile item every month – give fluctuation commodity price foreign exchange rate amplified. the “10 percent trim mean” rise moderately currently 0.6 percent, contrast sharply decline trend observe period last year. third, firms’ price behavior respect sale price show positive developments. to see this, let plot relationship actual sale price di rate growth project domestic sale fiscal 2015, accord september tankan (chart 4). the sale price di calculate subtract percentage share firm respond sale price “falling” share indicate price “rising.” chart 4 indicate sector position first quadrant (positive territory actual sale price di project domestic sales). development sector (1) food (2) accommodations, eat & drink service worthy note. the sale price di sector use negative relatively large degree show great response “fall” “rise” qqe launched. this indicate significant turnaround firms’ price behavior toward environment find easy raise sale price before. the current rise wide range cpi item reflect three factors: (a) import price rise drive yen’s depreciation; (b) increase domestic demand; (c) pass-through wage rise. while difficult disentangle factors, impact (a) above, import price rise, seem large eventually fade away unless depreciation yen take place. meanwhile, firm provide high value-added good services, high sale price accompany sale increase items, see food accommodations, eat & drink service sectors. look ahead, nominal wage likely rise output gap likely improve positive territory, help enhance sustainability price rise. fourth, development inflation expectation monitor closely, although indicator decline recently. inflation expectation collective term refer households, firms, economists, well market-based indicators. attention bi central bankers’ speech 7 pay recent decline inflation expectation firm economists, well market-based indicators. at time, however, decline inflation expectation global phenomenon since summer 2015. therefore, important understand whether decline reflect downward revision commodity price projection temporary deceleration global economic growth, alternatively deterioration outlook domestic supply-demand balance. on front, domestic private consumption resilient. the corporate sector maintain positive business fix investment plan accord various recent surveys, thus fix investment likely expand near future. these domestic demand condition support view domestic supply-demand balance bad all. inflation expectations, therefore, likely show sustainable rise rate change cpi begin rise follow improvement output gap. fifth, relate issue, households’ inflation expectation tend high firms. household tend perceive price always rise always keep positive inflation expectation even mild deflationary phase slight inflationary phase (chart 5). this suggest presence upward bias inflation expectations. on point, i deliver several speech abroad past suggest scale upward bias appear generally great japan europe unite states.2 give past long-standing stagnant wages, household appear form expectation time future wage always decline. this lead household anticipate tight budgets, strong defensive action result large upward bias inflation expectations. in environment, important household form perception wage increase steadily increase continue; indeed, wage currently improve moderately. in addition, present, monetary policy action unnecessary give current sluggish movement core cpi cause decline energy price temporary, decline production cost resultant improvement corporate profit might enhance opportunity firm raise wage readily. base five viewpoints, time closely monitor whether price exhibit rise trend current accommodative monetary ease environment. if path toward price rise materialize all, bank – depend cause – may consider adjustment regard monetary policy. this bring end speech. thank much indeed kind attention. 2 for recent speeches, see sayuri shirai, “monetary policy diversify global economy: japan, unite states, asia-pacific region,” remark panel discussion organize federal reserve bank san francisco, bank japan, 2015, sayuri shirai, “unconventional monetary policy bank japan european

mr jan mallien mr daniel schäfer publish 10 december 2015. * * * mr praet, rather next big flood money expect european central bank (ecb), small expansion exist stimulus. do back down? doe majority ecb’s govern council long support mario draghi’s policy? quite opposite: strong majority! by way explanation: relevant work group provide executive board analysis different measure board discus monetary policy package, i put forward govern council. what agree last week exactly line i propose council thursday, take account discuss committees. you already meet member ecb’s govern council dinner wednesday though. do encounter much resistance scale back proposal thursday’s meeting? the dinner always take place, issue discuss meal. it true first i sure proposal would received. but end, discussion controversial. not everyone favour proposals, case say “we want this”, get less. that true. if didn’t want achieve anything more, create high expectation beforehand? we already talk review measure govern council meet malta october. the market already react back then, understandable. the problem markets’ expectation grow ever big meantime persisting, even though recent economic data encouraging. one big problem that, quiet period... ...i.e. day directly govern council meeting, member council allow talk monetary policy... ...during period, market exaggerate situation again. but could respond oblige remain silent. what mean “exaggerated”? that speculation package measure never discussion. but prior start quiet period mario draghi give pretty hard-hitting speech make market feel euphoric. why didn’t quickly try correct expectations? you shouldn’t push expectation management far. if expectation get control, we, central bank, try correct it. but simply cannot do quiet period. what consequence communication debacle? we don’t communicate order please markets, fulfil mandate. investor seem take different view. to begin with, market expect reduction deposit rate, increase amount monthly bond purchase extension bond-buying programme. but 2 bi central bankers’ speech anticipate reinvestment mature bond expansion programme include regional bonds. the reinvestment mature bond important decision ensure enough liquidity available long necessary. the expansion include regional bond also important market concern that, instance foreseeable future, might enough bond purchase. but enough get inflation move back towards 2%? firstly, come inflation objective, i’m really determined. i’m hardline point. and ecb ensure necessary degree monetary policy ease maintain order achieve goal. but two big uncertainties: development emerge country effect interest rate turnaround us. a regard emerge countries, arrive third phase great financial crisis. it start us, continue euro area reach emerge economies. it’ll take long time overcome. i would concern position euro area robust, unfortunately still fragile. and risk see us? we don’t comment monetary policy central banks. but market still don’t know effect imminent turnaround u monetary policy long-term interest rate global bond markets. it obviously bring uncertainty. be ready, need be, more, would prefer instruments? we clearly say ready more, become necessary. the precise choice instrument cannot determine long advance; base specific circumstances. the asset purchase programme sufficiently flexible size, composition duration adapt necessary. you pump money since march large-scale purchase government bonds. nevertheless, inflation november stand around 0.1%. doesn’t prove policy isn’t working? no, it’s work well. in fact please see strongly monetary policy improve credit conditions. the impact inflation however seem take longer. some would say great patience call for. we already push back several time expectation inflation rate reach 2%. if keep push back, credibility put risk. be view share member govern council? almost everyone ecb’s govern council think measure working. but doesn’t mean everyone find good. there two school think among critic council. some say they’re unnecessary economic situation isn’t bad all. for instance, don’t regard development inflation expectation dramatic. others say that, special nature currency union, asset purchase use deflationary situation. this point discuss length. a large majority council members, include me, think deal extreme circumstance deflation it’s late. it corrected, think goes, great difficulty require much effort. but doesn’t ultra-loose monetary policy reduce pressure policymakers undertake reforms? i course concern rather hesitant pace economic policy reform. many politician afraid alarm voters. that’s drag reforms. monetary policy cannot solve problems. but cannot inactive either, simply side deliver. bi central bankers’ speech 3 you often use market-based inflation expectation argue monetary easing. be market still useful source information monetary policy? i never take one indicator. and don’t conduct monetary policy basis market prices. that one part information look at. even there’s news, market still subject lot volatility anyway. a number german politician recently voice strong criticism secret agreement purchase security national central banks. some bank purchase large scale, others not. why difference? there’s secret agreement. when currency union found government decide transfer function task necessary monetary policy eurosystem leave task responsibility national central banks. they invest, instance, cover pension employee build capital reserves. some central bank also manage investment portfolio central bank outside euro area invest money stay circulation. it’s vital govern council ecb full control size eurosystem balance sheet, case. if that’s case, publicly? personally, i see problem transparent matter. but decision take govern council. could ecb force national central bank that? a i said, national central bank fulfil task responsibility risk, provide european treaties. but aren’t purchase monetary financing? no, ecb’s govern council limit overall amount necessary information. there thing “money print national central banks” outside eurosystem framework. in case, govern council ensure eurosystem operation infringe prohibition monetary financing. mr praet, bear germany grow here. do understand ecb’s policy severely criticise here? the situation germany different elsewhere europe. there credit cycle here. but germany it’s often forget would face catastrophic situation acted. the european environment difficult. we institutional weakness euro area address eliminated. until happens, work central bank difficult case currency areas. there proper resolution system banks, nothing event state run difficulties. it’s u favour one country another. it simply make best difficult situation. what do right. it’s best could do, working. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview la libre belgique interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, la libre belgique, conduct m isabelle de laminne mr vincent slit publish 21 december 2015. * * * what situation euro area eve 2016? how see come years? the economic outlook improved, environment interest rate low oil price fall sharply. the positive effect structural reform number countries, spain ireland, also underscored. these factor positive effect labour market economic recovery. fiscal policy neutral too, even slightly expansionary. in fact, contribute 0.1% gdp growth euro area 2016 2017. enormous fiscal effort made, although debt level still high. however, must bear mind real gdp euro area first quarter 2016 barely return level early 2008. this mean last eight year gdp euro area grow real terms, average, even though country like germany saw reasonable growth. other country experience severe fall live standard long period time. this pose number problems. the damage cause period non-growth, two recessions, considerable. there is, course, structural unemployment, business investment also decline considerably period still regain 2008 level. country also cut back sharply infrastructure investment. and financial sector stabilise now? the financial sector firm footing. it largely recapitalised. bank supervision carry european central bank level, positive development. but pocket fragility still exist, example level non-performing loan countries. provision make debts, element fragility nonetheless. the low profitability bank level public sector debt, still significant, also underscored. before crisis, public debt euro area represent 60% gdp, today stand nearly 100%. to conclude, economic situation euro area improve remain difficult. the main challenge euro area demonstrate ability bring prosperity security. an enormous amount work remain done. to must add political risk i call “seeping pessimism”. there still considerable support euro political level great european integration still reject extent. that one risk come years. the crisis highlight weakness monetary union, weakness incomplete monetary union. the ecb often send message create condition strong growth government must, turn, undertake structural reform make economy competitive. do politician expect much ecb? yes no. no, everyone responsible must take action. this great coordinate plan. we need mix. a mix includes, one hand, policy structural reform stimulate supply economy, support demand lead ecb, and, other, fiscal 2 bi central bankers’ speech policy achieve debt sustainability long-term growth. cut affect public infrastructure avoided, example; good long-term growth. the principal challenge government regain road productivity, source prosperity. if look back 2000 outlook growth follow five years, average growth rate 2.4% expected. in 2015 growth prospect next five year high 1.3% annually. this problem also affect japan, unite state emerge countries. productivity gain limit certain technology sectors. they need roll rest society, health sector example, tax collection. overall, productivity gain slow respect previous decades. the priority structural reform must rapid dissemination technological advance throughout society. and yes, people expect much ecb, actor rein effort whenever take action. we see le effort public finance side. the ecb make possible avoid outright depression 2012 2013, even break-up euro. it pursue accommodative monetary policy long necessary. without give date, timescale fairly long. it’s long last endeavour. additional risk arise slowdown emerge countries, risk pretty significant euro area. there also downward pressure price manufacture sector result surplus output high unemployment level. but monetary policy alone solve problems. be situation greece control now? discussion ongoing still intensive political technical levels, succeed atmosphere discussion improve considerably. it distinctly positive begin year. a great deal progress already make negotiations. significant reform vote in. the bank able recapitalised. nevertheless, situation remain fragile country. after debt crisis, isn’t migration crisis next threat european cohesion? or represent opportunity? europe must show prosperous secure area. in short term migration economic impact form fiscal expansion positive impact growth. germany’s fiscal situation likely deteriorate around 0.3% 0.4% gdp 2016 2017. this deterioration weak countries. in long term also look impact refugee crisis. this population different, care take integrate migrant labour market, especially germany. in medium term, demographic point view, positive factor. the key issue integrate migrant labour market line profiles. all economic aspect know straightforward. from economic perspective, situation insurmountable; political issue. the integration achieve economic level, accept politically. but cannot do day. europe need young well-trained workforce. we create opportunity tragic situation, go easy. it possible country organise migration, already do past. the issue security combat threat terrorism become major challenge government month come. france already say take liberty european deficit limits. shouldn’t fiscal straightjacket member state loosened? this little bite overstated, security figure quite low budgets, prohibitively expensive strengthen security. of course, relevant fiscal bi central bankers’ speech

counter surge nationalist populist current europe economic perspective? by deliver prosperity economic security promise create euro area. today, level economic output eight year ago. the crisis cause

ahead towards integration. a central banker, i observer actor area. monetary policy one part this. but even harsh critic acknowledge ecb institution function well capacity take decision avoid catastrophes. the effectiveness would require political level, even if, admittedly, difficult. and, i say earlier, crisis reveal weakness monetary union, rather weakness incomplete monetary union. bi central bankers’ speech 1 carolyn wilkins: innovation, central-bank style remark m carolyn wilkins, senior deputy governor bank canada, rotman school management munk school global affairs, toronto, ontario, 13 november 2015. * * * i’d like thank ron morrow, alexis corbett, jill vardy michael ehrmann help prepare speech. introduction everyone know company must innovate thrive. you may know true central banks, even we’re one kind bank wouldn’t imagine go business. just like private companies, central bank often focus immediate issues. this hardly surprising, give throw way past years: financial crisis, great recession oil price shock. and central bank exist first place set solid foundation economy financial system. in recent years, we’ve keep inflation low stable. this make easy people company recover downturn. work authorities, also avoid major disruption financial system. give track record, innovation matter bank? it matter world move quickly: would imagine 20 year ago interest rate would zero number advance economies? that canadian-dollar asset would hold foreign reserves? or would bitcoin atm local pub? confident thing now, bank keep eye future. fail would mistake business could real negative consequence canadian economy. so, us, innovation isn’t react recent crisis; it’s push we’re ready whatever future holds. this i’m happy morning. the rotman school management munk school global affair world-leading organizations. people passionate innovation. now, student know stay ahead curve, need plan. we three-year plan we’re put place, that’s i want discus today.1 i’ll start talk plan continue tradition innovate question answers. i’ll go tough policy research issue we’ll tackle motivate u create plan.2 this lead explain we’ll get past obstacle new idea change corporate culture. finally, i’m go ask 1 every three years, bank set strategic course medium term. our current plan, adopt june, outline bank canada’s 2016–18 medium-term plan find http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/central-banking-new-era-mtp-2016–18.pdf. 2 not surprisingly, bank’s strategy build answer question similar propose former rotman dean roger martin book a. g. lafley, play win: what bank hop achieve? what area focus on? how get good result areas? what tool need get there? what bank’s senior management need support strategy? 2 bi central bankers’ speech – people care bank – get involve constructive dialogue. question answer the bank canada innovation create great depression support economic financial well-being canadians. over past 80 years, bank do exactly carry four main line business. you know monetary policy role, read set interest rate return economy potential meet inflation target 2 per cent. in financial stability role, monitor health canadian financial system act lender last resort. one example work extraordinary liquidity provide system 2008 crisis. we’re also federal government’s fiscal agent, mean manage $650 billion federal debt around $70 billion foreign reserves. finally, we’re responsible bank note wallet. more work go might evident: develop new security features, combat counterfeit research new trend electronic payment digital currencies. those responsibilities, combine balance sheet nearly $100 billion, put bank heart canadian financial system. even though bank mandate 80 years, haven’t afraid change paradigm circumstance demand it. the change monetary policy stark. under bretton wood system prevail second world war, u.s. dollar could exchange gold rate $35 per ounce, country peg currency greenback. in 1950, canada bite international rebel become first industrialize country adopt float exchange rate. canada return fix peg 1960s, let dollar float good 1970. believe not, let market determine value currency revolutionary time. that didn’t solve problems, say least. inflation become rampant: stretch 20 years, never fell 2 per cent sometimes exceed 10 per cent. interest rate exploded: month 1980s, homeowner pay 20 per cent 5-year mortgage. the bank react. it leader know research alternative monetary policy regimes. in central banking, business, take long time bring idea market; take decade develop inflation-targeting regime adopt 1991. target inflation seem like obvious choice today, it’s replicate major advance economies. when start study it, however, many economist would tell unworkable. not afraid innovate, second central bank world set inflation target, short month new zealand. it year idea target inflation fully accept canadian public, bank take lot heat it. bi central bankers’ speech 3 these days, central banker see inflation target success. it credit contribute “great moderation” – 25 year financial crisis, performance advance economy unusually good.3 i wish i could say end story. in reality, success probably distract central bank confront hard question buildup financial risk lead global crisis.4 it’s stern reminder must resist confirmation bias complacency. if bank’s history teach anything, it’s must always ready consider question challenge old answers. how that? by give innovative think central place strategic plan create corporate culture foster different perspective challenge status quo. a former governor david dodge say bank staff, “we clash idea secure knowledge winner loser … we’re explore aspect issue.”5 focus critical central bank issue let turn what’s plan. the bank canada remain commit inflation target expert execution responsibilities. the bank also commit explore best contribute canadian economy world go fundamental structural change. it’s context bank seek advance frontier along business lines. let focus monetary policy. the current inflation-targeting framework work well, bar change high. but history tell u can’t cling indefinitely particular way business. one important challenge central bank conventional monetary policy stretch limit countries, policy interest rate at, below, zero. because this, number country use innovative monetary policy measure return inflation target. canada fortunate avoid bad crisis, thank relative strength economy, prudently manage resilient financial system, well-anchored inflation expectations. tiff macklem, predecessor dean, take lot credit that. it’s surprise focus research firepower monetary policy lesson crisis. the first lesson innovative instrument monetary policy toolbox. structural change reduce economy’s potential grow without create inflation, neutral rate interest low crisis.6 that mean that, continue target 2 per cent inflation rate, it’s likely policy interest rate fall zero past. remember, year ago, many believe zero monetary policy bullets. we observe european country test limit. there, central bank charge commercial bank deposits, government effectively get pay borrow. we publish today interest staff paper look 3 l. benati p. surico, “var analysis great moderation,” american economic review 99, no. 4 (2009):1636–52. 4 o.

exchange rate channel might particularly important. our staff, along many central bank researcher academics, also assess effective innovative monetary policy measure been. today, publish staff research paper cover issues. the bank canada one innovator use tool call forward guidance. that’s central bank communicate intention path policy rate policy actions. the evidence suggest forward guidance, clearly communicate credible, effective policy tool.8 it probably work best it’s reinforce policy actions. other innovative tool central bank experiment ease monetary condition different kind asset-purchase programs. we study experience unite states, europe places, like japan. these central bank design purchase base part market want affect. to low yield curve, purchase longer-term government bonds.9 to improve credit condition specific areas, buy distress asset corporate bond mortgage-backed securities. our research find purchase successful affect yields.10 research area continue, bank around world, situation continue unfold take year understand effect innovations. the second lesson crisis policy-makers must consider risk vulnerability financial system set monetary policy. in lead-up crisis, world economy bolster financial tailwind poorly understood. in aftermath, global recovery hold back financial headwind also don’t understand well. to address blind spot, bank make big investment economic model research. economist use theoretical statistical model forecast future study different policy scenarios. a good model allow u isolate cause-and-effect relationship play complex system. our workhorse models, terms-of-trade economic model, good job assess impact economic shocks.11 but can’t handle behaviour market disruption give rise financial

fiscal macroprudential – authority use handle specific problem support economic financial well-being canadians. we need understand good circumstance would appropriate bank use monetary policy financial stability purposes. model start point. no model give whole picture. that’s engage outside world gather miss pieces, abroad. this allow u ask right question apply judgment. consider alternative future innovation doesn’t stop simply adapt theoretical framework gather information world see today. we must also challenge think contemplate alternative futures. the international monetary system could look completely different 20 year now. china increasingly open financial market liberalize capital flow rest world. while clearly positive global economy long run, huge change transition could bumpy times. that mean need think world financial system evolve canada’s place be. will renminbi become reserve currency? how would affect demand reserve currencies, include canadian-dollar assets? global domestic payment system – backbone financial system – could also look completely different. technology advance new player like paypal apple pay compete traditional ones. the bank help lay groundwork next generation canada’s payment systems.12 then disruptive technologies, distribute ledger that’s heart bitcoin, peer-to-peer lend facility like lend club. these development push financial activity outside traditional financial sector. the share economy upend entire industries. here, i’m think thing like peer-to-peer home rental service vrbo mediate service uber. these type trend raise question bank. consider cashless society everyone us e-money, monetary value store electronically link bank account. if money denominate canadian dollars, issue it? who earn seigniorage?13 the central bank, today, private sector? what would financial system look like case? the bank need consider questions. cash public good many people still prefer, especially small

order, one central bank would struggle implement monetary policy. and, central bank couldn’t act lender last resort currencies. this mean household business could suffer important loss e-money crash. we need anticipate manage risk benefit could arise broad adoption e-money. the bank explore many trend course three-year corporate plan. to this, we’re expand range technique use analysis. for example, we’ve begin capitalize “big data” thing aren’t possible traditional economic statistics. price collect retail website use study price behaviour. social medium use people age express like dislike may become vital source data understand perception credibility monetary policy. we’re also draw technique behavioural economics study thing people form expectations. if don’t start find new approach handle alternative futures, won’t prepare whatever come way. cultivate inquiry inform risk take our strategic plan focus new ideas. and want new idea match ambitions, need right corporate culture. no matter successful is, business face natural obstacle get way innovation. that proactive make sure don’t get way. the first obstacle innovation homogeneous thinking. it’s human nature affinity people think way use jargon. but echo chamber create limiting. people rotman munk know often look outside industry find way improve. we certainly financial crisis creation liquidity facilities, involve economists, market experts, it specialists, lawyer accountants. scientist currency department also cast wide net develop new security feature bank notes. a year ago, turn material use cancer therapy research machine-readable security feature. we get patent innovation. the second obstacle innovation people generally avoid conflict. not everyone enjoy centre debate play devil’s advocate. have smart entrepreneurial people critical generate innovation, it’s sufficient; must also culture value inquiry encourage people speak freely. there lot wisdom concept integrative think propose former rotman dean roger martin: often, two way look problem offer insights. leader give example. good leader flexible mind open challenged. they take time listen. they look facet problem come best strategy. they don’t step newly sprout grass early. so we’ve add innovation formal topic discussion senior leadership meetings. we’ve also put innovation heart leadership expectations. these expectation integrate leadership train embed performance management, recruitment management practices. practically speaking, focus translate manager spend time employee employees’ ideas. leverage important asset – people – spur creative idea diversity thought. we’re also implement new practice help staff ass kind alternative future i mention earlier. we’re develop innovation lab cross-functional group ass bi central bankers’ speech 7 implication low-probability, high-impact economic scenarios. i expect inquisitive “black hat” perspective benefit everyday operation well.15 the last obstacle innovation i’ll mention aversion risk, common among central bankers. this understandable, give responsibility economic stewards. there take-backs writedowns central banking. that said, can’t escape fact innovation entail risks. a company create ipads iphones occasionally produce newton. mark zuckerberg right said, “in world that’s change really quickly, strategy guarantee fail take risks.”16 we find way embrace risk occasional failure come risk without jeopardize mission. this we’re foster culture inform risk taking. to support it, risk-management framework help u anticipate, mitigate manage risk could undermine ability fulfill mandate. it also give u scope groundbreaking research improve operation business practices. reputation figure prominently risk analysis. it deserve special attention vital success work. monetary policy good example this, it’s effective people believe bank achieve inflation target. our credibility take year build intend preserve it. if take appropriate risks, action stand test time, even initially face criticism. the important thing bank right thing, popular one. seek constructive dialogue to get right answers, need engage people outside bank. if don’t engage, leave open confirmation bias tunnel vision. john maynard keynes write depression “it astonish foolish thing one temporarily believe one think long alone, particularly economics.”17 that’s true ever. what i’ve learn since join bank canada 14 year ago need deliberate reach people beyond four walls. we consultation public market participants. we also talk 100 firm every quarter part business outlook survey get sense entrepreneur see ground. a part plan, devise new way reach out. first, we’ve recently launch program outstanding scholar work bank researchers.18 we benefit injection outside leading-edge thinking. we’re also host conference important economic financial issue face canada. early year, hold conference disappoint global growth rates. and we’re get

that way, people benefit analysis it’s fresh. we expect kind work, times, show result fully align view bank’s govern council. that’s okay. the innovation process demand researcher intellectual space

we learn central banks’ experience original idea student have. conclusion let wrap up. if there’s one idea i want leave today, it’s this: world move around you, stand still risky strategy. at bank, put innovative think centre strategic plan make sure navigate what’s ahead. for us, innovation come take hard look we’re consider alternatives. hubris enemy sound policy. innovation come involve

governor national bank denmark, annual meet danish banker association, copenhagen, 7 december 2015. * * * thank invite speak. i follow key message today: in view special circumstance relate krone begin year, ecb’s decision last thursday reduce deposit rate further, i would like make clear nothing change regard danmark nationalbank’s willingness ability defend denmark’s fix exchange rate policy. my second message prolong period low interest rate may lead high asset prices. but subsequently asset may fall considerably value, could result losses, also lenders. furthermore, risk low interest rate impede productivity development denmark buoy unprofitable firm would otherwise close. finally, i would like emphasise new eu recovery resolution regime banks, danmark nationalbank remain lender last resort. but banks’ liquidity management base access emergency liquidity assistance danmark nationalbank come pressure. first, let talk economic situation. while growth emerge market economy shift low gear, advance economy still pick steam. the usa robust upswing, rise employment fall unemployment. in euro area, virtually member state grow rate potential, approach normal level capacity utilisation. in denmark, growth little low previously forecast year, danish economy remain track spare resource likely become scarce next couple years. this see clearly labour market, employment expect continue rise, unemployment declining. a regard monetary policy, respective authority usa euro area currently pursue opposite paths. while market expect federal reserve respond strong labour market increase interest rate soon, ecb last thursday reduce deposit rate 10 basis point –30 basis points. in addition, exist asset purchase programme extended. ease monetary policy euro area aim ensure ecb achieve target inflation below, close to, 2 per cent. in light ecb’s monetary policy steps, danmark nationalbank choose keep monetary policy interest rate unchanged. from april include november, intervention sale foreign exchange market total kr. 230 billion, therefore appropriate allow interest rate spread denmark euro area narrow little. we plenty patience become necessary intervene prevent krone strengthening. in situation – begin year – upper limit amount krone danmark nationalbank make available. we target size foreign exchange reserve. a long short-term interest rate low denmark euro area, reserve even yield positive return. furthermore, reduce danmark nationalbank’s interest rate necessary. bi central bankers’ speech 1 since march year, foreign exchange reserve shrink substantially result intervention market, end november kr. 484 billion. that much high level large inflow capital january february. the capital inflow prompt danmark nationalbank intervene foreign exchange market large amounts, interest rate also reduce considerably. the gradual reduction foreign exchange reserve reflect investor sell krone since large inflow capital begin year. but sell fast done. all all, foreign investor buy krone begin year sell again. domestic investor also reduce hold kroner, slow pace, recently hold increase again. against background, ministry finance, upon recommendation danmark nationalbank, resume issuance government bonds. so far, five auction held, demand generally high. 10 month pass since reduce rate interest certificate deposit –0.75 per cent. at time move unknown territory: never danmark nationalbank’s interest rate low, internationally switzerland introduce correspond level short earlier. the low interest rate desire effect. the krone remain stable euro sign cash hoarding. historically, monetary policy interest rate little high denmark euro area. but right interest rate spread euro area negative. this mean investor will hold financial asset danish krone even return little low euro investments. the long-term interest rate spread denmark germany positive, however. like denmark, germany robust economy current account surpluses. furthermore, interest rate germany large extent affect ecb’s asset purchase programme. the reduce interest rate spread euro area may attributable denmark’s build-up considerable net foreign asset recent years. the increase wealth give rise various payment flow tend strengthen krone, thereby reduce interest rate spread. the accumulation danish net foreign asset pass phenomenon. consequently, reason believe interest rate spread euro area will, long term, low previously. exactly much low difficult say. recent year characterise extraordinary event sovereign debt crisis number euro area member state and, recently, quantitative ease european central bank, ecb. so year cannot see indicator situation long term. all same, seem likely danmark nationalbank’s interest rate close ecb future, time also little lower. shift willingness domestic investor hold unhedged position euro may lead fluctuation size danmark nationalbank’s foreign exchange reserve. it become considerably large previously been. we see clear example year. if danish investor will take foreign exchange risk link large net foreign assets, fall upon danmark nationalbank, interest rate spread become low negative. this part fix exchange rate policy, foundation stable economy three decades. i turn attention credit quality. during crisis learnt, again, value collateral pledge loan may decrease considerably. this case e.g. agricultural land, commercial property least housing. in case price drop much value collateral fell loan amount. a result, loan look safe time grant might late result large loss borrower default collateral realised. this lead loss credit institutions, especially banks, loan subordinated. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we forget that. at present probably apply mainly house loan copenhagen area. here, rate price increase unsustainably high time, although quarterly price increase owner-occupied flat slow since spring. the high price see context low interest rate rise population capital. one reason strong impact price absence automatic stabiliser form countercyclical house taxes. with freeze land tax 2016, push price city particular, fluctuation even larger. that increase risk value home subsequently fall loan amount. when house bubble burst, saw price copenhagen dive sharply. all same, credit institutions’ loss house loan modest. this mainly low interest rates, help ensure homeowner still able service loans. however, cannot assume interest rate also low next time house price fall. the fact interest rate may go house price natural element assessment potential loans. these sound principles, also reflect new guideline danish financial supervisory authority “prudent credit assessment grant house loan growth areas”. the currently low level interest rate make cheap firm service debt. and low level interest rate is, speak, act life-support mechanism them. if interest rate rise, firm variable rate loans, may soon turn unable survive. the clear example agricultural sector. in 2014, nearly 25 per cent farm operate loss, even though buoy strongly low interest rates. if rate interest 2.5 percentage point high 2014, nearly half farm would red. that is, twice many actually case due low interest rates. an interest rate increase 2.5 percentage point lot. if variable interest rate mortgage loan rise 2.5 percentage points, le match current rate interest fix rate mortgage loans. this indicate close one two farmer cannot afford remortgage fix rate loan, would otherwise provide protection future increase short-term interest rates. this emphasis vulnerable agricultural sector – many farmer save low interest rates. the implication low level interest rate take account bank ass deal default loan. this apply loan – agricultural loans. in case may good shut exposure rather wait hop firm will, despite tough odds, survive able repay loans, include interest. especially bank must finance deficit keep firm afloat. that bad bank, risk eventually suffer large loss would otherwise done. and bad economy impede productivity development. labour capital tie firm viable, mean cannot employ productive. i address issue cyber risk; topic receive considerable attention denmark abroad. in increasingly digitise world, society dependent it system function data protected. that also apply financial sector. it well know future problem may type previously seen, next challenge financial stability could well cyber attack. for danmark nationalbank, increase focus cyber risk priority. i put cyber risk agenda meet systemic risk council late month. another topic currently receive much attention market liquidity. the focus mainly decline le resiliant liquidity bond markets. high liquidity support efficient bi central bankers’ speech 3 financial system. danmark nationalbank regularly ass whether change liquidity may negative implication financial stability keep dialogue market participants. a also areas, appreciate close cooperation danish banker association member respect. market liquidity cannot measure directly. therefore, assessment liquidity must base number indicators. in market mortgage bonds, traditional liquidity measure show clear sign reduce liquidity. all same, liquidity volatile since late 2014, indicate become le resiliant. hence, risk small shock previously may cause liquidity bond market evaporate. market participant point market maker become le will absorb imbalance bond supply demand. this see context low risk appetite increase capital liquidity regulation since financial crisis, could mean bank reduce market make bond market. over last year, danish bank reduce portfolio mortgage bond market making, support view. liquidity danish government bond fell 2015. the pattern see european government debt markets, denmark particularly severely affect due suspension issuance. since bond issuance resume october, demand generally high, liquidity improved. trade volume back level see suspension issuance. price quotation also become sharper, still room improvement. finally, i would like mention – like rest eu – new recovery resolution regime, brrd, lay uniform rule handle distress banks. the rule must fully implement 1 january 2016. the fundamental principle owner creditor bear losses, government. this sound principle eliminate imply government guarantee large banks. under new set rules, bank require prepare recovery plans. these plan must describe bank respond encounter difficulties. the bank should, far high degree previously, able take necessary step restore liquidity situation itself. a bank must never count emergency liquidity assistance danmark nationalbank. danmark nationalbank still lender last resort, always been. this apply connection liquidity problem sector general, also single solvent bank urgent need emergency liquidity assistance – ela. the role lender last resort element danmark nationalbank’s task contribute financial stability. but banks’ liquidity management obviously base access emergency liquidity assistance danmark nationalbank come pressure. if bank request ela, danmark nationalbank lender ass whether bank solvent creditworthy thus able repay loan matures. danmark nationalbank include danish financial supervisory authority’s assessment bank’s solvency liquidity natural element connection. furthermore, danmark nationalbank require adequate collateral amount granted. no bank preclude ela advance. but besides consider solvency, creditworthiness ability pledge collateral, danmark nationalbank ass whether financial stability consideration warrant ela. this assessment base specific circumstance relevant situation. under new recovery resolution regime, financial stability company, resolution authority, give number resolution tool prevent resolution cause financial instability. this mean genuine alternative grant ela. we therefore expect new recovery resolution regime limit number situation ela relevant. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let conclude reiterate three key messages: neither unusual circumstance relate krone begin year ecb’s decision last thursday reduce deposit rate affect danmark nationalbank’s willingness ability defend denmark’s fix exchange rate policy. my second message bank aware long period low interest rate may entail credit quality risks, e.g. via fluctuation value collateral. the low interest rate may also impede productivity buoy unprofitable firm would otherwise close. my final message danmark nationalbank lender last resort, also new eu recovery resolution regime banks. but let emphasise banks’ liquidity management must base access emergency liquidity assistance danmark nationalbank. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 5 bi central bankers’ speech 1 juyeol lee: leverage asia open address mr juyeol lee, governor bank korea, bank korea-imf conference “leverage asia: lesson past, what’s new now?, where watch out for?”, seoul, 11 december 2015. * * * greet lady gentlemen, it great pleasure bank korea, together imf, host conference “leverage asia,” sponsor korean ministry strategy finance. i sincerely welcome attending. my special gratitude go director siddharth tiwari imf strategy, policy review department, keynote speaker, deputy director kalpana kochhar imf asia pacific department, conference co-organizer. i would also like thank first vice minister joo hyung-hwan ministry strategy finance, deliver welcome remarks. let express sincere appreciation well esteem conference speakers, discussants, moderators, panelists. leverage emerge market economy draw increase attention lately, give so-called g2 risks, stem u.s. monetary policy normalization slow growth china. at important juncture, i think today’s conference meaningful opportunity consider current status leverage asia relate potential risks, order seek effective policy measure response. current status leverage asia during global financial crisis, global economy suffer severe recession. asian economy also affected, manage recover crisis relatively quickly thank low leverage compare u.s. europe. whereas advance country carry deleveraging since crisis, leverage ratio korea many asian country rising. this due largely abundant global liquidity provide major advance country unprecedented quantitative easing, accommodative policy pursue asian countries. the result low borrow costs, couple easy access finance, lead high leverage region. effect increase leverage economy leverage occur process economic agent fund economic activities. specifically, increase household try smooth fluctuation consumption, firm raise fund investment, government spend tax revenues. a long leverage increase within manageable extent, help boost growth promote economic activities. if leverage rise excessively, however, relative country’s fundamentals, constrain consumption, investment activity economic agents’ debt burden grow. in extreme case, heighten credit risk borrower financial institutions, destabilize financial system. the country’s sovereign rat fall result, inevitable impact real economy. since global financial crisis, financial interconnectedness across country deepen greatly due expand international capital movements. a result, change monetary policy financial condition one country considerable effect 2 bi central bankers’ speech countries. and one country suffer financial instability owe excessive leverage, country likely face contagion risk ever before. policy response measure in future, degree global financial accommodation likely gradually decline u.s. federal reserve’s monetary policy normalization, lead international financial condition develop direction different see now. in circumstances, public private sector need devote great attention stable, appropriate management leverage. financial institution need improve capability screen supply credit borrowers. this allow manage leverage well, quantitatively qualitatively. they also need expand share stable funding, minimize adverse shock case global financial environment changes. borrowers, part, need maintain stable financial structures, properly manage risk stem future income flows, change interest rates, possible maturity mismatch asset liabilities. on policy authority side, effort made, use macro-prudential policies, prevent excessive rise leverage. corporate restructure need well, since continue operation inefficient firm lead leverage increase. and decide monetary fiscal policies, effect policy leverage also carefully investigated. asian emerge market economy substantial external debt, therefore vulnerable external shocks, due example, u.s. dollar appreciation. policymakers thus devote effort develop implement new measure ensure external sector stability. policy macro-economic stability foremost importance, strengthen financial cooperation among country world wide also essential. conclusion i confident today’s conference valuable opportunity participant carefully evaluate potential risk associate leverage asian countries, discus in-depth policy alleviate them. i also believe insightful suggestion make conference help u find way strengthen financial system economic fundamental country asia around world. let conclude say much i appreciate take time busy schedule participate conference today. thank you. françois villeroy de galhau: supervision business practice open speech mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france chairman autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution (acpr), acpr conference “supervision business practices”, paris, 20 november 2015. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight welcome today new conference organise autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution would like thank coming. this opportunity tell first time important i find type event, authority i chair explain action principle guide it. it also opportunity u listen party concerned, topic bring u together today – supervision business practice – i would like put forward three ideas: (i) first, supervision business practice important current mobilisation nation. (ii) second, supervision business practice important financial stability. (iii) lastly, supervision business practice must increasingly take account development technology change europe. our supervision business practice important current mobilisation nation. many lesson learn dramatic event friday 13 november paris suburbs, require u total mobilisation. face barbaric acts, i wish recall determination banque de france – financial sector – participate fight terrorism, attack financing. many attend afternoon presentations, introduce mr delas, vice-chairman acpr, anti-money launder counter-terrorist finance insurance sector. a know, acpr college, together tracfin, adopt last week new guideline area, applicable bank insurance firms. i doubt financial sector fully involve implementation; ensure together professionals. i would also like recall today determination fully participate mobilisation nation, contribute broadly economic social cohesion, great bank financial inclusion. the protection consumer – particular vulnerable one – one component this. financial education fight overindebtedness also priority banque de france actively contributes. terrorism, alas, also fee exclusion different forms. ii/ second, supervision business practice also important financial stability. since creation 2010, acpr responsible safeguard financial stability ensure consumer protection. this major innovation, robust step, wake 2008 crisis loss confidence customer financial sector many advance economies, sometimes due deceptive business practices. restore confidence course interest present room. this means, us, ensure compliance exist law regulations, well best practice observe recommend acpr. bi central bankers’ speech 1 naturally, consumer protection task design enforce different rule blanket fashion. rather, must do accordance principle underlie regulation fully understand reality business practices. to sum one sentence, principle aim balance relation client professionals. this rebalancing mainly achieve take account information asymmetry exist players. this may include rule specific vulnerable clients, category complex products, obligation consider interest customer product design organisation product distribution. the reality business practices, however, difficult sum words. this work acpr staff come play; supervision well analysis different data contact professional consumers. collect data business practice prerequisite acpr guide supervisory duties. against backdrop, acpr redesign questionnaire business practice consumer protection. it understand current market practices, well trend products, service practices. i talk acpr inspections. they firstly intend ensure compliance applicable rule make sure error correct consequence customers. in bad cases, error lead sanctions. this approach necessary punish violation useful increase awareness profession. acpr inspection however limit deal bad practice case-by-case basis. they also identify general problem call change market practice even regulations. several example discuss morning illustrate lesson learn inspections. for instance, acpr staff examine distribution channel number intermediary customer producer (bank often insurer). the question ask today simple. but important sector whole. do intermediary provide value add customer? how guarantee customer reliable efficient chain, irrespective organisation? to enhance practices, acpr also flexible legal tool, recommendation. i believe instrument useful prevention. recommendation intend change guide behaviour professionals. it help identify actually integrate expect term consumer protection. generally, area business practice one quite conceivable best practice define player themselves. to this, dialogue require well commitment bind enough enforced. the aeras agreementwhich aim facilitate access credit people serious health problems, good example i would like thank mr emmanuel constans, chairman aeras mediation committee member acpr college agree present today change agreement. iii/ lastly, supervision business practice must increasingly take account development technology change europe. i believe important, acpr also market, anticipate change wherever possible. european legislation recent process adopt call standardisation customer information. this case package retail insurance-based investment product (priips), directive credit agreement relate residential immovable property (carrp), insurance distribution directive (idd). also, aegis amf, share joint unit efficient 2 bi central bankers’ speech supervise business practices, market financial instrument directive (mifid). european legislation recast obligation product distributor include particular concept independent advice sectoral directives. it also make change obligation product manufacturer impose product design process take account interest characteristic target customers. lastly, extensive work delicate subject compensation sale staff employee complete come months. a regard late least substantial european development area business practices, aim drive standardise rule framework cross-sectoral approach simplification. this drive extended. an obvious case key information document priips regulation. it allow customer easily compare two investment products, irrespective whether classify bank products, insurance product financial instruments. but i could also cite example work area “product governance”, conflict interest compensation, bring regulation three sector close line. i finish discuss change stem new technologies. we aware change business practice affect consumption pattern customer relations. the contractual nature bank insurance industry mean relationship rich often long-standing. such relationship base consent party contract execution basis trust. today, agreement price object, form basis sale contract, possible use security customer data increasingly relevant. the development new technology appearance new tools, aim make “customer experience” fluid attractive, must also take account cardinal principle consumer protection. this also necessary condition new sustainable robust economic model emerge. these area currently main focus national european authority acpr stand ready play full role, draw experience dialogue engage stakeholders. let hand floor patrick montagner acpr staff elaborate number aspect i wish excellent conference. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 3 salvatore rossi: finance growth – capital market union keynote address mr salvatore rossi, senior deputy governor bank italy, rome investment forum 2015 “financing long-term europe”, rome, 11 december 2015. * * * i would like comment proposal capital market union (cmu) raise three questions, give tentative answer them. the first question is: actually need cmu europe? should really priority european policy agenda? my answer resound “yes!”. the question may seem rhetorical, give tide apologetic documents, papers, seminar (including perhaps one) dedicate project since official launch last year. however, i think it”s important keep mind reason “yes”, hesitation even open dislike quite widespread country sectors. the fact european economies, partial exception uk, strongly dependent bank finance needs. too dependent. let explain why. a wide literature (i mind example recent piece empirical research langfield pagano, 2015), show economic growth tend low economy bank-based financial structure, particularly time fall asset prices, systemic risk higher. a “bank bias”, l&p dub it, bad, circumstance. but even believed, sake argument, optimality bank dominance financial systems, come another hard fact: also consequence new regulatory supervisory framework, bank le le will lend money risky borrower smes, heavy burden non-performing loan legacy crisis; capital require risky assets, capital costly. request capital buff come international regulate bodies, global level (financial stability board, basel committee) european level (single supervisory mechanism – ssm), shield new, devastate financial crisis. up now, europe effect procyclical: notwithstanding cheap, abundant liquidity supply ecb, bank reluctant increase lend real economy. the corporate sector, especially southern europe, mostly make smes, access financial capital market difficult, impossible. hence, inconsistent trio: economic structure mostly request bank finance, regulator concern risk pose banks” activity, bank consequently step back ample part credit markets. how sort out? one way move european financial structure intermediary towards market (visco, 2015). this indeed require national efforts, needed: integrate european-wide capital market, harmonise sme-friendly rules. in words, cmu. the second question is: consider european cmu realistic project? this time answer much doubtful. the idea cmu first put forward president european commission european parliament july 2014 (juncker, 2014), ambitious language. last september commission present action plan transform enlighten vision reality (ec, 2015). from one document degree ambition apparently scale down. a nicolas véron (2015) recently noted, plan “mostly boil prune exist rule correct [the] eu”s recent regulatory overreach”. bi central bankers’ speech 1 but suppose normal business commission. let”s check whether harsh judgment well founded. what cmu mean substance? it mean create single market non-bank financial services: belated completion single market project “80s. a first attempt merge european financial market fifteen year ago succeed. in good market main obstacle integration technical standards: harmonise crucial move. in financial service market, obstacle various kinds: every country legal system, tax treatment, account standards, prudential regulation (danielsson et al., 2015). these specificity entrench local costume traditions, case protect national champions. harmonise myriad laws, taxes, regulation short period time, urgency matter would require, extremely challenging. the delicate problem uk. it’s quite obvious european cmu exclude city london would little sense. but uk government highly sensitive london’s competitive advantage financial hub europe, issue remain almost intractable referendum uk remain part european union held. the third question is: do facilitate/accelerate process create pan-european cmu? the approach follow action plan step-by-step one. such approach recommended, chance, stakeholder involve wide public consultation hold commission first half year. be right approach? in principle, one might prefer bold attitude, one address simultaneously directly need harmonisation fields, instance, bankruptcy laws, taxes, investor protection market infrastructure regulations: thatcher-like “big bang”. but would definitely unrealistic. what action plan intend do, i quote key passage document, proceed “from bottom up, identify barrier knock one one, create sense momentum”. among knock first are, accord plan: • red tape information asymmetry make costly smes list equity debt markets; • specific rule new european insurance regulatory framework (solvency 2) capital requirement regulation bank (crr) prevent insurance company bank get involve business finance infrastructure investment; • sort damnation still weigh securitisation global financial crisis (asset-backed security label “toxic sludge”), while, simple transparent, could fundamental tool bridge gap smes financial markets. • forth ... these good intentions. be sufficient create “sense momentum”? we see. the risk fall sort “ten little indians” trap. a risk still present, example, bank union story. bank union conceive institutional framework three pillar (rossi, 2015): ssm, single resolution mechanism (srm), single deposit insurance scheme (sdis). the three pillar originally mean concurrent, symmetric, logically connected. but outcome different. the ssm swiftly realise see prerequisite restore mutual trust among country sovereign debt 2 bi central bankers’ speech crisis. but mistrust remained. on crucial issue bank resolution, long tiresome negotiation decide share cost bank crisis among eurozone country now; foresee final step process last many years, case involve private fund (the single resolution fund, finance eurozone banks). the use money taxpayer country one bank’s head office locate rule – contrary original intention (anyhow, use national public money general forbid state aid rules). a sdis, first postpone indefinite future; recently, proposal present european commission, envisage many-year process reach mutualisation one establish single resolution fund. the cmu, needle say, totally different endeavour. still, overcome variety national habit interest formidable task, inherent difficulty must underestimate want cmu eventually succeed. reference european commission, 2015, action plan build capital market union, http://ec.europa.eu/finance/capital-markets-union/index_en.htm#action-plan.

mario draghi: monetary policy structural reform euro area speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, prometeia40, bologna, 14 december 2015. * * * summary the tool deploy since june 2014 produce intend effects, say mario draghi speech bologna today. follow recalibration instrument decide govern council early month, ecb expect inflation return objective without undue delay. the president also say ecb intensify use instrument ensure achieve price stability mandate, would. however, monetary policy deliver price stability, alone guarantee last prosperity. to structural recovery need raise current growth potential growth well. the key high investment. investment hold back euro area three things: weak demand dynamics, still-high private debt overhang fragile private sector confidence. the euro area today need take additional steps, alongside support demand, address debt overhang fragile confidence. structural reform key end. it clear that, countries, large stock non-performing loan (npls) still prevent strong recovery credit. all explain facilitate work-out npls part package policy action restore productive investment. the ongoing work towards capital market union (cmu) opportunity accelerate progress also front. if truly underpin confidence, important that, even deal press priorities, lose sight need complete monetary union. * * * after crisis last eight years, european economy appear long last solid footing. the recovery lead domestic demand rather exports; prove resilient recent slowdown global trade. monetary policy give decisive impetus this. the tool deploy since june 2014, particular asset purchase programme public private sector security introduce september last year expand january year, produce desire effects. follow govern council’s recalibration instrument early month, expect inflation reach objective without undue delay. but continue closely observe movement economic financial conditions. a i say last council meeting, recently, “there doubt that, intensify use instrument ensure achieve price stability mandate, would”. but shock hit economy since 2008 merely cyclical nature. they also structural. in context, monetary policy secure price stability, alone cannot bring last prosperity economies. it essential, therefore, intervene supply demand side act consistently front consolidate turn cycle, time create condition sound last recovery. what i would like discus today way different policy help achieve result, act sequentially simultaneously respective sphere responsibility. bi central bankers’ speech 1 the role monetary policy one characteristic crisis fall potential growth rate euro area, pace economy grow stable basis without overheating, without generate inflation. it estimate rate around 1% euro area, compare around 2% unite states, crisis fact accompany decline potential growth rate well. this mean even strong cyclical recovery growth fairly low. to ensure structural recovery, must boost short-term cyclical growth, also long-term potential growth. in determine potential growth, role investment crucial. it increase today’s demand tomorrow’s supply. in euro area, however, recovery thus far mainly concern consumption less degree involve investment, still 15% low pre-crisis levels. this weakness is, moreover, common advance economy well. in euro area, investment hold back primarily three factors: weak demand, debt overhang, build already period precede crisis, private sector’s shaky confidence growth prospect economies. at time, virtuous circle, increase investment, strengthen demand, support recovery, lessen debt burden boost confidence. to end, monetary policy play vital role speed return output potential level output gap wide inflation objective. this ecb measure implement since middle last year, context prolong low inflation. we cut official rate negative levels, approve credit ease package – notably target longer-term refinance operation – expand purchase programme public private sector securities. since june 2014 banks’ lend rate firm fall steeply, 80 basis point euro area whole decrease 100–140 basis point country badly hit crisis. so transmission monetary policy powerful: june 2014, similar effect banks’ lend rates, would low monetary policy rate 100 basis points, something time clearly possible. these measures, accord eurosystem staff estimates, help increase growth euro area 1% overall 2015 2017. the fall rate accompany recovery lend businesses. last may, credit ease measure announced, lend decline annual rate 3% area whole. since july, trend halted; euro area average, lend grow again, albeit modest rates. at height crisis, 2012, small firm report access credit principal problem, immediately need find customers. since april year, however, access credit one least significant factor hold back business activity small medium-sized enterprises, accord surveys. lend term condition begin converge rapidly towards enjoy large-scale borrowers. our measure therefore prove effective two ways: reduce divergence lend condition among euro area country compress dispersion different category borrowers. all help consolidate recovery also make flexible. the weaken foreign demand emerge country offset increase demand within euro area, especially economy “non-core” countries. by support bud recovery, monetary policy measure thus make possible mitigate negative effect weaken emerge countries’ economy euro area’s main export countries. 2 bi central bankers’ speech it important positive effect measure also reach small firm mean felt large audience specific economic social groups, sometimes claimed. we must forget small medium-sized enterprise make 99% total number firm europe and, importantly, provide job two-thirds employment. why monetary policy measure effective? one reason lend rate firm high past that, give weakness economic conditions, bank particularly fear risk enterprise become insolvent, reason raise risk premia. however, high rate also cause demand credit healthy firm fall, thus worsen condition economy justifying, ex post, high risk premia. and vicious circle created. by reduce borrow cost new loans, measures, especially target longer-term refinance operations, encourage bank resume lending. the increase competition credit market turn compress rates, drive lend improve macroeconomic picture. we thus succeed break vicious circle. the public private sector purchase programme also fuel competition credit market drive yield sovereign bond thus reduce appeal respect loans, ensure grow volume bank activity direct towards real economy. in addition direct impact target longer-term refinance operations, analysis conduct ecb show asset purchase programme indirect effect credit supply conditions, also improve macroeconomic outlook reduce risk premia. and measure damage banks. far it. although may sometimes lead contraction interest income, measure also lead capital gain banks’ assets, high volume quality credit. consider effects, staff ecb estimate impact measure profitability bank sector essentially nil euro area whole. the role policy the effectiveness monetary policy show ecb appropriate tool achieve price stability objective thus support demand. and within mandate unconstrained choice instrument way deploy them. we always bring inflation objective; must, will. but monetary policy cannot must instrument. on one hand, risk accommodative monetary policy extend period must address appropriate macroprudential instruments. on hand, clear economic policy instrument could improve effectiveness monetary policy close output gap. in past, limit space deployment fiscal policy increase burden monetary policy; today, two policy seem coherent regard. so monetary policy benefit policy area play part sphere responsibility. at time, insofar monetary policy succeed support cyclical recovery, facilitate introduction structural policy could encounter great resistance weak macroeconomic climate. none controversial. the g20 finance minister central bank governor clearly state communiqué issue meet ankara september: “monetary policy continue support economic activity consistent central banks’ mandates, monetary policy alone cannot lead balance growth”. for euro area mean additional step need taken, alongside support demand, address two factor hold back investment: debt overhang fragile confidence. bi central bankers’ speech 3 so entail? let highlight two point particular. first, structural reform clearly part equation. beyond current demand, investment largely depend firms’ sentiment future: micro level, easy business, macro level, confident feel future growth. if obstacle entrepreneurship high, much uncertainty growth prospects, investment low could be. that structural reform important. by reduce red tape, cut cost firm start new projects, thereby raise effective return investment. and encourage high labour participation boost productivity, reform raise expectation demand, give firm great confidence invest today. investment is, all, bet future. so structural reform are, fact, essential comply part treaty espouse objective balance growth, full employment social advancement, promotion scientific technological progress. none objective achieve unless firm invest research development, exploit new technology develop skill upper end value chain; unless, words, condition favour high private investment re-established. moreover, worth remember reform raise potential growth produce permanently high income economy whole, also governments, high tax revenue sustainable public debt, open fiscal space. and that, turn, mean scope fiscal policy support monetary policy stabilise economy. second, area structural reforms, special attention pay measure bring reduction debt overhang. certainly, lot already achieve bank sector creation single supervisory mechanism, part that, comprehensive assessment ensue significant recapitalisation bank sector. this also support repair bank lend channel monetary policy transmission mechanism. but clear that, countries, large stock non-performing loan (npls) still prevent strong pick-up lending. high stock npls dampen credit supply several reasons: absorb resource operational capacity; tie bank capital unproductive uses; reduce bank profitability, weigh banks’ capacity generate capital internally. such effect lend tend exacerbate small firms, dependent bank lending. moreover, slow resolution npls hamper necessary process corporate restructure viable firm reduce debt start invest again, non-viable firm exit market. create condition rapid workout npls part economic policy action restore condition favour productive investment. each country list action need speed process, delay front serious drag growth. in particular, well-designed insolvency regime key separate viable non-viable borrower facilitate valuation asset sell off. an efficient judicial system also essential. analysis ecb staff show pace deleveraging fast country strong effective legal apparatus. from perspective, recent reform insolvency law italy welcome. it estimate average length bankruptcy procedure halved. foreclosure time also expect decrease significantly. this important short time recover collateral bring market value non-performing asset close level transaction take place, mean bank deleveraging accelerate. the ongoing work towards capital market union (cmu) opportunity accelerate progress fronts. a true cmu aim harmonise insolvency regime improve 4 bi central bankers’ speech overall quality converge towards international best practices. that turn also help expand secondary market distress debt, help bank get npls book easily. and cmu successful develop european market sme asset-backed securities, bank able diversify credit risk lend smes easily, strengthen credit supply. finally, truly underpin confidence, important that, even deal press priorities, lose sight need complete monetary union. in context several step take commission steer process right direction. but also important confidence step form part longer-term vision remove fragility union. in sum, combination monetary policy measure demand side, couple structural reform supply side, go long way towards create condition genuinely structural recovery. monetary policy structural reform together support demand, deleveraging

monetary authority, 5th hong kong - london rmb forum, seminar rmb business, hong kong, 11 december 2015. * * * katharine [braddick], peter [alexander], distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, it give great pleasure host 5th hong kong – london renminbi (rmb) forum. may i extend warm welcome attend seminar form part forum, especially guest travel london. this annual congregation reflection importance place long-established rmb business co-operation hong kong london. and, seminar could come good time. just 10 day ago, international monetary fund announce decision include rmb special draw right basket. naturally, hong kong monetary authority welcome announcement represent milestone development rmb. the imf’s decision reaffirm chinese currency’s status freely usable currency, enhance representativeness sdr basket. indeed, base market projections, rmb’s inclusion basket could bring us$1 trillion worth investment rmb asset central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational organisations, large pension fund institutional investor next five years. more importantly, i believe, imf’s decision promote confidence use rmb international trade financial transactions, give impetus rmb’s internationalisation process. the imf’s decision therefore represent key milestone rmb’s internationalisation. significant progress also make area cross-border use rmb past year. and, i see three important trend emerging: key trend rmb internationalisation first continue liberalisation capital account major breakthrough new policy headroom grant mainland authorities. the shanghai-hong kong stock connect place operate smoothly since november 2014, allow international investor access a-shares list shanghai stock exchange hong kong, vice versa. the mainland-hong kong mutual recognition fund scheme implement july year, allow mainland hong kong fund distribute other’s market streamline approval process. eligible fund currently go approval process expect launch market shortly. since june, offshore bank also allow conduct repos onshore interbank bond market, since july, foreign central banks, sovereign wealth fund supranational organisation allow access onshore interbank bond market without investment quota conduct much wide range transactions. they also grant access chinese foreign exchange market september. these key step liberate capital accounts. and come. we look forward launch shenzhen-hong kong stock connect, look ahead, mainland authority announce plan consider implement qualify domestic individual investor scheme (qdii2) trial basis. it’s certainly true individual mainland show great deal interest diversify investment holdings. this area see hong kong strong competitive advantage, strategic location, expertise private bank wealth management business, couple strong client network mainland. to 2 bi central bankers’ speech capitalise emerge opportunities, liaise closely mainland authority qdii2.the second trend chinese capital “going out”, chinese company also increasingly "going out". outward direct investment (odi) china rest world amount rmb758.5 billion 2014, 63% rise past five years. and, it’s interest note 16% flow settle rmb, mere 3.7% 2011. this “going out” trend continue time, give fresh impetus great desire chinese enterprise diversify non-rmb asset classes. new policy measure mainland authorities, notably ‘belt road’ initiative, also play key role. accord ministry commerce, chinese enterprise already invest total us$13.2 billion 49 country along “belt road” first ten month year. the commencement operation asian infrastructure investment bank expect bring chinese capital company “going out” time. hong kong’s deep mature financial market ideal place corporates raise fund infrastructure project manage investment ‘belt road’ developments. the capital investment project also expect create new opportunity use rmb trade investment activities, give rise new opportunity rmb settlement, finance asset management region. to ride opportunities, hong kong actively pursue measure develop hub corporate treasury centre (ctcs) chinese corporates multinational company expand footprint increasingly demand centralise treasury management. the hkma work closely government develop concessionary tax regime provide market-friendly environment company set ctc hong kong, relevant amendment bill introduce legislative council last week. the third trend market developments, term turnover product range, pick momentum past year. there rapidly grow list product provide bank hong kong meet clients’ liquidity, hedge business need rmb. at end april, daily turnover rmb foreign exchange transaction hong kong reach us$93 billion equivalent, eight time great five year ago. the average daily turnover hong kong’s rmb real time gross settlement system also exceed rmb1 trillion recently. go forward, see product denominate rmb. this area market participant play part also think seminar like important bring together idea look solutions. build market infrastructure the hkma play major role promote market development, strategy focus strengthen market infrastructure support offshore rmb business. indeed, liquidity linchpin grow offshore business hkma place rmb400 billion currency swap agreement people’s bank china activate market condition warrant. in addition, make available rmb liquidity facility bank currently offer intraday repos rmb10 billion, well overnight fund t+0 basis one-day one-week fund settle t+1 basis. we also appoint seven bank primary liquidity provider (plps) provide bilateral repo facility rmb2 billion. these facility help bank good manage rmb liquidity play significant role offshore market development. these facility review time time aim provide good liquidity support offshore rmb market. hong kong also develop highly efficient rmb clear settlement system. a i mentioned, average daily turnover exceed rmb1 trillion recently. we continue enhance service capability rmb clear settlement system keep pace business growth. our system complement recently launch cross-border interbank bi central bankers’ speech 3 payment system (cips) mainland authorities, make rmb business transaction even convenient. conclusion in conclusion, china’s 13th five-year plan 2016–2020 reaffirm commitment open wide world, accelerate open capital market develop rmb convertible freely usable currency. financial centre like hong kong london, robust mature markets, play major role facilitate usage rmb internationally. in context, hong kong – london rmb forum essential element share experience learn other, particularly area market product developments. i wish fruitful seminar. bi central bankers’ speech 1 delisle worrell: keep economy stable achieve growth

atlantic canada, halifax, nova scotia, 27 october 2015. * * * introduction thank invite speak halifax. in remark today, i want take inside bank canada walk monetary policy decision making. in particular, i want discus take account dimension time. let’s start basic reality: canadian make choice present know consequence far future. anyone make decision whether take job, pursue education, buy house save retirement form view result be. business decide whether hire workers, expand plant equipment, seek new customers, adjust prices, finance operation face similar reality. a cfas, know time centre every financial decision make advise on. the bank canada’s mandate – deliver low, stable predictable inflation – fundamentally root importance time. our job make sure longer-term decision wrong-sided unexpected change value money. the confidence canadian money can’t take granted: it’s something work hard achieve maintain. when look around world even back canadian experience, see many case either high inflation – opposite, deflation – damaging, sometimes even devastating, effects. the second aspect time address that, bank canada too, short-term decision long-term results. to achieve good inflation outcome, need make decision policy interest rate short run – every six weeks. these decision influence economy inflation evolve much long period. a know, six week long time economy markets. we approach decision vast set new information. to start with, inflation fluctuate, fundamental reason result various temporary one-off factors. in addition, receive kind economic data canada economy affect us; financial market commodity price data; well many relevant news item economic policies, foreign conflict even weather. so react information – without overreact – keep eye prize? i hope aren’t disappoint i won’t tell next. to tell truth, i don’t really know. a lot happen next policy announcement december 2! what i spell logic approach – think underlie trend inflation make sense stream information come in. the test time let’s start background inflation-targeting framework. canada’s decision 1991 set target inflation come blue: product two decade unacceptably high variable inflation. during 1970s 1980s, inflation become part everyone’s calculations. adjustment inflation contentious element wage negotiations. interest rate rise high double digits, build premium high expect rate inflation uncertainty around it. high variable inflation also different effect different groups: bi central bankers’ speech 1 saw salaries, save pension erode away, others reap windfall house financial investments. for period, canada’s monetary policy struggle find clear direction. half century ago, anchor bretton wood system fix exchange rates.1 that system collapse early 1970s face increasingly open financial market contradictory policy unite state major economies. in mid-1970s, canada, like many advance economies, try target rate growth money supply. this approach base extensive research show inflation tend associate increase supply money economy. but deregulation financial innovation, relationship rate expansion money supply rate inflation prove unstable. money supply target long viable abandon 1982. before money-targeting period, bank canada clear policy framework guide monetary policy action anchor public’s expectation inflation. inflation rise high monetary policy react accommodate inflationary pressure come commodity prices, fiscal deficit high inflation countries. while inflation eventually tame 1980s, long arduous process come cost several year sub-par economic growth. in 1991, recognize importance inflation economic financial well-being canadian central role monetary policy control inflation long run, bank begin pursue explicit target inflation. the result impressive. since 1991, inflation canada, measure consumer price index (cpi), remarkably stable. inflation average 2 per cent (chart 1), variability fall roughly two-thirds. canadian benefit number important ways. great price stability allow consumer business manage affair great certainty future purchase power income financial assets. real nominal interest rate also low across range maturities, part, long include substantial premium compensate investor inflation risk. more broadly, low, stable predictable inflation facilitate stable economic growth canada low less-variable unemployment (table 1). our inflation-targeting regime also stand test 2007–09 global financial crisis. a fallout hit canadian economy, bank canada responded. we ease monetary policy aggressively forestall deep prolong economic slump. inflation target give u flexibility allow strong policy response. it provide analytical framework calibrate far go, long. it also anchor public’s confidence that, despite extreme condition period, policy would remain track achieve 2 per cent inflation target. a particularly useful feature inflation-targeting framework that, every five years, renew agreement federal government. the agreement set target inflation parameter achieve it. and renewal process provide opportunity discipline reassess approach systematic way look room improvement. but bar major change high. we know inflation target turn far superior framework tried. also, i stressed, part 1 canada adhere bretton wood part post-war period. see m. bordo, t. gomes l. schembri, “canada imf: trailblazer prodigal son?” discussion paper 2009–1, bank canada, 2009; d. dodge, “the evolve international monetary order need evolve imf” (speech woodrow wilson school public international affairs, princeton, new jersey, 30 march 2006). 2 bi central bankers’ speech purpose monetary policy framework allow canadian make longer-term decision without worry much inflation – argue change framework unless it’s really necessary. a matter time let’s look time way enter target inflation. target inflation involve important challenges, don’t control inflation directly. normally, influence inflation policy interest rate – precisely, target overnight interbank rate. our policy rate affect interest rate economy, overall financial condition and, turn, economy large. it affect inflation amount excess demand supply economy – output gap – generate pressure inflation disinflation. the exchange rate expectation also play important role transmit effect monetary policy inflation. there long lag transmission process – lag vary significantly, depend economic context. total inflation “noisy” many temporary sector-specific factor impinge inflation short run and, many cases, quickly reverse (chart 2). some example consumer energy price gasoline prices, price certain food product may fluctuate weather factors. in canada, example, 90 per cent observe monthly variation cpi link price change eight category good services, together amount one-seventh whole cpi basket. there many example temporary factors, let take one. in early 2000s, auto insurance premium soar 30 per cent span one year. by itself, one component cpi basket add full percentage point inflation (chart 3).2 this outcome reflective broad inflationary processes. in setting, can’t hit inflation target precisely continuously – don’t try to. to illustrate, consider would happen raise policy rate mechanically whenever inflation target low whenever inflation target. we would end react lot temporary factors. and policy work long lags, would overreact, make huge adjustment policy rate effect, follow huge correction compensate lag effect policies. this would lead call “instrument instability” – kind policy over-steering would quickly land u ditch. this reason point u two directions. first, need able look temporary factor affect inflation short run, don’t overreact shock go reverse anyway. second, need understand anticipate force affect inflation future policy decision keep inflation target effect work way economy. both element go make judgment underlie trend inflation evolving. so, rather try hit inflation target continuously, set time horizon reach it. normally it’s two years, base estimate reasonable time frame policy effect temporary shock dissipate. 2 m. khan, l. morel p. sabourin, “a comprehensive evaluation measure core inflation canada,” discussion paper no. 2015–12, bank canada, 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but flexibility return sooner take longer, depend nature shock affect economy. in particular, flexible inflation targeting, scope take long get back target situation return target within two year would require aggressive policy could result buildup imbalance financial system possible instability road. this point make explicit inflation-targeting framework last time renew 2011. the time return target thus require judgment balance risks. even inflation target, can’t afford complacent. sometimes force push inflation high lower, need use monetary policy counteract them. in cases, policy rate need deviate long-run level provide stimulus restraint necessary offset forces.3 there also situation need get ahead shock see significant effect inflation future. otherwise, would situation try catch effect already become entrenched. that logic january 2015 rate cut. we could see 60 per cent decline price oil would, balance, bad canadian economy. so even though still uncertain large prolong effect would be, need act promptly achieve inflation target. the combination long- short-run factor affect inflation, lag effect policies, uncertainty around element make monetary policy fundamentally exercise risk management. while one try write reaction function rule describe monetary policy, rule function go far. for example, taylor rule hold monetary authority adjust policy rate response deviation inflation rate target output potential. that’s useful rule thumb, mechanical go far explain policy actually behaves. inflation target also “informationally inclusive,” mean doesn’t react current inflation rate gdp. it also take account broad range information. that information include economic data well soft information response business outlook survey wide range informal conversation conduct business canadians. we use combination model judgment understand underlie force work inflation. we want get clear picture possible, actually go on, also could go wrong unexpected happened. underlie inflation in think target inflation time, aspect receive lot attention recently underlie inflation: inflation rate would prevail absence various sector-specific one-off factor affect measure cpi month month. conceptually, underlie inflation drive mainly amount excess supply demand economy, together public’s expectation inflation. underlie inflation particularly important concept year. we impact oil price shock, push inflation via price gasoline consumer energy products. at time, weak canadian dollar, largely associate low price oil canadian commodity exports, push measure inflation upward. a number one-off factor also affect inflation. our challenge distinguish trend temporary avoid 3 for detail discussion use monetary policy counteract headwind tailwinds, see technical box 2, bank canada monetary policy report (july 2011): 28. 4 bi central bankers’ speech overreact temporary – give public confidence inflation return right track. for reason, bank canada, along many central banks, us number measure calculate core inflation, design minimize influence transitory price movement (table 2). an effective core measure must four key properties. it must le volatile total inflation; closely track long-run movement total cpi (in words, “unbiased”); relate underlie driver inflation, notably output gap, order reliably predict future trend movement total cpi; easy understand explain public. since 2001, bank canada feature one measure core inflation operational guide monetary policy: cpix, exclude eight volatile component cpi adjust remain component effect indirect tax (chart 4).4 include eight component mortgage interest costs, cpix strip different reason: avoid give perverse read impact monetary policy core inflation. (a measure core inflation include mortgage interest cost increase policy tighten bring inflation.) another exclusion-based core measure, cpixfet, take food, energy indirect taxes. yet others calculate core inflation use trim mean, exclude different component month base whether exhibit volatility specific point time. more sophisticate method track common price movement across category cpi basket. such movement likely reflect aggregate demand fluctuation sector-specific developments. the advantage tool take information price cpi use objective method filter information. the disadvantage case construct use technique that, firmly found logic statistical theory, opaque. all measure follow similar track (chart 5). each measure satisfy key property identify differ degrees. they display le volatility total inflation (chart 6). and one track long-run movement total cpi closely. while various measure correlate output gap differ degrees, predictive power total inflation (chart 7).5 but formula completely exclude idiosyncratic factors. we’ve example lately automobile pricing, telecoms, consumer electricity natural gas. the product subject idiosyncratic factor change period period; obviously, can’t change measure time happens. nor ignore sector-specific factors: sometimes, movement individual price advance warn wide price movements, look right context. a prepare renewal inflation-control agreement federal government 2016, examine property measure core inflation determine whether bank continue practice identify one pre-eminent measure 4 the exclude item cpix fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest costs, intercity transportation tobacco products, well effect change indirect tax gst. 5 all core measure generally good predictor total inflation total inflation itself. however, none measure outperform naïve forecast 2 per cent. bi central bankers’ speech 5 operational guide and, so, whether cpix continue play role. we publish today website late technical assessment measure core inflation.6 exchange rate inflation target i want discus one factor particularly important effect inflation: exchange rate. inflation target work flexible exchange rate, give bank canada room set monetary policy independently countries. we don’t target exchange rate even publish forecast. with float exchange rate, external value canadian dollar change variety reasons, affect inflation canada two channels. it direct pass-through effect price import goods. the exchange rate also affect inflation indirectly impact aggregate demand canadian economy, mainly effect competitiveness canadian-produced good service relative produce elsewhere. the pass-through effect transitory, effect aggregate demand generally persist long period. the importance kind effect particularly clear change exchange rate large recently: le two years, canadian dollar lose 20 per cent value u.s. dollar. the effect depreciation export real economy already evident. it improve competitiveness canadian producers. export category historically sensitive exchange rate movement show strong activity. example include build package materials, furniture fixtures, clothe textile products, large motor vehicle (e.g., heavy truck buses). export services, constitute 15 per cent total exports, also benefiting. the pass-through effect also quite significant. they estimate add 0.9 1.1 percentage point total cpi inflation (chart 8).7 so monetary policy react? if change exchange rate see temporary factor reflect structural changes, clearly appropriate look pass-through effect assess underlie inflation make policy. that case present time. the depreciation canadian dollar drive mainly two factors. first, associate sharp decline canada’s term trade price oil canadian commodity export decreased. these commodity price development are, turn, result dynamic supply demand commodity global market, certainly result canadian monetary policy.8 second, part general strengthen u. s. dollar economy strengthen federal reserve move close normalize monetary policy. by logic, exclude direct impact pass-through effect exchange rate movement assess underlie inflation. therefore, judge underlie inflation around 1.5 1.7 per cent. of course, effect weak canadian dollar stimulate canadian economy essential element projection underlie inflation return sustainably target, economy back potential, next couple years. 6 m. khan, l. morel p. sabourin, “a comprehensive evaluation measure core inflation canada,” discussion paper no. 2015–12, bank canada, 2015. 7 l. savoie-chabot m. khan, “exchange rate pass-through consumer prices: theory recent evidence,” discussion paper no. 2015–9, bank canada, 2015. 8 t. lane, “drilling down – understand oil price their economic impact” (speech madison international trade association (mita), madison, wisconsin, 13 january 2015). 6 bi central bankers’ speech although believe that’s right decision present time, would always right call. there times, 1970s, exchange rate movement part broad inflationary process. in cases, look pass-through could put u treadmill accommodate high inflation. moreover, identify pass-through depend combination estimation judgment. for reason, issue estimate underlie trend inflation judgment current policy context, rather alternative measure core inflation. expectation expectation inflation, base actual inflation well credibility target, also play central role conduct monetary policy. many economic decision depend expectation future inflation. for businesses, inflation expectation influence stance wage negotiation price setting, well assess rate return decision production, hire invest productive capacity. for households, expectation impact save decision well choice alternative save vehicles.9 through influence decisions, expectation tend become self-fulfilling. it would much challenge keep inflation target expectation become unanchored – anchor low high level. for reasons, keep close eye expect inflation. we measure business expectation quarterly business outlook survey recently begin track household expectation quarterly online poll 1,000 canadian consumers. the poll measure inflation expectation participant various time horizon uncertainty surround expectations. it also cover wide array economic expectation inform bank, canadian general, issue range labour market prospect personal finances. conclusion let wrap up. our inflation-targeting framework stand test time. it prove vastly superior policy alternative tried. our periodic renewal important opportunity make sure continue serve purpose suggest improvements. i focus one set improvement considering: ass underlie trend inflation, separate price movement likely temporary. the critical test confidence inflation remain within target range. we would like public take 2 per cent inflation granted. we don’t, however, take confidence u granted. we know earn trust delivering, without fail, commitment. 9 a. côté, “inflation, expectation monetary policy” (speech association québécoise de technologies, mont-tremblant, quebec, 19 february 2015. bi central bankers’

30 october 2015. * * * your excellency prime minister, dear governor hamza senior central bank representatives, your excellency ambassadors, dear guests, friend colleagues, i delight welcome annual conference bank albania organise cooperation south east europe study oxford. it pleasure see cooperation bring together old new partners. this tough year full challenge albanian economy, consequently work bank albania. the full recovery economic growth improvement future remain one top priority work year. the prolong crisis impel u homologous institution across world review many economic axioms, take grant long time. it accident main topic conference focus causality solution long-term problem face period. over five year period, albanian economy grow positive territory, yet, potential. this global phenomenon post-crisis period, extend across entire south east europe, experience even low growth rates. i hope conference opportunity analyse depth reason behind situation, source fee difficulty impose business model financial intermediation. furthermore, would useful discus option available policymakers way situation, which, i believe, temporary situation rather long-term economic equilibrium. the bank albania actively use two main instruments, monetary policy macro-prudential one, give contribution swift systematic closure negative output gap albania. the bank continue implement accommodative monetary policy low key interest rate historic 2% level. notwithstanding scepticism accompany process, low key interest rate reflect wide range interest rate financial market, include loan government securities. the fact economy continue grow potential, necessarily reflect absence effective transmission channel monetary policy. we convince that, all, weak aggregate demand, generate much need stimulus recovery economic activity. recent data, however, render u optimistic. the real sector show sign constant recovery, corroborate positive development external economy. i would like underline clear prospect political economic situation greece positive impact upcoming period. the bank albania continuously monitor development southern neighbour, aware various risk could spill albanian economy. but, thank precise duly interventions, especially bank sector, risk never materialised. bi central bankers’ speech 1 the constant ease monetary policy seem reflect especially investment indicators, domestic foreign one show significant improvement first half year. on side, happy investment due public sector interventions. there also substantial component private sector. this make u believe well-studied project investors, couple increasingly sound pro-investment business climate, serve main driver economy towards high also sustainable growth near future. in accordance best contemporary practices, bank albania endeavour enhance transparency communication public, actual decision also forecasts. the bank albania constantly convey economic agent idea monetary policy remain accommodative sustain revitalisation economy. a result, hope forward guidance monetary policy stance bank albania adequately understand market agent public. bank entrepreneur use opportunity boost activity rest assure central bank continue sustain support activity. in addition monetary policy easing, bank albania pay special attention reform financial sector prudent supervision bank sector. the chair board governor federal reserve system, ms. yellen, statement long ago leaf doubt necessity reform financial sector, i quote “... sine qua non sustain economic recovery follow financial crisis thoroughgoing repair financial system.” from perspective, cooperation parliament, government public regulatory entity undertake series legislative regulatory initiatives, aim create incentive recovery assurance lending. thank reform undertake year, start reap first positive result regard situation non-performing loans. a result, ratio non-performing loan fell first time almost seven year continuous rise. the write loss loans, i explain previous statements, finalisation joint inter-institutional efforts. during process, assist oversee also important international financial institution world bank international monetary fund. beyond non-performing loan issue, bank system continue well capitalised, liquid financially sound. the issue non-performing loan require time resolve, keep u recovery credit activity home. for long positive performance above-mentioned indicator continues, bank sector room potential credit convince project investments. in judgement, important administer courage persistence prevalent perception non-performing loan force bank adopt conservative approach lending. to permanently address problem, additional measure take take future. i would like briefly focus late initiative regard: coordinate plan bank albania, government albania, association banks, international monetary fund, consist two main pillars: the first pillar relate draft complete legislation regulate lend moment conclude contract final repayment, include dispute among parties. these change aim make precise legal term procedure relate bank activity, bailiff services, borrower relevant state institutions. the second pillar relate regulatory framework activity bank system, therefore, relate day day activity bank albania bank system. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we identify regulation subject amendments. in addition objective create high flexibility relation certain aspect activity treatment credit portfolio, aim adopt new concept: “background check (biografi)” client relation bank borrowing. we believe new element help bank ass borrow potential client. in spite i say above, fact that, recently, lend national currency see positive growth months. this phenomenon, among others, accompany positive side effect high speed intensity pas mechanism monetary policy economy. dear guests, a i point out, beginning, economic activity home remain positive trajectory, yet reach level wish were. research bank continue confirm albanian economy unutilised potential close gap remain main challenge policymakers. intervention monetary policy macro-prudential element insofar succeed definitively close gap. i list fact intentionally conference year call “do crisis change economic fundamentals?” these intervention main action central bank allow legislation, recommend modern theory. if intervention fail introduce long-term positive equilibrium economy, question arise naturally: else done? the answer phrase “structural reforms”. while phrase may often speculated, truth firmly confirms: willingness project undertake courageous visionary reform golden key success”. this fact strongly emphasise final statement minister finance central bank governor 24 develop nations, (financial committee imf) annual meet imf organise early month lima, peru. a secure sustainable long-term growth require timely-implemented well-sequenced structural reform remain critical raise productivity, potential output, live standards; bolster confidence economy reduce social inequality. concluding, i would like underline support bank albania series reform undertake recently part medium-term agreement government albania, bank albania international monetary fund. similarly rest south east europe, albania need new path, investor able see profit opportunities. it
