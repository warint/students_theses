 bi review 21/2002 1 bank japan’s march report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 22 march 2002 * * * the bank’s view2 japan’s economy still continue deteriorate whole, although downward pressure export inventory gradually abating. with regard final demand, decline net export (real export minus real imports) almost cease amid improvement export conditions. meanwhile, business fix investment continue decrease private consumption remain weak. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment also declining. to sure, final demand overall still weak, exports—which relatively large impact production—have recently stop declining. also, inventory adjustment progress many industry include electronic part due continue production cutback date. reflect developments, decline industrial production moderate further. however, firm maintain stance reduce personnel expense strong excessiveness employment. under situation, severity employment income condition household rather intensifying, unemployment rise trend rate decline wage expanding. turn outlook, export conditions, synchronize inventory adjustment it-related good worldwide near end. under condition, east asian economy appear hit bottom. a u.s., possibility increase economy recover since household spend remain solid inventory adjustment almost finished, although still remain uncertain factors. furthermore, yen low level compare last autumn. under circumstances, export expect turn toward middle year. still, pace recovery export modest, anticipate expansion overseas economy gradual final demand it-related good worldwide remain stagnant time being. meanwhile, respect domestic demand, business fix investment expect follow downtrend reflect fall corporate profits. private consumption also likely remain lackluster mainly due worsen employment income conditions. while domestic private demand generally weaken mention above, government spend basically project follow downward trend. consequently, may take quite economic activity whole stop declining, even though decrease industrial production may come end background improvement export condition completion inventory adjustment. overall, economic deterioration japan project moderate steadily, production stop decline due mainly recovery exports. still, economy continue fragile state, continuous attention pay risk negative impact economy development foreign domestic financial markets. with regard prices, import price increase reflect depreciation yen since around end last year rise international commodity prices. the decline domestic wholesale price recently contract somewhat background increase import price progress inventory adjustment. consumer price continue decline effect fall crude oil price latter half last year persisting, price import product substitute keep falling. corporate service price continue decline. a condition surround price developments, depreciation yen around end last year rise international commodity price regard factor support price time being. however, since domestic demand project remain weak time, balance supply demand expect keep exert downward pressure prices. furthermore, factor ongoing technological innovation machinery, deregulation, streamline 1 this report base data information available time bank japan monetary policy meet hold march 19 20, 2002. 2

prices. in addition, expansion rate decline wage may also work factor push price downward, mainly service price apt influence factor. overall, price expect follow gradual decline trend time being. moreover, give high degree uncertainty regard future economic developments, possibility weak demand intensify downward pressure price continuously warrant careful monitoring. in financial market, overnight call rate continue move around zero percent bank japan provide ample liquidity money market aim maintain outstanding balance current account bank around 10 15 trillion yen. interest rate

policy meet february 28. yield long-term government bond mainly move range 1.4-1.5 percent recently. yield spread private bond (bank bond corporate bonds) government bond expand slightly. stock price start turn due tight regulation short-selling stock rise u.s. stocks, subsequently increase domestic foreign institutional investor buy back. in foreign exchange market, yen surge temporarily reaction rise japanese stock price weaken thereafter. with regard corporate finance, private bank become cautious extend loan firm high credit risk continue active extend loan blue-chip companies. the lend attitude financial institution perceive firm become severe. in corporate bond cp markets, fund-raise condition generally favorable particularly firm high credit ratings, issue environment low credit rat continue severe whole. credit demand private sector continue follow downtrend mainly firm decrease business fix investment continuously reduce debts. amid developments, private banks’ lend continue decline 2 percent year-on-year basis. meanwhile, amount outstanding corporate bond issue grow around 2-3 percent year-on-year basis. the year-on-year growth rate amount outstanding cp issue continue decline, although amount still well previous year’s level. the year-on-year growth rate monetary base increase record substantial increase somewhat le 30 percent. the year-on-year growth rate

continue cautious take credit risks. hence, development behavior financial institution corporate finance continue require close monitoring. bi review 21/2002 1 alan greenspan: corporate governance remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, stern school business, new york university, new york, 26 march 2002. * * * corporate governance1 evolve past century effectively promote allocation nation’s save productive uses. and, generally speaking, result structure business incentives, reporting, accountability serve u well. we could achieve current level national productivity corporate governance deeply flawed. and yet, recent experience bankruptcy enron and, precede that, several less incident suggest governance corporation stray perception suppose work. by law, shareholder corporation and, ideally, corporate manager work behalf shareholder allocate business resource optimum use. but economy grown, business unit become ever larger, de facto shareholder control diminished: ownership become disperse shareholder sufficient stake individually influence choice board director chief executive officers. the vast majority corporate share ownership investment, achieve operate control company. thus, increasingly fall corporate officers, especially chief executive officer, guide business, hopefully perceive best interest shareholders. indeed, board director appoint shareholder overwhelm majority case choose slate propose ceo. the ceo set business strategy organization strongly influence choice account practice measure ongoing degree success failure strategy. outside auditor generally choose ceo audit committee ceo-chosen directors. shareholder usually perfunctorily affirm choices. to sure, ceo maintain control corporate governance long company demonstrably difficulty. when company run trouble, carte blanche grant ceo shareholder withdrawn. exist shareholders, successful hostile bidder corporation, usually displace board director ceo. such change corporate leadership relatively rare but, often not, contribute more-effective allocation corporate capital. for part, despite provide limit incentive board member safeguard shareholder interests, paradigm work well. we fortunate, financial market realistic alternative depend chief executive officer ensure objective evaluation prospect corporation. apart relatively large institutional investors, many exist potential shareholder research capability analyze corporate report thus judge investment value corporation. this vitally important service become dominate firm business underwrite sell securities. but, see recent history, long-term earn forecast brokerage-based security analysts, average, persistently overly optimistic. three- five-year earn forecast s&p 500 corporations, compile projection security analyst i/b/e/s, average almost 12 percent per year 1985 2001. actual earn growth period average 7 percent. perhaps last sixteen years, systematic data available, historical aberration. but persistence bias year year suggest likely results, least part, proclivity firm sell security retain promote analyst optimistic inclination. moreover, bias apparently especially large brokerage firm issue forecast also serf underwriter company’s securities. 1 on topic nonfinancial corporate governance, federal reserve board’s jurisdiction, i obviously speak myself. in addition, comment represent official view subject president’s work group financial markets, i member. 2 bi review 21/2002 the performance security analyst may improve result recent joint initiative national association security dealer new york stock exchange require brokerage firm include research report distribution firms’ ratings, among “buy,” “sell,” “hold,” example. brokerage firm must also include research report record indicate analyst assign change rat company. i suspect underlie database publicly available, matter time ex post result analysts’ recommendation compile publish regular basis. i venture say transparency, current upward bias analysts’ earn projection would diminish rather rapidly, investment firm well aware security analysis without credibility market value. * * * prior past several decades, earn forecast nearly important factor assess value corporations. in fact, i recall price-to-earnings ratio prominent statistic 1950s. instead, investor tend value stock basis dividend yields. since early 1980s, however, corporation increasingly pay cash shareholder form share repurchase rather dividends. the marginal individual tax rate dividends, rare exceptions, always high marginal tax rate capital gain repurchase create raise per share earn share reduction. but, early 1980s, share repurchase frown upon security exchange commission, company repurchase share take risk investigate price manipulation. in 1982, sec give company safe harbor conduct share repurchase without risk investigation. this action prompt mark shift toward repurchase lieu dividend avail shareholder low tax rate cash receipts. more recently, desire manage shareholder dilution rise incidence employee stock option also spur repurchases. a consequence, dividend payout ratios, decade past average 55 percent, recent year fall average 35 percent. but share price rise much earn recent years, dividend yields--the ratio dividend per share company’s share price--have fall appreciably payout ratio. a half-century ago, example, dividend yield stock typically average 6 percent. today yield barely 1 percent. the sharp fall dividend payout ratio yield dramatically shift focus stock price evaluation toward earnings. unlike cash dividends, whose value unambiguous, unambiguously “correct” value earnings. although pretax profit reflect cash receipt le out-of-pocket cash costs, significant part result change balance-sheet valuations. the value almost asset base assets’ ability produce future income. but appropriate judgment asset value depend critically forecast forthcoming events, nature uncertain. a bank, example, book interest pay loan current revenue. however, borrower subsequently defaults, presume interest payment would, retrospect, see partial return principal. we seek cope uncertainty construct loan reserves, adequacy reserve also subject forecast. depreciation charge income, base book values, crude approximation deterioration economic value physical plant. the actual deterioration know asset retire sold. and projection future investment return defined-benefit pension plan markedly affect corporate pension contribution and, hence, pre-tax profits. thus, one choose evaluate future income potential balance sheet significant impact current report earnings. * * * earn uncertainty particularly elevate recent years. improvement information technology create new opportunity innovative companies, environment rapid technological change also one result profit opportunity difficult ass project. in particular, rapid change heighten potential competitor encroach establish market positions. this process capital reallocation increase long-term earn growth potential economy whole, widen well degree uncertainty individual firms. not surprisingly then, longer-term outlook increasingly amorphous, level recent growth short-term earn take especial significance stock price evaluation, bi review 21/2002 3 quarterly earn report subject anticipation, rumor, “spin.” such tactics, presumably, attempt induce investor extrapolate short-term trend favorable long-term view would raise current stock price. ceos, increase pressure investment community meet short-term elevate expectations, many instance draw account device whose sole purpose arguably obscure potential adverse results. outside auditors, several well-publicized occasions, sanction devices, allegedly fear lose value corporate clients. thus, surprise since 1998 earn restatement proliferated. this situation far cry early decade when, recollection serf correctly, firm compete basis one conservative set books. short-term stock price value seem le focus maintain unquestioned credit worthiness. * * * a change behavior, however, may already train. the sharp decline stock bond price follow enron’s collapse chasten many uncritical practitioner questionable accounting. corporate reputation fortunately reemerging ash enron debacle significant economic value. market evidently begin put price-earnings premium report earn appear free spin. likewise, perception reliability firms’ financial statement increasingly reflect yield spread corporate bonds. corporate governance doubtless already measurably improve result great market discipline wake recent events. but congress clearly signal need done. i hope legislative regulatory initiative move realign current practice de jure governance model serve u well generation past. most success direction would seem come primarily change incentive corporate officers. in particular, president bush suggested, define clearly duty ceo respect account disclosure appear appropriate. there are, doubtless, measure could reinforce aforementioned enron-induced market incentive disclosure thereby strengthen investors’ trust, essential effective function free-market capitalism. we careful, however, look significant expansion regulation solution current problems, especially price-earnings ratio increasingly reflect market’s perception quality accounting. regulation has, years, prove partially successful dissuade individual play rule accounting. * * * some changes, however, appear overdue. in principle, stock-option grants, properly constructed, highly effective align corporate officers’ incentive shareholders. regrettably, current account option create perverse effect quality corporate disclosure that, arguably, complicate evaluation earn hence diminish effectiveness publish income statement support good corporate governance. the failure include value stock-option grant employee compensation and, hence, subtract pretax profits, increase report earn presumably stock prices. this would case even offset expired, unexercised option made. the financial account standard board propose require expense early middle 1990s abandon proposal face significant political pressure. the federal reserve staff estimate substitution unexpensed option grant cash compensation add 2-1/2 percentage point report annual growth earn large corporation 1995 2000. many argue distortion report earn growth contribute misallocation capital investment, especially high-tech firms. if market participant indeed misled, that, itself, surprising, little mystery effect stock-option grant earn report shareholders. account rule require enough data option grant report footnote corporate financial statement enable analyst calculate reasonable estimate effect earnings. some argue black-scholes option pricing, prevail mean estimate option expense, approximate. but good deal earn estimation, i indicate earlier. moreover, every corporation report implicit estimate option expense income statement. that number most, course, zero. be option grant truly without value? 4 bi review 21/2002 critic option expense also argue expense make raise capital difficult. but expense bookkeeping transaction. nothing real change actual operation cash flow corporation. if investor dissuade low report earn result expensing, mean le inform been. capital employ basis misinformation likely capital misused. critic expense also argue availability option enable corporation attract more-productive employees. that may well true. but option expense way preclude issuance options. to sure, low report earn result expense could temper stock price increase thereby exacerbate effect share dilution. that, presumably, could inhibit option issuance. but again, inhibition would appropriate, would reflect correction misinformation. * * * in endeavor align board director shareholders, rather management, considerable attention place fill board seat so-called independent directors. however, experience, director modern time see interest separate ceo, effectively appoint and, presumably, could remove future slate director submit shareholders. i deny law could pass force selection slate director patently independent ceo influence thereby significantly diminish role ceo. i suspect, however, initiative, ensure independent directors, would create compete power center within corporation, thus dilute coherent control impair effective governance. * * * after considerable soul-searching many congressional hearings, current ceo-dominant paradigm, faults, likely continue view viable form corporate governance today’s world. the credible alternative large--primarily institutional--shareholders exert far control corporate affair appear will exercise. fortunately, seem clear that, ceo choose govern interest shareholders, can, example oversight, induce corporate colleague outside auditor behave way produce de facto governance match de jure shareholder-led model. such ceo leadership critical achieve optimum allocation nation’s corporate capital. * * * before concluding, i like emphasize market economy require structure formal rules--a law contracts, bankruptcy statutes, code shareholder rights--to name few. but rule cannot substitute character. in virtually transactions, whether customer colleagues, rely word business. if could so, good service could exchange efficiently. company run people high ethical standard arguably need detail rule act long-run interest shareholder and, presumably, themselves. but, regrettably, human be come are--some enviable standards, others continually seek cut corners. yet one set rule corporate governance, must apply all. craft rule provide proper mix regulatory market-based incentive penalty never easy. and i suspect even get beyond enron debacle, craft update rule continue challenge. bi review 20/2002 1 otmar issing: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement professor otmar issing, member executive board european central bank, brussels, 20 march 2002. * * * today, i would like review economic development euro area context monetary policy strategy ecb. before this, allow mention extremely please see euro cash changeover go smoothly. there significant technical problem complex logistical process fact national banknote largely withdraw well final deadline cease legal tender confirm european public become familiar new banknote coin quickly. the govern council would like express gratitude help make euro cash changeover success. turn monetary policy, let start remark first pillar ecb's monetary policy strategy. in 2001, annual rate m3 growth double low almost 4% march 8% november, decline slightly january 2002. from june 2001 onwards, m3 growth stand clearly reference value 4½%. however, govern council far assess development imply risk price stability medium term. let explain detail assessment. a well aware, govern council ecb react mechanistic way deviation m3 growth reference value. rather, conduct thorough analysis monetary analysis view derive information outlook price stability medium term. this analysis base clear evidence high m3 growth lead inflation medium term euro area. however, addition, need take account monetary development time affect number temporary factor change tax regulation or, case, turmoil financial markets. hence, appropriate assessment monetary development always need take medium-term perspective addition require detail knowledge underlie factors. the year 2001 highlight importance take broad-based approach monetary analysis. m3 growth 2001 drive significant extent number factor continue judge indicate upward risk price stability medium-term. let point one important factor, namely fact m3 growth significantly influence portfolio decision economic agents. initially, relatively flat yield curve august 2001 persistent decline stock price september seem induce many investor shift part portfolio capital market shorter-term assets, include m3. subsequently, aftermath event 11 september, exceptional rise economic financial uncertainty lead shift longer-term asset low-risk, liquid instrument include m3. in addition, let point substantial decline growth loan private sector 2001. this contrast development money loan feature clearly distinguish monetary situation 2001 1999, strengthen m3 growth accompany strong loan dynamics. hence, overall assessment monetary development euro area 2001 far indicate risk price stability. however, assessment need continuously checked, matter monetary analysis medium-term trends. it therefore crucial monitor m3 develop year. should moderation monetary growth materialise implication monetary development risk price stability may need reassessed, particular conjunction strong economic recovery euro area. on basis available evidence fundamental long run stability money demand euro area, affect event 2001, analysis monetary development medium term thus remain crucial assess future inflation. it also worth point strong increase liquidity 2001 specific euro area global phenomenon point existence common (financial market) factor influence monetary development well reflect stance monetary policy major economy 2001. turn second pillar, recent data release provide evidence improvement economic condition euro area. this turn increase likelihood economic cycle reach trough end last year. 2 bi review 20/2002 start external developments, indication gradual firm economic activity, turn lead gradual strengthen external demand euro area product services. these development certainly reinforce expectation upturn economic activity euro area 2002. the recovery support continuous favourable finance condition significant positive impact past expect future decline inflation real disposable income. in addition, recovery encounter fundamental impediments, give lack major economic imbalance euro area require long adjustment process. recent data point recovery start moderately early 2002 accelerate course year, assessment seem share expectation form financial markets. our expectation real gdp growth might line potential towards end 2002. overall, however, still face significant uncertainty regard strength economic upswing year. turn price developments, current outlook gradual economic recovery euro area imply inflationary pressure stem economic activity likely remain subdue time. in fact, downward trend annual hicp inflation observe since may 2001 expect continue come months. however, annual inflation rate are, expected, undergo volatility first month year. the pick-up hicp inflation january 2002 see light. it partly due base effect stem fall energy price early 2001 high indirect tax euro area country early year. the increase also reflect considerable rise unprocessed food price due adverse weather condition part europe slight increase energy price start 2002. in next months, effect past increase energy food price gradually subside, data february 2002, annual hicp inflation decline 2.4% 2.7%, already indicated, annual inflation rate fall 2%. it well know evidence euro cash changeover significant upward effect average price level euro area. while observe significant increase sub-components service price inflation, also see price round context cash changeover. in view, also reply one question address ecb letter chairperson committee week ago, expect great transparency result introduction euro move exclusive euro price strengthen competition retail sector thereby support maintenance price stability euro area. besides uncertainty oil price, key factor current assessment risk price stability development wages. the govern council closely monitor forthcoming wage negotiation analyse implication future price developments. a favourable outlook price stability euro area rest fundamentally assumption wage moderation continue. this also major condition employment growth decline unemployment. in respect, follow letter president ecb chairperson committee, let briefly recall govern council satisfy definition price stability, – way – fully consistent goal pursue successful national central bank euro area prior stage three economic monetary union. it worth point quantitative definition, namely annual increase 2% hicp euro area, symmetric, i.e. also definitely compatible deflation. furthermore, also state price stability maintain "over medium term", govern council acknowledge existence shock inflation monetary policy cannot control make clear ecb intend pursue objective respond differently different economic shocks. this consideration may lead, cases, gradual response monetary policy risk price stability. our forward-looking strategy medium-term orientation towards maintain price stability thus help avoid harmful trade-off growth employment. most importantly, definition price stability contribute anchor inflation expectation euro area, thereby reduce risk premia ultimately support efficient allocation resource favourable long-term finance condition economy. for reasons, maintenance price stability medium term best contribution monetary policy sustainable growth employment creation. turn main challenge euro area face present, let start mention stability-oriented macroeconomic policy require step towards fiscal consolidation. the recently reaffirm commitment government euro area country fiscal imbalance avoid breach 3% deficit limit year adhere objective achieve balance bi review 20/2002 3 budget 2003-2004 appropriate policy pursue. the govern council support action take european commission context stability growth pact subsequent outcome ecofin council meet last month. in vein, vigilance necessary ensure strict adherence medium-term plan implementation exist procedures. in particular, country still sizeable fiscal imbalance take advantage come upswing strengthen budgetary position attain target present stability programmes. finally, order put expect recovery broad sustainable basis, utmost importance euro area country strengthen effort implement comprehensive structural reforms. over past years, considerable progress make enhance flexibility euro area's product capital markets, well improve way labour market operate. these reforms, together moderate wage developments, contribute strong employment growth considerable reduction unemployment witness many euro area country last cyclical upswing. however, unemployment still intolerably high much remain done. in context, important make headway reform agenda put forward lisbon strategy. we accept recovery might constrain unsatisfactory potential growth level. the sound macroeconomic situation expect present perfect opportunity accelerate badly need reforms. this require acceleration financial market reform well product market reforms, relate network industries. a regard labour market reforms, worth note despite continue high level unemployment euro area significant mismatch labour supply demand number area euro area country still reported. a conclude recent report prepare eurosystem experts, publish 11 march, provide evidence despite improvements, still much work do labour market reform process. with respect reform financial markets, ecb much support implementation procedure suggest lamfalussy report security regulation. the ecb belief procedure suggest report allow swift implementation priority set financial service action plan relate integration security markets. the reform financial market regulation, also include measure foresee action plan, complement enhance effect reform labour product market. bi review 20/2002 1 christian noyer: france, europe, euro ecb speech mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, university nantes, 22 march 2002. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, i like begin express pleasure invite talk euro, ecb single monetary policy first three year stage three european economic monetary union (emu). the primary objective ecb the treaty establish european community assign single monetary policy maintenance price stability euro area primary objective. monetary policy pursue one primary objective. the participate national central bank long hold belief, result year experience, credible last maintenance price stability single monetary policy best contribute sustain long-run economic growth, employment creation good standard living. ask monetary policy more, serve purposes, risk create illusion monetary policy do. the event 1970s, particular, demonstrate central bank aim boost real activity implement excessively expansionary monetary policy, face high inflation risk financial instability. due need disinflation process afterwards, long-run disadvantage expansionary policy term output employment loss turn always much high immediate advantage term transitory growth push. price stability, contrary, contribute efficient allocation economy's resource enhance transparency price mechanism prevent tax distortion individual misallocation save wealth. moreover, neutralise need hedge inflation particular minimise inflation risk premium long-term interest rates, price stability contribute channel real resource towards production investment. thus favour economic employment growth. for purpose support safeguard pursuit price stability, treaty endow ecb high degree institutional independence. at time, ensure transparency accountability ecb's policy design implementation, treaty also impose certain report requirement ecb. the ecb has, fact, exceed these, thereby set high standards. monetary policy decision regularly explain press conference give president first meet ecb govern council every month, monthly bulletin ecb, speech give member govern council testimony president board member european parliament. key aspect ecb's monetary policy strategy to achieve treaty mandate, ecb design medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy. to enhance clarity, anchor expectation offer yardstick ecb hold accountable, govern council ecb provide numerical definition price stability "a year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) euro area 2%". this close objective participate national central bank start stage three economic monetary union (emu). the banque de france, example, 1998 define price stability consumer price inflation "not exceed 2%". the govern council also emphasise price stability maintain medium term. the focus medium term guarantee appropriate orientation impart monetary policy. this ensure measure policy reaction threat price stability prevent 2 bi review 20/2002 unnecessary volatility introduce economy. the medium-term orientation also realistically acknowledge short-term volatility price cannot control monetary policy monetary policy therefore hold accountable price development long horizon. the recognition monetary policy cope ever change imperfectly know world key consideration design ecb's monetary policy strategy. the govern council choose equip broad robust framework analyse economic development shocks, call two pillar monetary policy strategy. give long-term monetary nature inflation, first pillar assign prominent role money. this imply use monetary analysis model monetary aggregate play important role analyse risk price stability. in parallel, second pillar ensure form analysis models, investigation interplay supply demand well cost-push dynamics, incorporate analysis price developments. together, two pillar ensure comprehensive assessment economic situation allow focus nature shock hit euro area, thereby provide adequate guidance policy process. can one size fit all? the ecb's definition price stability see quantification ecb's primary objective, apply euro area whole. this imply single monetary policy consider successful fulfil primary objective aggregate development matter. the euro area country need always exhibit similar price developments. in way maintenance price stability within single country consistent divergence rate price change among different region cities, price stability euro area generally line inflation differential among individual member countries. indeed, study price differential major u city show differential least large sometimes even large country euro area. whether differential cause concern depend source. inflation differential result public debate often quote "a catching-up process", illustrate balassa-samuelson theory, see part normal process adjustment consistent well-functioning economy. thus cause concern. a catching-up process may start level productivity – thus per caput income – country monetary union (much) low participate economies. when productive sectors, notably trade good sectors, become expose international competition, country typically go transitional, catching-up period may experience sector productivity growth fast attain mature participate countries. this catching-up process may, turn, lead fast price increase productivity growth country gain tradables match similar productivity growth non-tradable sectors, wage tradables non-tradables tend converge. in euro area, impact pure catching-up effect price level likely minor substantial process convergence per caput income already take place last decades. however, inflation differential arise excessive wage increases, unsustainable expansion profit margin expansionary stance fiscal policy, situation may become cause concern. each factors, fact, may well lead loss competitiveness and, eventually, loss output employment growth. these are, however, problem single monetary policy position address. it task national economic policy avoid counteract situations. i come back issue later. inflation differential may also induce economic policy shock affect euro area country region different way different times. also, local economy may respond dissimilarly common shock individual economic structures. especially run-up stage three emu, quantitative relevance asymmetric shock attract lot attention among analyst among economic observers. the economic framework mind, know optimum currency area theory, predict creation common monetary area become costly participate country experience idiosyncratic shocks, term size, nature frequency, vary response shock are. while asymmetric shock adjustment mechanism recognise realities, also see general framework, within gain stage bi review 20/2002 3 three emu take account. these gain sizeable. from political point view, monetary unification, part general process european integration, see bring long-lasting peace high level co-operation participate countries. from economic point view, monetary unification see bring great prosperity stability. there doubt fact stage three emu has, have, net positive impact france participate countries. it is, however, worth examine potential effect result asymmetries. to extent asymmetry still exist concern? one useful way approach problem compare euro area unite states. the u appear fairly natural benchmark. it economy similar several way euro area, least size economy population. one line suggest approach compare degree synchronisation economic activity among euro area country u state regions. one interest find emerge empirical literature asynchronous fluctuation also take place us. we therefore surprise observe similar fact euro area. however, evidence result several study carry past year point unambiguously high degree co-movement u euro area. yet, study also find high increase degree synchronisation within euro area, long period time, also recent years. this degree convergence appear approach level record us. similar conclusion reach reference analysis estimate differentiate impact asymmetric shock result adjustment. these find appear contrast diversify production structure several euro area country compare state us. however, evidence result combination two factors: distribution shock result country-specific adjustment process shocks. the relative impact two force across country europe unclear. in addition evidence, argue analyse evolution euro area economy year precede monetary union order gain insight likely future development misleading. indeed, entry currency union may well foster economic integration, enhance intra-area trade and, increase interdependence, raise degree synchronisation participate countries' macroeconomic fluctuations. in addition, adoption currency eliminate one source major external instability affect euro area economy past, namely exchange rate shock significant magnitude. moreover, high synchronisation follow close trade links. the adoption common currency, fact, promote trade among member union eliminate exchange rate risk diminish transaction costs. in theory, increase trade among two country could also opposite effect, increase divergence business cycles. this could happen, instance, close integration trade induce high degree specialisation, consequence production structure become heterogeneous across countries, make vulnerable idiosyncratic shocks. the question effect prevail mainly empirical one, plausible. the evidence euro area far appear suggest country integrate trade other, correlate respective business cycle be. at present stage, early estimate effect stage three emu reduce severity asymmetric shock increase business cycle synchronisation among participate countries. while impact likely take place already, period time need full effect develop uncertain. although useful lesson gain comparison us, over-emphasised. a matter fact, important difference euro area u also identified. in us, example, importance stock market higher, market represent mechanism amplify impact shock real economy. moreover, evidence find u adjustment asymmetric shock fast euro area, largely latter's low mobility capital labour. in particular, labour mobility, one important adjustment mechanism us, often find much low euro area. while partly offset increase mobility capital, enhance creation single market europe, many euro area country labour still remain immobile. 4 bi review 20/2002 a currency union need flexible market when labour mobility low, efficient response economic shock asymmetrical effect euro area country require prompt adjustment price wage local levels. flexibility price wage set therefore particularly crucial euro area. more precisely, increase flexibility would allow region national economy adjust rapidly smoothly shock affect particular sectors. we always bear mind, moreover, economy operate increasingly competitive global environment require ever frequent adjustments, particularly sectors. for many reasons, structural reform aim increase mobility, boost competition reduce rigidity distortion goods, service labour market need euro area. in product markets, progress make past years. these market become integrate sectors, network industries, liberalised. the adoption european company statute council ministers, example, step right direction. this statute allow for, regulates, creation firm operate eu-wide basis govern community law. another ambitious reform liberalisation eu's postal sector, although full implementation take time. despite encourage developments, pace liberalisation uneven across participate country effort still need several sector various area remain burden excessive regulation. these delay act brake flexibility competition require improve long-term sustainable employment growth prospects. one area still require much attention, i already mentioned, labour market. the potential benefits, term high aggregate welfare employment growth, reform euro area labour market high. follow reform implement 1990s, positive effect already felt. these include strong employment growth sharp decline unemployment rate record euro area recent years. progress labour market structural reform has, however, uneven among euro area countries. indeed, rigidity persist. for example, although euro area unemployment rate 2001 stand 8.5%, survey study show company often problem recruit workers. such labour mismatch demonstrate reform need increase labour supply demand improve job creation, also increase likelihood vacancy fill unemployed find work quickly. in addition, unemployment rate still 8%, low level labour force participation uneven labour market performance across euro area country clearly indicate measure need taken. reforms, particular, require improve job intermediation, enhance wage flexibility increase wage differentiation, improve education promote train life-long learn order maintain develop human capital. moreover, reform tax benefit systems, introduction le restrictive employment protection, work time flexibility, measure increase labour mobility also needed. it also important keep mind reform carry broader, systematic coordinate manner across sector country present. if objective transform euro area competitive dynamic economy world, decide lisbon european council 2000, effort needed. challenge fiscal policy i would like devote attention fiscal policy. national fiscal policy europe guide budgetary provision contain maastricht treaty stability growth pact. the provision maastricht treaty, limit level government deficit government debt, key achieve sound public finances. the stability growth pact, agree upon 1997, introduce target budgetary position close balance surplus medium-term objective member states. with monetary policy conduct euro area whole, fiscal policy important instrument hand national government stabilise domestic demand output. discipline sound fiscal policy support ecb's stability-oriented policy reduce risk price stability. the so-called automatic stabiliser one mechanism cushion fluctuation demand price development national level. automatic fiscal stabiliser mechanism build tax code bi review 20/2002 5 social legislation. they lead timely symmetrical reaction budget policy economic fluctuation reduce demand pressure economy period strong growth support economy downturns, without require government action. the full benefit automatic stabiliser however secure country preserve sustainability public finance prudent fiscal position low debt. otherwise, burden debt service risk excessive deficit limit ability let automatic stabiliser operate. the strategy attain preserve medium-term position close balance surplus, require stability growth pact, promote sustainable public finance therefore also fully support stabilise role public finances. nevertheless, considerable doubt effectiveness discretionary fiscal fine-tune way manage aggregate demand due well-know implementation lag problem policy reversal. let finally add think relationship monetary policy fiscal policy. the ecb closely monitor fiscal policy since one main area significant shock price stability – also long-term interest rate – originate. in fact, many episode high inflation past relate mismanagement public finance combine accommodate monetary stance. monetary policy gear maintain price stability medium term end take fiscal development account. the ecb's monetary policy framework however envisage mechanistic reaction fiscal policy changes. moreover, need coordinate monetary fiscal policy euro-area level authority act

representatives, norge bank, 21 march 2002. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * your excellencies, lady gentleman the economic outlook the world economy experience slowdown. economic growth stagnate u euro area last three quarter 2001. growth remain somewhat firm uk, moderate towards end year. gdp fall japan. in countries, public private consumption fuel growth demand, fall capital formation inventory exert downward pressure. growth u economy come halt last spring. overinvestment, particularly it telecom equipment lead low return capital reduce corporate earnings. the stock market decline growth prospect revised. the unemployment rate rose. terrorism war add uncertainty. the u economy flexible seldom remain recession long period. there sign early recovery. monetary policy fiscal ease support continue growth private consumption. equity prices, commodity price long-term interest rate pick since sharp decline follow event september 11. oil price plunge around 40 per cent autumn 2000 end 2001. development towards end last year mark low demand oil. in december, opec country together russia, mexico norway decide limit oil production. this may contribute increase oil price last months. the risk war middle east decline commercial oil stock u may also contribute increase oil price. oil price plunge around 40 per cent autumn 2000 end 2001. development towards end last year mark low demand oil. in december, opec country together russia, mexico norway decide limit oil production. this may contribute increase oil price last months. the risk war middle east decline commercial oil stock u may also contribute increase oil price. 2 bi review 20/2002 bi review 20/2002 3 the global slowdown start ripple effect norwegian economy autumn winter. price important norwegian export product fell, market many export industry weakened. salmon price drop close 20 per cent 2001, reach record level previous year. the trade policy eu stipulate minimum price salmon exports, benefit ineffective high cost producers. the volume traditional export fell autumn last year. fish, iron steel export show steep declines. employment stagnate early last autumn, pick towards end year. unemployment edge somewhat latter half 2001, remain low. in february 2002, register unemployment 3.1 per cent, 0.3 percentage point high one year earlier. norwegian household seem relatively unaffected international downturn. overall consumer confidence rise sharply first quarter 2002, back level record early 2000. households’ confidence financial situation remain high throughout autumn, reflect solid growth real disposable income comfortable net asset position. 4 bi review 20/2002 we estimate price inflation, unchanged interest rates, 2½ per cent two year ahead. the overall uncertainty surround inflation projection illustrate chart. on whole, risk seem balance around central projection 2½ per cent. norway’s real disposable income highly affect export prices. a income export oil gas transfer government petroleum fund, effect global downturn activity level norway limited. the norwegian economy may weather downturn without substantial impact level activity employment, continue risk high growth labour cost business public sectors. economic policy the guideline economic policy revise last year. henceforth, real return government petroleum fund shall use central government budget. central government petroleum revenue shall continue transfer government petroleum fund invest abroad. monetary policy norway orient towards low stable inflation. since march 2001 inflation target set 2½ per cent. when monetary policy orient towards stabilise inflation, also contribute stabilise aggregate demand output. the inflation target nominal anchor norwegian economy. low inflation objective interest rate instrument. if appear inflation unchanged interest rate high 2½ per cent, interest rate increased. if appear inflation unchanged interest rate low 2½ per cent, interest rate lowered. low stable inflation fix feature economic developments. this something social partners, businesses, borrower investor property security take given. from 1986, change exchange rate prospect change exchange rate implication interest rates. a stable krone exchange rate nominal anchor. in norway, reflect wage determination labour cost development among trade partner country important reference. exchange rate major international currency fluctuate widely. the u dollar appreciate 30 per cent since 1995. the german mark – euro since january 1999 – depreciate 1995 autumn 2000. the japanese yen particularly volatile. bi review 20/2002 5 small country also experience fairly wide exchange rate fluctuations. the swedish krona depreciate 10 per cent since summer 2000. the australian dollar weaken 30 per cent since spring 1997. the uk, canada new zealand also experience wide exchange rate fluctuations. the norwegian krone exchange rate, hand, relatively stable. country whose export include large component raw material tend experience considerable volatility exchange rate. australia one example. fluctuation commodity price entail change countries’ term trade, measure ratio export import prices. change term trade impact exchange rate, turn curb effect change commodity price profitability business sector. hence, exchange rate serf buff change term trade. norway’s term trade also fluctuate considerably, primarily reflect change oil prices. however, substantial portion petroleum revenue invest foreign equity bond government petroleum fund. change oil price influence size fund, 6 bi review 20/2002 little effect use petroleum revenue home. the government petroleum fund thus serf buff swing oil price, thereby stabilise krone exchange rate. the norwegian economy may nevertheless expose disturbance type cannot absorb petroleum fund. in future, fluctuation value currency probably line fluctuation observe countries. the exchange rate vary. the increase labour cost important norge bank’s ass outlook price inflation set interest rates. since 1997, labour cost increase annually 5 7 per cent. in spite this, consumer price inflation close 2½ per cent past years. the krone exchange rate appreciate result wide interest rate differential norway countries. combine low growth abroad increase trade low-cost country china, lead slow rise import prices. in norway, voluntary export restraint clothe remove tariff clothe reduce considerably. in eu us, similar tendency see extent. this may explain price clothe fall norway relative eu us. however, still long way go restriction clothe import norway entirely dismantled. for example, duty today import children’s clothe shirts, suits, jacket trouser men boys. a world economy recovers, import price inflation edge up. a rise labour cost 5 per cent consistent inflation target krone continue appreciate. in long run, wage must compatible value add generate workers, i.e. labour productivity. over time, increase real wage therefore determine development labour productivity. in norway, productivity growth average 1½-2 per cent last 20 years. if continue case, increase nominal labour cost around 4-4½ per cent long term consistent inflation target. there important interaction monetary policy fiscal policy. accord guideline fiscal policy, petroleum revenue phase approximately pace expect real return government petroleum fund. this guideline imply fiscal policy contribute stimulate aggregate demand norwegian economy every year many year ahead. the guideline also imply use petroleum revenue increase long petroleum fund expanding. variation oil price accompany considerable fluctuation government petroleum revenue one year next. it important prevent fluctuation spill mainland economy. public expenditure tax vary relation oil price would result unstable economic environment. financial market would mark uncertainty turbulence, increase risk premium norwegian securities. this would result bi review 20/2002 7 high variable interest rates. the risk financial crisis norway would also increase cyclical fluctuation norwegian economy would pronounced. it therefore advantage fiscal policy predictable anchor long-term strategy. the future size petroleum fund depend oil price developments. the guideline ensure use return wealth already accumulated. this make policy robust change oil price ensure petroleum wealth benefit today future. the guideline provide framework contribute make central government budget appropriate tool set political priorities. it set limit share petroleum revenue government use year distinguish domestic foreign spending. this eliminate waste resource two separate budget would necessarily entail. the government invest petroleum wealth foreign security petroleum fund. government wealth thereby diversified. these investment impact norwegian capital market. both mainland private save business fix investment high recent years. in norway, credit capital market nevertheless feature weaknesses, thin security market narrow investor ownership base compare countries. the reasons, hence solutions, probably find structure taxation dwellings, property financial assets, high level state ownership enterprise organisation pension save norway. invest even government capital norway would reduce return investment norwegian business sector prompt investor invest elsewhere. allocate even capital norwegian economy would probably lead rapid relocation job countries, krone would tend appreciate. effect industry structure the plan use petroleum revenue increase demand public private services. the guideline imply increase use petroleum revenue central government budget around 3½ per cent mainland gdp 2010. this may add 2½ -3 per cent total employment service sector. a long labour shortage norway, comparable decline manufacture employment likely occur. although phase petroleum revenue gradual process, contest labour resource intensify. a result, monetary policy likely remain fairly tight year ahead. a high interest rate level may period result strong krone. this may accelerate scale back manufacture industry. however, long run monetary policy cannot influence overall employment distribution across industries. a low interest rate would result high price cost inflation, would also weaken profitability manufacture sector. the end result would employment production, addition would face cost high inflation. even employment production manufacture affected, situation norwegian enterprise necessarily negative. some enterprise could forefront technological development increase efficiency pace relatively high rate growth real wage norway. in recent years, also see many enterprise move large portion production abroad, particularly labour-intensive production. norwegian manufacture company could therefore remain profitable even size manufacture sector norwegian economy reduced. however, scale back manufacture also involve risk. it make economy vulnerable. the growth potential economy – basis learning, innovation development – may impair le business sector expose intense foreign competition. over last thirty years, manufacture industry scale back waves. the sharp decline observe year 1977 1984 1987 1992. the decline precede fall profitability industry. it may take time weaken spill output employment, turnaround first occur take place rapidly large scale. primary industries, contrast, scale back gradually. these development take place addition effect associate increase spend petroleum revenues. all all, employment manufacture agriculture may fall 2 - 5 per cent total employment period 2010. employment manufacture may drop towards 10 per cent total. agriculture may employ le 2 per cent total employment. 8 bi review 20/2002 change industry structure, increase number employ service decrease manufacturing, probably reduce role pay increase manufacture benchmark wage determination. among many norway’s trade partners, similar development occurred. however, share employment manufacture agriculture norway already relatively low. pension while high oil price result sizeable revenue surplus current account government budgets, growth mainland output low last three years, 1 ¼ per cent per year. the sluggish growth rate may attribute supply side norwegian economy. extensive labour reform limit supply labour. measure person-hours, employment fall 0.4 per cent annually period. at time, labour shortage persist many sector overt unemployment stable low. the business sector must restructure rapidly real wage increase sharply. many activity long profitable shut down. this could lead high unemployment. however, low employment necessarily reflect unemployment figures. we may instead see flow discourage worker into, example, disability pensions, early retirement scheme different type adjustment packages. the extent scheme use depend financial incentive entitlement thresholds. bi review 20/2002 9 in norway, employment rate among high oecd area. this reflect high labour force participation low unemployment. the picture become mix average work hour take account. the average low norway countries. the sickness absence rate high. part-time employment widespread. the average number person-hours work working-age population relatively low, despite high labour force participation low unemployment. among oecd countries, country low figure norway high unemployment. in norway, average work hour fall 20 per cent last thirty years. this partly explain way work life child care organised, similar trend also see many countries, especially scandinavia. we cannot simply assume people want work more, even increase labour input result high income great prosperity. it natural use increase prosperity leisure. the considerable share part-time employment may reflect choice individual necessarily want change. 10 bi review 20/2002 on hand, increase labour input level sweden, without reduce productivity, future income would increase increase result double petroleum wealth. the structure tax pension system influence choice work leisure. low tax rate employment income could boost labour input. the pension system also significance labour input, influence employers’ labour investment decisions. the expansion labour force come halt. at time, number old-age disability pensioner rise rapidly. twenty year ago, nearly three person labour force every pensioner, whereas 20 years, few two. although life expectancy high, average retirement age norway steadily falling. for men 50, average retirement age fell nearly 67 1970 little 63 end 1990s. for entire labour force, include age groups, average pension age national insurance scheme 58. flexibility work hour retirement age give worker opportunity choose work leisure. this freedom choose benefit itself. however, term - wages, bi review 20/2002 11 work hour pension scheme - reflect value add labour. pension benefit therefore depend long person choose remain employment. many country evaluate country work change pension system cover high portion pension expenditure accumulate capital, i.e. fund system. sweden recently implement pension reform ensure annual pension benefit increase relation number year person worked. at time, increase life expectancy age group reduce annual pension. this motivate person remain employment help ensure system sustainable. due duration transfer pension reserve sweden, replacement former pension system reform one require transitional period several years. in norway, surplus current account government petroleum fund simplify replacement today’s pension system fund pension system. labour important resource. the decline average hour work cannot continue sustainable pension system. the current evaluation public pension system must focus incentive work effect average retirement age. a fund-based system may appropriate approach time make pension save transparent individual. this may provide incentive increase work hours. thank attention. bi review 19/2002 1 urban bäckström: the monetary policy situation sweden open remark mr urban bäckström, governor sverige riksbank, riksdag's finance committee, stockholm, 19 march 2002. * * * first i want express thank opportunity discuss swedish economy monetary policy member finance committee. the riksbank require law present committee write account monetary policy least twice year. the first year’s account hand morning. it contain description riksbank’s view economic development prospect inflation. in open remark i shall summarise report discus consequence riksbank’s executive board draw regard monetary policy. then i look forward discussion member committee shall best answer questions. brighten outlook world economy the discussion previous meet last autumn colour high degree terrorist attack unite state 11 september effects. at time considerable uncertainty extent economic activity, already weak, would affected. there risk attack make household firm even uncertain erode confidence future, negative consequence demand. a inflationary pressure vary state demand resource utilisation, event influence formulation monetary policy many countries, include sweden. six month later, however, see sign imminent improvement activity abroad. the attacks’ impact global economy fortunately limited, though certain sectors, air transport insurance, heavily hit attack repercussions. production last year constrain excessively large stock look though stock adjustment come long way, good sign output. a certain amount optimism begin spread. order book become stable case even improving. then additional impetus come expansionary economic policy many countries. a proper global recovery become increasingly strong does, however, presuppose broad sustain increase demand. an increase production generate solely end stock reduction liable relatively brief. in respect may uncertainty. there still large imbalance american economy stock market value high, historical comparison relation current cyclical phase. opinion differ somewhat imbalance unite states. many observer focus worry structural imbalance u.s. economy. the adjustment problems, undue optimism among household firm late 1990s give rise imbalances, lead recovery sluggish usual. some even consider could drastic correction break global upswing come years. those optimistic point instead u.s. economy’s productivity growth; remain high, le cause concern imbalance high potential growth rate permit high income service debt burden. the riksbank’s current analysis envisage quick correction imbalances. still, grind suppose growth american economy come year high late 1990s. and imbalance adjust quickly, riksbank would, course, take account formation monetary policy. turn europe, see few sign recovery. the prospect germany, large economy euro area, still uncertain. however, look lead indicator show firm become positive. imbalance like unite state accumulate euro area may benefit recovery. moreover, economic policy also markedly expansionary europe, although scope fiscal measure great side atlantic. in addition, upswing likely hold back product labour market rigidities. 2 bi review 19/2002 so all, hard see come economic upswing rapid early recoveries. but world economic picture appreciably bright last autumn outline upturn become increasingly clear. inflation sweden high if picture present inflation report hold good, present cyclical dip swedish economy turn mild thirty years. gdp growth admittedly subdue 2001 figure statistic sweden show negative rates. neither labour market deteriorate much usual. nor serious imbalance arisen. so thus far reason positive economic situation; lead indicator point economic recovery, upturn activity 2002. there is, however, problem inflation time clearly riksbank’s 2 per cent target. to certain extent comparatively high inflation explain various supply shock raise price electricity, meat, fruit vegetables, instance. the background shock include previous winter’s low precipitation hydroelectric power, livestock disease poor harvest due last autumn’s unusually cold weather europe. a i said, shock type raise general price level lead, cases, transitory increase rate inflation. but even one disregard price increases, inflation risen. a discuss number inflation report last year, probably number interact explanations. one resource utilisation swedish economy probably somewhat high envisage earlier. this turn doubt explain wage increases, particularly domestic sectors, high expected. a accompany weak productivity growth, mainly seem cyclical reasons, lead upward pressure prices. a general contraction profit share economy whole presumably help modify price increase recent years. but also leave firm le room “absorb” addition cost weak underlie productivity growth. all naturally raise question potential growth resource utilisation, inflationary pressure, competition various market work economy. resource utilisation high expect ever since inflation expectation close onto target time mid 1990s, important consideration inflation forecast thereby formation monetary policy resource utilisation. this indicator concern relationship actual demand economy capable produce long run without price wage increase accelerating. let point first neither potential growth rate, resource utilisation inflation propensity wide sense something measure directly. for year riksbank draw attention question type, analyse present detail account inflation report. although mainly refer various supply shock explanation inflation’s relatively high rate past year, also draw attention conceivable factor right start. in inflation report last may, example, wrote: the risk inflation connect domestic demand relationship growth inflation sweden somewhat upside foresee march report. the inflation forecast main scenario admittedly revise upwards view unexpectedly high domestic inflation do mainly come year. it conceivable high register inflation partly sign resource utilisation strain assume main scenario. (inflation report 2001:2, pp. 24–25) some upward revision resource utilisation incorporate inflation report riksbank present today. that do partly underlie rate price wage increase move gradually upwards time. this resemble response, though opposite sign, inflation repeatedly turn positive surprise late 1990s. the present adjustment imply le unutilised resource bring production without lead rise rate price wage increases. that turn affect prospect future bi review 19/2002 3 inflation, particularly economic activity, sweden well elsewhere, seem improve overall economic policy expansionary. this analysis ramification labour market. the general weaken demand 2001 show employment. unemployment le stable. both economy whole labour market show sign dichotomy; industrial output employment fallen, accompany increase demand job service sector. at time mainly service wage price risen. thus, light happen price wage past year, riksbank gradually arrive somewhat alter view swedish economy’s inflation propensity. high resource utilisation, together high wage increase weak exchange rate, lead somewhat strong inflationary pressure. this affect forecast present today. meanwhile, are, course, continue work develop analysis interpret new data become available. rise inflation all all, inflation report riksbank note incoming statistic confirm impression activity sweden probably stop falling. the expansionary fiscal policy contribute strong development household disposable income come years, provide basis high private consumption well increase saving. export rise forecast period increase relatively modest account international upswing tentative initially krona expect appreciate. gdp growth judge 1.6 per cent year accelerate 2.5 3 per cent come years, fare judge somewhat swedish economy sustain long run without give rise inflationary tensions. with high resource utilisation, labour cost judge rise somewhat foresee december report. partly reason, domestic inflation forecast period somewhat high foresee earlier. cpi inflation stop 2.2 per cent one year ahead 2.4 per cent two years. the correspond forecast inflation’s underlie rate, und1x, 2.2 per cent one two year ahead. monetary policy focus first place latter rate. in price forecast, supply shock leave mark inflation judge drop twelve-month change figure successively late spring. inflation accordingly expect approach 2 per cent early summer. after that, however, foresee strain resource utilisation connect strong economy activity lead renew increase inflation. the risk spectrum mainly concern domestic inflationary pressure. if resource utilisation strain riksbank assume potential growth overestimated, risk future inflation high main scenario. when risk spectrum take account, underlie inflation, measure und1x, amount 2.3 per cent one two year ahead. monetary policy conclusion i like conclude word monetary policy. in light increasingly clear sign economic recovery resource utilisation somewhat strain expected, riksbank decide raise repo rate 0.25 percentage points, 4.0 per cent. by safeguard price stability, aim create condition stable sustainable development production employment swedish economy. last year’s high inflation assessment solely transitory already leave mark monetary policy. that case least last summer, raise repo rate concern weak exchange rate combine comparatively high resource utilisation might lead high inflation become entrenched. in september we, like central banks, cut interest rate 0.5 percentage points; late autumn, however, cautious low instrumental rate than, example, european central bank. since last may, risk high domestic inflation weight decisions. whereas 4 bi review 19/2002 swedish repo rate begin last year low counterpart euro area unite states, higher. look ahead, usual commit ourselves. what refrain repo rate depend new information become available ass analyse it. what happen last year good illustration appropriateness approach. neither positive negative surprise rule out. we ready cope that. that said, inflation relatively high, even though count become good deal low come six months. resource utilisation probably relatively high, too. the path interest rate depend – long inflation expectation remain place – economic activity develops. if activity continue strengthen expect reason reappraise economy’s inflation propensity, reasonable assume repo rate sweden adjust successively upwards. this come surprise participant financial markets. it natural consequence riksbank earnest task ensure rate price wage increase line inflation target situation economic activity sweden become gradually stronger. here i prompt refer knut wicksell, well-known political economist, point day; matter look “natural” rate interest economy expand without price wage rise quickly. bi review 19/2002 1 the rt hon sir edward george: a broad brush picture uk economy speech the rt hon sir edward george, governor bank england, asian business association dinner, london, 19 march 2002. * * * thank you, mr president, kind introduction. i'm delight here. in fact second time year i've pleasure din representative asian business community uk. just couple month ago, glasgow, i join association business community pay tribute mr yaqub ali remarkable contribution make scottish commercial community life since arrive pakistan 50 year ago. it poignant occasion, come terrorist attack 11th september new york washington still fresh minds. those event sadly sometimes represent - misrepresent - something ethnic religious differences. but, universal condemnation terrorism follow event 11th september showed, nothing ethnic religious differences; reflection fanaticism place civilise society. nevertheless clearly capacity accentuate perceive differences, provoke unwanted tension within international, national local communities. the contrast concern example experience mr ali, celebrate even glasgow, could pronounced. whatever difficulty face - social disadvantage, doubt, too, degree ethnic prejudice uk - mr ali overcome them. from modest beginnings, move build whole series substantial business simply benefit great benefit, term good services, income employment provide community adopt him. but, beyond impressive business achievement, also make great contribution term community service charitable involvement uk relation pakistan. now example contribution ethnic minority business - give proper opportunity encouragement - make economy certainly unique. the bank england's investigation 18 month ago availability finance ethnic minority firm suggest ethnic minority represent 5% uk population, control 7% uk business account around 9% new business start-ups. those national figure relate 1997, little date. but recent figure london chamber's report, publish last december, contribution asian business london's economy, suggest ethnic minority population manage own 20% london's private sector businesses, asian community alone account half - 10% total. these figure make powerful point, underline presence many asian non-asian business professional people evening. they illustrate vividly great benefit accrue society, whole, provide opportunity people uk, whatever background, realise full potential achieve different fields. it underscore importance non-discrimination, whether ethnic religious, sexual social, material well moral progress whole community. it real pleasure you. in letter invitation me, chairman - subhash thakrar - suggest i could talk anything i want evening, provide state economy, provide i tell precisely happen interest rates. let begin try explain bank - mpc - task do, why. the task sound straightforward. it set short-term interest rate consistent aim hit government's symmetrical 2½% inflation target (on precisely define measure retail price inflation - rpix). now reason we've set task - people imagine - either government think consistently low inflation end economic life. it we've learn long experience consistently low inflation necessary 2 bi review 19/2002 (though sufficient) condition sustain growth output economy whole, high level employment, rise live standards, are, course, fundamentally thing seek achieve. carry task straightforward sound simple, direct, link short-term interest rate - instrument - rate inflation. interest rate essentially affect demand side economy. they directly influence supply side, depend upon whole host structural characteristic largely beyond direct reach monetary policy. what manage short-term interest rate keep overall demand grow broadly line underlie - sustainable - supply-side capacity economy whole meet demand. in word try maintain overall, macro-economic, stability much broad sense, medium- longer- term short-term; government's inflation target criterion success, otherwise, achieve broad macro-economic stability measured. our problem know great precision confidence exactly happen supply-side:- know that's say precisely rate growth hope sustain. we know precisely either currently happening, likely happen look forward next couple year so, overall, aggregate, demand. and know precisely full impact change interest rate aggregate demand, long take full impact felt. ours precise science. in fact art science. and, although bring much economic statistical science bear can, know forecasts, indeed policy judgements, subject range error. they can't accurate every last digit. so, can't expect hit inflation target time, consistently aim hope get reasonably close target average time. the uncertainty well illustrate sudden jump rpix inflation rate january 2.6% announce month ago, fall back 2.2% february - publish morning. and, give uncertainties, overall result past decade since recession early 1990's encouraging. whether that's result good luck good judgement i leave others decide - i'm interest outcome. since summer 1992, inflation, target measure average 2.6% - stable time history. and consistently remarkably close target past 5 years. but even good news stable, low, inflation accompany steadily increase overall output employment, progressive fall, recently least, rate unemployment. over period, fourth quarter last year, gdp growth average 3% year - well estimate trend rate 2¼%-2½%. gdp fact grow 38 successive quarter long period sustain quarter-by-quarter growth enjoy since quarterly record begin uk 1955 - though i admit close run thing fourth quarter last year! employment increase steadily low point 25 ½ mn people - take people here, statistic - spring 1993 current level around 28 mn. and rate unemployment fell peak 10½% internationally comparable lf measure around 5% last summer; claimant count measure fell 10% 3%, mean number people claim unemployment benefit, 950,000, low 26 years. now - give what's happen business - probably think i must live different planet. and yes, problem. once look beneath apparently benign surface economy whole, find substantial difference many internationally-exposed sector economy - include particularly many manufacture business - recently really tough time, business largely serve domestic market generally much better. there two main reason pressure affect internationally-exposed sectors: synchronise economic slowdown past year major industrial countries, one bi review 19/2002 3 hand; puzzle persistent weakness euro foreign exchange market sterling even dollar, other. the frustrate thing that, best world, much either bank uk government could do ward pressure uk manufacturing, origin abroad. it's fairly obvious talk global slowdown - negative growth last year ½ % japan slow growth 1¼ % u 1½% eurozone. we go international meet encourage respective authority stimulate economies, nothing directly ourselves. it's perhaps le obvious cannot influence exchange rate. many people think could weaken sterling euro quite simply cut interest rate relative interest rate eurozone. but simple that. the u reduce interest rate far aggressively ecb past year so, dollar actually strong euro begin with; true, less degree, ourselves, uk, sterling also strong euro (though weak dollar) year ago. so nothing much - i say - could do directly affect depress effect come global economy result weakness external demand uk. but able - give inflation marginally target - try compensate external weakness stimulate domestic demand uk. the bank seek cut interest rate buoy consumer spending. and government step spending, certainly helpful recent international environment. although avoid overall slowdown altogether manage keep uk economy whole move forward despite recession internationally-exposed sector manufacturing. in fact overall gdp growth 2001, 2.4%, margin, high among g7 countries, rate uk unemployment currently lowest, comparable basis, g7. and interest rate are, i said, low they've country generation. of course we'd much happy good balance growth. stimulate domestic demand offset external weakness - option available u - much second best option, without risks, good nothing all. that would mean much sharp slowdown, probably recession, economy whole. and, give fact inflationary pressure remain subdued, would mean quite unnecessary loss overall output - income employment. in effect take view unbalance growth good growth. the question now, course, go here. there recently encouraging, still tentative, sign bad global slowdown may behind us, u eurozone economy begin bottom pick up, perhaps around trend, go year. some asian country actively involve ict sector show strong recovery, even japan financial market recently strengthened. a exchange rate, euro, has, i say, puzzlingly weak since soon introduction 3 year ago, still seem likely strengthen eventually. a become clear international environment really improving, external demand really pick up, look forward good balance generally strong growth economy. that due course mean domestic demand growth - consumer demand growth particular - need moderate avoid build inflationary pressure. but let quite clear - that's warning, still le threat. it essentially matter arithmetic! it's quite possible, even quite likely, necessary moderation consumer demand - i emphasise word moderation - come accord, give gradual increase unemployment currently seeing, build household debt. and provide happen abruptly, would best possible outcome. but consumer spend moderate accord, would, context strengthen external demand, clearly need point consider raise interest rate bring moderation about. i suggest time move imminent - obviously depend upon time strength recovery abroad strength domestic demand move forward. 4 bi review 19/2002 and that, subhash, course answer second question - "what precisely happen interest rates?" in case confused, i think i say interest rate rise - unless fall stay same! mr president, doubt past year difficult time world economy make life increasingly difficult internationally-exposed sector economy. we yet altogether wood, increase light trees. i "cautiously optimistic" overseas environment improve move 2002, time next year uk see return somewhat strong good balance growth, unemployment far recent lows, continue low inflation. if indeed thing turn out, weather international storm well anyone could reasonably expected. bi review 18/2002 1 lars nyberg: financial disturbance real economy speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, danske securities, stockholm, 11 march 2002. * * * i would like begin thank invitation come danske security speak you, real heart financial sector, also heavily dependent occurrence real economy. in speech today i intend concentrate mainly relationship development real economy financial developments, look past may look future. the riksbank's two objectives, maintain price stability promote efficiency stability payment system broad context, real economy financial aspects. the objective closely link might think initially. turbulence financial market repercussion economic activity development real economy thus great significance shape monetary policy. it difficult, impossible, pursue effective monetary policy financial market function inefficiently. at time, price stability stable, low inflation expectation help create security stability financial markets. this far quite simple. it rather difficult make in-depth survey understand relationship financial real economies. moreover, development financial market rapid every reason believe relationship change time. if one look back global development past year, financial market appear cop great shock many would think possible. the it telecom bubble burst, simultaneous international slowdown economic activity began, turkey experience financial crisis, usa suffer terrorist attack 11 september begin war afghanistan american energy company, enron, collapsed. finally, argentina suffer severe crisis. the private market operator save measure imf, many expected. however, even event together appear serious long-term effect global financial markets. in addition, seem though

complete adaptation made. increase experience act deregulate environment reduce risk financial crises. the banks, particularly important role play payment system, good capitalise decade ago. credit

market thus (hopefully, i perhaps add) become robust, use grown. household company become operator financial markets, mainly offer good cheap service traditionally offer via banks. an increase percentage investment make finance market share bond country usa. this become possible households' save increase degree channel share mutual funds. we use financial market much ten year ago. this mean good reason concern functioning. it also mean question regard financial stability acquire great importance international political agenda. at time use market grown, new instrument trade increasingly complicate structure risk content become difficult assess. various form derivative developed, instance, spread risk efficiently. this create condition reduce vulnerability bank well finance cost investments. essentially, development benefit long-term growth. in recent years, use credit risk derivative securitisation increased, instance. however, risk complexity instrument increase difficulty see credit risk company bank actually exposed. bi review 18/2002 3 the complexity financial instrument fact often found, various forms, asset side liability side companies' balance sheet well "off balance sheet", make difficult detect financial risk within bank companies. this particularly serious increase number household save companies' shares, easy professional analyst portfolio manager see. the collapse american company enron serve example problem connect development complicate financial instruments. a lack understand instrument use lack transparency company's account mean directly collapse considerable concern possible contagion effects. here i mean evident breach regulation force, auditor burn document senior manager sell share company prior publish negative information. enron raise number other, long term fundamental, issues. today, i shall limit discuss three these. firstly, enron basically energy company, time come pursue financial operation large scale, without come supervision financial company normally subjected. the lack supervision also apply long term capital management, ltcm, year earlier. one might wonder whether function rather company type might good base supervision. there otherwise risk function essential society thus need protection transfer company subject supervision. at time, public sector practice force intervene failure comprise threat system, regardless whether able exercise supervision. to extent enron involve function assess worth protect question discussion, important question principle. we cannot regulate company involve financial operations, e.g. manage funds. secondly, appear obvious account regulations, least us, develop rate instrument form capital acquisition financial markets. be really reasonable long term increase number companies' risk report balance sheets? in case enron, also appear risk need report all, accord regulation force, liquidity risk trigger down-rating. thirdly, educational (and frightening) see exactly shortage liquidity bring enron's downfall question raise regard quality balance sheet market lose confidence company. enron's balance sheet similarity bank, liability side consist borrow prove rather short term, asset side difficult value much poor liquidity. a bank find equivalent situation could face run, customer withdraw deposits, really happen enron. this make form liquidation necessary, even late prove value leave balance sheet. the experience enron case lead investor temporarily flee company complicate construction ownership company suspect rather creative accounting. however, seem temporary phenomenon. companies' credit spread affect much fear stock market shake little, begin recover again. the effect appear rather account method procedure voluntarily revised, development welcome market operator authority alike. perhaps enron case become indication market actually become robust. however, enron collapse also illustrate clearly risk might arise market grow significance complexity. these risk effect real economy underestimated. the markets' increase dependence one another within country could lead considerable contagion effect disturbance one part system. to summarise; risk large financial imbalance build economy probably decline past decade result predictable economic policy. regulation risk management system also improved. at time, complexity financial instrument opportunity extensive position balance sheet increase difficulty assess future profit risk companies. meanwhile, increase save finance market-listed instrument make household company dependent safe efficient function financial markets. this could mean effect disturbance 4 bi review 18/2002 financial system real economy could increase long term regulatory framework supervision adapt sufficiently rapidly. can live large imbalances? when share price plummet almost two year ago uncertainty increase follow terrorist attack september last year, fear expectation future would revise strongly households' willingness consume company willingness invest would decline drastically. the fear concern u economy particular, uncertainty also expect affect rest world. the high level indebtedness build economic upturn many country significantly increase risk. positive expectation future increase companies' finance need investment. at time, bright picture paint future increase wealth stimulate households' consumption increase investment housing. it easy imagine risk scenario household sector demand decline rapidly heavily indebted company go bankrupt, unemployment rise drastically bank lender suffer extensive loan losses. this negative spiral could continue fall share price household wealth rise credit risk premium would make lend expensive. if negative sequence event broken, high loan loss could eventually lead bank crisis credit crunches, would contribute downward spiral. a credit boom, large increase asset price high rate growth investment, often concentrate particular sector, factor precede serious financial crisis around world. however, important remember neither credit boom large deficit current account need interpret accumulation financial imbalances. if save investment decision base realistic expectation future growth bank financial investor able make realistic assessment credit risk connect investment project consumption loans, development sign international capital market function efficiently. the task capital market channel capital investment project high return. if financial investor ass return investment particular country high countries, reason exchange rate strengthen. one cannot rule possibility exactly happen usa. whether level indebtedness, deficit current account strong usd exchange rate comprise significant risk large fluctuation growth threat global financial stability near future depend great extent whether long-term growth u economy develop much weakly expect decision loan investment made. and, i mention earlier, shape economic policy improvement regulatory framework risk management system reduce uncertainty investment save decision thereby also risk build-up large financial imbalances. however, remain see whether globalisation, it telecommunication technology perhaps also efficient financial market really create potential high growth lay behind expectation push economic activity. so far, economy react fairly moderately shock face past year. the risk financial imbalance build result over-optimism still remains, assess comprise le threat recovery economy previously thought. monetary policy consideration development past month also indicate risk profound prolong international economic slowdown decline considerably. there number sign low point reached. one condition upturn international economic activity growth u economy pick up. productivity continue develop positively relative economic situation, good sign. the fact american households' demand consumption improve since autumn also indicate low point reach turnaround way. the unease existed, accentuate terrorist attack 11 september, possibility rapid perhaps exaggerate adjustment financial imbalance american households' companies' balance sheet might cause deep decline appears, least bi review 18/2002 5 far, quite unfounded. good function financial market result change economic policy improvement regulatory framework supervision i mention early may contribute this. if so, level indebtedness corporate household sector comprise great threat economic activity come year many feared, include riksbank number inflation reports. in sweden, decline economic activity affect capacity utilisation unemployment extent previous case economy. this mean upward turn relatively high level resource utilisation economy. low interest rates, weak krona expansive fiscal policy contribute factor here. one consequence high level resource utilisation could unexpectedly high inflation rate register recently. early price increase certain product group assume temporary, would mean inflation fall year. however, price rise service sector, instance, probably reflect high labour costs. a number colleague express concern future inflation i must say i share concern. the fact international upturn economic activity take place brief moderate decline mean economic upturn expect strong early upturns. for sweden, mean export increasing, growth primarily expect come domestic demand, particular service sector. in opinion, increase risk domestically-oriented company pressurise profit margin continue compensate cost increase raise prices. this roughly picture look executive board riksbank gather monday 18 march discus economic situation monetary policy. we also basis decision completely

cannot offset low interest rate high public spend tax cuts, require change function labour market. the plan use petroleum revenue imply shelter sector lay claim large share labour force. this probably

* introduction when thing go well, natural look scapegoats. in case hong kong economy, peg exchange rate certainly get fair share treatment. what basis complaint peg, far justified? before examine complaints, however, let u review monetary policy background. monetary policy it widely accept duty monetary policy - embrace exchange rate policy - provide monetary environment conducive long-term growth prosperity economy. this see imply desire stable monetary conditions, scope judgement stability defined. the majority regime focus internal purchase power thus aim low stable domestic inflation. thus, practice inflation target become quite widespread well understood. this require active monetary policy, necessarily impact domestic interest rate money market liquidity; and, least strict form targeting, inevitably involve exchange rate flexibility, even entirely free float. a minority regimes, hong kong one, focus stable external value currency - hong kong's case particular mechanism discipline currency board. the externally orient economy is, great weight may need attach exchange rate stability within overall concept monetary stability. there various pro con approach. inflation target le precise, necessarily base forward projections, verifiable indicator success available timelag. it also require reasonably accurate forecast process, may simple realise relatively close highly open economy. nevertheless, experience several country show inflation target capable deliver good results. an obvious advantage fixed-rate regime compliance monitor directly unambiguously real time; and, currency board version, regime operate automatic mechanism rather discretion central bank. it may, however, result le stable inflation rate, although, assume monetary policy country anchor currency conduct responsibly, extreme hyper-inflation deflation avoided. both regime may prone fluctuation interest rate response shocks, inflation targeting, require flexible exchange rate even manage degree, central bank measure discretion magnitude time response, whereas, fix rate, defensive reaction must immediate may hence potentially sharper. hong kong context recent criticism hong kong's currency board focus mainly two aspect - implication competitiveness hong kong vis-a-vis economy problem live fall price levels. the remainder paper direct mostly issues. competitiveness change competitiveness typically measure compare movement appropriate measure cost price home abroad, adjust shift exchange rates. the 2 bi review 17/2002 measure competitiveness thus produce commonly refer real exchange rate.1 a strong real rate mean high relative price therefore imply weak competitiveness.2 i detect two common misconception real exchange rate. influence real rate the first belief real rate amenable control central bank government choose regime nominal exchange rate therefore important determinant real rate. let explain i believe flaw view. even central bank could, intervention foreign exchange market action influence domestic interest rates, fix nominal exchange rate particular level, even succeed fix simply bilateral rate trade-weighted rate, would determine real rate short term. this monetary policy actions, exchange market intervention change interest rates, due course feedback effect domestic inflation. more specifically example, depreciation tend raise prices. in market-based economy central bank, already us monetary policy set nominal exchange rate, cannot separately control inflation. eventually initial gain competitiveness depreciation offset inflationary feedback, obviously highly import-dependent economy hong kong. empirical study reject hypothesis feedback eventually 100%, although full offset may occur considerable lapse time. meanwhile real rate also affect movement price level economies, lie beyond home central bank's influence. in sum, central bank cannot, except perhaps short term, dictate real exchange rate. equilibrium real rate the second misconception real exchange rate weak rate (if could somehow arranged) would necessarily good thing, benefit improvement competitiveness, thus measured, would bring economy. history tell rather different story. successful economy typically experience appreciate exchange rate period rapid development; wealthy economy tend appear expensive term overall price comparisons. it much real exchange rate determine prosperity, fundamental characteristic economy, underlie productivity, determine real exchange rate. an economy successfully sell high value-added good service world market result enjoy time relatively cheap import good one balance account sell high quantity cheap output buy low quantity dear imports. there remain question whether might nevertheless advantage short burst competitive advantage - might deliver engineer depreciation inflationary feedback negate competitive gain - mean boost economy short term also hopefully mean build good foundation longer-term growth. experience suggests, however, sort procedure bite like drug patient readily become addicted. if people come expect continue do devaluation, inflation inflationary expectation may harden and, perhaps significantly, business spar discipline search great efficiency incentive move up-market. the dosage drug may increase dependency rises, eventually fairly severe anti-dote austerity may need administer break grow addiction. it may reasonably argued, however, that, even underlie path real exchange rate determine essentially structural force within economy, monetary policy utilise 1 in fact necessary take account one's trade partner thus arrive real trade-weighted "effective" exchange rate - reer. for ease exposition, however, term "real exchange rate" use paper. 2 the precise interpretation depend crucially set price cost use calculation, aspect address here. bi review 17/2002 3 far possible prevent excessive divergence trend may prove damage economy. for example, currency artificially strong prolong period, particular sector economy may become damage incapable recover exchange rate eventually return equilibrium. in practice, however, extremely difficult determine, time, whether particular movement real rate represent divergence equilibrium path fundamental shift path itself. at various moment past 20-30 year may call weak hk dollar order preserve local manufacture sector. but would doubt retrospect shift away manufacture high value-added service-based economy beneficial would anyway inevitable eventually. there would little advantage try slow process action monetary exchange rate policy. in words, long-term equilibrium path real rate necessarily flat. the trend path may, particular moment, up, flat, actual rate constantly diverge equilibrium path random event unforeseen movement nominal exchange rate cost price level home abroad, failure market adjustment process work quickly enough. all quite aptly illustrate look path hong kong dollar's real rate since first pegged. the natural trend appear upward, though smoothly so, middle period ten years, nothing tell u will, should, path hereon. against background, monetary policy may expect achieve much competitiveness. but policy maker nevertheless choose. should fix float rate preferred? fix float? in theory, advantage float may allow nominal exchange rate adjust continuously precisely keep real rate equilibrium - ideal situation achievable. however, historical experience, even world's major currency - u dollar, japanese yen currency merge euro, example - float regime provide assurance stable real rate. in practice, market steer rate continuously rational manner. there also tendency, even authority prepare conduct intervention, float rate overshoot occasionally, especially mercy potentially massive international capital flow herd behaviour financial markets. indeed, certain circumstance float may magnify rather reduce short-run volatility competitiveness, thereby unsettle environment make judgement cost prices, hence business planning. 4 bi review 17/2002 the advantage fix rate that, credible (and i take hong kong's 18-year track record lead example that), provide unambiguous highly transparent real-time indicator whether monetary policy track not, well solid anchor plan purposes. but, floating, provide assurance stable real rate. and disadvantage entire burden relative cost-price adjustment fall domestic cost prices. inflation likely volatile under, say, inflation target accompany floating. moreover, notably, fix regime may require downward flexibility cost price nominal exchange rate become strong whatever reason. it aspect become focal point recent attention hong kong. hong kong's flexibility in fact, hong kong exhibit considerable flexibility sort required. this characteristic share degree many economies. comparison often draw argentina of, recently, currency peg. the chart compare various indicator hong kong argentina. the timescales set align sudden loss competitiveness hong kong late 1997 asian crisis, sudden loss competitiveness argentina early 1999 result brazilian crisis devaluation real. attention draw particular comparison development subsequent month (to right vertical divide). the first chart show level consumer prices. hong kong experience much significant price deflation, absolute price level fall almost 10% peak first two year shock, argentina price fell 3-4%, even look somewhat long period. a appropriate measure internal cost price gdp deflator. this fell 10% hong kong roughly static argentina. bi review 17/2002 5 largely result difference response internal costs, hong kong manage recoup lose competitiveness (as measure real exchange rate), amount 15%, argentina fail achieve last recovery; indeed, loss competitiveness resumed, long lose grind recovered. in view evident flexibility hong kong, extent therefore correct talk peg impose sort rigidity economy? in strict sense word, course rigidity, because, even speedy flexible adjustment domestic costs, correction may need offset shock nominal exchange rate cannot instantaneous. but rigidity judge economy might fare fix rates, hong kong emerge rather favourably. and, compare alternative floating, mean 6 bi review 17/2002 obvious peg deliver inferior result hong kong, give possibility volatility over-shooting floating, especially small highly expose economy. indeed, although always difficult predict event hypothetical circumstances, concern flexible regime would, rather liberate monetary policy, actually pose problem - especially short term confidence would re-established might remain brittle. this might involve high rather low interest rate risk premium, plus great uncertainty. before move subject competitiveness, let leave couple thoughts. if hong kong has, underlie sense, suffer severe uncompetitiveness, one explain continue strength trade current account performance... … fact pace recession hong kong last two year significantly different number economy region? bi review 17/2002 7 i draw conclude criticism peg competitiveness grind stand well scrutiny. even forego analysis discussion prove unequivocally fix superior floating, challenge contention perceive problem competitiveness would dissipate float exchange rate. live deflation let turn focus criticism monetary regime i mention earlier, namely deflation. there four main factor contribute fall price hong kong. first, state global economy. a combination recession remarkable success tame inflation recent year leave policy maker several country face unusual situation deflation. hong kong alone, although process perhaps prolong many places. the second factor process integration economy hong kong southern china. this something generally welcome broad context, may put downward pressure hong kong price certain sectors. the third peg which, global background mention above, force downward adjustment cost prices. the fourth factor peculiar property market, namely excess property market cycle drive price peak five year ago, almost inevitable would correction. attitude fall price are, understandably, ambivalent. other thing equal, consumers, especially fix incomes, generally prefer fall rise prices. even people suffer small cut pay may still good previously; all, price face, measure hong kong's consumer price index, currently 14% peak. meanwhile, involve market hong kong business location eager publicise low costs. and prospective first-time entrant property market happy. but producer see continue decline likely price sell output, wholesaler retailer whose margin squeezed, home-owners sit negative equity, financial institution worry solvency customer result developments, process deflation particularly welcome. from monetary policy perspective, prospect persistent deflation present possible concern that, even near-zero interest rates, people may prefer sit money balance rather spend, may hind recovery real activity. to certain extent problem may illusory. behaviour different interest rate zero inflation (or, strictly speaking, project inflation) minus 2%, interest rate 5% inflation plus 3%; real rate case. but deflation prevent real interest rate go negative. it matter debate much impediment recovery limitation could be. possibly would become significant expect pace deflation rather sharp been. in assess cause impact deflation, possible remedies, appropriate distinguish price level good service one hand, asset - whether financial real estate - other. for good services, consensus view probably low, stable positive rate inflation preferable negative one. nevertheless, economy society may able cope certain period modest deflation - range of, say, 0-2% pa - without much difficulty. asset prices, hand, display much great volatility, collapse property price create problem homeowner financial institutions, despite present opportunity others. plainly, stability preferable volatility. but plunge price much early exuberance, plus structural influences, grow cross-border integration, exchange rate. although current deflation may undoubtedly painful some, rush argue deflation could avoid float exchange rate, let's pause reflect japanese experience. at times, japan experience deflation accompany upward pressure yen, serve exacerbate deflation. it may appropriate draw close 8 bi review 17/2002 analogy, give contrast economic circumstance two economies, worth note that, fix exchange rate, deflation, continues, eventually restore lose competitiveness bottom (assuming significant continue deflation overseas). in words, hong kong context peg effect set upper low bind inflation rate relative rate unite states. in sum, peg certainly contributor deflation, contribution made, probably severe. the presence deflation make compel case alter exchange rate regime. sum back 1983 peg installed, i recall ask whether government's intention arrangement permanent, circumstance change would contemplated. i say simply peg time appropriate monetary anchor hong kong. i would give much answer today. our peg fix rate support dependent discretionary intervention. it rule-based currency board system impose particular discipline adjustment interest rate channel domestic prices. it enjoy widespread support international observer official circle widely. this people nice u choose say anything might rock boat, although may one two them. rather reflect appreciation unique feature currency board structure benefit bring 18 years, well appreciation distinctive characteristic hong kong economy. the main distinctive characteristic i allude following: flexibility cost prices, discuss earlier; extreme openness economy term trade capital flows; constitutional commitment, basic law, support free movement capital operate exchange controls; soundness bank sector. take together, factor help explain peg may feasible sensible hong kong might others. this mean hong kong would incapable operate continue prosper alternative regime. indeed, posse necessary infrastructure conduct discretionary monetary policy (although case back 1983), i confident colleague would quite capable meet challenge new, activist regime. however, although may moment one think "if float rate, thing bad right now", one cannot chop change regime suit short-term expedience. we acknowledge system perfect, i suggest much criticism peg may exaggerated, even unfounded. we would need well satisfy alternative would unequivocally superior, ditch something cornerstone internal financial stability external confidence 18 years. bi review 17/2002 1 alan greenspan: the u economy remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u

power u.s. economy recent past encouraging. one important ingredient resilience performance productivity. even discount somewhat phenomenal strength growth output per hour late, one cannot help impress well productivity hold face abrupt slow economy late 2000 2001. that performance encourage nation’s fortunes, great degree, depend evolution growth productivity. in particular, productivity play central role determine nature economy’s response age population soon upon us. most economic forecast subject significant uncertainty. at least comparison, one judgment look reasonably sure proposition: the ratio retiree still work rise precipitously start end decade continue climb first third century remain high thereafter. in part, project development owe retirement baby boomers. but phenomenon broad reflect age society. importantly, accord social security trustees, demographic challenge go away pass baby-boom generation. this ever-larger retire population fed, clothed, housed, service workforce grow far le rapidly. the retiree may accumulate large stock retirement savings, good service need redeem save must produce active workforce assist stock plant equipment sufficiently productive meet need retiree workforce expect ever-increasing standard living. though individual household’s point view, save reflect financial claim adequate meet future needs, focus economy whole, necessity, must produce real resource need redeem financial assets. the role finance channel save investment physical capital asset assist production gross domestic product, which, turn, serf retiree active workers. clearly, efficient system finance effectively deploy give stock capital thus maximize contribution support population. any analysis amount type save require finance bulge retirement horizon clearly need project (1) number retirees, (2) size workforce, (3) productivity workforce. of three, productivity directly affect level investment, which, course, finance saving. the size future workforce, exclude immigrants, size future retire population relatively simple project today's age distribution. the level immigration, legal illegal, dominate public policy decision economic forces, unite state country immigrant drawn. this forecast problematic, level matters: over past decade, example, immigration account approximately one-third increase workforce. the large workforce 2010 beyond, easy produce good service retiree active worker be. immigration policy will, therefore, key component baby-boom retirement policy. the rate saving--for retirement purposes--may directly affect either number retiree size workforce. but surely affect capital investment, finances, productivity engenders. besides total amount save investment, change allocation fund among different type capital also appear influence growth labor productivity. a dollar new save flow financial market firm allocate among different type capital investment. clearly, firms' choice type investment make matter crucially much labor productivity ultimately boosted. in late 1990s, example, business allocate much investment dollar toward high-tech, higher-return capital early years. business make shift continue move direction response extremely rapid decline price high-tech asset new opportunity asset afforded. accord one set calculations, roughly 2-1/2 percent annual rate increase output per hour,

managerial organization, and, i note testimony last week, great flexibility resilience economy stem deregulation, primarily finance. notwithstanding more-intangible contributions, level save remain key ingredient economic growth. but need also know whether source save sustainable and, beyond that, whether type financial asset save overall accumulate affect productivity. during past six years, 40

reduction domestic investment. a contentious issue whether mix domestic private government save affect rate productivity growth. another whether form private saving--for example stock debt instrument include bank deposits--affects productivity growth. ultimately, composition real investment economy reflect, among influences, attitude toward risk financial claim capital stock. the nation’s savers, daily marketplace, exhibit obvious sensitivity association expect return risk. few, any, individual would will accept great risk without potential great reward. similarly, nation whole would will invest risky asset without commensurately great overall economic growth potential. that tradeoff reflect willingness many investor forgo high rate return equity great tranquility less stress risk associate debt instruments. reflect differential risk, return common stock roll twenty-year period almost always outpace return less-risky securities. should relative preference saver aggregate shift toward debt instrument away equity, interest rate drive low equity-price ratio higher. these shift asset valuation induce business enterprise alter choice capital projects. specifically, firm find project low average rate return meet requirement provide certain, stable income stream desire savers. the physical counterpart choice business project low expect financial return slow growth productivity, average, across economy. conversely, saver become risk-tolerant, financial risk premium decline. in response reduce penalty risk, firm induce adjust mix endeavor toward more-speculative projects--but, importantly, presumably one also offer high prospective rate return average, often not, translate high long-term average economic growth. thus, answer whether government private save foster productivity growth arguably come propensity u.s. saver take risks. government save reflect largely retirement debt. have choose hold least portion save riskless securities, holder government debt confront debt retirement presumably would choose less-risky private debt security common stock rebalance portfolios. thus increase share save government markedly conservative financial strategy

bank thailand, foreign bank association, bangkok, 6 march 2002. * * * mr weerasinghe, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, let begin thank foreign bank association host enjoyable event invite speak. i honor would like extend congratulation mr. weerasinghe presidency fba. the formal meet late january offer opportunity exchange many useful view idea you. i consider fruitful i also appreciate opportunity give evening. i hope talk tonight enhance communication mutual understand even further. i wish use time tonight share view current state thai economy well see outlook 2002. it intention discus assessment nature incipient recovery process take place, identify risk challenge may face near future. lady gentlemen, permit go straight crux matter. we enter year 2002 confidence. the thai economy assuredly bottom last year. the late release january economic figure point strength fourth quarter 2001 anticipated, give event september 11. and, current supportive fiscal monetary policy stance well expectation rebound us, overall environment year conducive growth last year. from vantage point, view economy could grow 2-3 per cent year inflationary pressure would virtually absent. a continue expansion domestic demand rebound export latter half year would key driver year’s growth. the outlook inflation remain tame, core inflation expect hover around 1-1.5 per cent, well within target corridor 0-3.5 per cent. last year, notwithstanding slowdown global markets, thai economy exhibit note degree resiliency. while world economy slump, thailand’s export fall extent observe many country region. and, even export fell 7 per cent, output growth remain positive every quarter. in term macroeconomic stability, saw improvement domestic external fronts. in fact, thailand external position strengthen significantly 2001. the current account register large surplus external debt continue fall sharply 2001. our reserve position remain strong. i convince flexible mix monetary fiscal policies, plus diversify structure production exports, allow economy avoid contraction build great external stability. with improve environment growth i noted, i comfortable today last year talk economic recovery. my optimism, however, remain guarded. because road recovery, still many risks. such risks, manage well, could undermine sustainability recovery process. let first talk macroeconomy view 2002. then i describe challenge ahead well think manage them. first, economic recovery. what recent economic number tell us? in january, economy show sign continue expansion despite sluggish global conditions, thank largely momentum domestic demand. a number indicator suggest economic condition improve somewhat recent months. for instance, – consumption investment continue improve january. in particular, private investment index (pii) continue increase. a significant expansion see construction, follow spur house demand construction activities. 2 bi review 16/2002 – it look like good news domestic demand front warrant significant increase january business sentiment index (bsi) index look 3 month ahead. – export quantity continue improve year-on-year growth rate high positive. this represent pick-up trade partners' purchase power stay ability compete. another factor continue firm recovery process come fiscal front. – during first four month fiscal year 2002, budget disbursement rate accelerate compare period last year. this front-loaded fiscal stance surely contribute sooner recovery. i must note here, however, jury still early sign may portend. i believe impassioned judgment speed recovery must await data. lady gentlemen, it rather unfortunate economist busy debate whether early sign point tangible recovery, recent strong boom stock market seem overwhelm debate. on point, let say need distinguish recent asset price performance economic fundamentals. it true performance list set firm improved. the improvement lead part better-than-expected profitability list companies. corporate profit general also rise 2001, compare 2000. with improvement, able segregate winner - is, strong performer -- lag behind. this present stark contrast previous picture almost sector judge perform poorly. another factor contribute strong performance stock market thai market relatively low p/e ratio compare markets, regional extra-regional, positive price correction might large. but, whether inflow drive market stay long depend underlie fundamentals.this say order attract long-term investor need, thai company must persevere business restructure continue reform operations. but importantly macro level, economic recovery process must continue firmly, support right policy mix progress unfinished reforms. i would like turn attention see risk process recovery. the speed robustness recovery depend large part turnaround global economy. on front, bank thailand remain cautious optimism. our guard optimism base two reasons. first, u economy, absorb roughly 20 per cent exports, likely rebound late year japan, 15 per cent export go, seem likely remain mire rest year. therefore, global economy whole may expand much. second, u recovery, particularly lead electronics, may benefit thailand much benefit regional economies. this owe diversify nature thailand's exports. for example, electronics count 26 per cent total export count 36 60 per cent taiwan's singapore's exports, respectively. furthermore, u take 40 per cent taiwan's electronics exports. so, u rebound would likely benefit us. therefore, hopeful u economic trend upbeat, harbor healthy dose reservation insofar immediate gain bring u recovery concerned. another risk growth effectiveness policy stimulus meet growth challenge. in past years, various fiscal stimulus package principal motor drive economy. late year, however, necessary consolidation take place ensure fiscal sustainability, sound economic management demand right mix policies. have achieve external stability price stability, room monetary policy accommodative growth. on point, i wish emphasize even though focus today economic recovery, bank thailand's monetary policy objective remain maintain price stability. bi review 16/2002 3 it belief important pre-condition growth sustain basis stable macroeconomic environment. however, i doubt macroeconomic policy alone sufficient long-term economic growth. we, therefore, need look beyond macroeconomic policy. to meet growth challenge, thailand need steady sincere effort micro-level put economy back robust growth path. the reform must aim good corporate governance, fast debt restructuring, efficient effective bank sector. without actions, potency fiscal monetary policy limited, whatever gain output make ephemeral. the bottom line, lady gentlemen, thailand stand ready reap full advantage upcoming global recovery real sector become competitive financial sector function smoothly. the bank thailand contribute growth process conduct responsible monetary policy ensure price stability, prod economy along path institutional reform initiated. with sound policy framework institutional reform place, efficient economic structure build entrepreneurial energy private sector unleash ensure great economic well being. this bring last point i wish make tonight, need speed structural reforms. i convince necessary transition toward robust durable growth lie break current constraint impose economy post-1997, press debt-overhang problem. to go forward first need unshackle ourselves. the crawl pace debt resolution tie economy. if could resolve debt problem timely manner adopt new work practices, next impossible compete successfully world market. the bank thailand government alert challenge. and government already initiate process overhaul. one notable attempt debt restructure establishment thai asset management corporation (tamc). the entity set reduce distress asset bank system centralization npls' management. this allow bank resume normal function new lending. new lend need provide work capital support corporate restructure well business expansion. this way, energy channel toward productive enterprises. and, authority liquidate rehabilitate business swift legal procedures, tamc unique unprecedented power. next, give substantial share distress asset remain outside purview tamc, i see need expedite process corporate debt restructure require speedy passage reform bankruptcy law. this action testimony sincere effort authority make benefit future generations. insofar bank sector concerned, bank thailand regard good enforcement bank financial institution regulation priority. this area bank thailand take leadership role strengthen soundness efficiency financial institutions. our leadership must lead outcome make practical sense, measure international best practices, must market-oriented. on front, actively involve consultation process new basel capital accord, provide comprehensive sensitive approach address risk use minimum capital requirements, supervisory review market discipline. the second agenda bank sector reform enhance risk management capacity. toward end, supervision group move regulation transaction-testing toward risk-based supervision. we realize good rule alone automatically translate honorable practices. therefore, consider upright supervisory role sine qua non ensure honest bank practices. the new supervisory practice consider milestone area. our aim nudge thai bank change business practices. currently, work hard ever satisfy new rules, notably link risk-based classification debt provision loan losses. 4 bi review 16/2002 we effect encourage bank eschew old norm collateral lend adopt new practice examine cash-flow projection indicators. this reform implement hand hand corporate sector reform purview sec. this practice lead efficient allocation financial resources. under new rule strict supervisory practices, optimistic bank system play meaningful role economy near future. lady gentlemen, much transpire since 1997. our economy intense pressure perform, i confident enough say good position today manage future challenges. although, outlook 2002 bright last year, remain somewhat cautious. the reform process must continue global pick-up pas u economy secure potential gain imbed talented entrepreneur workforce. it honor thank attention tonight. bi review 15/2002 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, press conference, hold frankfurt, 7 march 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. first all, please see euro cash changeover go smoothly – smoothly fact could hoped. the european public quickly become familiar new banknote coins, show fact national banknote largely withdraw well final deadline cease legal tender. the govern council wish express gratitude help make euro cash changeover success. a usual, today's meet examine recent monetary, financial economic developments. the govern council conclude information become available recent week confirm current level key ecb interest rate remain appropriate maintenance price stability medium term. against background, govern council decide leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. start analysis first pillar monetary policy strategy, three-month average annual growth rate m3 stand 8.0% period november 2001 january 2002, compare 7.8% period october december 2001. the high level annual growth rate m3 much relate portfolio shift liquid positions, occur autumn 2001 economic financial environment characterise high uncertainty. while many investor still seem "parking" asset m3 early 2002, moderation short-term dynamic m3 could observe around turn year. the govern council continue hold view information first pillar thus far indicate risk price stability, portfolio reallocation drive m3 growth 2001 remain temporary. in addition, slowdown rate growth loan private sector continue past months. however, need analyse monetary development closely come months. a regard second pillar, sign trough economic activity may reach end last year. coincident forward-looking indicator increasingly point improvement economic conditions. a similar picture reflect financial market expectations, especially embed bond yields. the economic fundamental euro area sound major imbalance would require lengthy process adjustment. the expectation recovery euro area 2002 furthermore support favourable finance condition real disposable income benefit past expect future decline inflation. there also increase confirmation economic activity outside euro area pick up, lead gradual strengthen external demand euro area product services. while strength recovery remain uncertain, good reason expect return economic growth level line potential towards end year. turn

fall 2%. the recent behaviour producer price also point direction. beyond horizon, expect little upward pressure price aggregate demand and, bar unforeseen developments, inflation rate line price stability. however, current favourable outlook inflation fundamentally rest assumption continuation wage moderation. a i already note last month, cause concern regard ongoing wage negotiations. a continuation wage moderation euro area crucial foster employment growth also support monetary policy task maintain price stability. with regard fiscal policy euro area, govern council welcome reaffirm commitment government euro area country fiscal imbalance adhere objective achieve balance budget 2003-2004. the confirmation political continue along path fiscal consolidation appropriate. the govern

recession - time speech mr edward m gramlich, member board governor u federal reserve system, conference combat recessions, ford school public policy, university michigan, ann arbor, michigan, 7 march 2002. * * * accord national bureau economic research, u.s. economy enter tenth postwar recession early year. at point, accord blue chip forecasters, recession seem much mild most, unemployment rate unlikely go much 6 percent. but early fall moment risk serious downturn much greater, even relatively flat 2001 recession prompt renew policy discussion deal recessions. today, i offer view subject. for obvious reasons, i avoid evaluation specific action piece legislation discus general strategy. my central point put place sensible long-term macroeconomic policy strategy, cover fiscal monetary policy, extremely important. the main importance strategy involve effect policy position trend economic growth, recession expansions. business-cycle movement obviously deal with, part address exist system fiscal monetary shock absorbers. at times, shock absorber may augment discretionary antirecessionary fiscal actions, time relatively rare. and discretionary antirecessionary fiscal action meet stringent criterion make sure good harm. sound long-run policy the fundamental reason establish sound long-run macroeconomic policy strategy path trend productivity growth nation's crucial economic variable. it determine long-run growth live standard main determinant affordability entitlement spend programs, level household wealth, value currency, economic magnitudes. whatever policy response short-term needs, policy formulate context sound overall long-run strategy. the path trend productivity growth many underlie determinants--the vibrancy technology, strength entrepreneurial motives, flexibility labor capital markets, effectiveness regulatory policies, name few. but also two vital macroeconomic policy determinants. one, involve monetary policy, credible commitment stable price long run. the second, involve fiscal policy, concern share total output devote national saving. output devote save consumed, that's that. output saved, reserve consumption, devote capital investment, equip worker new capital, enhance productivity, raise live standards. in recent years, unite state fortunate beneficiary productivity growth spurt. both monetary fiscal policy play important role. the commitment realization stable price surely critical background forces, facilitate long-term plan efficient allocation resources. on fiscal side, role save investment important well. production-function decomposition growth spurt suggest good 30 40 percent due so-called capital-deepening productivity change, reflect increase economy's capital-labor ratio. fiscal policy relevant help determine national save finance capital investment. national save generate privately, household business, government. effort promote private save certainly merit theory, bald empirical fact unite state government introduce number tax provision increase private save past twenty years, almost correlate reduction overall rate private saving. these measure could effective margin, large enough effect counter general downward trend private saving. a add caution, standpoint national saving, make sense introduce costly private save incentive reduce government save raise private saving. 2 bi review 15/2002 what seem raise national save government fiscal policy, budget surpluses. government saving, surplus, lead reduction outstanding government debt wealth-holders, part, seem respond devote fund private credit markets. this response, turn, finance capital investment. much capital investment likely unite states, directly influence output productivity. but even save flow abroad, either buy back foreign-owned capital purchase new capital foreign countries, unite state get return investment, raise income growth future consumption. the instance government surplus raise national save so-called ricardian equivalence scenario. in scenario, household learn government plan run surplus, reduce save proportionate share surplus. in general, economist find ricardian offset exist all, modest share relevant government surpluses. at casual level, i have, many year survey non-economist friend see alter consumption behavior response national fiscal policy. the usual response blank stare: if non-economists even imagine connection government deficit saving, idea much respond direction. fiscal policy what, then, long-run fiscal policy lead vibrant economy high rate productivity growth? in general, imply nudge economy direction raise overall rate national saving. it theoretically possible economy save much long-term path consumption per caput actually lowered, generally economist believe u.s. economy well short saturation point. for present circumstances, i proceed assumption save better. i start decompose federal budget two components, cash surplus trust fund social security entitlement programs, net surplus activity government, i call general budget surplus. for general budget surplus, let repeat simple rule, similar enunciate committee economic development milton friedman fifty year ago. the rule general budget surplus average zero long run. this general budget exactly balance year, long-run balance. in event recession, example, natural, actually healthy, revenue fall, spend rise, general budget move deficit. this deficit help prop economy recession, budgetary movement call automatic fiscal stabilizers. but though deficit excusable recession, desirable general. if follow period see expansion, general budget move surplus, time general budget surplus average zero. indeed, long-term value high national save give argument aim positive general budget surplus average, i push argument likely political nonstarter. for surplus entitlement program trust funds, cover social security, medicare, retirement benefit government employees, one would follow different rule. these trust fund set finance long-term entitlement expenditures. to illustrate, social security, large entitlement programs, revenue worker payroll tax go trust fund and, along earn asset holdings, use pay retiree benefits. these trust fund evaluate actuarial basis--whether present future anticipate inflow adequate pay anticipate present future program benefits. if not, corrective step taken. again use social security example, inflow currently exceed outflow (a cash surplus), forecast inflow cover forecast outflow (an actuarial deficit). even though fund cash surplus today, combination tax increase long-term cut benefit need maintain surplus future restore actuarial soundness. this situation atypical country like unite state age population. for country age population, combination general budget surplus zero average trust fund cash surplus normally lead surplus overall, unified, budget. these surplus rationalize technique build nation's future capital stock. since population aging, relatively small cohort worker soon pay benefit relatively large cohort retirees, idea least give small cohort worker bi review 15/2002 3 large capital stock work with. have type budget policy accomplish three objective simultaneously: • the surplus provide capital accumulation. • they great extent country's population aging. • automatic fiscal stabilizer remain deal recessions. the discussion point entirely term federal budget. in principle, state government could follow countercyclical fiscal policy, except one problem. state typically operate legislative constitutional limit deficits. the way state could run deficit recession save store asset early booms. this presaving strategy sound nice principle good idea, state actually follow sufficient degree. so, state budget situation worsen state automatic fiscal stabilizers, unfortunate likely result state lack rainy day resource run deficit need make budget change neutralize automatic stabilizers. monetary policy the automatic fiscal stabilizer help stabilize economy business cycle, main burden fight recession leave central bank. traditionally two reason this: • monetary policy respond shock much quickly fiscal policy. • it generally believe that, economy open foreign trade capital flow flexible exchange rates, monetary policy become effective fight cycle whereas fiscal policy become le effective. to sure, one raise question second reason--the argument hinge fact value domestic currency positively correlate interest rates, recent year often seem case unite states. but despite qualm second reason, first reason seem solid know real world economy. for long time now, central bank try stabilize economies, art form know "leaning wind." john taylor develop equation provide one statistical description practice might followed. under know taylor rule, certain equilibrium position short-term interest rate. the central bank us open market operation raise short-term rate equilibrium response threat inflation low rate equilibrium response threat unemployment. i go details, central bank will announce inflation target, policy response implicit taylor rule could similar implicit forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting, policy strategy use successfully control inflation ten lead economy around world (twenty, one count european central bank, practice form inflation targeting). determine much central bank raise short-term interest rate response inflation, low response recession, even response subpar growth, become empirical matter. however much do, another stabilizer economy. a demand growth heat up, central bank raise short-term rate try limit boom result inflation. a recession threaten, central bank low short-term rate try limit downturn. discretionary fiscal policy? with long-run strategy place, least two shock absorbers--one monetary, one fiscal--we ready sixty-four dollar question. in average recession, additional discretionary fiscal actions? for action effective, must satisfy three conditions: • they stimulate spending. • they institute quickly. • they reverse quickly automatically. 4 bi review 15/2002 the reason speed reversibility important recession long, average twelve month unite states. if expansionary action come effect late recession, say twelfth month, likely add vigor next expansion hence increase business-cycle volatility. reversibility also important overall budget rule discuss earlier. if general budget already approximate balance, continue expansionary fiscal action take top would generate normal deficits, normal budget balance. there limit set fiscal action satisfy conditions. many commonly discuss proposal fall short least one ground. by way illustration, i discus mention recent debates. extend unemployment insurance. unemployment insurance benefit run twenty-six week unite states. in general time limit control caseloads helpful--the basic idea unemployment insurance provide temporary, permanent, support unemployed workers. but recessions, unemployed worker much difficulty get new jobs, may make sense policy lenient extend time limits. such extension enact nearly postwar u.s. recessions. the extension would provide benefit unemployed worker might trouble maintain pre-unemployment standard living, imply extension stimulate consumption spending. the extensions, say thirty-nine weeks, could make define period, year. even period exceed year, budget dollar would reverse worker would naturally good able get job would remain unemployment rolls. this one action seem satisfy three conditions. accelerate schedule cut tax rates. if future tax-rate cut already enact law, put effect sooner plan could do quickly. presumably relevant political compromise already made. a acceleration would damage long-run budget position, reversibility condition satisfied. but property could lessen effect rate cuts. it find consumer spend relatively little one-shot increase income. they spend much tax cut view permanent rather one-time events. since rational, forward-looking consumer view accelerate rate cut one-shot increase income, effect cut consumption could limited. on hand, consumer forward-looking wait tax cut begin spending, accelerate rate cut could stimulate normal amount consumer spending. in case accelerate rate cut could satisfy three conditions. if one change tax policy expectations, overall verdict is, anything, le favorable. suppose household expect propose future rate cut become law. in cases, move rate cut might strong perceive effect permanent income consumption clearly satisfy impact test. but action might take general budget long-term balance, least far bond market concerned, would fail reversibility test. in latter case, accelerate tax cut satisfy two conditions. temporary cut payroll taxes. one could also respond recession cut payroll tax limit period. the cut could make quickly, satisfy first requirement. but income taxes, rate cut short time, fund appear temporary consumers, case effect consumption may large. another problem change payroll tax involve fact virtually devote entitlement trust fund social security. the social security trust fund already underfunded long-term actuarial sense, payroll-tax revenue could remove fund, even short period, without raise long-term actuarial deficit. moreover, one would want start tradition use long-term program fund short-term needs--soon long-term program would exist. thus, payroll tax cut, fiscal flow would keep separate social security system. income tax would need cut amount worker would otherwise pay fund payroll taxes, without actually take money fund itself. such logistical complication could difficult work could lead delay enactment implementation. temporary cut sale taxes. a fast-acting, short-term measure powerful spend impact temporary cut sale taxes. whereas temporary income-tax cut view make one-shot change household disposable income, temporary sales-tax cut bring temporary reduction price good consumer buy. the switch temporary income change temporary price change make difference. the government offer sale consumption bi review 15/2002 5 good consumer respond raise consumption. the period reduction keep reasonably short, encourage household take advantage favorable terms. it appear measure might satisfy three tests. the problem temporary sales-tax cut federal level federal government impose sale taxes. most state do. hence, measure effective, federal government must give grant state government cut sale taxes, roughly amount revenue lose state cuts. other arrangement might need make state impose sale taxes. our supposedly quick program get bite complicated, one easily imagine various state argue revenue flow bill, hold passage cyclical need passed. temporary inducement investment. follow principles, federal government, levy corporate taxes, could offer sale investment goods. until 1986, normal way temporary investment credit. but new tax law make measure much difficult. what do instead offer temporary acceleration depreciation allowances. a temporary sales-tax reductions, make period reasonably short could accelerate investment expenditure time aggregate demand weakest. a pro con associate focus investment instead consumption. the advantageous feature investment represent capital deepening--the whole goal keep long-run general government budget balance encourage investment-oriented economy. the con investment already volatile spend component consumption. if temporary investment inducement time coincide cyclical dip investment, could exacerbate investment cycle instability. but circumstance investment inducement could pas three tests. conclusion the important point establish right long-run policy framework, general budget fiscal policy aim establish budget balance average cycle entitlement trust fund policy aim make program actuarially sound long run. monetary policy aim long-run price stability, short-term flexibility response demand conditions. the fiscal measure monetary commitment price stability stimulate investment, productivity, technological change long term. the flexible monetary policy automatic fiscal stabilizer provide economy shock absorber smooth business cycles. the unanswered question involve role discretionary fiscal changes-- valuable addition macroeconomic strategy? to valuable, measure stimulate spending, take effect quickly, easily reversible. a number temporary tax change might job, stimulate spending, enactment delayed, easily reversible, might little undermine long-run fiscal strategy. the outcome ultimately depend detail program, speed enactment, ease reversibility. bi review 15/2002 1 roger w ferguson, jr: back future manage bank risk remark mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, washington lee university, lexington, virginia, 4 march 2002. * * * good evening. i wish start acknowledge contribution h. parker willis, leader teach economics political science major contributor establishment federal reserve. i suspect would please know contribution remember serve national academic interest well. in teachings, dr. willis recognize relationship monetary fiscal policy, role banking, combine effect economic growth. recent event illustrated, again, cyclical nature u.s. world economy direct effect economic condition bank intermediary credit. after nearly decade steady improvement, earn core bank operation measure financial strength u.s. bank system take inevitable turn. while concern indicator financial health continue grow, deterioration source alarm. since end 1999, example, growth industry asset far outpace rise earnings; nonperforming assets, though still relatively low, expand 70 percent; number asset unsatisfactory problem bank increased, still remain relatively low. fraud bank employee lead loss even closure bank recently. more broadly, failure enron, stock market react might expect uncertainty create opaque balance sheet punish firms, bank nonbanks, whose risk profile le easily understood. to sure, u.s. bank system remain strong virtually measure well position support future economic growth. by historic standards, current profitability figure robust; relative industry's equity, reserves, asset size, nonperforming asset still low. bank survive prosper accept risk, crucial economic role reason existence. nonetheless, risk must well manage many institution task become much difficult complex. indeed, remark today, i want discus change nature risk management bank implication banker bank supervisors. my central message core principle risk management remain that--core principles. the improve technique new technology provide improve matter remain root core principles. in context, i remind old back-to-the-future theme science fiction individual travel back time and, presence, nearly alter history disadvantage. in deal complex, fast-paced, highly competitive business today, many institution may face similar risk. institution ability, result available technology financial innovation, change activity risk profile quickly, may always employ control necessary prevent unexpected untoward results. many firm already eliminate lower- middle- management position response competitive pressures. though action probably improve cost-efficiency ratio bank help meet earn expectations, also could, do carefully, increase likelihood new weakness appear. that say, institution must take sufficiently long-term perspective decisionmaking pursue purely short-term remedy high operate costs. bank highly leverage and, many respects, low-margin business. loss single bad loan material breakdown control eliminate gain many transactions. the continue ability identify manage risk maintain proper internal control critical bank organization even seek increase profit profitability. indeed, acceptance application current innovation risk-management technique go require expense dramatic change way large bank organization business. many banks, i afraid, fall curve, perhaps basis short-run cost-benefit analysis. in view, failure make outlay change put risk banks' long-run profitability financial transaction grow increasingly complex. the thrust basel ii 2 bi review 15/2002 and, independently, supervisory approach disadvantage entity prepare adopt innovative technique handle ever complex financial transactions. new technology technique must adopt financial institution avoid repeat problem bank system successful accept risk future past. important experience over past thirty years, bank industry face many challenges. in 1970s, large bank abroad sharply increase exposure emerge economy latin america regions, recycle deposit oil-rich nations. although profit opportunity bank look attractive while, picture clearly change 1980s, lender incur sizable loss foreign loan reduce exposures. the industry's problem 1980s domestic nature. for many community banks, weak agricultural market last half decade create difficulty throughout midwest contribute failure hundred small community banks. by end decade, excessive exposure overbuilt commercial real estate market undermine financial strength number large money-center regional banks. those problem force several institution fail otherwise lose independence contribute wave industry consolidation national reform domestic bank law regulations. in contrast, 1990s view calmly certain satisfaction; indeed, industry please many things. after first year past decade, number cost bank failure drop sharply, bank system post impressive performance virtually every year, many investor former owner bank liquidate hold nice profit industry consolidated. recently, bank experience problem le widespread nature 1970s 1980s. last month, example, large foreign bank discover trade loss u.s. subsidiary bank apparently increase substantially go undetected time. also last month, fdic seize $70 million bank ohio examiner uncover $40 million embezzlement. several year earlier, bank west virginia close examiner allege bank manager hide extensive loss relate complex securitized transactions. these experience remind u even decade solid performance allow anyone become complacent. virtually major problems, whether involve fraud honest misjudgment risk, can--almost definition--be trace weakness organization's risk-management corporate-governance. judgment always easy hindsight, failure apply fundamental principle management often root material business problems. manage control risk although failure product fraud, key risk bank remain credit risk--the risk borrower default. if many customer default, bank itself. historically, best tool manage credit risk include strong reliance understand business prospect borrower source repayment. additionally, manage risk, bank traditionally apply several limits, include limit exposure one counterparty entire industry sectors. recently, i note earlier, bank also use more-sophisticated credit-risk-management tools. however, credit risk one many risk bank must manage. liquidity risk, traditionally define risk bank cannot meet payment obligation timely cost-effective manner, another. determine adequate liquidity bank organization always rather subjective difficult task, bank rarely liquidity problem long view sound. although competition retail deposit emerge past several years, bank still relatively easily issue additional insure deposits, give federal government's guarantee. most liquidity problem arise market confidence lose bank cannot attract sufficient level uninsured funds. commercial banks, particular, may little room slip, give high leverage slim profit margins. a drop market confidence trigger series cascade events: drop bank's credit rating, high fund costs, reduce profitability, le overall competitiveness access public markets, forth. all that, turn, increase institution's liquidity risk. bi review 15/2002 3 manage liquidity risk require bank address market risk, well, ensure maturity asset liability reasonably balance overly expose change interest rates, exchange rates, equity, commodity, bond prices. give evolution global financial markets, activity commonly associate market risk, trade investment banking, become important many large financial institutions. this evolution, turn, relate financial innovation widespread use complex derivative securitized investment products, require virtually bank know management market risk. put somewhat differently, past years, bank initiate transaction high risk use new financial engineer technique lay hedge risk. these beneficial stabilize risk-sharing technique prerequisite strong management control procedures. flaw quickly result significant unanticipated losses. operate risk, legal risk, reputational risk round conventional list risk banks. operate risk, particular, attract attention recent years, partly improvement technology data storage permit institution retain analyze data also increase volume complexity bank transaction have, arguably, increase risk many banks. roughly defined, operate risk refer risk arise inadequate information systems, operational problems, breach internal controls, fraud, unforeseen catastrophe result unexpected losses. the term may also embrace legal risk, many legal claim arise operational failures. the need manage control operate risk particularly great institution whose activity involve substantial interbank payments, security settlements, asset management, transaction high volume entail large dollar amounts. these condition expose particular institution substantial risk also potential disrupt financial market worldwide. event september 11 illustrate point. risk-focused supervision bank risk management culture in supervisory efforts, federal reserve much past decade emphasize risk-focused approach, particularly case large institutions. that approach require examiner understand institution's risk profile devote resource area present great risk. it allow examiner great flexibility oversight activities, focus attention institution's internal processes, contrast traditional approach base review evaluate individual transactions. the sheer volume bank transaction today speed individual exposure change require u take approach. we need confident institution's internal systems, procedures, control sound remain effective long review. of course, evaluate procedure control require transaction testing. risk-focused supervision nature bank today require successful organization maintain sound corporate governance strong system controls. bank must manage customer counterparty relationship appropriate sensitivity risk. lend officer risk manager must understand change customers' business plan might implication creditworthiness. they must blind reputation counterparties rather use fragment data, proprietary market-based, shed light customers' prospects. finally, exposure limit sufficiently robust consider capital risk cash door. still practices, diversify risk assume best condition continue indefinitely, seem common sense. but even they, too, occasionally overlook ignored. risk-based supervision require u recognize basic nature human be force motivate u all: fear, greed, ambition, like. all this, turn, speak importance implement management principle learn college management trainees: importance segregate certain duties; limit individual's span control; establish write policy procedures; provide accurate timely information organization's senior management director creditor shareholders, well. the fact manager delegate authority--but responsibility--is another. neither bank supervisor internal external auditor detect deter weak practices, particularly core management principle applied. fraudulent activity particularly difficult uncover often involve collusion individual authority within 4 bi review 15/2002 organization. it crucial, then, institution maintain culture value integrity create adequate controls. that effort must begin top. bank capital standard in effort provide large internationally active bank great incentive measure manage risk well, bank supervisor around world develop more-sophisticated more-risk-sensitive regulatory capital standards, technique standards. these grow best-practice bank talk begin apply. if multi-year effort successful (a goal federal reserve board hope try hard achieve), would replace decade-old capital standard one good able distinguish among bank base economic risk associate activities. in addition benefits, provide information supervisor market participant use evaluate condition large complex bank organizations. the standard development large part base internal credit rat bank assign exposure internal measure risk. it require institution evaluate borrower's probability default, bank's loss give customer's default, bank's likely exposure borrower time default occurs. relevant factor collateral for, maturity of, credit undrawn loan commitment considered. lead bank organization throughout world make progress measure credit risks, consult firm private-sector business provide helpful analysis, insights, techniques. i want downplay contribution bank risk manager development new concept techniques. but fact much gain could attributed, i believe, willingness regulator revisit capital standard also increase attention give risk measurement on-site supervisory reviews. even progress make industry analysts, investors, counterparties ask inform question institution's risk profile refuse settle response question inappropriate answer difficult provide. such reply encourage analyst dig deeper, bank supervisors, too. only probe answer disclosure unclear expect meaningful complete information. unfortunately, measure credit risk easy, apply new technique cheap, especially institution need most--the large internationally active bank complex structure operations. if easy, method would clear well accept now. if measure credit risk new technique cheap, bank would apply them. it is, i said, neither easy cheap. these fact complicate international process develop more-risk-sensitive capital standard reach agreement address relevant industry concerns. they also make process time-consuming. in areas, regulator find develop solution fill hole industry widely accept practice. measure risk commercial real estate lending, bank equity investing, even effect loan's maturity underlie risk issue still actively debate among supervisor bank managers. bank practice role bank generally credit-intermediation process also differ among country continents, give different borrow practice consumers, various stage development capital market throughout world, different legal code regulatory philosophies. in absence establish solution within industry across major industrial economies, regulator force make proposal base largely concept partial application rather practice common industrial economies. any regulatory capital standard must, course, require bank hold amount capital sufficient get through, bad imaginable, nevertheless rough times. competition within industry among bank system different country often press less. such pressure must resisted, supervisor throughout world work together develop accurate standard sufficiently rigorous accomplish common goals. we want capital structure risk sensitive; experience new approach, however, prudence argue wholesale reduction aggregate capital levels. some institutions' capital requirement may fall requirement institution rise, case portfolio risks. bi review 15/2002 5 an important objective spur, discourage, analysis understand bank risks, include area historically subject much quantification, operational risk. require bank quantify risk assessment push direction. the need progress within industry front seem clear. urge good complete public disclosure risk seem equally beneficial risk measurement, credit allocation, investment processes. all effort proceed. for good worse, lag new rule developed, agree upon, implement various rulemaking processes. the industry also need time develop information risk-measurement system would required. in meantime, regulatory bank community continue learn development practice measure risk, supervisory expectation evolve. much work remain develop new standard sufficiently acceptable federal reserve parties. the effort present opportunity, however, move industry regulatory practice ahead. we eager work regulator achieve purpose. conclusion in closing, i emphasize, again, importance teaching, learn apply fundamental principle economics sound management practices, washington lee. many financial institution today become extremely large complex, operation management processes. fundamental principle still apply, however, cannot afford overlook them. at time, new technology concept offer opportunity add principle set technique could well change way bank manage risk. regardless large, sophisticated, complex organization may be, remain govern people subject law market forces. a educator students, work together reinforce lesson next generation leader business commerce. a bankers, bank supervisors, policymakers, ignore fact make judgment decisions. bi review 14/2002 1 kristina persson: the riksbank, growth inflation speech m kristina persson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, företagarnas riksorganisation, trosa, 28 february 2002. * * * firstly, i would like thank invitation come here. it important meet representative industry able talk role riksbank significance growth. the role riksbank the objective monetary policy clearly state sverige riksbank act - maintain price stability. the riksbank define inflation target, i.e. cpi inflation shall amount 2 per cent, tolerate deviation interval plus/minus one percentage point. this mean determine direction monetary policy, must take account change number area affect price trend directly indirectly. i intend comment one particular, namely potential growth swedish economy long-term perspective. the sverige riksbank act also establish riksbank shall independent, mean six member executive board, make decision regard instrumental rate, may request receive instruction government parliament. the idea thereby always free safeguard value money tempted, instance, contribute increase growth employment low interest rate election year. at begin new monetary policy regime, fix exchange rate abandon 1992, certain amount criticism inflation target; many people fear unconditional attachment inflation norm would negative effect growth employment. a monetary policy aim price stability could lead prolong period low growth and, extreme cases, decline production. it may appear though objective force riksbank give low priority development real economy, i.e. production employment. we one objective monetary policy, unlike, instance, u central bank also task take consideration effect interest rate decision growth employment. however, actual fact, difference probably great - indirectly assessment future path real economy also play important role decisions. moreover, also task "without neglect price stability objective, support objective general economic policy aim attain sustainable growth high level employment." this express proposal sverige riksbank act 1999. however, even importantly, opposition good growth price stability, quite reverse. if look development 1990s, growth since 1992 show average rate 3 per cent year, despite fact inflation target level several years. at time, unemployment fall 9 per cent approximately 4 per cent. this compare 1970s 1980s, inflation around 8 per cent growth average 2 per cent. price stability importance achieve also well establish among general public sweden. this important, understand acceptance monetary policy important inflation expectation thereby behaviour labour good markets. it - particularly business - set price must able trust turn say; inflation rise fall target 2 per cent long period. this also reason member executive board often travel around hold speeches. communication swedish public operator various market important monetary policy. a monetary policy operate impact certain time lag, instrumental rate adjust total assessment future inflation, take account risk scenarios, 1 2 year ahead line target. interest rate decision base forecast future prices. there deviation forecasts, even well founded, partly economy hit 2 bi review 14/2002 unforeseen shock time time. if fruit-growers' crop attack insects, price apple rise, dam fill water, electricity price may rise, cow europe suffer various diseases, price meat certain foodstuff rises. if riksbank try make correction type temporary price disturbance, would probably lead large swing monetary policy unnecessary fluctuation demand. it would therefore wrong give impression inflation always lie 2 per cent. on hand, important riksbank constantly adapt instrumental rate ensure inflation forecast 1-2 year ahead line inflation target. this mean household firm rely temporary deviation level temporary. one factor could seriously undermine credibility inflation target high rate price increase lead large-scale demand wage compensation. if wage price begin chase one another upwards, happen 1980s, everyone lose end. the importance monetary policy growth vice versa the importance monetary policy growth primarily connect need stability trade industry labour market. when businessmen woman make decision investment, usually avoid worry sudden fluctuation inflation rate overturn calculations. in cases, temporary, minor deviation target change final result calculations. the stability plan create lead good quality investments, turn stimulate growth. this reflected, instance, fact total factor productivity swedish economy increase strongly macroeconomic stability establish 1990s. other country around world experience. macroeconomic stability promote growth productivity. what may give le attention public debate importance growth capacity meet inflation target - despite fact really key issue. it demand economy relation production capacity decisive factor whether inflationary bottleneck arise not. or, instead under-utilise production potential therefore need try increase capacity utilisation. what determine whether risk overheat swedish economy's capacity utilisation relation potential. i believe one say type inbuilt speed limit economy. it difficult, rule, know goes; moreover change time. external events, dynamic industry particular economic policy change potential growth rate economy. in words, possible raise low speed limit, depend happen economy. however, give point time limit cannot exceed go without damage consequences. if growth exceed limit long period, overheat inflationary pressure arise. if growth low, opposite apply, result high unemployment poor welfare necessary. let u compare swedish economy drive car. the riksbank's job make easy car road allow speed, without accident occurring. the work do political area promote growth trade industry therefore important enable riksbank maintain low interest rate. the riksbank cannot affect potential growth; role create good condition private public operators. it work structural reforms, good infrastructure, education, research, entrepreneurship, innovations, etc. improve economy's long-term capacity create growth thereby welfare long term. the decisive factor monetary policy speed limit long period time. if low capacity utilisation start, temporarily high growth, i.e. accelerate achieve economy's cruise speed. one complication lack clear sign state speed limit - words; always uncertainty capacity ceiling lie - high swedish economy's potential growth rate is. at riksbank previously estimate approximately 2-2.5 per cent. today, conclude inflation tendency swedish economy appear high previously realised, one possible explanation may over-estimated swedish economy's production capacity. the inflation report publish march, form basis decision interest rate bi review 14/2002 3 next monetary policy meeting, provide overall assessment resource utilisation inflation. economic progress 1990s in seam 1980s 1990s, clear overheat swedish economy, despite fact growth modest 2 per cent year 1980s. over past five years, economy grow 3 per cent year without correspond worries. something evidently change better. my opinion reason positive change particularly four area important growth: macroeconomy, increase competition, trade development technology. i shall briefly discus then, conclusion, say word challenge i see swedish economy present. economic policy change different stage 1990s. monetary policy aim maintain price stability, give u low interest rate increase stability predictability, beneficial willingness invest. fiscal policy also contribute consolidation central government finance new budget system, also give u increase predictability. sweden's membership eu's common market deregulation also mean several market previously monopoly screen competition, open competition. these include financial services, transport, telecommunication energy. the pressure company use resource efficiently thereby increased. the stiff competitive pressure result increase internationalisation deregulation various sub-sectors. the new competition act introduce 1993 also contributed. however, despite fact several year since new competition legislation introduced, development towards increase competition appear move slowly. one indication price level sweden high many countries, without completely explain difference vat wage levels. this applies, instance, foodstuff construction material sector, area characterise high company concentration, significant entry barrier new company weak competition imports. some limitation import competition due norms, standard regulation specific sweden. the swedish market small company country find profitable manufacture product especially us. there may therefore reason consider competition legislation may great effect practice. increase competition benefit economy two ways: initially contribute indirectly low inflation stimulate efficiency new way thinking. i believe one problem competition legislation may incentive follow law weak. it always individual (company managers, owners) prepare make decision limit competition provision law, little personal responsibility current legislation. merely sentence company fine risk create situation ultimately consumer pay second time; first cartels' high price cost cartels' fines. in usa, responsible decision-makers penalise breach law come light. the swedish competition authority express opinion response report committee combat cartel (sou 2001:74) possibility personal penal responsibility consider sweden. it make comparison economic crime lead prison sentences. increase mobility ideas, goods, services, work capital 1990s, partly membership eu, probably also positive effect growth. internationalisation increase competition particularly valuable growth small country like sweden, involve resource would otherwise use inefficiently instead move towards efficient use sector companies. some year ago, widespread hope sweden country "new economy" follow breakthrough information technology would lead sustainable high growth rate. it possible still remains, usa calculation indicate growth 4 bi review 14/2002 one percentage point high it would otherwise 1990s.1 the setback experience telecommunication it recently probably see mainly unavoidable sober process sector heavily inflate expectations. the fact bubble burst change situation it development many way lastingly change condition growth, particularly efficient flow information, decentralise production networks, etc. in sweden see total factor productivity, part productivity consider reflect progress technology organisation, rise strongly before, much strongly many countries, 1990s. the high productivity figure sweden partly connect rise telecommunication product industry, rise total factor productivity also see part swedish trade industry, mainly engineer pharmaceutical industries. despite fact importance it play down, extensive use computers, network internet sweden make positive contribution productivity. efficiency gain arise, instance, tax authorities, social insurance systems, municipal services, etc. move internet-based self-service. the connection it use internationalisation trade industry appear particularly strong, increasingly advance network specialise sub-contractors. it appear country good productivity growth 1995-2000, usa, finland, australia sweden, trade industry open international exchange quickly oecd countries, parallel increase it use. challenge the question whether improve condition enough provide sweden stable, good growth next five ten years. can trust problem 1970s, 1980s 1990s definitely over? or institutional structural change economy need undergo? some growth 1990s probably temporary effect economy make recovery hard press begin 1990s. this effect fade now, therefore labour force, technology renewal job raise potential growth long term. there two main method increase growth: firstly, people work people work more, secondly productivity improved. when, instance, new technology new organisation introduced, production rationalise productivity increases. if content production change renewal direction product service demand high value global market, value production rises. when occur without correspond increase number hour worked, lead high productivity. during 1970s 1980s little way 1990s, sweden lose considerable grind term real growth compare country oecd region. accord sn paper produce last year, sweden growth rate one whole percentage point average among rich countries, would take 17 year u regain place among ten rich country world.2 if growth go increase people working, part large percentage adult population absent work life various reason would work. today approximately 800,000 full-time worker disappear work life result ill health3. at end 2001, estimate number person sick leave long one year amount 120,000, almost three time figure 1997. the number sick leave short one year also continue rise.4 the problem accentuate fact 1 accord stephen oliner daniel sichel federal reserve washington, productivity trend increase one percentage point second half 1990s. half increase result investment it. 2 economics council report 2001: kluster.se. sweden new geographical economy 2001. 3 800 000 full-time post calculate approximately 400 000 early retirement plus total sick leave, include qualification day absence sick-pay period translate become approximately 400 000 full-time post (source: sou 2002:5, an action plan increase ill-health work.) 4 source: sou 2002:5, an action plan increase ill health work. bi review 14/2002 5 pensioner support ratio, express number professionally active relation retire due ill-health old age, move 2.1 2000 1.4 2030, accord statistic sweden's population forecasts.5 this mean potential growth sustain people working, need participate work life high age groups. another method raise potential growth would invest heavily productivity labour force increase sufficiently allow one worker support one pensioner future. capacity renewal to summarise, much change recently swedish economy. the external framework currently characterise substantial fiscal policy monetary policy stability, facilitate plan decision-making household companies. these fundamental conditions, together mark increase openness world around us, give reason believe continue favourable development productivity. at time, one remember many market sweden still show clear sign poor competition. this involve considerable costs. i believe swedish economy considerable unutilised potential strong development concentrate this, i.e. shall increase "speed limit" economy. it enough good macroeconomic conditions; policy growth concern microeconomics macroeconomics. it question create good incentive individual people behave rational social manner role economic agents. what profitable attractive behaviour individual also profitable whole. this take field politics, part riksbank's responsibilities. however, field i involve previous career roles. i would therefore like briefly round say something i personally believe could increase long-term growth potential sweden. i believe stimulance increase growth capacity swedish economy find three main arease, concern, firstly, effort promote entrepreneurship, i.e. people choose start company company growing. the entrepreneurs' share work force sweden low. compare oecd countries, sweden rank no. 19 2000.6 secondly, invest knowledge education, level everyone. research belong too, link research new product - innovations. education promote economic growth individual welfare. the third area call renewal work life. a good, rich society must make use productive force people have. to make possible probably require new think many areas. so, access capital, surely decisive growth? certainly, capital seek go obtain best return. attractiveness, ability attract retain investments, create entrepreneurs, research & development competence. in increasingly globalise market, region place compete one another investments. the important factor attract investment tie people's capacity. the key growth human capacity will. this reason apply small place trosa municipality, also region country europe sweden. the eu compete usa; recently usa often superior regard productivity, growth inflow capital. an important question europe whether common market, single currency co-operation achieve degree dynamism usa. and pursue european welfare policy without lose competitiveness. excessively deep social chasms, extensive crime social maladjustment could become internal threat growth. 5 source: the national social insurance board analysis 2002:3 "older people's exit labour force - future." 6 oecd, dsti/ind(2002)11: "benchmarking: foster firm creation entrepreneurship". 6 bi review 14/2002 even good microeconomic condition well-tended macropolicy, able avoid fluctuation economic activity; build way economy functions. however, subdue fluctuation stability predictability all, different development welfare since 1970s. thank listening! bi review 14/2002 1 roger w ferguson, jr: a review economic development 2001 economic outlook remark mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice-chairman board governor u federal reserve system, canton forum speaker series, canton, ohio, 27 february 2002. * * * i please address canton forum today. a always, view i express necessarily share member board governor federal open market committee. review 2001 a confluence factor shape economic development last year, i would first like review factors, provide backdrop assess economic prospect 2002. a year ago, sign recession eventually unfold begin materialize. after several year boom growth, economic indicator start send mix signals. although consumer sentiment drop around end 2000, consumer still spend healthy clip. though consumption growth decelerate somewhat previous year, modest slow consistent deceleration aggregate demand necessary good align supply demand. businesses, however, appear struggling. a data end 2000 become available, become clear businesses--amid disappoint sale earnings--had abruptly curtail record-setting expansion investment spending. of course, reduction investment usually accompany recognition downshift economy, firm bring capital stock line revise outlook sales. but severity adjustment last year appear reflect usual reaction. business seem reassess profitability additional fix capital fundamental way. new capital, especially capital embody new technologies, continue promise efficiency gains, expectation seem get ahead even favorable reality, result unsustainable buildup capital run-up equity market values. capital expenditure high-tech equipment especially hard hit. moreover, sudden drop-off business demand, couple slow consumer sector, apparently catch producer guard. and despite rapid cut production, inventory uncomfortably high relative sales. early last year, manufacturer take step address unwanted stock begin liquidate inventory earnest slash production type goods. against backdrop, federal open market committee reduce target federal fund rate sharply last january contain weakness head serious slackening. this first installment series policy ease counter weakness economy emerge first half last year. in business sector, serious retrenchment spend production way. in addition initial cause pullback, abruptness slow seem jar business confidence, lead firm postpone spend reassess situations. in way, investment downturn become self-reinforcing. at time, financial developments, include strong dollar, sharply low equity prices, tight lend standard bank security markets, tend offset influence low federal fund rate. by midyear, investment--and high-tech investment particular--was post large decline decades. the weak job market low stock price also begin weigh consumers, though much less extent. with overall sale sagging, inventory remain excessive many sectors. a weakness economy intensified, policymakers responded. in june, president bush sign economic growth tax relief reconciliation act 2001 law. the first installment reduction personal income tax rate go effect july. in addition, act provide tax rebate $300 $600 per household pay directly taxpayers. a monetary policy, march june, fomc vote ease monetary policy four times, bring cumulative reduction federal fund rate 275 basis point first six month year--the rapid reduction fund rate since early 1980s. despite 2 bi review 14/2002 fiscal monetary effort bolster sag aggregate activity, late summer hard sign surface recovery hand. the terrorist attack september 11--whose bad effect felt people family directly touch tragedies--were blow already weaken economy. in week immediately follow events, forecaster expect damage economy extensive. the initial effect airline travel industry severe. also, rapid deterioration business consumer confidence seem highly probable. in addition immediate crisis-related injection liquidity, federal reserve move address perceive shock macroeconomy low federal fund rate 50 basis point september 17 additional 75 basis point end year. over past months, watch closely see aggregate activity would unfold aftermath terrorist attacks. no doubt great deal pain inflict economy. but, give magnitude shock, economy prove resilient initially anticipated. though several industry hit hard, worst-case scenario spin late september materialized. in particular, households' view economy remain relatively stable, thing considered. in fact, one recent readings, consumer confidence much low august. while spend surely buttress temporary factor aggressive discount motor vehicle retail goods, effect terrorism consumer spend severe fear late september. to sure, 2001 rough year economy--one rough face long time. the weak economic outcome despite sizable reduction federal fund rate lead question effectiveness monetary policy. but i believe monetary policy substantially cushion negative force weigh economy. residential construction visibly buoy policy easing. house activity remain high level year, low mortgage rate apparently offset restraint decline employment, small gain income, low level wealth. also, although delinquency rate risen, restriction emerge availability credit consumers. indeed, low interest rate make attractive refinance mortgage reduce mortgage payments, extract home equity buildup, pay expensive form consumer credit. even businesses, feel pinch low corporate profits, benefit low interest rates; aggregate interest expense remain fairly low relative cash flow, business move aggressively bolster financial stability lock more-certain, longer-term source funds. automaker particular able offer inexpensive finance customer fund cost fallen. in many ways, mechanism propagate weakness last year quite traditional: a negative demand shock lead unwanted inventory adjustment production. that, turn, idle worker feed back even weak demand. but even shock terrorist attacks, two aspect last year's slowdown atypical. first, main source negative hit demand large shock capital expenditures. in past fifty years, investment spend nearly always begin decline one four quarter peak economic cycle, it. what start gradual cool overheat economy become much serious severe shakeout hit high-tech sector. second, consumer spend good services--which represent two-thirds gross domestic product--held remarkably well last year. in past, consumption spend almost always decline recession started. but last year, despite sharp drop consumer confidence decline wealth low equity values, household keep buying. at point, still early classify recession mild severe. in general, economic fluctuation past fifteen twenty year tame counterpart early eras. economist conjecture improve technology allow business monitor demand closely manage inventory better. recent development ought give u evidence subject. one thing certain: because unusual, investment-led nature recession, cannot put much weight shape profile past recovery try predict one. bi review 14/2002 3 current situation near-term outlook that said, data receive recent week encourage suggest economic activity process turn up. although payroll employment continue fall january, pace decline slow fourth quarter last year. initial claim unemployment insurance move low past two months--another hopeful sign recovery. industrial production fell january, here, too, rate decline well pace precede months. a obtain information spend pattern since september, behavior household increasingly prove key stabilize force economic activity. sale car light trucks--though extraordinary rate fourth quarter--have continue quite healthy rates. in addition, retail sale outside motor vehicle strong december january. house construction, too, robust, bolster part favorable weather low mortgage rates. in business sector, rapid pace company liquidate inventory fourth quarter contribute weakness manufacture output. however, downward adjustment stock desire level seem well along industries, drag production may diminishing. business fix investment yet show consistent sustain evidence turnaround, although positive indicators. after year deal overhang capital goods, many firm cautious capital spending. with corporate profit pressure capacity utilization rate near past cyclical lows, many business report expansion plan remain hold. however, capital investment allow business reduce cost might attractive. spend indicator positive past months, particularly respect computer equipment. development sector importantly influence strength economy month ahead, therefore warrant careful monitoring. a know, chairman alan greenspan present board's semiannual monetary policy report congress morning. a indicated, central tendency forecast member board governor federal reserve bank president real gdp growth year 2-1/2 3 percent. i comfortable range forecasts. a i noted, recent data indicate household spend reasonably well maintained. in addition, sign capital spend may improving, strength durability improvement still uncertain. until clear perspective regard business investment, i believe still reason reservation regard contour recovery. the longer-run outlook one main force lead recovery temporary slowdown confidence business household that, long run, outlook u.s. economy still bright. despite current problems, fundamental economy strong. our workforce well educate adaptable. our bank system healthy, capital markets, flexible multifaceted, well equip handle shocks. perhaps notable feature economy recent years, however, acceleration productivity. in second half 1990s, output per hour nonfarm business sector increase annual rate almost 3 percent per year, well pace early decade. these efficiency gain allow real gdp rise 4 percent year, average, period. with rapid increase productivity, business cost well contained, rate price inflation stable, despite fall unemployment rate 4 percent. productivity growth continue four quarter 2001. that increase impressive, give historical tendency productivity growth turn negative economy enter recession. this performance provide additional evidence improvement productivity growth witness since mid-1990s largely structural persist time. but fundamental factor lead cautiously optimistic much improvement likely sustain outlook state technological advancement unite states. a feed economist dan sichel steve oliner shown, one major source gain output per hour high rise level business investment, increase amount capital per worker, thereby boost productivity. boom investment 1990s due importantly steep 4 bi review 14/2002 decline price high-tech equipment, largely reflect rapid technical progress. about ½ percentage point increase productivity growth 1995-99 period attribute so-called capital deepening. although extraordinary pace investment spend boom year sustainable, i believe technological progress continue drive cost information technology come years, induce still robust growth capital stock. moreover, business reaffirm intention improve productivity substitute cost-saving high-tech capital labor. though certainly risk view improvement productivity growth persist, i believe terrorism last fall go permanently harm increase output per hour (and thus health economy). most assuredly, aftermath attacks, many business force redirect resource efficiency-enhancing investment meet great demand security. business may also compel increase redundancy cope great potential supply disruption. however, effect mainly one-time hit level productivity. they likely change trend growth rate output per hour. moreover, effect ameliorate business use new technology find creative way hold cost enhance security provide contingencies. conclusion obviously, 2001 challenge year. but american people prove challenge, sign economic recovery increasing. at federal reserve, stand ready necessary maintain financial stability, september 11, maintain monetary policy stance foster price stability promote maximum sustainable growth output. bi review 13/2002 1 eva srejber: monetary policy inflation expectation sweden speech m eva srejber, second deputy governor sverige riksbank, föreningssparbanken karlstad, 25 february 2002. * * * i like begin thank invitation come here. today i intend talk guide executive board make decision monetary policy role predictability central bank’s action play maintain price stability. then i shall take brief look back economic situation immediately follow tragic event 11 september summarise economic situation today. finally, i like explain view monetary policy i enter reservation decision leave repo rate unchanged last executive board monetary policy meeting. monetary policy strategy i shall begin reminder guide u make decision monetary policy; i.e. monetary policy strategy formulated. the riksbank assign law task maintain price stability. we also task promote safe efficient payment system. the bank play central role tasks. the monetary policy objective define riksbank target cpi inflation 2 per cent tolerate deviation interval +/- 1 percentage point. the steer interest rate instrument riksbank’s disposal maintain price stability. it also possible use methods, e.g. foreign exchange interventions, summer, mean achieve objective. however, repo rate monetary policy instrument normally used. our monetary policy strategy described, somewhat simplified, rule thumb inflation one two year ahead estimated, take account risk scenario, deviate inflation target, steer interest rate adjusted. the riksbank’s assessment future inflation rate communicated, instance, inflation report present four time year. the riksbank choose set inflation target medium-term perspective. this monetary policy influence inflation time lag. an ambition try ensure inflation also develop line target short term would probably require significant change steer interest rate thereby contribute unnecessarily large fluctuation demand. the fact inflation target express term medium-term perspective also play importance temporary price changes. consumer price sometimes affect various disturbance temporary effect inflation. political decisions, instance, tariff indirect taxes, also temporary effect rate price increase. it may also useful describe briefly monetary policy affect inflation. a change interest rate effect rate price increase via number different channels. for instance, interest rate influence general public’s decision regard investment consumption. a high interest rate normally mean growth demand slightly subdued, assume entail amount free resource economy increase slightly long term. the effect demand often come quarter thus also subdue price increase even late stage. a change interest rate also affect exchange rate. an increase mean return asset home country’s currency slightly higher. this also mean expectation growth inflation subdue somewhat relative development rest world, accord textbook contribute slightly strong exchange rate. if krona appreciates, become slightly cheap import sweden, assume lead import price input consumer good increase slow rate. a strong krona also subdue global demand swedish export goods, help subdue growth demand. on hand, little confidence country’s economic policy, increase interest rate risk result weak exchange rate rather reverse, confidence growth low. monetary policy also affect price development via households’ companies’ expectation future inflation. in context important point number different measure 2 bi review 13/2002 inflation expectations. the inflation report contain different measure household company expect rate price increase develop. price financial market also provide information here. a type inflation expectation reflect various forecasters’ assessment developments. the riksbank base estimation total assessment different measure inflation expectations. stable low inflation expectation affect companies’ price behaviour wage formation, well beneficial effect, far monetary policy concerned, consumer react price changes. companies’ price behaviour base partly development marginal costs, competitive situation, demand inflation expectations. if company confidence riksbank’s monetary policy, price affect much temporary change in, instance, supply, demand exchange rate. in situation, company assume inflation return long-term trend effect disturbance subside. a credible inflation target thus contribute maintain monetary policy target low cost term fluctuation demand interest rates. one mean inspire confidence show high degree openness clarity regard monetary policy conducted. the fact riksbank describe consideration regard economic prospect form basis interest rate decision make easy external analyst understand predict monetary policy. moreover, fact consideration report openly may help increase confidence assessment conclusions. consistency monetary policy action also increase confidence price stability target, turn stabilise effect inflation expectations. the role predictability monetary policy it important riksbank clear explain base interest rate decision made. a effect monetary policy price development time lag, interest rate change basis forecast future price developments. however, always easy interpret correctly happen economy. in recent year difficult find clear relationship demand situation inflation sweden. gdp growth high 1997 middle 2000. since growth demand subdued. during 1997 1998 inflation fell, rate price increase tend accelerate thereafter. at time, inflation expectation remain relatively stable level. there many explanation development riksbank’s view described, instance, various inflation reports. let expound personal reflection issue. if riksbank’s monetary policy inspire confidence, inflation expectation establish around inflation target. this mean resource utilisation economy could vary slightly more, without immediate impact inflation. stable, low inflation expectation base assumption central bank shall act control inflation rate mean inflation become high, even resource utilisation increase potential. conversely, confidence lower, high inflation expectation mean price fall, even resource utilisation declines. there also number study indicate relationship inflation growth stable, due degree resource utilisation general public think central bank’s actions. a central bank high level credibility safeguarder price stability allow demand high relation potential growth central bank opposite reputation. the fact wage set price set behaviour affect inflation expectation mean take time reduction resource utilisation impact term fall price low wage hikes. in way take time change inflation expectation price behaviour downwards, difficult change upwards. a i mention above, partly general public expect certain behaviour central banks, partly raise price involve cost companies. these purely administrative cost also reputation costs. reputation cost sense damage good among first raise prices, one many wave price increases. this mean company start raise prices, many others soon follow. for reason, central bank misunderstand situation allow positive inflationary pressure prevail long bi review 13/2002 3 inflation rate remain low, general public’s image central bank’s behaviour change. this turn affect price behaviour increase started, follow shadow first. this inflation often come late stage economic upturn mean inflation remain high period economic activity declining, despite fall demand production. it something paradox credible central bank great difficulty see sign price pressure time. in opinion, risk swedish inflation hold deregulation increase competition way lull think inflationary tendency economy low actually are. when companies’ scope reduce price result of, instance, deregulation increase competition, begin exhaust demand pressure finally express rise prices, risk price increase great introduce rapidly expect u analysts. monetary policy must base forecast inflation resource utilisation. if monetary policy base overly optimistic assessment interplay growth inflation, lead monetary policy become overly expansive. if inflation expectation become slow moving, could mean time considerable imbalance build policy impact form high inflation. example japan 1980s, usa 1927-29 1990s. the example japan indicate even inflation rise forecast period monetary works, important take broad outlook throughout entire economy forward time, envisage risk could exist regard financial stability. in japan cost borrow low long period time borrow money invest share property. a productivity economy increased, confidence future grow make investor credit institution will take risks. the result asset price push up. a raise interest rate type situation, over-optimism rife inflation interest rate low, could mean investors, property buyer credit institution would act rather cautiously interest rate remain unchanged low rate thus least subdue price bubble somewhat. the cost society wait long change direction monetary policy high imbalance allow grow fall production drastic imbalance corrected. it therefore important monetary policy act preventive manner great vigilance exercise regard temperature entire economy, real financial parts. let u return, outlook, own, calm circumstances. low, stable inflation expectation cannot use situation argument favour retain monetary policy unchanged. it could possible expectation base general public assume riksbank act required. the fact inflation expectation remain stable could reflect expectation future monetary policy. if expectation fulfilled, inflation expectations, late rate price increase, rise. the example japan also show certain inflationary pressure visible cpi inflation; sometimes price pressure first see price consumer prices. if riksbank wait adjust repo rate inflation expectation inflation already increased, risk delay great. in type situation large interest rate adjustment may require riksbank act early stage. this bring current economic situation. however, first i would like take brief look back event occur connection act terrorism september. the riksbank’s action follow terrorist attack 11 september 2001 after terrorist attack usa, entire world shock realise something dreadful could happen. the executive board make assessment uncertainty cause act terrorism risk subdue demand internationally, mainly effect companies’ households’ confidence future, could result profound prolong economic downturn. this riksbank low interest rate, together central bank usa, rest europe several countries. 4 bi review 13/2002 prior terrorist attack usa 11 september, new statistic indicate global economic downturn could reach low level end 2001. however picture clear-cut. a result terrorist attacks, uncertainty increase even regard time scale recovery. if consumers’ confidence regard future decline, together rise unemployment weak development stock markets, great risk activity u economy would subdued. company often react uncertainty “wait see” policy, mean postpone investments. in addition, uncertainty whether financial system could cope problem arise result devastation new york. on top this, certain sector global economy would hit directly, instance, insurance companies, airlines, tourism, etc. all risk worsen economic downturn usa countries. the role central bank type situation contribute create confidence promote financial stability. it important act quickly resolutely. this may consider contradict claim important riksbank act predictably. however, observe central banks’ action occasion problem financial system arise confidence future declined, 1987 1998, surprise central bank act support economy low interest rate great supply liquidity. this counteract downward spiral global economy result decrease willingness take risks. interest rate reduction around world see insurance really poor outcome. it important remember sweden already expansive economic policy 11 september, low interest rate, weak krona expansive fiscal policy. give this, natural withdraw ‘insurance’ interest rate reduction confidence expectation stabilise risk severe negative spiral declined. the current economic situation so, say confidence return stabilised? to answer question, i would like describe see current economic situation. the fact willingness take risk increase see standard & poor’s credit spreads, return level prior terrorist attacks. in usa, swap spread fall since mid-september financial crisis occurred, however increase slightly since start year, probably enron scandal. in europe sweden, hand, swap spread continue fall low level prior 11 september. much statistic receive since begin december support picture international development paint december inflation report. the signal subdue effect demand decline level activity stabilise u economy become clearer. restrain factors, destocking adjustment investments, appear gradually abate strength. on hand, uncertainty development labour market, last imbalance save volatile stock market development comprise continue risk factor forecast. there also sign industrial sector many oecd country enter phase recovery. one particular risk factor development is, opinion, equity price push usa, give economic situation. at time, degree indebtedness private sector remain relatively low. the low real interest rate entail risk future development asset prices, particularly stock market. these risk need impend current situation, problem could become tangible couple years’ time. this mean risk economic policy, expansive order avoid strong downward spiral, would postpone adjustment imbalance economy. some parallel draw event take place crisis 1987, financial bubble recurred. a example asset bubble way back time happen usa 1927. at time, u central bank pursue expansive monetary policy order stabilise gold standard. this contribute over-valuation asset late crash 1929. if financial imbalance usa correct slowly near future, risk economic upturn short-lived downturn powerful correction finally made. bi review 13/2002 5 on hand, continue development usa depend whether domestic demand pick maintained. if growth productivity really reach bottom level around 1.5 per cent economic downturn, could sign long-term sustainable growth rate usa move upwards recovery merely temporary. look sweden, assess december inflation report gdp show weak growth 2001 would rise 2002 2003. the main feature picture pain inflation report still stand. however, accord national account first three quarter last year, development private consumption weak assumed. there statistic indicate gdp may strong 2001 show national accounts, instance, credit growth, money supply, tax payment development employment. regardless correct, appear relatively moderate slowdown 2001. industrial activity weak, balance expansive economic policy contribute sector swedish economy develop well. the question much slowdown industrial activity time spread part economy upturn industrial activity. for future see good development disposable income, recovery household wealth continue low oil prices, provide strong growth consumption year next year. the situation labour market give mix signals. open unemployment rise somewhat december 2001 january year. employment level second half last year, increase still 80,000 persons, 2000 2001. wage rise slightly high expect last year, despite weak economic activity. however, development labour market divide two parts. employment manufacture industry fall since begin last year, possible detect slowdown service sectors. similarly, number redundancy notice high manufacture industry. in public sector, healthcare welfare, notice redundancy number new vacancy register increased. the fact weak growth manufacture industry spread private public service sector probably due expansive economic policy. forward-looking economic indicators, confidence indicator household companies, imply downturn activity abate development begin stabilise. with regard prices, inflation increase slightly expect 2001. this partly explain unexpected price increase on, instance, fruit vegetables; price product group probably continue increase slightly expect short term. import inflation increase expect producer consumer areas, could due exchange rate’s effect price slightly high assumed. however, price increase also broad high expect good services. my view current situation so i ass situation find today? firstly, i feel confidence future willingness take risk appear recover shock 11 september. but happen inflation? there three reason inflation fall year. the first growth demand utilisation resource low expect last year, subdue price pressure near future. the second inflation expectation dispose towards decline inflation, accord recent surveys. and third krona appreciate slightly, mean low risk import inflation. on top this, effect last year’s price rise certain good services, include food energy, gradually abate. however, also risk price rise abate own. i see, unfortunately, couple reason inflation may remain high hop price increase might continue spread. firstly, half increase inflation rate could explain temporary effects. many price rise expected. this probably due resource utilisation economy relatively high demand sufficiently high enable implementation price increases. the fact competition weak certain sector probably reinforce this, facilitate pass cost consumers. a sign increase employment good. there adjustment downwards work hour rather number jobs. the division labour market, increase employment sector le expose competition mean wage rise expected. thank expansive fiscal monetary policy, 6 bi review 13/2002 unemployment expect rise marginally. a economic activity appear increase 2002, difficult imagine pressure labour market decline significantly. secondly, personal opinion possible inflation expectations, reflect acceptance price rises, may increased. i believe temporary price rise occur cloud view possible undertake price rise cover these. there report media, instance, importer long withstand cost increase cause weak exchange rate. mad cow disease foot mouth disease make u get use idea high meat prices. poor harvests, worm-eaten apples, etc. mean resistance high fruit vegetable price weak. the fact certain trade union representative also say medium may break wage agreement inflation remain high, indicate fully rely price stability maintained. the implicit inflation expectations, see price interest rate market, also show inflation expectation two year ahead rather high. it is, course, worry inflation high expected. the low repo rate 0.5 percentage point september partly contribute reduce uncertainty raise confidence future unusually uncertain situation. however, future prospect long uncertain economic slowdown appear final stages. there therefore long need large insurance severe decline. it important react quickly interest rate policy downside risks, equally important react quickly upside risks. a see minute executive board meet 7 february 2002, i enter reservation decision leave interest rate unchanged. i would rather see increase interest rate 0.25 percentage points, severe tighten policy, rather see step hard gas. bi review 13/2002 1 jean-pierre roth: the challenge international financial centre: swiss case speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, british-swiss chamber commerce, london, 26 february 2002. * * * it give great pleasure opportunity address distinguish assembly today. like swiss i know, i always enjoy come london. even though considerable difference two countries, many thing common. we proud history colourful traditions, cherish freedom independence. what’s more, countries, financial industry pillar economic strength recent times. but days, strike parallelism unite kingdom switzerland see monetary affairs. both country “outs”: belong euro-zone. in britain, currency still pound sterling and, switzerland, still preference franc. we thus face challenge: live next large currency area absorb foreign trade. this situation new us. it course swiss central bank governor speculate long situation last unite kingdom. but far i tell, good chance switzerland remain island middle euro-ocean year come! experience shows, however, monetary regime central issue existence development financial centre. neither uk, switzerland european monetary integration consider necessary sufficient condition successful financial centre. in today’s global competitive markets, success rely ever fundamental strength skills. switzerland financial centre since early 1990s, international financial markets, along entire bank sector, undergo profound changes. the drive force behind world-wide trend threefold: first, advance make process transmission information; second, trend towards liberalisation financial markets; and, third, grow increasingly diversify demand financial services. these development lead widen horizons, proliferation financial products, increase international competition. switzerland - thank long tradition openness world - well prepare face challenge global markets. but globalisation world-wide competition leave financial centre untouched. consolidation significantly alter structure swiss bank industry. during 90s, domestic merger acquisition reduce number bank 40 percent. nevertheless, despite clear tendency towards financial market concentration, switzerland remain country wide network small banks. beside two big banks, credit suisse group ubs ag, switzerland count 100 regional save banks, 24 cantonal banks, 17 private bank 140 subsidiary branch foreign banks. our bank sector extremely dense strong presence part country. the insurance sector second traditional leg financial centre. our insurance company strongly expand abroad. here also, open market intense competition lead consolidation large units. more 10 year global de-regulation leave deep last mark structure financial sector, also range activities. react change market environment stiff international competition, many bank place emphasis international business shift activity balance-sheet off-balance-sheet transactions. this true switzerland well. investment bank asset management gain importance, whereas le lucrative areas, domestically-oriented retail banking, lose part attractiveness. in case, expansion investment bank activity take form number acquisition foreign countries, tighten tie switzerland financial centres. 2 bi review 13/2002 the expansion asset management much domestically generated. asset management area switzerland traditionally strong. accord unofficial statistics, swiss bank entrust one third totality world’s asset manage bank country client domicile (so-called offshore wealth management), place well ahead competitors. indeed, asset management private bank strong segment swiss banking, term market shares, also measure revenues. for many observers, success bank asset management private bank explain existence switzerland’s bank secrecy. i think misunderstand mean feature. in case, would short-sighted believe financial centre could insure long-term development single factor. a successful strategy require strong fundamentals: competent dedicate workforce, reliable service products, efficient infrastructures. i doubt share view me. necessary characteristic successful financial centre how explain long-lasting development finance industry switzerland? it result public strategy industrial policy. instead combine outcome number factor point direction. a) an open-minded economy firstly, switzerland, traditionally open economy, well place benefit trade liberalisation financial deregulation. we use see economic performance constantly challenge directly dependent ability adjust change world environment. what true nestlé, novartis swatch - name - also valid banks: today’s competitive marketplace, fit survive, even become global player process. b) professional skill secondly, finance industry access pool well-educated, highly-skilled, multilingual, service-oriented worker familiar international financial markets. private bank long tradition switzerland, financial advisory service foreign client part swiss bank business generations, literally. c) efficient financial infrastructure thirdly, besides availability highly professional staff, outstanding efficiency switzerland’s financial infrastructure. i refer so-called “swiss value chain” comprise full set settlement payment systems, individual part harmonise optimum way. the entire facility consist trade platform, payment-against-delivery system, central payment system. a fourth component, central counterparty, currently developed. it might due long tradition watchmaking swiss develop skill build interconnect sophisticate settlement systems. in 1987, swiss national bank launch swiss interbank clear (sic), first rtgs system precursor many payment system around globe. shortly after, swiss exchange move traditional “à la criée” procedure electronic platform include automatic transfer securities. with virt-x, london, go one ambitious step further, create first international fully integrate electronic exchange. d) stable domestic environment fourthly, switzerland, stable political environment, also offer legal protection that, together trust, crucial bank business. furthermore, healthy social climate peaceful labour relation also contribute successful bank system. among element contribute favourable environment - indeed high list - i obviously also include financial stability strength currency. switzerland enjoy traditionally strong current account position. contrary popular belief, net capital bi review 13/2002 3 importer, massive exporter funds. with excess save investment, transfer capital rest world. our external surplus give bank important role channel fund strengthen international position. for long-term orient investor, moreover, know swiss franc keep purchase power maintain external value is, course, great importance, reflect positively onto entire swiss financial industry. in situation crises, security-conscious investor too, even short time horizons, demonstrate action swiss franc special merits. the fact swiss franc safe currency certainly make work swiss national bank easier. we nevertheless view continue existence independent currency, freely trade world markets, important asset switzerland general, financial sector particular. e) efficient supervision to sure, financial centre survive without credible guarantee soundness robustness. a know, financial institution different firms. due complex tie exist them, give institution money build trust, fragile element destabilise entire industry. they devastate effect players, include fundamentally healthy institutions. a prerequisite successful financial centre therefore strong bank supervisory authority. f) integrity all ingredient mention far important build block flourish financial centre. one forget, however, significant factor successful bank system assurance public, bank customer particular, honestly fairly treated. in short, without trust last successful financial centre. this wishful think part central banker. it obvious self-interest financial centre, lawmakers, supervisory authority private agent association set implement rule code conduct match high standards. with market globalisation free flow capital, real risk financial centre become involve illegal transaction will. i consider reputational risk major challenge face financial centre begin century. in switzerland long become conventional wisdom. know customer rule effectively implement constantly adapt evolve requirement market reality many years. swiss anti money launder rule regulation widely recognise expression state art. i shall come back thorny topic moment. challenge ahead what challenge ahead? a) market globalisation a i mention outset, bank sector go period heavy restructure past decade so. bank long amount simply accept save grant loans. business become increasingly complex dominate dwindle number ever-larger financial conglomerates. the trend toward concentration tendency toward onshore international bank observe country mine. the internationalisation bank business lead large bank establish major business unit outside home country. our bank create job outside country switzerland. obviously, global business first challenge face financial centre well authorities. a close co-operation supervisor essential. the trend toward financial conglomeration pose additional challenge bank industry: tendency towards “all-finance”. more provider offer bank services, type financial service well, notably insurance products. a single supplier offer specific advantage customer provider turn expect synergies, customer loyalty, low 4 bi review 13/2002 costs. it yet clear whether strategy commercial success, question heavily debate among specialists. what clear, however, financial conglomerate challenge supervisor well. today, bank insurance company often govern different law supervise different authorities. the absence consolidate supervision make difficult ass combine risk conglomerates. with creation financial service authority (fsa), unite kingdom take lead respect. the creation integrate financial supervisory authority also envisage switzerland major financial centres. a single authority could supervise banks, security dealers, investment funds, insurance companies, financial conglomerate portfolio managers. this integrate supervisory authority would also play key role fight money laundering. b) fight money launder financial crime i come naturally issue major importance financial centre today: fight money launder criminal money. any financial system - swiss system exception - misuse order transfer recycle money issue from, link illegal activities, include terrorism, drug trafficking, illicit trade weapons, modern slavery, corruption, name few. to sure, money launder risk already exist past. a result globalisation, however, grow significance organise crime, risk increase considerably recent years, country, every major financial centre. for reason, dense network legal regulations, control self-regulatory mechanism necessary order make financial centre unattractive possible criminal funds. switzerland one first country introduce strict anti-money launder laws. they cover activity banks, also financial intermediary insurance companies, fund managers, lawyer even fiduciaries. our experience far show efficient fight financial crime require two specific rules: first, application strict due diligence procedure include careful identification customers, i.e. beneficial owner asset involved; second, obligation, impose market intermediary inform authority case found suspicion money laundering. i fully convince effective fight money launder successful active co-operation financial institution authority promoted. in view, responsibility banker prevail automatic report transaction exceed certain amount. track criminal money even difficult identify money launder operations. the finance criminal activity require large amount ex ante identity criminal source pertinent information. furthermore, fund use finance terrorism, unlike case money laundering, often legally acquired. it therefore crucial financial intermediary bank non-banking sector thoroughly verify client relationship order identify suspicious circumstances. in connection, strict observation “know-your-customer” principle key importance. switzerland hesitate offer international co-operation judicial matter block incriminate assets. follow decision unite nation apply sanction taliban regime 1999 2000, block certain number afghan bank account freeze asset belong person list sanction committee unite nations. to date, 76 account freeze total 42 million swiss francs. in unite kingdom switzerland, authority bank fully aware utmost importance successfully ward criminal funds. we realise money launder morally unacceptable, also clearly undermine public’s confidence financial centre. unfortunately identify money launder criminal money, easy task, criminal element short imagination, continuously invent new scheme deceive bank authorities. although switzerland forefront fight money laundering, swiss financial centre also suffer number mishaps, especially involve politically expose figures. the experience make elsewhere: london city well bi review 13/2002 5 centre misuse similarly even great extent undesirable clients. these case stress need relentless vigilance. c) political integration fiscal harmonisation let come another issue great importance us: movement toward tax harmonisation europe. you easily imagine switzerland, island within eu, close economic tie single market. about 80% import come eu, absorb 60% exports. after unite states, switzerland eu’s second large trade partner firm among important investor eu (for instance, second large uk). a non-eu member, seek co-operation basis bilateral agreements. a first round agreement implement spring. a second round negotiation begin shortly. it cover one issue major importance financial centre: taxation save income. switzerland directly affect eu’s intention introduce system automatic exchange information bank tax authority order enhance tax revenue save income within european union. one course fear plan might trigger capital transfer non-eu financial centre purely fiscal reasons. our position known: want swiss financial centre become privilege fund seek avoid eu regulations. we thus ready consider reform withhold tax regime along line eu directive. we even consider possibility hand eu part tax interest earn eu residents. we already 50 year positive experience withhold tax: convenient efficient way collect resource without income declaration. we never consider introduce system automatic exchange fiscal information citizens, ready consider scheme foreign depositors. we feel current system secure appropriate balance protection private sphere safeguard interest state. there many misunderstand switzerland uk fiscal issue. let recall points: – first, wrong say foreigner invest fund tax-free swiss banks. we 35% withhold tax impose interest dividend payment make favour resident non-residents. – second, avoid loophole basically due international failure apply debtor principle withhold taxation, ready reshape system line eu directive, i.e. apply payment agent principle withhold taxation whenever client swiss bank fiscally domicile eu. – third, must forgotten, switzerland grant full judicial co-operation fight tax fraud. thus, position fair. with measure - fiscally equivalent exchange information - switzerland cannot accuse fiscal paradise attract foreign money like offshore centre. with capital extremely mobile internationally, evident coordinate taxation policy make sense cover main financial centres. the eu regulation implement member countries, also many dependent associate territories. furthermore, crucial europe similar measure take world-wide basis. without fully watertight solution, offshore centre around globe expand business expense europe increase lack transparency high global risks. one last point fiscal harmonisation. i live country count nearly three thousand different tax regimes. in switzerland, every town, every canton and, course, federal government, authority levy tax set rates. it part function internal democracy decentralise political system. we firmly believe benefit tax competition, manage keep tax rate relatively low. we regret international level, mention “tax competition” almost always precede term “harmful”. this clearly reveal preconception bias judgement. 6 bi review 13/2002 d) financial privacy with tax harmonisation, bank secrecy centre discussion. allow add word subject. early on, i mention bank secrecy - perhaps call financial privacy - one necessary feature successful financial centre, i believe that, per se, not. what important, though, i emphasise earlier, trust professionalism. bank secrecy prohibition banker staff divulge privilege information regard client third parties. the beneficiary bank secrecy client, bank. financial privacy part swiss legal structure. in country, like here, individual freedom protection private sphere highly value deeply respected. in switzerland, privacy rule limit bank sector, apply equal vigour profession doctors, lawyers, solicitor clergy. the respect one’s private sphere long tradition. like yours, country base high value attribute individual democracy. our state bottom - rather top - construction. we trust citizen - often call vote important matters, include relate taxes. we trust keep army rifle, full round ammunition, home. we trust citizen file tax forms, trust undertake financial transactions. sure, occasional abuses, prosecute determination full extent law. we believe, however, case use justify switch system big brother breathe neck. swiss people would comprehend - indeed would support - initiative aim throw financial privacy principle simply dishonest people take advantage them, would accept give medical secrecy case health insurance fraud. nor could swiss understand - accept - foreign client bank treat differently, i.e. without amount due trust respect. but - important - bank secrecy absolute. it simply true swiss bank maintain secret number account whose holder know anyone. swiss bank hold so-called number accounts, restrict circle person within bank must - law - know name person(s), i.e. beneficial owner(s) behind every account. in regard, “know customer rule” essential. bank secrecy routinely lift case criminal investigation swiss judicial authority earn high mark extent co-operation international criminal affairs, include involve politically expose persons. these fact mean country especially attractive criminal money. they rather show bank secrecy rule obstacle efficient determine action criminal activities. let u frank: fact financial centre rarely even never register case suspicious transaction certainly proof integrity rather lack it. conclusion today, find many financial centre around globe. they benefit easy communication high capital mobility. some long history bank activities, others recently expanded, often give foreign investor special legal fiscal treatment. with customer world, switzerland much offshore centre london significant financial centre. we provide special advantage foreign investors. our financial centre build wide range comparative advantages: financially sound country, stable political monetary framework, long tradition bank internationally orient economy. all point also valid unite kingdom. there major difference term specialization, however: city “the” market place investment bank number financial activity europe, whereas switzerland play dominant role asset management. despite different reality market positions, switzerland unite kingdom share many common value vis-à-vis financial centre: – country believe financial activity require professionalism, high standard efficient supervision; bi review 13/2002 7 – country consider money launder finance criminal activity major threat long term development financial system act decisively them; – country favour market competition general liberal attitude toward tax competition particular; – country reluctant accept over-regulation see mushroom offshore centre source risk global financial system. i come therefore conclusion converge interest rivalry financial centres. some diverge view due misunderstandings. with tradition experience asset management, switzerland attache great value financial privacy. but, i show you, protection financial privacy obstacle efficient fight money launder finance terrorism, hamper fair tax competition neighbour withhold tax implement along line eu directive. both disclosure certain information relate bank client protection privacy financial sphere arise fundamental ethical conviction worth protecting. i confident frank dialogue mutual effort understand other’s position, common value swiss british financial centre come forefront. in particular, predominant joint interest see demand standard set financial industry become world-wide accept rules. the long history financial centre large experience bank industry give u natural leadership role respect. 1edward m gramlich: consumption wealth effect: the unite state unite kingdom speech mr edward m. gramlich, member board governor u federal reserve system, international bond congress, london, u.k., 20 february 2002. * * * besides share common history, language, legal structure, unite state unite kingdom something else common. in past years, country experience significant wealth effect--so significant understand wealth effect become important aspect conduct monetary policy. in unite states, average ratio household wealth disposable income 4.5 1970 1995. over next five years, fuel modest boom real estate value huge boom equity values, wealth-income ratio shoot 6, high record value fifty year wealth data available. since 2000, equity price moderated, wealth-income ratio still 5. perhaps that, consumption remain strong throughout downturn 2001. the experience remarkably similar unite kingdom. here wealth-income ratio average 4.75 past thirty years, moderate boom house price huge boom equity value late 1990s take ratio 6.5 mid-2000. again, wealth-income ratio fall since time, consumption spend strong throughout 2000-01. with number like this, make sense probe wealth effect deeply. i begin summarize empirical evidence wealth effect, unite state unite kingdom, i move theoretical quandaries. get theoretical quandary sound like bad idea wrap-up speech, i try persuade quandary indeed puzzling--and also fundamental. empirical evidence household wealth spend at aggregate level, effect wealth consumption mainstay large-scale econometric model least thirty years. the econometric model u.s. economy use federal reserve include wealth effect time, one suggest additional dollar household wealth leads, time, permanent rise household consumption three five cents. a basic question whether households' net worth summarize information balance sheet useful predict spending. doe decomposition net worth various asset liability category improve forecast household spending? for variety reasons, question prove difficult answer: some researcher find separate liability asset help explain variation consumption time; others not. the current version fed's model us two category wealth: equity wealth wealth, latter encompass house wealth also value noncorporate business net financial assets. the estimate marginal propensity consume two wealth aggregate virtually indistinguishable. but always case. a model evolved, estimate marginal propensity consume non-stock-market wealth vary substantially relative marginal propensity consume stock market wealth. the bank england's model consumption expenditure also incorporate significant effect household wealth. accord bank's model, 10 percent increase real net financial wealth boost consumer spend 0.7 percent long run, similar rise real gross house wealth boost spend 0.5 percent long run. convert penny pound present levels, effective net worth coefficient consumption 1.5 penny per pound net worth increase house 2 penny per pound financial wealth. unfortunately, relatively little know household behavior underlie time-series relationship aggregate data. until recently, economist able marshal little formal evidence observe relationship aggregate spend aggregate wealth could trace change spend household actually experience wealth gains. but gap understand filled, least equity wealth unite states. several recent papers--including economist federal reserve board--have document microeconomic relationship correspond relationship long observe aggregate data. for example, one study analyze response individual household change stock market wealth find that, 1983-99, spend u.s. household own stock respond movement stock market, whereas spend non-holders stock apparent link stock prices.1 a second study estimate that, second half 1990s, u.s. household top income quintile household attain college education show large consumption increase households, also disproportionate increase consumption compare disposable income. this consistent fact household own stock experience large gain wealth.2 but yet, microeconomic evidence link house wealth consumption much limited. the predict effect wealth consumption put test unite state past half-decade, pass test easily. between early 1995 early 2000, wilshire 5000 stock-price index (a broad measure equity price unite states) tripled, nearly $12 trillion add wealth u.s. households. over period, save drop 6-1/2 percent disposable income roughly 1 percent. the magnitude decline consistent run-up equity price marginal propensity consume equity wealth build fed's model. since peak equity values, wilshire 5000 drop one-third, correspond loss wealth roughly $6 trillion. the personal save rate yet turn substantially, i would read much fact: previous stock-market gain probably still support spend end 2000, low save rate could rationalize recession surge motor vehicle sale spur generous finance offers. the u.s. experience past year provide equivalent test effect house wealth consumption, movement house price limit strike swing equity prices. between early 1995 late last year, value residential real estate unite state increase 65 percent--a substantial rise. but gain house price fairly steady, make isolate effect household spend difficult. in first quarter 1995, house wealth equal roughly 1.4 time after-tax income, third quarter 2001 ratio increase 1.6 without ever move outside fairly narrow range. in contrast, ratio equity wealth after-tax income soar 1.1 early 1995 2.6 early 2000 subside 1.5 third quarter last year. development unite kingdom period consistent u.s. experience. british households' equity wealth increase ¢g880 billion (thousand million) 1995 2000--a gain excess 50 percent--while house wealth rise ¢g650 billion. at time, household save fell 10 percent income 1995 around 4 percent early 2000. a unite states, equity price unite kingdom fall sharply since 2000. the ftse 350 index stand almost 25 percent peak september 2000, techmark 100 index fall around 75 percent since peak. the save rate appear increase much period, part house price continue rise double-digit annual rate part lag effect past wealth increases. these explanations, correct, could similar unite states. 1 karen e. dynan dean m. maki, "does stock market wealth matter consumption?" finance economics discussion series, 2001-23 (board governor federal reserve system, may 2001). 2 dean m. maki michael g. palumbo, "disentangling wealth effect: a cohort analysis household save 1990s," finance economics discussion series, 2001-21 (board governor federal reserve system, april 2001). 3to sure, every analysis link household wealth spend come conclusion study i mentioned. on balance, however, link aggregate household wealth spend remain one sturdy empirical relationship macroeconomics. the link stock-market wealth consumption give sturdiness empirical relationship, may bad form question theoretical basis; let anyway. first, equity side, value equity change two reasons: market participant adopt new view future profit market participant apply different set discount factor expect profits, discount factor incorporate risk-free interest rate equity premiums. barry bosworth, robert hall, others point that, theoretical standpoint, stock-price movement different effect household spend depend whether derive change expect profit change discount rates. suppose, example, stock price increase rise expect profits, say spurt productivity. an individual household own stock high wealth want consume more, predict wealth effect. for economy whole, story complicate additional aggregate demand likely push interest rate limit rise stock prices. both productivity spurt induce rise interest rate affect desire investment, international capital flows, trade balance. suppose, instead, stock price increase household apply low discount rate future profits. whether individual household want consume unclear case. intuitively, household simply discount stream profit different rate; obvious truly good increase consumption. at technical level, increase wealth might--taken alone--encourage great consumption, household spend also influence familiar income substitution effect induce change discount rate. this second case far complicate first one consider evolution economy whole. the discount rate profits--the sum risk-free interest rate equity premium--depends feature economy. hence, discount rate changed, aspect economy must change well--and change may effect consumption separate effect change stock prices. among myriad possibility area, i mention two. one household investor may reassess riskiness future profits. another tax may altered, move different fiscal policy would change risk-free interest rate. implement complicate theoretical relationship empirical model challenging. because interaction stock-market wealth consumption depend many feature economy, would need model household sector rest economy well. in addition, households' expectation future income, profits, rate return play critical role analysis, model expectation especially difficult. to summarize result equities, three main lessons: at least theory, change stock price different effect consumption depend origin. change expect profit change discount rate generally occur independently economy whole although, course, may individual firms. thus, think profit discount rate separate influence stock price may mislead one consider economywide changes. capture true complexity relationship stock-market wealth consumption extremely difficult exist data empirical techniques. a many area empirical economics, currently must satisfy model capture broad pattern data. the link house wealth consumption the task get easy turn relationship house wealth consumption. because house asset similar corporate capital, much previous discussion stock market wealth apply house wealth well. thus, change house price occur different reason may also different effect consumption. nonetheless, make sense think house specifically. suppose house price increase relative price good service individual become patient reduce discount rate future house services. those intend live house forever would high wealth, would additional resource increase consumption real house service good services. yet, i note earlier, study base aggregate time-series data find change house wealth affect real consumption. so miss simple story? one factor house sometimes appreciate expect house service house rise. for example, population growth immigration may push value land close major cities. we interpret increase house wealth reflect great house service offer proximity populous urban areas. in scenario, homeowner would truly good off, live house forever would consume additional real house services. however, household would still resource increase consumption goods, unless could sell house borrow house equity. this simple example become complicate consider homeowner intend live current house forever. instead, many homeowner expect move small houses, condominiums, retirement community get older. these so-called "downsizers" clearly good house price increase relative prices, expect increase consumption nonhousing good services. at time, however, many individual currently home plan purchase homes, many small home plan trade large home future. these so-called upsizers may respond increase house price reduce consumption good services. to evaluate effect house wealth aggregate consumption, one must determine relative magnitude oppose responses. economic theory suggest downsizers may generally high marginal propensity consume house form wealth upsizers, would give consumption positive impetus house-price increases. for example, downsizers tend old upsizers, distribute change lifetime consumption across few years. moreover, upsizers may liquidity constrained. if would like consume cannot unsecured borrow difficult, least modest increase house price reduce consumption. at time, upsizers save downpayment may relatively short plan horizon. in end, determine relative consumption response house upsizers downsizers become empirical question. a third factor link house wealth consumption effect realize capital gains, accrue either sell one's house borrow home equity loan. a chairman greenspan noted, accumulate home equity liquid asset. in addition, value somewhat uncertain, although general trend real estate price easily observed. sell house, get one's house appraise take home equity loan, convert illiquid home equity uncertain value liquid fund know value. this conversion could also induce add consumption, especially consumer liquidity constrained. conclusion there little empirical doubt stock-market wealth house wealth influence consumption macroeconomy. nevertheless, understand empirical relationship theoretical underpinnings relationship remain incomplete. substantial progress made, hope future research help untangle remain puzzles. this research agenda important advancement economic understand conduct monetary policy. a know, federal reserve bank england long-run goal price stability sustainable growth. to achieve goals, central bank take active interest factor affect economic performance, include business consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, foreign exchange value dollar, fiscal policy, on. the experience past years--in unite state unite kingdom--has emphasize effect wealth consumption important place list. bi review 21/2002 1 tan sri dato' dr

mumbai financial capital major centre gold market india, direction gold policy continue rightly decide government india (goi) new delhi close consultation reserve bank india (rbi). though association conference trace wgc conference 1996, association gold policy india management gold reserve rbi go back 1991. in capacity other, i happen participate almost legislative, policy procedural change relate gold policy ministry finance rbi decade. in recent years, i benefit excellent advice stand committee gold precious metal rbi participation ministry finance commerce goi. i find gathering, outstanding experience world gold markets, hence initial narration recent global development would brief focus official sector. however, i recall detail, recent development regard gold market gold policy india second part. the third part capture aspect viz., consideration risk return investment gold india; result recent research gold market consideration proposal relate gold. the fourth part review india’s experience gold policy help set parameter medium-term gold policy. the conclude part briefly explore future direction gold policy market india. recent global developments: focus official sector accord available data public domain, event last decade international bullion market dominate official sector mainly central banks, especially sale leasing, consequential impact gold prices. on supply side, mine production first 5 year almost flat, latter half decade, gradually go up. official sector sale record substantial increase amount 450 500 tonne year 2000. addition supply hedge range low 100 high 500 tonne year. mining, official sector sale lease together provide reasonable liquidity market. a regard demand, data indicate 1995, annual demand account jewellery fabrication order 2,600 tonne zoom 30 per cent 1997, last 3 years, average 3,150 tonnes. the important factor supply demand side mine production demand jewellery fabrication remain flat 1988-2000 average 2,550 3,250 tonnes, respectively. yet, abundant liquidity. flat demand decline price addition institutional developments, may much change attitude central bankers, particularly europe. the official sector sales, amount 130 tonne 1994, progressively go record 470 tonne 2,000. more importantly, official sector leasing, 1,000 tonne 1991 go 4,800 tonnes, add liquidity ample measure impact prices. low inflation soft interest rate recent year bring great sensitivity among central bank regard return portfolios. the steady decline gold price recent year background low inflation raise doubt quarters, importance gold safe investment hedge inflation. some central bank resort load substantial quantity gold, hold reserves. another significant development 1990s spurt central bank lend precious metal. central bank lend idle stock view enhance return 2 bi review 21/2002 reserves, bring good liquidity market bridge gap supply demand. a notable development regard sign washington agreement central bank september 1999, place effective cap operation central banks. a result clear trend emerge recent year increase amount central banks’ sale well lending, official sector’s hold percentage total above-ground stock fell 30 per cent 1996 23 per cent 2000. the central bank across world hold 33,000 tonne end 2000 compare 36,000 tonne begin 1991, reflect substantial sale many european central banks. the reserve bank india (rbi) hold 357.75 tonne gold form 6 per cent current value total forex exchange reserves. our reserve management regard gold term passive conservative rbi sell gold trade gold. recent development india wgc estimate annual indian demand precious metal recent year excess 800 tonnes. most appear mean jewellery fabrication, rest, estimate 10 15 percent, possibly mean meet demand account investment industrial processes. a major step development gold market india authorization july 1997 rbi commercial bank import gold sale loan jeweller exporters. initially, 7 bank select purpose basis certain specify criterion like minimum capital adequacy, profitability, risk management expertise, previous experience area, etc. the number bank late go upto 18. on review, since five bank evince adequate interest business term activity, rbi find appropriate renew licence purpose. at present, 13 bank active import gold. the quantum gold import bank range 500 tonne per year. import gold bank authorise rbi succeed large extent curb illegal operation gold foreign exchange markets. it also result reduce disparity international domestic price gold 57 per cent 1986 1991 8.5 per cent 2001. the import duty gold, rs.220 per ten gram upto january 1999, increase rs.400 per ten grams, effect april 2001 reduce rs.250 per ten grams. the estimate duty realise gold import indicate annual amount vary rs. 1,000 rs. 2,000 crore per annum since 1997. even though country consume 800 tonne metal every year, system assay hallmarking gain desire importance. the low quality gold jewellery sell country resultant loss incur consumer recognize now. recent survey conduct bureau indian standard (bis) jointly central consumer protection council 5 major city reveal 80 per cent jewellery sell market low purity claim charge for. in cases, gold article sell 38.6 per cent short purity monetary terms. the low purity result loss around 16 per cent gold jewellery. in recent past, rbi actively pursue issue upgrade quality trade product system assay hallmarking government india bis. the major objective introduce proper assay hallmarking system country enable consumer protection, develop export competitiveness gold jewellery industry, introduce gold base financial products, help mop vast dormant gold resource domestic sector develop india lead gold market centre world. ministry commerce hold meet trade representative 1997. base view emerge consultations, bi formulate scheme hall mark 1998, voluntary certification scheme, combination quality certification bi laboratory recognition schemes. the bis-recognised laboratory would affix/stamp/hall mark jewellery manufacture bi certify jeweller bi turn would maintain require surveillance. a culmination effort concerned, bi launch scheme hallmarking april 2000 bi act, 1986. under scheme, 12 firm jeweller certify bi review 21/2002 3 assay hallmarking centre far. consumer awareness campaign highlight advantage go hallmarking jewellery conduct bis. the government india announce gold deposit scheme 1999 rbi issue guideline bank intend launch scheme october 1999. five bank launch scheme guideline quantum gold mobilise far 7 tonnes. unfortunately, scheme evoke expect response. a number reason cite low response, prominent among depositors’ lose make charge spend jewellery (as bank would convert primary form accept deposits), low caratage jewellery, low rate return deposit (as see depositors) absence amnesty. some aspect gold market india risk return gold investment the return investment gold may compare return investment government bond indian markets. illustratively, gold purchase end-february 1996 sell end-february 2002 prevail rate local bullion market, average annualised return would work negative. on contrary, investment liquid risk-free government security date would fetch comfortable positive return, case capital gain mark market also take account, annualised average return could high 15 per cent. recent research gold market a drg study (gold mobilisation instrument external adjustment) prepare rbi 1992, test five factor influence demand gold: are, generation large market surplus rural area result round increase agricultural production, unaccounted income/wealth generate mainly service sector, comparative rate return available alternative financial asset like bank deposits, unit uti, small save scheme etc., price variation gold price commodities. the study lead conclusion first two factor i.e. rural surplus unaccounted income service sector far influence gold demand factors. in another analysis make shri vaidyanathan 1999, (economic political weekly, february 20, 1999) factor determine demand gold studied. the parameter take account gdp, ratio household financial save national product, domestic price gold, gdp deflator, index ordinary share price difference domestic foreign price gold percentage international prices. the study establish gold import tend high domestic gold price rise relative ordinary share international gold prices; but, effect two variable pronounce 1991-96 compare 1970-90. dr. saumitra chaudhuri (financial express, november 26, 2001) make analysis possible choice saver interest bear financial instrument gold. he advocate indian conditions, return le 6 per cent save instrument would induce saver invest gold. mr. n.a. mazumdar, many articles, hold view capital starve country like india cannot afford utilize foreign exchange commodity like gold. he hold opinion consequence gold liberalization policy could alarming, especially view fact import gold unrelated india’s export jewellery. some proposal relate gold a proposal make set gold index fund mobilise gold collection centre major cities, swap gold u dollar invest u dollar fund corporate debt high yield off-shore investments. the average return envisage 20 per cent depositors. rbi’s view off-shore high yield investment contemplate would risky institution mobilise gold risk may able service gold deposit 4 bi review 21/2002 customer without loss itself. it also felt financial institution without adequate branch network may succeed mobilisation adequate quantity gold. proposal certain bank launch gold accumulation plan certificate consider stand committee gold precious metals. however, pursue view poor response gold deposit scheme. another proposal relate issue gold bond 5-year tenure liquidity provide international investment company. this scheme design enable high yield pick-up country’s gold reserves. the proposal pursue since may appropriate lock gold long tenor 5 years, bond issue first time institution. yet another proposal substitute gold import borrow gold lease long-term basis also pose decide proposal practical huge quantity gold available lease long term basis, apart fact lease amount borrow gold attendant foreign currency risk well gold price risk. proposal location swap gold stock rbi’s reserve bullion bank institutional swap (swapping gold gold import authorize banks) also make mean enhance quality gold internationally acceptable standards, pursue view passive approach policy. gold policy: review experience our experience various policy measure may review term gold control, prohibition gold imports, gold sales, gold mobilisation liberalise gold policy. the evolution gold control policy since independence center around major objectives, viz., wean away people gold, regulate supply gold, reduce domestic demand price curb smuggling. in wake chinese war, felt circle would feasible make frontal attack demand gold india. accordingly, gold control order 1962 issued, ban make sell jewellery 14 carats, make compulsory gold smith license submit account gold receive utilise etc., the measure meet lot resistance criticism. this couple administrative complexity result failure gold control order. bullion import export also ban restriction import gold country result flourish smuggle unofficial transaction foreign exchange. official import discourage smuggle first moot 1977 view forex reserve available then, think impossible proposition. the government decide sell confiscate gold small quantity rbi. however, major impact smuggling. various scheme mobilisation idle gold hold implement government rbi past, little success. the 15-year gold bond 6 1/2 per cent (november 1962) could mobilise 16.70 tonnes. a second attempt garner gold make 7 per cent gold bond 1980 scheme (march 1965) could mobilise 6.1 tonnes. the third series designate national defence gold bond 1980 (1965) garner 13.7 tonne gold bond scheme 1993 garner 41 tonne gold. even two year launch scheme recent gold deposit scheme (1997) mobilization around seven tonne only. thus, attempt mobilise gold various scheme evoke desire response. currently, gold import permit three official channel viz., special import licences, non-resident indian authorize bank institutions. import gold special import licence (sil) negligible gold import bank permitted. it natural nri route become le attractive bank permit import gold. the liberalize gold policy certainly bring official sector originally unofficial sector. without doubt, eliminate illegal transaction profiteer illegal transaction attendant socio-economic impact large scale high value market involve cross-border operations. at level manage external sector forex markets, elimination large unofficial market forex improve policy effectiveness. it may also note indian consumer gold spar huge transaction cost amount thousand crore rupee account existence unofficial sector past. further, duty realization significant time realization custom duty commodity come down. bi review 21/2002 5 however, argue ban gold import re-imposed, others argue duty hike assumption measure would curb total import bill account gold. past experience seem favour negative view. in regard, another view hold gold import export totally freed, argument ignore fact gold characteristic currency. parameter medium-term policy in light experience gain global trend gold market, particularly recent trend gold policy gold market india, possible suggest five broad parameter could govern medium-term policy regard gold. a positive approach gold appear demonstrably le disruptive consistent socio-economic condition country negative approach gold, amply demonstrate ineffectiveness well disruptive nature control framework past. the response measure aim discourage utilisation possession scheme gold mobilisation gold deposit also worked. a positive approach significantly reduce transaction cost evident, example, reduction difference price world market indian gold market liberalisation. a mention earlier, liberalize policy add comfort public finance management external sector. further, non-positive attitude towards use gold presumption expenditure productive non-productive would inconsistent liberalise framework economic management. thus, would inconsistent allow consumption luxury item perfume imports, gold. moreover, unlike tobacco extent liquor, gold adverse impact health, environment family life. in words, would proper make judgement desirability productive nature gold consumption weave policy around value load judgement. it would appropriate ass indian reality implication large preference hold gold take appropriate policy measures. on basis assessment, positive approach several dimension viz. macro policy, financial markets, external sector protection consumer interest. in term macro policy, objective reduce recourse gold would automatically serve long run economic development, though immediate effect increase prosperity could preference investment gold. spread literacy, particularly female literacy, could also help reduce preference gold. above all, availability easy access different form financial save extensive scale, particularly women, protect traditional “streedhan” may prove viable policy option encourage non-gold form savings. of particular relevance monetary authorities, price stability reasonably low stable interest rate medium-term, likely contribute reduce preference recourse gold form save well investment. a regard role gold financial markets, policy recognise indian gold market always link international gold market view large requirement import gold. recognition integration inevitable reality take appropriate institutional measures, would reduce transaction cost impart stability indian gold market. further, gold virtually insulate local financial market term finance gold gold transaction bank sector. gold-linked financial instrument prevalent indian market forward market gold virtually prohibited. give inevitable integration global local gold markets, considerable merit follow global practice integration gold market financial markets. the role bank context gold market already recognised, bank play role essentially canalise agencies. while risk free approach defensible prudential angle, bank could fund financial instrument without take risk balance sheet, thus improve efficiency gold-linked financial markets. in respect external sector, liberalisation import gold help removal non-official transaction significant degree. however, export gold jewellery still somewhat insulate domestic market. the economic opportunity considerable liberalisation export could consider appropriate. special treatment gold export long consistent positive approach gold policy couple vibrant role gold external trade. 6 bi review 21/2002 finally, study show consumer average would pay rs. 8,000 crore extra year virtue questionable quality gold sell them. in particular, rural middle class woman specially vulnerable low quality gold. special consumer protection measure - educational legal appropriate enforcement consumer protection act - make positive contribution protection consumer improvement industry. future direction the broad parameter medium-term policy would suggest several action future. it may appropriate consider discussion debate parameter policy indicated. however, illustrative basis, possible identify broad area future direction regard. first, may scope rationalisation policy relate import gold. experience show select large institutions, particularly banks, contribute effectively efficient import gold. however, hangover past, number facility available nri individual import gold. there considerable merit review policy view remove individual-based special facilities. when gold import nris, may easy track origin destination, hence make vulnerable misuse. prohibit import may also consistent initiative prevention money laundering, since unlike bank system, transaction easily traceable. similarly, import gold special import licence may need review. at time, consistent positive approach gold, current restriction import gold part personal baggage return indian could reviewed. gold may treat differently commodity respect eligibility personal baggage within allowance levy standard duty import excess permissible limit par goods. second, regard exports, consistent positive approach, possible remove special restriction gold jewellery export-oriented unit treat like units. mechanism custom bond etc. may long necessary, purchase gold document export proceed realise fully documented. the

joint central bank research conference risk measurement systemic risk, basel, 8 march 2002. * * * introduction i delight opportunity meet distinguish group expert former colleague come together basel study issue relate financial stability. i would like share thoughts, inspire two recent case enron argentina, respectively largest-ever corporate sovereign default remember. like many observers, i try identify whether two case raise fundamental question concern function financial system interplay market force public authorities. i start career central banker 35 year ago, public intervention economy, particularly financial sphere, pervasive. almost business activity bank require specific authorisation, many action simply forbidden. market participant little room free innovative action. it take long time pendulum ideas, economic reality policy move towards market forces. public intervention gradually scale back, excessively wide scope narrow one, carefully target market failures. this long shift – accidentally coincide span professional life, action conviction fully adhere – produce extraordinarily large efficiency gain economy greatly benefited. enron argentina undoubtedly look various angles, time clarify lesson learn two cases. one question ask today is: enron argentina indicate pendulum may far swing back again, two extreme pervasive public intervention complete laissez-faire? be time reconsider – historical perspective – public intervention need best support orderly function financial markets? without pretend provide full answer questions, let offer thoughts. risk financial sector i start two observation origin propagation risks. first, although increase complexity financial system render difficult identify origin risks, never forget threat financial stability stems, fundamentally, real sector. it real sector event occur ultimately cause gain loss financial field. such event may unexpected disruption particular market, price shock, sharp change technology, deterioration macroeconomic condition policy decision government. manage risk associate uncertainty risk real sector core financial intermediation. second, propagation risk. the way risk spread within financial system vary time relation several factors, include market regulatory developments. enron argentina highlight importance two aspect characterise risk propagation today: first, grow use complex financial instrument assume transfer risk and, second, abrupt change international capital movements. a first, evidence suggest market credit risk transfer instrument quite concentrated, term dealer ultimate risk-takers. a second, lack data many important player global financial system leaf u relatively uninformed possible source destabilise capital movements. enron: failure deliver transparency let move enron case. there seem broad consensus incident point truly illegal action infringement ethical code conduct, also ineffective market discipline exercise enron’s equity debt-holders, due lack adequate transparency. enron 2 bi review 20/2002 owe much initial success deregulation, gas electricity sector variety areas. it publicly perceive highly successful company. only company approach bankruptcy market analyst react shareholder creditor become aware vulnerabilities. only attention focus risk entail extensive off-balance sheet transactions. inadequate account rule partly responsible failure uncover highly risky operation inadequate disclosure complex off-balance-sheet transactions. the extensive parallel consult business enron auditor entertain also blame. we process draw many lesson regard public policy require ensure smooth operation market discipline, also utmost importance function financial system. of lessons, three – opinion – stand crucial. first, timely recall paul volcker’s proposal june last year call international initiative update account standard adequately deal complexity derivative financial instruments. we utmost ensure enron affair serf powerful incentive speed effort field. second, case highlight question adequate oversight financial activity undertake non-financial corporations. despite main dealer, market-maker, liquidity provider important area energy derivative markets, enron required, either regulator market practice, disclose information counterparties, set aside capital trade risks. the absence mechanism prevent early detection problem might even create incentive imprudent risk-taking. finally, case suggest system sufficiently alert possible conflict interest. the combination audit consult enron case one example. such conflict arise whenever financial institution provide corporate finance similar service specific client issue security financial institution invest fund clients. all all, three issue give cause concern also deserve careful consideration public authorities. my feel that, player enron control regulators, tight market control exercise analysts, accountants, shareholder lend banks. if endogenous controller fail alert, sanction form monetary loss regulatory constraints. argentina: hands-off approach couple official sector weakness let turn argentina. here, lesson international macro-economic level. not long ago, argentina focus attention, though different reason now. in early 1990s, “neo-liberal” economic reform implemented; hyperinflation bring halt; economy progressively deregulate privatised. a macro-economic stability achieved, foreign capital pour economy growth quickly resumed. in continent emerge debt crisis 1980s success story tell, argentina’s experience economic paradigm positive much 1990s, grow average rate nearly 5 per cent 1991 1998. this period mark series external shocks, argentina’s currency board successfully overcame, namely, “tequila” crisis 1995, east asian crisis 1997, devaluation russian rouble 1998. but cost-free: absence use exchange rate shock absorber, burden adjustment economy currency board agreement necessarily fall wage prices. in case argentina, rigidity hard peg come forefront wake series external shock early 1999 – notably high cost finance emerge markets, sharp devaluation brazilian real, rapidly appreciate u dollar, fall commodity prices. the straitjacket impose currency board cast doubt argentina’s medium-term economic performance concern ability service refinance debt compound relative fiscal laxity previous years. a credibility currency board come increase pressure, country require policy adjustment also sustain sign support official sector. yet argentina’s misfortune that, need official finance increasing, opinion multilateral agency act face emerge market crisis change – particular, regard need engage private creditor (particularly bondholders) resolution debt problems. the last imf bi review 20/2002 3 package support argentina (september 2001), example, contain specific provision end. in subsequent months, fund official publicly encourage argentinean authority reach agreement private sector agent debt-exchange operations. and december 2001, fund suspend loan programme country. while private sector involvement crisis resolution welcome, one may wonder sole instrument deal circumstances. many feel official sector rather unkind argentina. after all, macroeconomic indicator – particularly fiscal accounts, main source concern – broadly (or better) country receive large imf fund recent years, turkey brazil. argentina’s central government debt 2001 le 55 per cent gdp, government deficit (including provinces) amount le 6 per cent gdp year. in contrast, turkey post 57.4 per cent debt-to-gdp ratio government deficit 11.6 per cent gdp 2000, right currency bank crises. brazil government deficit 7.9 per cent external debt-to-gdp ratio 30 per cent 1998. the international community relieve economic financial contagion spread argentina economy region, notably mexico brazil. yet i cannot wonder mexico brazil would today, argentine-style “hands-off” approach follow back 1995 1999 respectively. in many ways, present robustness two country testament – much criticise – support receive official sector. conclusion let conclude. be address enron argentina jointly two event happen time something else common? there doubt two case quite different. yet i see reminder need distinguish clearly scope public intervention effectiveness. where room public action, minimum scope intervention tantamount weak ineffective intervention. the important lesson emerge past experience overextend public intervention excessive scope unnecessary strength. both event highlight weak response authority deteriorate situation. in case enron, signal provide market authority policy-makers strong enough ensure adequate transparency avoid conflict interest. while initiative improve situation put forward relatively long period enron incident, prevail pressure corporate sector prevent substantive achievements. regulator policy marker something common policemen. a policeman friendly helpful citizen – regulator need market-friendly – policeman always remember is. hence, main lesson i would draw recent event strong public intervention necessary occasion market fail work properly. this confuse wide pervasive intervention market public authority use past. we, responsible oversight markets, signal commitment well-defined effective intervention, needed, thus contribute stability financial system. bi review 20/2002 1 svein gjedrem: the inflation target float krone: interplay fiscal policy, interest rate competitiveness address mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), executive board federation norwegian manufacture industries, oslo, 20 march 2002. this speech base information provide norge bank’s inflation report 1/2002, early speech governor’s annual address 14 february 2002. accompany chart find norge bank’s website (www.norges-bank.no). * * * norway’s economic policy base guideline fiscal monetary policy. the guideline fiscal policy state use petroleum revenue central government budget shall equivalent expect real return government petroleum fund. monetary policy orient towards low stable inflation. historically, period high inflation always follow downturn. low stable inflation foster stability growth economy. establish guideline economic policy new. both fiscal monetary policy base rule throughout post-war period, exception last half 1970s first half 1980s. monetary policy clear anchor since 1986. the inflation target provide anchor expectation concern future inflation interest rates. the inflation target set 2½ per cent. of course, authority must stand firm figure 2½ inflation target anchor long-term expectation shall reap long-term benefit conduct monetary policy. monetary policy affect economy lag. the current level inflation provide adequate basis determine level interest rate set today. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. two year thus reasonable time horizon achieve inflation target. economic agent act assumption inflation rate 2½ per cent. if appear inflation high 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate increased. if appear inflation low 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate reduced. there symmetry here. it equally important avoid inflation rate low, avoid inflation rate high. the global economy experience slowdown last year. the downturn u contagion effect european asian economy impact world trade financial markets. capital market global, revenue decline us, enterprise operation many country also reduce investment operate expense europe asia. industrial production decline markedly major region world economy. in norway, manufacture output stable. norge bank present last inflation report 27 february. we expect price inflation 2½ per cent two years, growth global economy pick assumed. the tight labour market probably continue result fairly strong growth labour cost rather sharply rise price domestically produce good services. annual wage growth project 5 per cent period ahead. a subdue rise price import good push overall price inflation. the projection base technical assumption krone exchange rate remain stable. on whole, risk associate inflation projection regard balanced. exchange rate major currency fluctuate widely. the effective exchange rate u dollar rise 30 per cent since 1995. the german mark (later euro) depreciate amount. the effective exchange rate japanese yen fluctuate sharply. small country also experience wide exchange rate fluctuations. the swedish krona change considerable last 10 year 10 per cent weak summer 2000. the australian dollar depreciate 30 per cent since spring 1997. country whose export include large component raw material tend experience considerable volatility exchange rate. australia one example. fluctuation commodity price entail change countries’ term trade, measure ratio export import prices. change term trade impact exchange rate, turn dampen impact profitability. the exchange rate act buffer. in 1990s, 2 bi review 20/2002 fluctuation norway’s term trade especially wide. change oil price important reason this. the krone exchange rate fluctuate much compare countries. the petroleum fund act buff fluctuation oil price, fund’s capital invest abroad. this contribute stabilise krone exchange rate. we must, nevertheless, prepare fluctuation krone line fluctuation observe countries. change global economy affect krone exchange rate. the exchange rate may also react contribute curb effect domestic disturbances. the float exchange rate large well-suited instrument absorb unforeseen disturbance economy. a strong krone may, example, prevent demand pressure translate high price inflation. a history experience country teach us, real economic loss associate eliminate high inflation curb inflation expectation considerably high associate variable nominal exchange rate. if oil price fall low level investment norwegian shelf come halt, weak krone would contribute facilitate restructure business sector rest norwegian economy. historically, stable krone exchange rate nominal anchor norwegian economy. labour cost among trade partner provide important reference. now, inflation target nominal anchor. the norwegian krone appreciate 2½ per cent since begin 2002 8 per cent since spring 2000. high interest rate differential oil price play part development. at present, krone exchange rate close level 1990-92 1996. the cost-competitiveness norwegian manufacture company deteriorate 10 per cent since 1996. this due entirely pay increase award manufacture industry’s organisation companies. underlie cost inflation tight labour market reflect high growth employment public private service well extensive work hour reform recent years. the increase labour cost important norge bank ass outlook price inflation set interest rates. excessively high wage growth, manufacture industries, affect internationally expose sector two channels. first, high wage growth reduce earn employment. second, interest rate increased. normally, lead appreciation krone, reduction earn employment. manufacture will, therefore, feel effect excessively high wage growth even great extent earlier. at present, labour market relatively tight, reflect high wage growth. in countries, situation different, sluggish economic development decline inflation. a result, interest rate high norway countries. accord guideline fiscal policy, use petroleum revenue increase every year number year ahead. this sustain demand labour. the service industry need resources. the contest labour resource intensify. to contain inflation, monetary policy must probably fairly tight year ahead. since 1997, labour cost increase 5 7 per cent per year. nevertheless, increase consumer price 2½ per cent last couple years. the krone exchange rate appreciate since summer 2000 result wide interest rate differential norway countries. combine low growth abroad increase trade low-cost country china, lead slow rise import prices. a high rise price domestically produce good service reflect increase labour cost norway. a world economy recovers, import price inflation probably edge up. a rise labour cost 5 per cent consistent inflation target krone continue appreciate. in projection norwegian economy next two years, expect 5 per cent wage growth. a long wage increase much, business sector’s competitiveness decline, thus contribute reduction employment goods-producing industries. when manufacture industry expose competition scale back extent room large service sector, competitiveness stabilise. in long run, wage must compatible value add generate workers, i.e. labour productivity. over time, increase real wage therefore determine development labour productivity. bi review 20/2002 3 in mainland norway, annual productivity growth average 1½ - 2 per cent last 20 years. if continue case, average increase labour cost around 4 - 4½ per cent long term consistent inflation target. the guideline economic policy may affect krone exchange rate two ways. on one hand, increase use petroleum revenue may lead deterioration business sector’s competitiveness. with low stable inflation, may time reflect strong krone. on hand, inflation target slightly high trade partners’ inflation targets. in long run, offset correspond depreciation krone.1 the international rise price manufacture good low service – around 1 per cent. the inflation target 2½ per cent imply depreciation norwegian krone around ½ per cent long term, target set somewhat high trade partners’ inflation target. this mean good price measure norwegian krone must expect rise 1½ per cent long term. with wage growth 4 - 4½ per cent, productivity growth manufacture must 2½ - 3 per cent maintain profitability. for services, price inflation somewhat higher, 3 – 3½ per cent, productivity gain correspondingly lower. the size expose sector affect portion petroleum revenue absorb norwegian economy. in long run, monetary policy cannot influence overall employment distribution across industries. historically, employment internationally expose sector decline waves. the sharp decline manufacture employment observe year 1977 1984 1987 1992. both period precede considerable deterioration cost competitiveness manufacturing. there risk new period decline manufacturing. the restructure manufacture may take place rapidly. competitiveness deteriorate 10 per cent since 1996. we know long development continue. the long-term requirement improve balance wage growth productivity growth may become apparent early stage. development norwegian enterprise not, however, negative. some enterprise could forefront technological development increase efficiency rapidly relatively high rate growth real wage norway. many enterprise move large portion production abroad. norwegian manufacture company could still profitable even significance manufacture sector norwegian economy reduced. however, scale back manufacture involve risk. it make economy vulnerable. the growth potential economy – basis learning, innovation development – may impair le business sector expose intense foreign competition. 1 akram, q.f.

government’s forecast currently 1-3% growth, fair assessment prospects. lesson asian crisis five year pass since asian financial crisis began, prompt major re-think policy hold obvious valid crisis. in particular, crisis highlight three major issue asian economic financial systems. first, analyst question east asia’s growth model, emphasis high savings, reliance foreign investment, export growth. east asian economies, argued, instead low save rates, order stimulate domestic demand, develop indigenous enterprise, insulate volatile external conditions. second, crisis highlight danger liberalise capital market rapidly without adequate safeguards. before crisis, capital account liberalization vogue. conventional wisdom emphasize benefit rather cost free capital flows. the crisis demolish complacent confidence. undoubtedly, structural flaw policy errors, especially financial corporate sectors, contribute crisis. however, financial markets’ reaction weakness proportion severity crime. market prove highly susceptible contagion herd behaviour. crash panic shake seemingly sound economy roots. third, crisis demonstrate danger over-reliance bank-based financing. in many asian country prior crisis, capital market underdeveloped. bond markets, particular, illiquid nonexistent. so asian firm rely bank loan work capital fund capital expenditure. when bank run trouble, firm leave without alternative source capital. more generally, thin capital market asia accentuate price movement investor preference shifted. this make asian economy vulnerable financial shocks. so country respond wake asian crisis? on east asian growth model, asian country abandon export foreign investment engine growth, even country harbour reservation risk globalisation. for small asian economies, singapore particular, idea rely tiny domestic market stimulate growth enterprise inherently implausible. large economy may make domestic markets, indeed asean country group need integrate market asean free trade area, make attractive foreign investments. but single domestic market substitute world market, age economy scale global, whether industry like electronics pharmaceuticals, service like bank telecommunications. 2 bi review 19/2002 indigenous enterprise important factor economic development. strong local company add depth resilience economy, spirit entrepreneurship enable population seize new opportunity thrive uncertain times. but indigenous enterprise cannot rely traditional family firms, small scale business margin modern economy. it require firm strong technology know-how, systematic management meritocratic practices, firm hold foreign competition, potential grow significant industry players. even then, firm complement, replace, foreign investment mncs. follow philosophy, singapore’s economic policy therefore remain externally oriented. we continue push free trade, welcome investments, integrate global economy, even promote entrepreneurship seek build singapore firm regional players. the pressure globalisation uncomfortable, change force upon u painful. but globalisation help u build stronger, resilient economy, one good prepare hold formidable competitors, deliver high rise standard live population. on capital account liberalisation, country acutely aware sound macroeconomic management key prerequisite, without regime exchange control deliver stability. they also realise must sequence liberalization judiciously, strengthen financial supervision prudential safeguard liberalize. in aftermath crisis, asian country impose capital controls, apart malaysia. but several tighten safeguard reduce risk destabilise capital flows, shield domestic foreign exchange money market speculative pressure emanate abroad. they improve monitoring, discourage trade currency relate real economy. a country go further, seek curb transaction home currency offshore markets. at time, ongoing effort develop bond market asia. issuance domestic government bond increase sharply asian countries. certainly, large part increase reflect spike fiscal deficit result debt restructure operation financial sector asian crisis. nonetheless, corporate bond also grown. there trade tighten capital account, develop bond markets. measure restrict offshore foreign currency trade effective, far reduce eliminate offshore market concerned. but safeguard come cost – also hind development capital markets, especially bond markets. size liquidity essential attribute market attract international interest. already size liquidity, clearly lag behind counterpart west. if asian market fragment unable grow, risk ignore global investors. in immediate aftermath asian crisis, country suffer hand market understandably disincline err side few restrictions, especially benefit bond market development likely large give structural problem economy. however, time asian country make progress restructure economy strengthen institutions, reassess balance risks, perhaps modify restrictions. liberalisation s$ policy in singapore, subject trade-offs. but circumstance somewhat different le severely affect crisis. our financial service sector also relatively large established, compare country region. by 1997, decide sufficiently well establish shift previous highly conservative risk-averse regulatory approach towards financial industry instead supervise light touch accept calculate risk order promote development. a part overall liberalisation, progressively relax restriction singapore dollar, foster growth capital markets, throughout asian crisis. our monetary policy centre exchange rate since 1981. but large financial centre open capital markets, expose large sometimes, volatile capital flows. thus long maintain explicit policy discourage internationalisation singapore bi review 19/2002 3 dollar, order support monetary policy framework. we limit use singapore dollar non-residents purpose unrelated singapore economy, example currency speculation. this non-internationalisation policy, support strong macroeconomic fundamental substantial foreign reserves, help u maintain stable singapore dollar, avoid large swing exchange rate would severely damage economy. the trade-off le vibrant capital markets. indeed cases, tight domestic restriction foster growth offshore market restrict activities, undermine purpose. recognize this, past four year progressively relax s$ restrictions. our approach cautious one: weigh trade-off development risk exchange rate management, feel way forward step step. our effort yield encourage results. the outstanding volume singapore government security (sgs) double since 1998 average daily turnover volume increase three-times. sg outstanding volume 2001 s$54 billion average daily turnover s$1.9 billion. new corporate debt issuance continue grow strongly, s$ non-s$ corporate bond issuance total record s$72 billion 2001. this almost 8-fold growth issuance volume 1998, spur exceptional merger acquisition activities, significant nevertheless. outstanding corporate bond also double s$80 billion. besides high volume issuance, also see great diversity corporate bond market. the tenor

structure debt product account 35% total s$ debt issuance, reflect move towards sophisticate debt instruments. with deep mature capital markets, great confidence experience manage large s$ flows, ready make move. since october last year, ma seek view key market participant facilitate continue growth s$ capital markets. follow dialogues, review non-internationalisation policy, take account idea suggestions. we decide liberalise policy, lift many specific restriction use s$. henceforth, retain two basic guidelines: a. first, financial institution may extend s$ credit facility exceed s$5 million non-resident financial entities, reason believe proceed may use speculation s$ exchange rate. this continue necessary, reason allow offshore speculator access liquidity onshore fx swap money markets. b. second, non-resident entity wish obtain s$ loan, tap equity bond market fund overseas activities, must swap convert s$ proceed foreign currency us proceed offshore. this guideline unlikely stand way market development, s$ currency commonly use transaction abroad, non-resident entity would case wish swap convert s$ proceed currency choice overseas use. with liberalisation, follow possible. a. first, ma exempt individual non-financial entities, include corporate treasury centres, s$ lend restriction non-internationalisation policy. this recognise entity usually prime driver destabilize currency speculation. b. second, non-resident financial entity continue govern s$ policy, lift restriction follow financial activities: i. asset swaps, cross-currency swap cross-currency

attract offshore s$ activity back onshore. we still maintain two core requirement non-internationalisation policy – restriction lend purpose speculate s$, requirement swap foreign currency proceed s$ loans, debt equity issue proceed use offshore. some market participant suggest go way lift requirement too, continue believe wise maintain basic stance encourage internationalisation s$, two requirements. they unlikely hind activity legitimate players. they also provide u basic safeguard case activity currency market turn self-stabilising, time time seem case. conclusion the new financial landscape offer many opportunity astute market player investors, time, present many challenge regulator supervisors. in singapore, make much progress, task ahead remain challenging. we continue engage

president bank international settlements, nederland genootschap voor internationale zaken, utrecht, 13 march 2002. * * * introduction "we european must create basis broad deep community among people long divide bloody conflict lay foundation institution give direction destiny henceforward shared". these lofty words, formulate fifty year ago, find preamble treaty establish european coal steel community. although may strike slightly passé, underlie think lose none poignancy. • to begin with, sense moral historical duty unite long-divided continent words. for first time, country central eastern europe join european union, 2004. • secondly, preamble state europe sufficient institutional power cohesion give direction share destiny. a know, european convention start deal issue; i understand dick benschop next week elaborate. • finally, text speak duty form close-knit strong europe, also right every european share fruit undertaking. we aware tension three principle grown, evidence renew power politics national level grow discrepancy large small member states. the economic heterogeneity within eu augment accession new member states. it heterogeneity exacerbate discussion right duty need cohesion within union. it consideration mind i discuss economic background expansion eu, special focus economic monetary union. the central theme address specific challenge economic policy accession country face next years. give challenges, accession country should, view, adopt gradual approach towards euro; first properly embed exist process economic policy coordination. situation regard expansion today, twelve country negotiate accession eu: visegrad country central europe, baltic state three balkan countries: bulgaria, rumania slovenia. these country must pas know copenhagen test. this test draw european council copenhagen 1993, consist three criteria: • to begin accession country must political democratic institution along western line even enter negotiations. that turkey, thirteenth accession country, find exceptional position. • secondly, potential member state must subscribe objective european integration. this means, among things, must adopt implement european legislation rules, word acquis communautaire. exceptions, make past british dane regard participation emu, allowed. • finally, copenhagen criterion also encompass economic test: accession country must function market economy capable cop market force within eu. in opinion, mean must able create stable macro-economic 2 bi review 19/2002 climate, market operator consumer take decision develop initiative predictable reliable environment. this presuppose powerful institution supervisory authorities, full-fledged physical human infrastructure develop financial sector. it also mean economic sector must sufficiently competitive able operate within single market. an indicator competitiveness provide trade relation european union. over past ten years, relation tighten considerably. the geographical reorientation abolition trade barrier since 1990 contribute increase trade volume accession country eu. today 67% countries’ export go eu member states. it worth note trade sector also grow materially. there doubt largely result vast foreign investment countries. the adoption european rule may, however, impair competitiveness of, instance, agricultural industrial industries. in late evaluation, november 2001, commission conclude accession country except rumania bulgaria function market economy. of countries, baltic states, hungary, poland, slovakia, slovenia czech republic consider capable hold within single market, provide continue reform. malta cyprus already fully meet economic criterion. subsequent commission report, european council laeken indicate december eight ten country join eu 2004. the chance big bang scenario, accession country except bulgaria rumania join time, thus gain probability. politically, would prefer route, eliminate tension country join soon late stage facilitate ratification process individual accession treaties. on hand, big bang scenario conceal persist – sometimes substantial – structural difference accession countries. there correlation potential problem economic structure stage transition reached. the consequent specific policy challenge continue demand attention even accession, notably participation monetary union considered. policy challenge accession country road convergence let begin point past ten year country central eastern europe engage highly successful catching-up exercise. painful reform enacted, often attend rampant unemployment. the necessary institutions, central banks, build scratch. at time, transition process centrally plan market economy usually prove laborious expected. the economic downturn country manage regain gdp level record 1990. the growth potential may exceed average european union, far margin slim. for instance, czech central bank put potential growth rate czech economy 2-3% per annum. income differential vis-à-vis european union consequently persist time come. in fact policy challenge accession country lie further structural reform aim raise growth potential. economically, structural real convergence towards eu interact. it lengthy process, involve measure introduce free enterprise corporate governance, well set social security system fight abuse corruption. in context, commission recently announce action plan intend boost institutional capability accession countries. look field, i see bank supervision need step up. in general, financial sector develop line economy whole, play limit role finance local enterprises. the capitalisation rate bank share/bond market poland hungary le third eu. financial intermediation must clearly stimulate economic development growth boosted. in parallel, supervisory power strengthen further. finally, several accession country face specific sectoral problems. here restructure heavy industry poland slovakia come mind, depreciation bad debt slovakia czech republic transformation vast unproductive agricultural sector poland bi review 19/2002 3 baltic states. the transition modern economy clearly attend economic hence social friction. all all, seem structural problem take account copenhagen test, ultimate test general political one. copenhagen consequently guarantee high measure structural convergence towards current eu member states. this need pose problem long structural administrative challenge really acknowledge expand union, issue i deal great detail later. a noted, prospective member state face major challenge need boost prosperity, words, achieve real convergence current eu. the difference prosperity accession country eu exceptionally large. per caput income poland le 20% eu. by comparison, per caput income portugal, poor eu member state, come 50% eu. slovenia currently accession country level roughly achieved. in order equal average poor three eu member states, portugal, greece spain, poland would record average annual growth percentage around eleven percent. such real convergence pose several specifical challenge economic policy. i shall try explain without go much theory. • first all, achieve necessary high growth rate go hand hand rise prices. in words: process convergence make inflation go up. this upward pressure partly offset appreciation exchange rate. generally speaking, flexible exchange rate regime alleviate pressure economy generate transition catch up, instance, capital inflow considerable. under circumstances, flexible regime give le rise speculative attack currency. • in addition, fast-growing transition country generally vulnerable asymmetrical shock (affecting country concerned). the baltic states, instance, seriously affect russian crisis 1998. another case point czech bank crisis mid-1990s, ultimately result foreign exchange crisis. • maybe see achievement eu membership shock right. after all, considerable administrative financial burden adopt comply acquis communautaire confrontation competition single market constitute major change economic functioning. this call flexible policy. give specific challenge policy pose transition convergence, worth note accession country make progress, hungary, czech republic poland, switch flexible exchange rate regime recent years. this allow exercise great influence real appreciation strong capital inflows, reduce potential speculative attack currency partially absorb shocks. policy challenge participation emu what relationship challenge pose structural real convergence participation economic monetary union? a may know, country accede european union may begin consider change euro two years. the question arise whether give circumstance early introduction euro always advisable. it must remember instrument exchange rate flexibility long available country join monetary union. there furthermore considerable chance new member state eager change euro quickly may find euro area-wide monetary condition incompatible specific circumstances. on one hand, accession country successful effort catch temporarily face structurally high inflation levels. on other, country’s economic weight insignificant affect ecb’s monetary policy. in situation, negative real interest rates, overheat economy erratic economic cycle may occur, make heavy demand macroeconomic management flexibility economy, notably labour market. this bring u back structural convergence requirement implementation copenhagen test. 4 bi review 19/2002 new member state european process policy coordination give structural real challenge policy, would seem advisable continue comply essence copenhagen test follow accession eu. this would give accession process necessary

deputy governor bank japan chairman committee global financial system, third joint central bank research conference risk measurement systemic risk hold basel, switzerland, 7 march 2002. * * * introduction: a brief history systemic risk conference lady gentlemen, i please join third conference “risk measurement systemic risk”. this theme gain increase importance since first conference 1995. the keen attention pay international community evident fact number international forum endeavour spot potential financial vulnerability might lead systemic crisis global market. actually, term “systemic risk” make bite uneasy unfortunately realistic connotation country. i look forward take home new insight subject, and, chair committee global financial system co-hosting conference, i would happy could same. the aim series conference enhance understand mechanism systemic shock generate transmitted. meanwhile, six year since first conference, witness significant change world finance. a result, focus conference change years. if i may generalise risk oversimplification, centre stage first conference 1995 occupy var methodology, gain acceptance lead financial institutions. reporter explore risk could quantitatively measure would real-life mean measures. well, real life, crisis erupt asia 1997 trigger event largely beyond bind standard var methodology. naturally, discussion second conference 1998 much influence asian crisis. we begin realise market microstructure theory could shed light market dynamic time stress. our third conference today carry theme further, many paper pay attention create stress stress contagious. triangular view systemic risk this brief history conference series suggest structural change financial markets, systemic risk reveal face actual crisis therefore nexus deeply explored. conventional think narrow coverage inextricably tie systemic risk banks. systemic disturbance originate bank spill bank system, turn adversely affect real economy. obviously, bank-centred risk propagation still holds; fact, much exist safety net aim prevent chain reaction within bank system. however, become evident financial market play significant role channel propagate disturbance involve bank system well real economy. the importance market dynamic underscore recent experience japan, asian region, russia ltcm case. the novelty russian ltcm crisis lie fact large capital market world “seized up” without entail bank crisis. it often case sudden deterioration asset price bring turbulence financial system. to illustrate, successive failure major japanese financial institution 1997 1998 directly trigger major default. instead, undo rapid loss confidence market. typically, soundness bank question market, price stock credit rat start fall. the bank would begin experience fund difficulties, access market become problematic. in situation, trouble bank resort fire sale assets, turn damage balance sheet drive stock even further. in self-fulfilling spiral, several bank go business. at time, deterioration asset price lead difficulty channel fund corporate sector, familiar credit crunch process. a credit crunch usually attribute dysfunction bank system – correct observation one aspect phenomenon. a deep look suggest process complex. we 2 bi review 18/2002 witness borrower blame bank tighten credit standards, lender complain lack credit demand. no doubt, important feedback mechanism also run real economy financial system via corporate balance sheets, asset prices, banks’ capital position, among others. i attempt draw definitive lesson specific episode past crisis, let alone unsolved problem japanese economy. however, experience last several year show disturbance multifaceted. systemic problem develop market risk, liquidity risk credit risk factor interact complex manner. this mean evaluation systemic risk base one isolate factor could provide fragmentary view. what call “triangular view systemic risk” – comprehensive analysis cover interrelation nexus bank system, financial market real economy. it background i think need devote least much attention market microstructure sophisticate analysis “fat tails” loss distribution. a focus market microstructure could shed light relation various risk factors. particularly important investigate individual market participant different budget information constraint would behave rationally stressful events, behaviour would affect formation asset prices. strategic interaction recent episode financial crisis seem defy explanation basis conventional economic theory, regard macroeconomic phenomenon mere aggregate independent decision-making economic agents. a reflection limitation conventional theory, grow body work attempt interpret financial crisis viewpoint “strategic interactions” among market participants. i would like devote minute outline why. strategic interaction define process market participant explore his/her optimal strategy conjecture response participants. some paper present conference follow path. herd behaviour one example. a know, large number small investor tend follow small number large investors. once stressful event happen, behaviour likely lead one-sided market sentiment, accelerate propagate stress within across markets. from viewpoint policymakers, herd behaviour phenomenon hard tackle. if understand phenomenon consequence strategic interaction among market participants, however, might find key reduce risk trigger herd behaviour. accord read line research, outbreak systemic disturbance would heavily depend many market participants, face systemic threats, expect disturbance actually occur. in words, crisis necessarily accident, consequence market participants’ expectations. their expectation form conjectural view market participants’ response threats. the magnitude crisis extent contagion would critically depend feedback market participant react collectively systemic threats. feedback could also accelerate crisis. these explanation seem offer useful perspective mechanism systemic disturbance appropriate policy response thereto. the strategic interaction framework seem offer u roadmap develop stress-resistant markets. a possible approach would enhance visibility future stress. let u suppose scenario consist series event lead stress. if market participant view scenario could result serious impact market future, might take necessary action avoid loss would materialise scenario. a market participant take necessary action gradually individually, actual impact event happen would soften stress would materialise. in words, stress scenario would remain stress scenario publicly recognise such. in fact, observe episode financial markets. for example, propose change account rule sometimes raise concern initially, rarely would result severe impact implemented. base experiences, i say approach enhance visibility stress appear appealing. “macro stress-census”, experiment conduct cgfs, might one option develop commonly recognise stress scenario among market participant central banks, although panacea. bi review 18/2002 3 challenge central bank before conclude remarks, let outline challenge face central bank regard systemic risk. in six year since first systemic risk conference, learn considerably involvement real-life crisis intellectual interchange conference venues. at time, one answer lead new question remain many unanswered questions. the say policy response central bank time financial crisis. in relation policy response systemic risk, generally recognise importance pre-emptive actions, ie action aim prevent systemic problems, after-the-fact measure contain unfold crisis. in regard, i see great rationale ever view stress importance preventive measures. this globalisation financial market consolidation financial institution considerably raise possible cost deal actual systemic disturbances. to end, strengthen market discipline well supervision would essential, international community make serious joint efforts. however, even best preventive measure may always successful completely remove source systemic crisis environment financial intermediation keep evolve speed beyond wild imagination. if slight chance severe financial disturbances, central bank must low guard. in envisage crisis management, change environment could compel u rethink establish doctrines. for example, doubt stress need minimise moral hazard. nevertheless, event systemic crisis actually unfolding, must overlook fact inherent, conflict aspect crisis management. in sense, crisis management artificially create moral hazard order avoid catastrophic consequences. in real-life policy responses, authority inevitably face trade-off prevention systemic crisis minimisation moral hazard. another example concern traditional lender last resort function central bank. accord traditional thinking, aim banks. but contemporary reality, i note earlier, systemic problem could originate financial market market populate bank also large number non-bank financial institution conglomerates. this may argue favour view traditional principle augmented. a relate issue condition central bank would take certain policy actions, invoke lender last resort functions. traditionally, “constructive ambiguity” regard golden rule cases, bank japan distance deal crisis late 1990s, view preclude speculation enhance policy transparency accountability. the issue practical significance “constructive ambiguity” must explore vigorously without leave ambiguity. conclusion today, i offer view systemic risk, might raise question answer central banks. in conclude remarks, i would like stress central bank must continue pursue issue discharge responsibilities. the responsibility arise follow facts. first, central bank unique economic agent relation corner systemic risk triangle – bank system, financial market real economy. second, central bank expect confront almost every systemic crisis entity readily provide liquidity. fortunately, central bank make progress gain insight extensive research market dynamics. nevertheless, central bank must satisfy achieve far. in order answer remain questions, refine view establish concepts, look forward continuously interact market participants, first-hand knowledge markets, member academia, lay groundwork. in regard, i hope series conference remain valuable venue continue inspire central bank community. thank attention. bi review 18/2002 1 david clementi: a bank regions: promote monetary financial stability unite kingdom speech mr david clementi, deputy governor bank england, ulster society charter accountants, belfast, 14 march 2002. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, thank much indeed kind invitation tonight. despite name, bank england central bank unite kingdom, essential u get country large, explain actions, listen hard view business wide public way job. in past year, member bank's monetary policy committee make 50 visit across uk. on trip, apart attend dinner, i hold meet regional council cbi, discuss trade condition local business people, explain mission northern irish press. i want cover three main theme comment tonight. first, i want briefly explain bank's general approach monetary policy. second, i want give current assessment outlook economy. and, third, i want explain bank's key role - maintain stability financial system. the accountancy profession much microscope moment, part rash enronitis fill page press. i want touch enron end talk tonight, since raise number issue relevance u bank broad financial stability role. maintain monetary stability i turn first though bank's role maintain monetary stability. the current institutional arrangement put place may 1997, chancellor establish monetary policy committee. the mpc's target extremely clear, - i hope - well known. we aim 2½% inflation retail price (excluding mortgage payments) times. that target set government. and symmetric: say, worry much target it. that make sense problem severe deflation great problem severe inflation. since inception mpc, rpix inflation extremely stable historical standards, close target. some commentator suggest fair share luck achieve outcome. there may well truth that. but i'm sure surprised. market survey evidence show people clear mpc take keep inflation track. and expectation factor behaviour, whether negotiate wages, set prices, decide much borrow consume. all go long way towards ensure inflation well anchor target. of course, month month, inflation still vary somewhat around 2½%. in recent months, rpix little target, even interest whether might reach 1.5%, point governor would write formal letter chancellor explain go on. the pick inflation 2.6% january silence discussion, least time being. we pore reason development enormous detail bank. but big scheme thing month-to-month movement quite small, i hope likely play little - - role key decision businesses, represent. people often ask relative success target inflation come cost term lose output employment. it increasingly accepted, i think, trade-off long run. and, look recent data, hard see trade-off even short run. unemployment remain close low level quarter century - trend see northern ireland much uk whole. and uk gdp rise 38 consecutive quarter (albeit case 2001 q4, just!), long continuous expansion since post-war record began. achieve low stable inflation best contribution monetary policy make wide economic goal sustainable growth employment. have inflation target certainly mean ignore 2 bi review 18/2002 real activity. we discretion rapidly try bring inflation back target diverge 2½%. and regularly publish best estimate likely future path growth two year horizon. but aim policy clear - necessary keep inflation target. a know, nine u bank's monetary policy committee, meet month make interest rate decision. this rigorous process, rightly so. but, course, agreement process need not, not, imply universal agreement appropriate stance policy, minute show. indeed, industry grow gear guess mpc members' personal habits, psychoanalyse personality classify u different specie aviary. but important recognise, i think, disagreement evidence strength system, weakness. economic analysis involve great deal peer future, surprise difference view. and opportunity explore explain difference rational open way important part get good answer. the outlook economy i want turn briefly current policy debate. the key focus mpc's recent discussion implication slowdown world growth, become apparent u first half last year, exacerbate tragic event 11 september. world trade rise around 1½% 2001, le quarter average growth previous three years. that course serious implication business expose international trade, i know many northern ireland. monetary policy idle face challenge. interest rate cut 4¾% u since start last year, 2% uk 1½% euro area. how far monetary policy would able insulate world economy slowdown persist i think hard say stage. very significant uncertainty remain. but recent news u encouraging. gdp growth fourth quarter last year revise upwards, consumer confidence rebound somewhat main forward look survey activity manufacture service sector look substantially positive since turn year. consistent tentative recovery optimism, consensus survey professional economists' forecast near-term growth u revise upwards first time quite period. so far, uk escape bad squall rag across atlantic. though gdp growth slow course last year, output 2001 still 2.4% high year earlier, close trend growth. underlie relatively benign aggregate picture, course quite mark differences: expenditure side, growth consumption, surge ahead, growth investment, strikingly depressed; and, output side, fortune firm manufacturing, bear brunt global slowdown, firm shelter service sector. these difference sometimes refer 'imbalances', certainly true neither expect (nor wish) persist long run. the shake-out manufacture particularly severe, know well. manufacture output northern ireland fell 4.6% year last autumn, compare fall 3.5% uk whole. but sectoral difference emerge necessarily unwelcome. indeed, seek ensure stability economy whole, really well consumption growth remain robust time net trade position economy worsen markedly. and, recent mpc minute show, intention. so long world economy recover quickly enough pick slack consumption slows, may uk avoid sharp recession previous cycles. of course, big 'if', i want imply i excessively confident occur. rapid consumption growth bring considerable risks, least finance large build consumer debt. but mpc's central expectation escape serious slowdown current interest rates. in last weeks, see tentative sign unwind severe sectoral gap economy, slowdown retail sale growth since start year, encourage pickup number survey business confidence investment intentions. bi review 18/2002 3 overall, seem risk around outlook uk inflation fairly evenly balanced. on downside, speed recovery world economy may hold back number factors, include large outstanding debt position corporate household sectors; investment uk might remain subdued; weakness price pressure see past year may persist. but upside, u might bounce back rapidly anticipated; consumption growth might remain robust; sterling exchange rate might begin adjust downwards. against background risks, quite possible may see rate current level time way ahead clearer. but, know, economic event habit develop quite rapidly, even short term prediction never easy. for part, continue ass case interest rate change month-by-month basis. in carry task, mpc rely heavily best information disposal, enormously assist network regional agencies. each month, agent drive thousand miles, eat hundred rush sandwich lunch and, occasion, doubt push goodwill limit seek late news development businesses. nigel falls, local agent, tonight, already meet i really encourage dinner. agent attend monthly brief threadneedle street ahead policy meeting, information contact feed directly heart policy process. i know i speak colleague mpc i say really find crucial barometer current events, i hope feel short agent twice year time well spent! financial stability enron i turn final subject tonight - bank's role ensure financial stability. responsibility day-to-day supervision bank pass bank england financial service authority 1997. but central bank still key role oversee stability system whole. in guise meet monthly basis hm treasury fsa so-called tripartite stand committee, review risk face uk financial system take stock action may require address them. keep close fsa particularly important. to end, i sit fsa board, howard davy member bank's court. of course, i need remind here, border euro area mile road, cannot look uk system isolation wide international financial markets. the world economic slowdown, attendant rise credit risks, deepen problem argentina spread bank system, event 11 september, create temporary liquidity strain new york elsewhere, pose serious risk stability international financial system. so far, response encouraging. the capital position many large financial player strong previous cycles. there seem sophisticate approach differentiate sovereign risk emerge markets. and hugely impressive effort staff, together largely successful operation contingency plans, flexibility u monetary authorities, saw u bad aftermath last autumn's attack without serious crisis emerging. the late topic discussion financial circle is, course, implication collapse enron. the case raise host issue firm policy makers. some relate account standards; relate way audit profession organise itself; relate corporate governance issue generally. there also issue scope operation financial regulation net. there also question raise implication collapse health financial system whole, much interest bank, give responsibility systemic risk. from current perspective, implication appear limited, however. enron extensive link bank financial firms, mediate part use relatively new credit risk transfer instruments. trace exposure ultimate owner particularly straightforward business - issue bank raise macro-prudential context time now, recently december financial stability review. but current information, residual exposure appear unmanageable. indeed, apparent dispersion exposure may even turn demonstrate effectiveness market spread risk. 4 bi review 18/2002 the bank direct locus account corporate governance issue raise case. but way firms' financial performance oversee present important bear discipline apply financial markets, essential component maintain financial stability wide sense. public confidence financial statement role auditor critical. one set issue relate appropriateness account rule govern treatment special purpose vehicle relate revenue recognition. this technical area, one rule apply u uk relevantly different. no doubt appropriate professional body look questions. another set issue relate rule practice govern appointment auditors, extent nature non-audit work carry firms' auditors. best practice list company time recognise importance rotate individual auditors. but relationship major list company auditor go well beyond role senior day-to-day audit partner. before come bank england, i involve company audit partner rotated; senior partner firm, take close interest relationship, course not. if profession belief rotation important maintain independence, rotation relate firm, relationship is, rather individual? there course good argument side, interest see review relate matters, recently announce patricia hewitt, come out. conclusion lady gentlemen, pleasure come northern ireland, meet number business people course visit, join evening. can i take opportunity wish you, business community serve, success future. bi review 18/2002 1 willem f duisenberg: the introduction euro: (critical) retrospect preview speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, occasion meet dutch society editors-in-chief, the hague, 15 march 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, it give great pleasure talk today introduction euro. if take introduction euro banknote coin benchmark, process say complete – and, i might add, smoothly successfully so. however, take broad perspective, introduction euro say ongoing process. the euro area economy large, respect complex still new map major economic entities. these feature imply policy challenge manifold remain long time come. i would thus like talk today cash changeover, also policy challenge face euro area economy. the policy area i closely involve is, course, monetary one, challenge ecb deliver require – namely price stability medium term. however, existence single monetary policy single market imply almost field economic policy affect european economic monetary integration – importantly budgetary structural policy. if i may permit state obvious, challenge maintain sound fiscal policies, foster efficiency public expenditure tax system improve function labour product market order enhance euro area's growth potential. the unique framework monetary, fiscal structural policy euro area foster recent discussion economic governance, "interplay" monetary, fiscal structural policy issue whether extent fiscal structural policies, particular, become centralise european level. this extensive list issue (as request mr. broertjes), mean focus must necessarily broad one. let make remark cash changeover, proceed brief discussion three key policy areas, namely monetary, fiscal structural policy. i finish speech briefly touch upon issue economic governance euro area. cash changeover with end changeover period 28 february 2002 euro become sole legal tender euro area country effect 1 march 2002. both term acceptance consumer achievement logistical targets, introduction euro banknote coin surpass expectations. here minor mishap occurred, quite normal huge complex undertaking. in case, support european citizens, accept new money rapidly enthusiastically, minor difficulty overcome. european citizen clearly choose actor merely spectator euro changeover. accord late eurobarometer european commission, 80% euro area citizen see euro changeover successful, almost 70% declare happy euro become new currency. but logistical factor contribute success euro cash changeover? first, measure take ensure early return national banknote coins. one example i would mention context campaign aim encourage people pay surplus banknote coin bank account well end 2001. overall, number legacy currency banknote circulation fell almost one-third course 2001. by end cash changeover period, eur 38 billion – little 10% original amount legacy currency banknote – still circulation. second, pre-distribution "frontloading" "critical mass" euro banknote coin make crucial contribution ensure smooth changeover euro area countries. a four-month lead time require order ensure sufficient euro banknote coin available within bank target group 1 january 2002. this pre-distribution key factor successful 2 bi review 18/2002 attainment one primary goal changeover process, namely ensure bulk cash transaction euro could effect within fortnight new currency's introduction. all all, 6 billion euro banknote distribute central bank euro area prior "€-day". nearly 38 billion euro coin frontloaded parallel. to put figure perspective, four-fifths euro banknote almost euro coin frontloaded period. third, give normal circumstance around 70% banknote put circulation via automate teller machine (atms), quick adaptation machine crucial smooth changeover. it necessary convert total 200,000 atms, either "on-site" bank branch "off-site" – example shop centres. follow thorough highly efficient preparation bank sector, adaptation process extremely rapid, virtually atm convert 4 january 2002. a fourth factor contribute smooth changeover particular commitment bank sector put low-denomination banknote eur 20 circulation large scale begin 2002. this reduce considerably need retailer hold large amount cash first day 2002. in addition, country welfare payment pay largely cash, effect low denominations. all ensure that, begin year, low-denomination banknote account 80% total number banknote 40% value. this clearly usual share low-denomination banknote banknote circulation. monetary policy let talk introduction euro broad perspective. i shall begin monetary policy primary objective ecb, namely maintain price stability euro area. for sake presentation, i would like divide first year single monetary policy three phase – rather artificially basis whether inflationary pressure see rise falling. in first these, begin start stage three economic monetary union (emu), inflationary pressure euro area abate phase economic slowdown global level start 1998, follow several episode financial turmoil around world. the decline economic growth accompany sharp reduction commodity prices, contribute significant fall import prices. in environment, govern council decided, april 1999, reduce key interest rates, level 2.50% main refinance rate. this precautionary move, aim reduce risk inflation could head towards hover around low levels. in course 1999, second phase breakdown, sign gradually emerge recovery economic activity take place euro area. at time, oil price gradually steadily increasing, exchange rate euro depreciate significantly. the result increase import price substantial effect consumer price inflation. in environment accelerate economic growth, level potential, could follow know second-round effects, possible longer-lasting effect inflation. in addition, high growth m3 – well reference value 4½% – development credit aggregate clearly indicate risk price stability move upside. the govern council therefore increase key rate first time november 1999, reverse precautionary move make april, six time period october 2000, total 225 basis points. move third period, sign late 2000 early 2001 economic growth gradually stabilise level line potential. this follow effect oil price increase real disposable income euro area accompany deterioration global economic climate, particular economic climate unite states. at time, monetary growth gradually decline level line reference value and, course spring (when m3 growth could correct statistical upward distortion previously known), even fell it. however, spring 2001 inflation still ecb's definition price stability, namely year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price euro area 2%, certain extent owe increase unprocessed food price result bse crisis outbreak foot-and-mouth disease countries. a effect expect temporary, situation anticipate medium-term inflationary bi review 18/2002 3 pressure would decline, govern council act forward-looking way cut key rate twice, may august 2001. in course 2001 gradually become evident global economic downturn would deep protract initially expected, repercussion euro area economic developments. in addition, terrorist attack unite state september 2001 constitute major shock world economy, implication entirely unpredictable time. in first instance, attack threaten disrupt function financial markets. thus, immediately terrorist attacks, ecb take measure ensure normal function financial markets. the govern council also react event hold extraordinary teleconference meeting, decide reduce key ecb interest rate concert federal reserve system unite states. in follow period, sign emerge slowdown economic activity significant, point direction decline inflationary pressures, govern council cut key rate november 2001, bring total reduction key rate 2001 150 basis points. since then, economic developments, point gradual economic recovery euro area course 2002, largely line govern council's expectations, consider current level key ecb interest rate appropriate maintain price stability medium term. to briefly conclude monetary policy, ecb has, view, prove capable adapt operate difficult economic environment. while inflation definition price stability time, medium-term inflationary expectations, imply bond yield forecast surveys, consistently 2%. this sign credibility ecb firmly establish public confident price stability prevail. fiscal policy the economic environment ecb confront also day-to-day reality fiscal policy-makers individual euro area countries. in 2001, mainly result economic slowdown, average budgetary balance euro area deteriorate first time since 1993. automatic stabiliser play significant role budgetary outcome 2001. major tax cut also contribute deterioration, often implement without adequate offset expenditure restraints. a result, large majority country fail meet budgetary balance target stability programme 2001. by token, country rightly refrain introduce discretionary fiscal relaxation response economic slowdown. moreover, country remain fiscal imbalance reaffirm commitment attain safe budgetary position 2003 2004. development 2001 project outcome 2002 confirm vulnerability public finance – especially country remain imbalances. the european commission recommend issue early warn germany portugal. the ecofin council consider subsequent reaffirmation even strengthen fiscal commitment make two country sufficient response concerns. vigilance need ensure strict adherence medium-term plan rigorous implementation procedure stability growth pact. to briefly conclude fiscal policies, recent experience show rapidly budgetary position deteriorate adverse cyclical circumstances. this concern start position fully sound. in view, then, main lesson draw recent experience that, normal circumstances, country need budgetary position close balance surplus. and let u forget medium-term challenge cop age society also call fiscal consolidation. moreover, 2000 lisbon european council put structural reform public finance high agenda, eye strengthen european union's growth potential. structural policy at summit lisbon, european council also emphasise need product labour market reform key condition eu become competitive dynamic economy world. structural reform aim increase flexibility euro area product labour market would, underlined, substantial economic benefit low adjustment cost associate economic shocks. that still need structural reform is, i think, beyond doubt. to take example labour market: strong employment growth witness recent 4 bi review 18/2002 year suggest labour market reform progress right direction, and, particular, suggest process wage moderation euro area period beneficial. at time, however, need reform evident still high persistent level unemployment low labour market participation several euro area countries. for example, despite continue high unemployment, firm continue report difficulty recruit suitably qualify workers, suggest improvement need match labour supply demand. economic governance finally, let turn briefly issue economic governance. with start monetary union, maastricht treaty create unique institutional structure. while supranational european monetary order, policy area predominantly national matter. this unity diversity reflect europe, wealth different histories, cultures, political system constitutions. in principle, structure function relatively well need major overhaul. in area clear case permanently adopt differentiate approach, example case labour market policies. harmonisation field would hamper flexibility price wage country, even region sector national economy pursue monetary union successful. in areas, tax policies, may gradual development towards co-ordination member states. diversity differentiation view reflect lack economic governance. on contrary, experience recent past bear form governance work well practice. for instance, decentralise wage set lead broadly appropriate wage development recent past contribute employment growth. monetary policy keep inflation control react swiftly circumstance sometimes difficult. on whole, fiscal policy also react way compatible economic environment medium-term objectives. all all, clear evidence policy-makers act appropriately three areas. conclusion let conclude. the cash changeover resound success. from logistical point view operation proceed smoothly, thank large part comprehensive preparatory work undertake involved. the people euro area country adapt new currency much quickly ecb national central bank anticipated. in addition, notwithstanding adverse price shock euro area recently subject, prospect good annual inflation rate return 2% come months. overall ecb's monetary policy successful maintain stable long-term inflation expectation difficult environment. it important maintain disciplinary effect stability growth pact; recent experience show quickly budgetary position deteriorate, thus highlight importance reach maintain medium-term budgetary position close balance surplus. structural policy area action also urgently needed. finally, economic policy framework euro area function satisfactorily, even largely unprecedented circumstance 2001. thank much attention. i open questions. bi review 17/2002 1 david dodge: monetary policy choices: canadian experience remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, chambre de commerce france-canada le canadiens en europe (france), paris, 12 march 2002. * * * it great pleasure today wonderful historic city. canada france share important link cannot weaken time. there was, course, vibrant french presence north america long country call canada. the french contribution canada restrict language alone. canada's legal political institutions, well culture way life, retain clearly visible french influence, continue so. obviously, economy economic link country come long way years. the chambre de commerce france-canada establish second world war. the chambre play important role reinforce commercial tie two country reflect historical cultural link already place. le canadiens en europe another organization seek strengthen many tie us. today, france canada member g-7–partners forefront global economy. the strong link two country also reflect close work relationship bank canada bank france. since become governor bank canada last year, i please continue relationship. i happy work jean-claude trichet, governor bank france. bank canada staff regularly attend annual seminar host bank france. and i hope continue strengthen work relationship two institutions. over years, canada france make decision framework guide monetary policy. the authority two country make choice reflect difference economies. today i'd like talk choices, mean countries. a well, i give brief update canada's current economic situation outlook. inflation target in early 1990s, world's central bank find face common problem. they need make sure economy return high volatile inflation see previous decades. further, look way keep inflation expectation control. in general, central bank good job this. certainly bank france successful early 1990s build credibility inflation-fighting central bank. at time, bank canada government canada come share appreciation damage inflation do. so make important decision early 1991. they announce joint agreement adopt explicit inflation-control targets. the agreement successful give canada low, stable, predictable inflation. it renew three times—most recently five year end 2006. today, bank canada european central bank work strengthen economy jurisdictions. we want promote stable growth rise live standards. and, importantly, agree promote low stable inflation best mean ends. there similarity inflation-control systems. for example, focus inflation, aim price stability medium term. but also difference i want highlight today. the bank canada aim price stability inflation target 2 per cent. on hand, european central bank inflation ceiling 2 per cent, measure harmonize index consumer prices. this may look like subtle difference, important. for bank canada, 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent inflation-control target range. it target, ceiling. our focus midpoint make clear run monetary policy symmetrical way. that say, pay equal attention significant movement away 2 per cent—whether below. 2 bi review 17/2002 when demand strong, push economy limit capacity produce. this tend raise future inflation target midpoint. in circumstances, bank raise interest rate cool economy, return inflation target. but process also work direction. when demand weak, saw 2001, mean future inflationary pressure likely ease. so bank low interest rate stimulate economy, absorb economic slack, return inflation target. by work symmetrical way response surprise demand, inflation-targeting system help smooth peak valley business cycle. this promote sound, generally le variable, economic growth. in experience, find operate way around inflation target effective way anchor inflation expectations. indeed, recent years, inflation expectation become firmly anchor 2 per cent target. this important economy. with inflation expectation solidly anchored, investor good ass future value investments. saver confident purchase power erode unexpectedly inflation. similarly, debtor good ass real burden interest payments. wage bargain become le contentious labour disruption decrease. the duration wage financial contract lengthen considerably. all possible people confident inflation neither greatly exceed, greatly fall below, 2 per cent medium term. in short, real economy work good stable. moreover, credibility target change whole dynamic inflation process. sudden temporary swing energy prices, movement exchange rate, fee price economy way past. again, inflation expectation well anchored. i clear adopt inflation target thing happen past 10 year improve canada's economy. the federal government, provinces, proceed clean balance sheets. because that, public debt-to-gdp ratio sustainable downward path, even period economic slowdown. this improvement public sector balance sheet lead sharp increase national savings. a result, net foreign indebtedness fell peak 44 per cent gdp 1993 20 per cent today. it important continue reduce net foreign debt. in canada, particularly important baby-boom generation retires. so, base experience, i say monetary policy aim low, stable, predictable inflation fiscal policy aim reduce public debt-to-gdp ratio work well together. prudent monetary fiscal policy reinforce other's credibility. the role flexible exchange rate let turn briefly role exchange rates. this one area two country make different choices. france one dozen european country choose monetary union single currency. this remarkable effort reach crucial milestone start year. after exist electronic form three years, euro finally begin circulate note coins. by accounts, transition go extremely smoothly. the european central bank, 12 national central banks, deserve great deal credit handle well. indeed, completion process rekindle debate canada: if advantageous france 11 european country form monetary union common currency, would similar arrangement canada unite state also advantageous? after analyze cost benefits, view, separate, float currency continue make sense canada foreseeable future. let take minute explain why. a float exchange rate beneficial canada, primarily production trade structure quite different major trade partner, unite states. bi review 17/2002 3 let give couple examples. canada net exporter primary commodities, unite state net importer commodities. and unlike unite states, canada's auto industry gear heavily toward exports. we produce two car every one sell canada. because difference economic structures, major changes, large swing relative prices, affect canada unite state differently. one way another, canadian economy must adjust changes. a float exchange rate important help economy adjust economic disturbances, fluctuation world demand for, price of, products. equally importantly, also facilitate adjustment change save investment flows. it true canadian u.s. economy become integrated. it also true form monetary union, would save canadian term transaction cost convert currency hedge currency movements. so question might well asked: since europe move monetary union single currency, north america? from canadian perspective, least three major argument monetary union north america. first, europe single market goods, capital labour. in north america, single labour market. second, structure large economy euro zone similar structure canadian u.s. economies. finally, euro zone collection 12 countries. although differ size, single nation dominate group. in contrast, north america, unite state dominant, term population economic power. so yes, north american economy become integrated. but necessarily follow structure economy become alike. a long structure remain different, benefit flexible exchange rate outweigh associate transaction risk costs. for canada, best choice inflation target anchor monetary policy, distinct, float currency. a i say before, remain case foreseeable future. now let turn briefly current state canada's economy outlook future. recent economic development prospect canada the immediate impact fallout last september's tragic event unite state lead sharp increase economic uncertainty around world. this exacerbate effect global economic slowdown, become evident last summer. in circumstances, bank canada step pace interest rate reduction begin early 2001. the aim minimize economic effect terrorist act limit loss confidence home. since last september, cut target overnight interest rate 200 basis points. the total reduction since begin 2001 375 basis points. this substantial monetary ease maximum impact move year 2003. in addition, tax cut implement begin last year continue provide significant support canadian economy. further stimulus also come spend enhance national security. thus, monetary fiscal policy support economy move forward. moreover, improvement since last autumn geopolitical climate consumer confidence, north america europe. sign increase global economy turn corner firm year progresses. for reasons, bank canada expect canadian economy gain momentum 2002. while growth first half moderate, accelerate second half—to something like 3 4 per cent—and strengthen 2003. this mean late year, economy start expand rate exceed growth potential output. at point, slack build past several month begin absorbed. still, could well 2003 actual level output canadian economy reach potential level. 4 bi review 17/2002 this imply core inflation probably average 1 1/2 per cent second half 2002. total cpi inflation expect stay core rate late 2002, energy price remain near current levels. give profile output growth, bank expect total core inflation move back 2 per cent approximately two years. recent economic indicator canada show bad downturn over. a recovery underway. there several positive sign fourth quarter national account data publish last month, include strong household spending. overall, canada's economy grow 2 per cent annualized rate fourth quarter 2001. in addition, sizable reduction inventory fourth quarter. this bode well come months, low level inventory underpin future production. data first two month year show canadian economy add 82,000 new jobs. car sale continue show strength, house sector. the bank expect fix investment canada unite state start pick second half year. but much aware depend recovery business confidence, especially large multinational enterprises. how quickly strongly profit confidence firm bounce back important bear strength sustainability overall economic recovery. to sum up, canada make difficult choice recent year face challenge today's globalize economy. we find framework symmetrical inflation target float exchange rate appropriate economy. we solid anchor monetary policy, inflation expectation well grounded. fiscal health restore continue make progress bring public debt-to-gdp ratio. thank improvements, effect last year's global economic slowdown canada pronounce might been. and encourage sign turnaround world economy domestic recovery underway, prospect canadian economy favourable. bi review 16/2002 1 y v reddy: develop bond market emerge economy - issue indian experience keynote address dr y v reddy, deputy governor reserve bank india, asian conference, jointly host fimmda, pdai, thai bdc bangkok 11 march 2002. dr reddy thankful dr a. prasad, mr usha thorat officer internal debt management cell rbi assistance. * * * governor dr. tarisa watanagase, dean, yoshitomi, dr. nachiket mor, mr. joshi & friends, it give great pleasure deliver keynote address asian bond conference organise jointly thai bond deal centre (thai bdc), fix income money market dealer association india (fimmda) primary dealer association india (pdai). it matter significance major self-regulatory organisation (sros) debt market asia take initiative exchange idea experience emerge economy asia i sure conference would mutually beneficial one u gain valuable insight absorb experience countries. the importance develop domestic bond market diversify risk financial system realise since crisis asia 1997, development government security market course integrally link development bond markets. worldwide, interest subject recent past evident several initiative taken. for example, asia pacific economic co-operation (apec) launch collaborative effort subject. the imf world bank currently finalise guideline public debt management. the imf also conduct select country study public debt management india agree case study. the asian development bank institute (adbi) recently release policy recommendation design new balance financial market structure post-crisis asia. i happy mr. yoshitomi share recommendation late afternoon. the theme deputy governor meet bank international settlement (bis) last december development debt market emerge economies. i would draw heavily discussion flag issue consideration indian experience would illustrate complexity address issue specific country context. my address today initially provide overview reason advocate development bond market, follow second section give possible motivation development bond markets. the third section explain rationale development government security market justification central bank actively involve it. while section four outline key issue relate market government securities, fifth section mention aspect relate non-government corporate bond market. the sixth section select institutional issue deal role institutional investors, self-regulatory organizations, bank bond markets, credit rat agency tax regime. the conclude section make observation road ahead development debt market india. 1. why develop debt market? first, basic philosophy develop diversify financial system bank non-banks operate equity market debt market enhance risk pool risk share opportunity investor borrowers. more specifically, case ensure presence development debt market make several grounds. first, absence debt market, bank system would large otherwise would be. prevalence domestic debt market move crisis outside bank system make easy government stand back. a alan greenspan argued, coexistence domestic bond market bank system help act backstop other. in past, country like japan develop almost total reliance bank intermediation risk excessive reliance relatively open economy since non-bank intermediation may get locate outside country. it also argue domestic bond market help avoid double mismatch currency maturity. 2 bi review 16/2002 second, argue debt market facilitate efficient financial intermediation use market mechanism allocate price credit. in particular, debt market expect facilitate availability long-term fund specific us infrastructure. they also infuse great transparency process credit allocation view information contain market determine rates. in fact, e-commerce make information share le costly, hence easy develop bond market infrastructure current environment facilitate transparent market-based allocation credit. it may difficult government intervene debt market direct subsidise lend compare bank system. hence, claim debt market facilitate reduction bad loans. furthermore, since debt instrument mostly rated, investor awareness monitor greater, mitigate moral hazard arise deposit insurance case banks. third, debt market help develop derivative market thereby facilitate hedge mechanism enable great diversification risk participants. also, variety instrument possible domestic debt market may result gain saver borrowers. it also essential recognise domestic debt market may able deliver reality seek them. the efficiency bond market would depend efficiency credit rat agency (cras), standard accounting, audit disclosures, institutional infrastructure, prevalence environment enforcement contracts, etc. bond market may necessarily reduce systemic risk since bank could major player bond issuers, investor underwriters. development debt market long-term instrument would also require complementarity policy flexibility interest rates, enable legal environment, etc. though high degree transparency expected, argue sophisticate instrument like option exist, transparency debt market may automatically ensured. furthermore, domestic bond market need necessarily address fundamental issue risk management price risk. on balance, current reality would lead one believe bank system continue centre financial system emerge economies. in fact, bank likely significant direct indirect presence debt market issuers, investor underwriters. if overall environment financial sector contain problem price risk banks, bond market suffer infirmity pricing. a financial system evolving, bank loan bond contract must treat complementary extent substitutes. in view undeniable benefit multi-institutional financial structure, number country rightly devote considerable resource attention development domestic bond markets, though country may different motivation so. 2. motivation development domestic debt market the main provocation undertake task development debt market would depend extent different history culture countries, predominantly economic factor experience high inflation, transition planning, restructure economy crisis, etc. more specifically, context financial system, objective may relate finance government deficit, fund bank restructuring, create complete financial markets, avoid bank take excessive credit, risk diversification financial system, conduct monetary policy, sterilise capital inflows, provide range long-term asset pension funds, etc. the impetus hong kong instance, seem come market development strategy towards achieve efficient financial intermediation make market complete. similarly, singapore reportedly view debt market mean financial intermediation help credit allocation, development corporate bond market give high priority alternative fund source order reduce reliance bank intermediation. in restructure economy like hungary, motif appear different, viz., reduce monetisation government deficit, increase competition bank wide spread deposit advance encourage foreign investment government debt domestic currency. in second half 1990s, monetary policy consideration relate information content yield curve concern transmission mechanism monetary policy must add impetus development debt markets. recapitalisation bank appear drive force indonesia. in chile, debt market develop mainly offshoot pension reforms. the grow pool save need government bi review 16/2002 3 instrument investments, whereas government surplus. the history hundred year inflation seem create demand inflation index bonds. china view government borrow important reason financial deepen government security market provide lead development bond market. furthermore, would possible develop corporate bond market efficient benchmark government securities. in india also, large government borrow provide impetus development bond market. a system reserve bank india (rbi) fund automatic basis, government’s budget deficit concessional rate interest replace april 1997 system rbi finance temporary mismatch expenditure revenue government market align interest rates. consequent dismantle administer interest rate regime, borrow requirement government largely raise market market relate rates. a india experience capital inflow consider intervention addition foreign exchange reserves, use domestic eligible marketable bond portfolio whenever want sterilize money expansion. a deep liquid debt market naturally facilitate process sense linkage capital inflows, sterilization development debt market also consider additional reason development debt market. 3. need widen deepen government security market the relevance government security view three point view, namely government want borrow; role financial market especially debt market operation monetary policy. first, viewpoint government/fiscal authorities, development deep liquid government security market facilitate public borrow reasonable cost avoidance automatic monetisation government deficit central bank. broad well-functioning secondary market particularly important government's borrow need substantial. a well develop government security market provide flexibility debt management authority exercise various option optimize maturity well interest cost government, minimize market impact large lumpy government debt operation and, facilitate good co-ordination monetary policy debt management. second, government security market provide backbone fix income market across world since help price various debt instrument creation benchmark, enable proper evaluation risk act conduit convergence interest rate markets. in addition, gild market act channel integration various segment domestic financial market help establish inter-linkages internal external financial markets. it sometimes argue always necessary develop government security market. some country government security market government fund requirement countries, alternate benchmark develop price discovery shift single government market range non-government markets. thus, inter bank repo rates, collateralised obligations, interest rate swap top rat corporate bond gain acceptance benchmark markets. third, number country move away use direct instrument indirect instrument repos direct open market operations. government security facilitate development implement indirect instrument monetary policy. typically, treasury bill government date security ideal instrument conduct repos many emerge economies. while t-bill market serf objective raise finance government, also spur development money market. an important ingredient development money market term liquidity available central bank. if liquidity adjustment support available certainty regard quantity price, could impede development money market bank desist enter transaction other. in fact, link development money market government security important aspect development debt markets. the primary interest reserve bank india (rbi) financial market criticality act transmission channel monetary policy especially rbi move towards reliance indirect instrument monetary policy. the government security market predominant part overall debt market interest rate market provide benchmark system whole. currently, rbi monetary authority, regulator government security market, issuer manager government borrowings, centre states, 4 bi review 16/2002 regulator money market well forex markets. the rbi's concern development government security market see light, recognise regulation debt market whole, context public issue corporates trade stock exchange debt traded, regulatory jurisdiction security exchange board india. in india, rbi consider well function market government security necessary effective government debt management monetary management, serve broad interest development financial market general debt market particular. accordingly, rbi take number initiative develop primary secondary market government securities. 4. key issue relate government security market there several motivation objective central bank interest develop government security market hence issue involve vary significance country country also context stage development markets. the key issue are: relevance money market, operational aspect relate primary market, significance secondary markets, policy conflict debt monetary management dilemma market intervention. relevance development money market a money market support bond market mainly process liquidity. in addition importance money market finance positions, money market price liquidity anchor short end yield curve. the existence repo market help development active government security market vice-versa since lend borrow safe environment foster repos. where interest rate liberalise debt management monetary policy function central bank, policy coordination need maintain government security money markets. in regard money market india, basic objective recent year develop short-term yield curve deep liquidity. a four-fold strategy adopt regard. first, liquidity adjustment facility operation, comprise repo reverse repo operation auction conduct view equilibrate liquidity keep short-term interest rate within informal corridor. second, call money market develop pure inter-bank market phase withdrawal non-bank participant currently lender call money market. third, traditional sector-specific refinance support rationalize additional recourse establish liquidity facility make increasingly market-based. removal establish facility fix term move full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (laf) active agenda. fourth, money market segments, especially repo market develop lend well borrow access non-banks markets. to help process, clear corporation india ltd. (ccil) established. operational issue relate primary market ensure efficient price discovery process dominant objective operation primary market purpose put place credible system ensure transparent mechanism critical. auction technique central bank participation auction auction common method sale government securities, though security also distribute tap sales, syndication book build process. in many countries, direct participation auction restrict select investor large investor base permit enter auction designate intermediary bank primary dealers. the actual modality reach investor base would govern pragmatism fact even choice auction technique even combination technique may circumstance link permit pattern participation. a regard technique, discriminatory price auction keep away investor winner curse, whereas danger irresponsible bid collusion uniform dutch type auction. country move discriminatory uniform price auctions, settle wisdom type auction better. an interest variant merit consideration combination feature auctions, i.e., discriminatory price auction ceiling, order mitigate winner curse. bi review 16/2002 5 in general, central bank participation auction best avoided, become necessary, central bank ought participate without compete bidders. there distinction central bank buy government security accord compel so. in many countries, either law prohibit central bank participation primary auction indonesia peru central bank voluntarily restrict participation case malaysia, philippine hungary. in india, auction method favoured, though auction could base yield, price discount, without underwrite commitment primary dealer discretion rbi. both discriminatory uniform price auction technique use former dominant multiple price auction format predominantly use government security issuance uniform price auction use 91-day t-bills. in context need attract retail investors, bid receive non-competitive basis within notify amount cut-off weight average yield derive auction. the question central bank participation outsider primary auction arise india since rbi conduct auction. the rbi, however, use take private placement liberally past recently extraordinary situations, also decide voluntarily move devolvement itself. the fiscal responsibility budget management bill, consideration, propose explicit provision prohibit rbi purchase government security primary market. instrument country experience different type instruments, suit unique circumstances, broaden markets. hungary instance gradually move away short maturity bond long-term fix rate government bond enable fact avoid hyper-inflation. similarly, israel favour simple plain vanilla bond although presence variety instrument (consumer price index) cpi-linked, fixed-rate variable-rate bond progressively lengthen maturities. chile favour inflation-indexed bonds. the rbi experiment different type instrument fix coupon bonds, zero coupon bonds, capital index bond recently float rate bonds. most bonds, however, fix coupon variety though recently float rate bond issue prove attractive. maturity profile on maturity profile, ideal solution, trade-off long-term short-term maturity consideration market preference, cost government, bunch maturities, development yield curve recognised. development government benchmark security essential element well function government security market require issuer make conscious effort avoid fragmentation necessary consolidate issuance. typically, benchmark security domestic market 2, 3, 5 10 years, country like usa issue security 30 years. in india, government revive borrow market rate 1992-93, new maturity compress 10 years. this necessary time coincide period high interest rate cycle, successful implementation auction system early stage move market relate rate interest require shorten maturity structure. this result bunch maturity well render liquidity management difficult. in last two three years, rbi’s preference towards long maturities, fix rate bring balance maturity structure. there would time government reluctant lock perceive high rates, bank face large asset liability mismatch great interest rate risk. recognise this, rbi reintroduce float rate bond attempt develop strip market government security segment. a regard consolidation, rbi extensively use technique re-openings exist security basis price-based auction. thus, advantage take large gross borrow programme lengthen maturity profile consolidate profile. issuance calendar base first principles, good provide clear timely information borrow programme issuance calendar, addition maturity profile outstanding stock, 6 bi review 16/2002 redemption calendar, etc. in operational terms, issuance calendar tackle trade-off certainty market flexibility issuer term market timing. the uncertain trend term cash flow pattern government india constrain publication issuance calendar. in respect t-bills, pre-announced issuance calendar auction evolved. recognise large market borrow programme uncertainty cash flow make issuance full-fledged calendar somewhat difficult stage, finance minister announce budget speech recently, calendar auction government financial year begin april 2002. role primary dealer many country establish system license primary dealer (pds) government security important intermediary promote activity government security market. typically, pd assign specific responsibility like minimum bid requirements, give two-way quotes, provide market information central bank, etc. in cases, pd give exclusive right primary auctions, special facility money market operations, open market operations, underwrite commission, etc. pd play vital role development secondary market. by market, price discount available information, take trade positions, also render valuable assistance central bank provide late market information, design new instruments, etc. since pd generally highly leveraged, regulatory oversight pd appear warrant common feature among central bank periodically review performance pd make continuation operation performance-based. an interest feature merit notice rat pd establish poland. the institution pd adopt india 1996 develop primary secondary market government securities. the main objective promote institutional mechanism pd strengthen institutional infrastructure government security market order make vibrant, liquid broad base ensure development underwrite market make capability government security outside rbi latter could gradually shed functions. in words, marketisation government borrow vacation rbi primary market environment large borrow programme facilitate conscious development institution pds. pd obligation include give annual bid commitment, underwrite primary issuance offer two-way quotes. in return, pd extend liquidity support rbi access call money market borrower lenders. incidentally, rbi experiment system satellite dealer (sds) 1996 serve second tier pd government security market particular objective promote retail segment. however, review find useful expect give up. gild mutual fund mutual fund dedicate almost exclusively investment government security call gild mutual fund establish india april 1996. currently, 13 mutual fund country. mutual fund regulate security exchange board india (sebi). in tune development take place debt market since 1996, scheme gild fund currently review rbi. give small size repo market period consequent uncertainty regard availability liquidity market, gild fund give limit liquidity support rbi. consider liquidity support introduce extraordinary measure fact repo market develop expect become liquid operationalisation ccil, case review liquidity support gild fund rbi. significance secondary market a diversify investor base vary demand, maturity profile risk preference admittedly important ensure high liquidity stable demand market. apart banks, pd mutual funds, retail investor foreign investor also play role widen investor base. cater need retail investor often essential part overall strategy develop diversify investor base. retail investment also contribute stable demand government security provide cushion impact volatility. bi review 16/2002 7 development repo markets, short selling, role benchmark mark market valuation, etc., contribute boost secondary market liquidity. the practice short sell security facilitate security lend borrow prohibit emerge market necessary recognise rationale this. no doubt, ability sell short positive effect increase market liquidity price efficiency since enable participant differ view market trade actively, short sales, potential increase market volatility risk especially market assume large position capable handling. a regard benchmarks, many country take effort towards consolidation creation benchmark procedure depend composition stock exist debt much debt propose raised. another issue relate whether move marked-to-market investment raise risk term stop-loss sale, etc. while marked-to-market serf encourage secondary market trading, necessary liquid market correctly price securities. the rbi take number measure enhance secondary market liquidity government security market. these include permit diversify participant base, improve fungibility bond reopenings, stabilize money market liquidity adjustment facility (laf), develop repo market, encourage operationalisation clear corporation india ltd., initiate negotiate deal system trading, enforce marked-to-market requirement valuation investments, ensure delivery v payment system settlement government security scripless form, disseminate detail information public daily basis respect government security trade market. in india, initially rbi announce yield curve market year-end valuation. currently, fimmda, self-regulatory organisation, announce yield curve, methodology approve rbi. incidentally, although statutory liquidity ratio (slr) bank system 25 per cent, bank voluntarily hold 37 per cent liability government securities. recognise risk involve large exposures, reserve bank india (rbi) create path bank reach target investment fluctuation reserve period. policy conflict debt monetary management irrespective whether debt management function vest central bank not, coordination important avoid conflict cash debt management government central bank operations. the time amount government security issuance may always coincide compulsion central bank's monetary policy. the government may wish issue security time market illiquid central bank need consider whether extent provide additional liquidity. liquidity provide secondary market central bank debt monetary manager, option operate primary market. currently, almost central bank harmoniously coordinate fisc, policy operational level regard debt management. there general agreement fiscal agent create problem central bank separation debt management function central bank would remove friction. in situation high fiscal deficit lack fiscal assurance responsibility, separation two function could increase risk macro instability. control fisc, develop financial market set place institutional technological infrastructure ideally precede separation. the monetary policy statement rbi october 2001 clearly indicate intention regard condition would need fulfil make separation possible. the rbi acknowledge although desirable principle, separation debt monetary management function medium-term process dependent fulfillment three conditions, viz., development financial markets, reasonable control fiscal deficit necessary legislative changes. of course, institutional arrangement establish separate debt office need think through. the federal nature country add another dimension issue namely state central government public debt office replace rbi. one method could set independent corporate entity structure manage debt centre states. 8 bi review 16/2002 dilemma intervention market on proposition since market mature case central bank intervention even price volatility, general consensus intervention normal course. there many central bank never intervene bond market smoothen volatility. in fact, low volatility impede secondary market development prevent hedge instrument developing, turn necessary deal volatility. there however, situation justify interventionist approach central banks. for instance, september 11, 2001 incident require federal reserve involve intimately market. india many situation like border conflict u sanctions, etc. rbi show willingness present market without create expectation market maker. thus, need differentiate normal market condition exogenous shock take view intervention. while case exogenous shocks, intervention expression intention may necessary, normal market condition option always available but, actual exercise convincingly dictate evolve circumstance directional preference strengthen market forces. on intervention policy rbi, three area need highlighted. first, money market, rbi concern mainly liquidity management liquidity adjustment facility effectively operate interest rate corridor repo reverse repo rates. second, context market borrow programme, rbi intervention private placement extraordinary circumstance since rbi responsibility raise government debt. in words, rbi’s assessment market would position absorb debt without disruption, resort private placement. third, bid auction unacceptable, rbi take devolvement, actual practice negligible last two years. primary dealer underwrite issue government paper pay underwrite commission. thus, twin combination high fiscal deficit narrow liquid market necessitate rbi intervention interest financial stability. there are, however, rule regard sale security take private placement term maximum period hold etc. it rbi’s discretion offload security take private placement condition conducive. when capital flow occur capacity monetise government debt circumscribe sterilisation, maneuverability conduct market borrow constrained. in current financial year, instance, rbi add $ 8 billion foreign currency reserves. to meet externally induce shock forex markets, rbi past conduct extraordinary operation process consider essential create firewall prevent transmission bond market. a by-product erect firewall that, whenever central bank resort monetary action exchange market considerations, even bond yield move sharply sentiments, tend create expectation liquidity action bond markets. these complexity concern learn live with. 5. development corporate bond market to develop corporate bond market, authority actively consider increase supply high quality paper, create adequate institutional investor base, ensure variety instrument differ maturity mount support infrastructure, etc. emphasis also need place efficient legal system important infrastructure deep liquid bond markets. among legal reforms, bankruptcy law capacity seize collateral particularly important. experience also indicate many emerge countries, since risk transfer creditor bond market compare banks, preponderant bias towards bank deposit among household saver many countries. in words, development domestic corporate debt market bind long draw process bank continue special dominant financial system emerge economies. in mexico, experience large company issue bond abroad, small company prefer borrow banks. in chile, substitutability bank bond finance company raise bond prepay bank debt. pre-crisis, korea large corporate bond market big lesson episode much government intervention (either exchange rate implicit explicit guarantees) result serious distortion markets. in many emerge economies, corporate bond market fragmented. poland example fragment illiquid corporate bond market characterise private placement cross holdings. bi review 16/2002 9 peru experience situation good credit go bank bad credit go bond markets; hence justify reluctance invest bonds. on hand, raise contrary view-point bond market developed, bad credit could go banks. there is, however, evidence far moreover ex ante well-priced badly-priced loans. there recognition need develop securitization market relate issue. securitization instrument act risk transfer mechanism could work advantage bank investors. in korea, non-performing loan spur market; hongkong establish mortgage corporation. in many countries, market nascent stage, either need complicate legal change credit environment enable securitization. for instance, hungary non-performing loan mortgage household; hence mortgage exist warrant securitisation involve development market. the reserve bank india's role development corporate bond market indirect govern interest monetary policy transmission, government securities, stability well efficiency financial sector whole. a mentioned, major preoccupation government security market reason explained. the corporate bond market commence significant way public sector undertake encourage take recourse late eighties, private corporate sector's debt requirement meet largely development financial institution banks. with development capital market establishment rat agencies, corporates development financial institution start take recourse debt, since reform commenced. more recently, special purpose vehicle fund infrastructure promote state government come fore especially since back state government guarantees. corporate debt market sense private corporate sector raise debt public issuance capital market insignificant part indian debt market. when talk debt market india, really refer government security market, account 75 per cent outstanding stock nearly 95 per cent volume trade secondary market. about 90 per cent corporate debt market privately placed. in privately place market, 58 per cent issuance financial institution banks, public private sector 26 per cent represent issue public sector undertake central/state government guarantee bonds. two-thirds total issue account public sector. 20 per cent total corporate debt issuance private non-financial sector. most issuer corporate debt market aaa aa rat borrower 10 per cent may unrated. the investor mostly institution retail investors. hence, first stage development bond markets, securitisation take place, disintermediation process partial. transparency limit primary secondary markets, liquidity poor many bond hold till redemption. the legal recourse case non-payment interest principal complicate bankruptcy law afford little comfort. the legal regulatory requirements, account audit standard issuer infrastructure trading, clear settlement need develop much case market become deep liquid. a non-transparent practice market matter concern, rbi issue guideline june 2001 regard due diligence undertaken, disclosure obtain credit risk analysis make regard privately place investment especially unrated instruments. bank advise adopt internal system rat issue non-borrowers, whether rat otherwise, adopt prudential limit mitigate adverse impact concentration illiquidity. bank also advise put place proper risk management system capture analyse risk take timely remedial measures. a review non-slr investment light recent development reveal ease mobilise fund privately place debt issue could lead use fund risky purpose disclose offer document. in order contain risk arise non-slr investment portfolio bank fis, particular private placement route, propose rbi issue prudential guideline observe banks. the draft guideline circulate bank fis october 2001. these guideline primarily focus need strengthen internal rat systems, fix prudential limit sub-limits, review rat change respect issuer non-performing investments; important, disclosure ‘notes accounts’ regard issuer composition non-performing investments. a announce mid-term monetary credit policy year 2001 – 2002, rbi constitute work group chairmanship mr.s.r.iyer, chairman credit information bureau india 10 bi review 16/2002 ltd., evolve framework collect share banks/ fis information private placement debt prescribe minimum requirement issuer meet banks/fis consider investment debt. the report due soon. the major pre-occupation rbi regard corporate debt ensure bank financial institution protect risk current state market also aid process qualitative change corporate debt markets. 6. institutional issue there several institutional issue relate debt market critical necessarily interrelated. these many, section focus them, namely, institutional investor debt markets, self-regulatory organisations, banks, credit rat agency tax regime. role institutional investor there wide consensus regard need institutional build development debt markets, though country approach differently. the notion pension reform important instrument process generally uphold although case regulatory limit investment risky asset interest financial stability. there several approach improve institutional investors' interest domestic debt markets. for example, indonesia currently embark substantial regulatory reform encourage institutional investors. hungary emphasize development mutual funds. some country like philippine concentrate market securitisation. hong kong prefer portfolio approach, great role credit rat agencies, build collective investment vehicle explore option like credit enhancements, rather increase supply government quasi-government paper whet appetite pension fund (pfs). in general, pfs encourage invest government security case chile, indonesia singapore although country like hungary philippine permit portfolio diversification allow investment within limits, non-government paper. it also observe many pension provident fund voluntarily invest government security minimum requirements. in case india, investment provident fund govern government regulation, indicate 40 per cent incremental accretion year invest central state government securities. this follow 40 per cent bonds/securities public financial institution certificate deposit issue public sector bank maximum 10 per cent permit rat private corporate debentures. investment category usually mop development financial institutions, financial intermediaries. moreover, pension fund conservative, prefer invest government securities. thus, resource pfs preempt government dfis, make linkage pfs corporate debt market tenuous. role self-regulatory organisation self-regulation fast emerge viable co-operative framework regulator market participant come together towards fulfilment common goal objectives. by create unique combination private interest official oversight, sros emerge effective efficient form regulation complex dynamic financial service industry. international experience self-regulation suggest power self-regulatory organisation vary significantly. in complete form, self-regulation encompass authority create, amend, implement enforce rule conduct respect entity subject sro’s jurisdiction resolve dispute arbitration means. typically, authority derive statutory delegation power non-governmental entity. in countries, sros formal regulatory status nevertheless provide code good conduct master agreement perform important role standardisation common practice without formal regulatory status. it necessary recognise exercise authority form sro raise fundamental issue accountability monopoly status. there merit constantly review representative nature sros responsiveness overall public interest considerations. bi review 16/2002 11 in context indian debt market, self-regulatory body like fix income money market derivative association india (fimmda) primary dealer association india (pdai) encourage recent past, part reform process give impetus development bond money market india. these body serve crucial layer regulator market contribute develop new benchmark product besides provide train development support participants. they formulate guideline dispute resolution mechanism also involve process develop standard practice code conduct. both pdai fimmda represent technical advisory committee (tac) reserve bank india government security money markets. fimmda involve task valuation central government securities. the daily yield curve base benchmark central government bond fast emerge accept benchmark price securities. in addition this, fimmda also contribute develop guideline documentation repo, securitised debt several debt market instruments. the activity sros closely coordinate policy rbi function also carefully constantly observe rbi. bank bond market the relationship bank bond market complex especially emerge country dominance bank financial intermediation set gradually decline bank critical role development debt markets. bank operate issuers, investors, underwriter guarantors. bank may also securitise loan thus participate long-term debt markets. in process, regulator bank responsibility ensure banks' participation debt markets, issuer investor consistent risk management. the vagary debt market impact balance sheet banks, banks’ confidence participation debt market influence growth liquidity markets. in countries, bank active participant equity market small presence debt market may partly explain le develop nature debt markets, particularly asia. in india, bank system incidentally dominate public sector, play pioneer role initiate growth mutual funds, merchant bank financial services. structurally, bank permit operate subsidiary asset management companies, pds, merchant bank mutual funds. the development financial institution also play role dominate promote credit rat agencies, sponsor national stock exchanges, depositories, etc. in regard government security segment market, account 75 per cent stock, 60 per cent stock hold bank system. a regard corporate debt segment, private placement public issue, half issuance bank financial institutions. the corporates, especially large corporate segment move bank advance debt market bank also participate both. in background, rbi continuously review nature extent linkage adopt wide range mechanism enhance efficiency impart stability. phase deregulation limit banks' investment non-government debt instrument accompany exposure norms, prudential guidelines, valuation norm debt instrument asset liability management guidelines. the maturity profile issue innovative instrument government security market also attune

occasion measure contemplate india development debt market especially government security market articulate rbi. in conclude part address, i list milestone reach within one- two-year time span. on legal side, several measure way. first, finance minister, union budget 2002-03, announced, new government security bill, since receive concurrence state legislators, replace exist public debt act 1944, would introduce current session parliament. the new act facilitate wide participation government security market provide necessary protection beneficial owner constituent subsidiary general ledger (sgl) accounts, enable lien mark pledge security raise loan government securities, recognition electronic form record maintenance, enlargement dematerialization facility bond ledger accounts, liberalisation norm relate nomination legal representation, facilitate easy transfer allow strip securities. second, fiscal responsibility budget management bill already consider parliamentary stand committee finance also expect introduce parliament session. the bill seek limit fiscal deficit, place limit public debt eliminate rbi’s participation primary market issue date government securities, thereby pave way separation debt management monetary management. the amendment rbi act, consideration government, would take away mandatory responsibility rbi act debt manager government india thereby facilitate separation, one major medium-term objectives. third, pursuance recommendation expert committee set rbi government india. new bill also propose introduce parliament strengthen creditors’ right foreclosure enforcement security bank financial institutions. this bill also enable securitisation money lock long-term loans, thereby strengthen legal basis transaction new debt securities. for development market encourage retail participation, particularly mid-segment investor like urban co-operative banks, nbfcs, trusts, etc., non-competitive bid scheme allow 5 per cent amount issue select auction government introduce january 2002. the amount could revise 10 per cent keep view, response. float rate bond (frbs) reintroduce recently two launch november december 2001. certain percentage total government borrow could earmark frbs provide good hedge instrument banks/other investor minimise interest rate risk. with clarification issue government india recently tax treatment zero coupon bonds, deck clear introduce strip would satisfy segmental need market. necessary preparatory work software development take up. to provide transparency stability market, announce finance minister recent union budget, calendar primary issue first half next fiscal announce soon. on institutional development side, clear corporation india limit (ccil), set april 2001, commence operation since february 15, 2002. ccil, act central counter party government security trade accept clear settlement negotiate deal system (nds) automate connectivity delivery versus payment (dvp) settlement system. it provide guarantee settlement transaction government security now. the reduction number transaction settlement rbi bring associate risk, cost time completion settlement. the establishment ccil expect pave way entry non-sgl participant repos market repos corporate debt instrument thereby improve liquidity debt market. we hope become possible within next one year. the ccil also act central counter party settlement forex transactions. this expect put place within next six months. on technology side, part nds-pdo computerisation project, negotiate deal system provide screen base electronic deal system trade government security money market instrument include repos electronic bid primary auction central state 14 bi review 16/2002 government securities/treasury bill also commence operation since february 15, 2002. at stage, possible invite bid primary auction nd daily repos liquidity adjustment facility (laf) report secondary market trade near real time basis. the

service investor completion primary market operation seamless linkage settlement system. very soon, also intend place real time basis, information available nd public domain. this facilitate transparency also enable banks/pds service client good various part country. to facilitate fast fund transfer debt market settlements, electronic fund transfer (eft) facility, available 13 centre cover 8,000 branches, available 40 centre next 6 month integration sbi manage clear house cover almost 75 per cent transactions. contract state art real time gross settlement system (rtgs) award october 2001 expect operationalised first quarter 2003, thereby facilitate fund settlement real time gross basis, ensure finality settlement. by next year, security trade settlement link rtgs. 8. conclusion the road ahead next year thus fairly clear way forward, several issue need addressed. let stage flag issue benefit deliberations. first, heterogeneity market participant term transaction needs, risk assessment investment horizon need encourage lend great stability market. with liberalisation activation insurance sector, long-term save debt instrument bind increase debt market important role play regard. mr.rangachary, chairman insurance regulatory development authority (irda) raise issue lengthen maturity government security rbi assure fulfillment requirement insurance sector. also, pension reform make start recent union budget. this bind result increase demand long-term debt securities. in addition, slr requirement cooperative bank nbfcs increasing. it would necessary ensure easy availability government security meet demand. second, context great thrust market player different perceptions, retail government security assume great importance. a three-pronged strategy would seem ideal viz., great role pd provide liquidity exit route available always retail investor; bank major custodian facilitate investment ease transaction retail demand; establish order-driven trade system stock exchange adequate safeguards. third, view in-principle decision take discontinue system satellite dealers, time appropriate review system pd term number system, obligations, activity regulation. in regard, decision rbi already take bring pd supervision board financial supervision rbi. fourth, regard non-government debt markets, major issue private placement squarely address sooner later. in context, ensure great transparency, adequate disclosures, enhance efficiency, proper account standard would large interest development debt markets. let conclude submit rbi keen understand theory practice debt market eschew ideological extremes. we want gain experience others chart course action. we aware complexity difficult road ahead. we approach task caution, humility flexibility, determination reach international best practice suit india's evolve needs. let wish deliberation success look forward learn expertise experience distinguish participants. thank you. bi review 16/2002 1 a wellink: the euro, major challenge catalyst europe speech dr a wellink, president de nederlandsche bank president bank international settlements, dutch business round table, zürich, 12 march 2002. * * * introduction it zürich 55 year ago winston churchill hold famous speech future europe. he depict unite state europe would put end century conflict bring prosperity peoples. indeed, since come long way actually fulfil grand vision, although without switzerland - nation address - play active role. of course, many reason - mostly historical -political nature - switzerland choose stay outside process european integration. in respect, i certainly want pas judgement. nevertheless, find surround ever close union member state also introduce single currency. in light, i would like elaborate introduction euro it´s consequence european union - take account, possible - position country. first, i shall briefly touch actual changeover euro begin year. then i shall go merit monetary union already bring last years. finally, i give vision future challenge dynamic euro. changeover ten year treaty maastricht, euro finally find way pocket 300 million europeans. this unprecedented process - comprise distribution 239,000 tonne coin 2 million kilometre note - outstanding logistical success. moreover, doom scenario predict mass forgery, robbery threat public security prove wrong. of course, clear, central scenario tight planning, especially within european system central banks, provide firm foundation, operation remain highly dependent local players; transporters, retailers, bankers, administrators, law-enforcers. in fact, also number swiss company (lanqart (paper), ovd kinegram) involve develop produce high quality euro notes. the effort local player sheer public enthusiasm euro central success changeover. indeed, sale so-called eurokits, people average already 14 eurocoins pocket 1 january. this “euro-eagerness” explain first week, already 75% cash payment euro. in netherlands, 75% level already reach second day, one week, changeover virtually completed. a such, without pride i proclaim country european champion - though could entirely wash bitter aftertaste miss year´s world championship soccer. in hindsight, people felt well-informed euro find euro introduction way drama predicted. finally, 28 january, dutch guilder first former euroland currency practice lose legal tender status. to ease mind dutch roundtable member present, guilder - certain condition - still exchange euro central bank; coin 2007 banknote even 2032. one tiny spot otherwise shiny, new currency anecdotal report price change associate changeover. there is, however, little evidence significant effect aggregate inflation figure euro area. accord european statistical office, eurostat, effect likely fall within range 0.0% 0.16%. on country-by-country basis, possibility round price would, course, link conversion rate national currency. for example, calculate back euro german mark much easy euro dutch guilders. in addition, cyclical position economy would influence direction round may occurred. 2 bi review 16/2002 for netherlands, research suggest might slight upward effect price level 0,2% 0,4%. overall, competition peer pressure consumer organisation would clearly limit room manoeuvre. moreover, possible one-off effect compensate increase price transparency year come. the merit euro far this bring reason netherlands decide give beloved currency. foremost, euro political project dutch could afford stay out. integration supranational context protect interest small european players. in economic terms, euro increase macro-economic stability cross-border price transparency. it reduce transaction cost eliminate exchange rate risks. moreover, euro catalyst economic reform integration. in respect, economist andrew rise recently publish interest article common currency arrangements. use cross-country panel data, show country currency, trade substantially different currencies. interestingly, impact common currency also large fix exchange rate regime, reduce volatility retain separate monies. in light, euro ice internal market cake broaden deepen scale. but, always, proof cake eating. indeed, three year euro´s virtual existence confirm dutch political economic motives. though tend mislead exchange rate, euro prove rock solid low inflation and, it, credible european central bank. now, hard currency hand, public become aware fact euro euro, internal stability euro counts. stable price development low level long-term interest rate provide firm basis growth. in addition, euro end uncontrolled spend dynamic past. indeed, eu unique set standard sound government finance stability growth pact. in light, probably hear early warn european commission recommend germany portugal. a consequence, country strongly re-committed budgetary consolidation close balance rule pact. the outcome clearly reflect respect country involve pact, underline credibility macro-economic policy framework general. thus, euro offer stable environment government business. finally, euro already make spectacular impact financial market europe. these become broad deeper, sharp rise volume capital issue spread credit quality. compare 1998, total international bond issuance euro doubled, compare well level dollar-bonds. the sharp rise corporate bond market increase finance possibility enhance merger & acquisition activity europe. switzerland euro be close euro-territory, swiss also reap euro fruits, partly, term big investment borrow opportunity euro-market. in addition, trade environment improve price transparency compare potential trade partner le exchange rate risks. on downside, potential exchange rate volatility remains, experience frank euro. give business service tourism central swiss economy, doubt euro coin note increasingly pop cross border. indeed, large retailer appear accept euro large number cash dispenser major city border produce euro notes. i hear city even ticket machine car park make “euro-fähig”. some point possible parallel use euro economy surround euro area. in fact, british first introduce notion parallel currency back early seventies, negotiation maastricht. a alternative monetary union, want intangible european currency unit compete national money. should european currency prove stable successful, would law nature become sole legal tender. along lines, helmut kohl argue recently switzerland would adopt euro 2010 latest. bi review 16/2002 3 however, i think mature country uk, sweden switzerland, likely take euro national currency without political integration eu. in words, part - commit - economic monetary union. here, draw parallel with, example, limit role u dollar canada - despite relative economic weight u strong trade relation context north american free trade area. future challenge dynamic euro it appears, i already look crystal ball, let move future challenge dynamic euro europe. the dynamic euro clearly lie expectation pressure market public opinion large. a good example recent agreement eu cost cross border bank transfer substantially reduced. in similar vein, economic agent simply accept cross border security transaction expensive within us. therefore, european parliament recently accept report, prepare chairmanship baron lamfalussy, foresee speeding-up decision-making elimination barrier european security market. this plan part ambitious eu programme create truly integrate financial market 2005. this political spin-off limit eu alone. for example, european commission recently open discussion switzerland, third countries, bank secrecy fiscal treatment savings. i understand swiss side, sensitive dossier link field negotiation schengen european immigration policy. it go show even third country impact euro surpass economic domain. clearly, euro enable “e” emu reach critical mass necessary progress many policy areas. in sense, deepen financial market enhance labour mobility, example portability pension social security entitlement across borders. more importantly, sign labour market flexibility improving. thus, european labour force tend absorb cyclical fluctuation effectively. in similar vein, wage negotiation appear adjust fast change economic conditions, inflation expectation decreased. this change behaviour reflection fact euro-countries exchange rate flexibility long available neutralise structural deficiencies. the extent success determine one, major factor - european policy maker must recognise euro dynamic live expectation long-term integration. here lie central challenge follow introduction euro: politician deliver. in sense, european council, convene four days´ time barcelona, put political weight behind liberalisation energy market deadline financial service action plan. moreover, council commit - example - speedy adoption european take-over patent directives, table decades. conclusion let conclude. a representative deutsche bank recently say ´there lot positive euro speak last couple years, nothing lead good growth´. i disagree; virtual euro bring macro-economic stability increase dynamic internal market, financial market particular. moreover, changeover tangible euro major success thank great acceptance enthusiasm around europe common currency. the historical political importance euro “an ever close union among people europe” (preamble treaty rome) without doubt. however, i agree one need put money mouth is. the benefit euro reap full dynamic acknowledged. in respect, euro catalyst growth employment, challenge european policy maker shape right climate. in way, swiss also face challenge - more, eu brink sizeable enlargement. follow winston churchill´s address half century ago, time might come sensitive question sovereignty neutrality long tilt balance play active role europe. in fact, historic break point might reach recent, public majority 4 bi review 16/2002 support membership unite nations. should switzerland ever decide take part european integration, i convince embrace euro warmly dutch 1 january. bi review 15/2002 1 glenn stevens: economic performance issue 2002 speech mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, australian industry group "economy 2002 - forecast industry prospects", sydney, 6 march 2002. * * * thank australian industry group invitation return annual conference. it pleasure here. since third appearance here, i think might useful give brief history past couple year prelude make observation current state things, issue year ahead. the world economy a know, year 2000 strong year global growth. in year, world gdp rise almost 5 per cent, growth major country (the g7) run 3½ per cent. this lead us, enjoy strong performance second half 1990s, though growth confine us, number country quite well, including, particular, australia. the asian region generally recover crisis 1997 1998, several country rid global boom spend information technology. japan perhaps conspicuous exception, weak performance overall 1990s – hold g7 aggregate mention quite noticeably. but towards end 2000, begin become clear slow u economy, talk about, seen, several years, finally begin occur. at time, expectation low growth major economy 2001 precede year, still growth average rates. then, early month 2001, assessment health u economy, extension much rest world, revise dramatically. for closely watch u economy, bell ring early january last year, reduction interest rate federal reserve, undertake normally schedule meetings. that follow sequence policy change aggressive compare experience precede decade. when meet year ago, then, period expectation move quickly, international scene australian economy. perception world economy worsen noticeably subsequent months. those australian economy worsen well, though far, long, abroad. it reasonable claim sentiment australian economy reach low point around march-april last year. since then, perception improved, reflect actual course economy, hold well give global downturn. talk recession america begin grow, though vigorous debate time. by june 2001, manufacture sector u economy contract year. the exceptionally strong growth demand itc product initially disguise weakness broadly manufacturing, strength fade 2001. employment begin fall. there active debate whether constitute "recession" normal sense word. then event 11 september 2001 occurred, end debate pretty quickly. pessimist optimist alike revise assessment growth worry possibility much pronounce long-lasting contraction u economy. to date, however, fear bear out. it true initial shock confidence us. it also true long-term response terrorist event could well considerable importance economic performance. high cost security insurance borne. way business organise themselves, good service produce sector us, may well change. on top this, no-one foretell way military response terrorism may change world, either strategically economically. but far, path u economy observe since attack show remarkably little last direct impact beyond initial disruption last weeks. the financial system quickly back operation. pattern consumer behaviour apparently affect briefly. 2 bi review 15/2002 industrial output, fell year prior attacks, look though may stop fall long thereafter, picture corroborate important survey sector. there recession, accord u national bureau economic research, cause attacks. that much clear fact nber evidence declare recession little post-attack data: data early year mostly relied. moreover, recession begin march 2001, nber suggest – is, almost year ago – would normally expect see sign turn point get close now. the behaviour manufacture production orders, inventories, labour market data, financial market price consistent idea. to cap off, course news last week real gdp final quarter 2001 rise little early estimated. so surprise people recently begin talk increasingly shape pick-up u growth. the forecaster poll consensus economics collectively increase forecast u growth 2002 quite substantially ask february – even prior late gdp revision. if see indeed first stage recovery, continues, recession 2001 mild indeed historical standards. that may well mean recovery pretty moderate affair compare previous upswings. there also one two apparent imbalance might slow business cycle upswing come quarters. exceptionally high level business investment recent year raise question whether might excess capacity areas. u equity price remain high historical standards, may subject correction. certainly profitability u corporation appear particularly poor present, ordinarily conducive expand investment. some argue household financially stretched. how play remain seen. nonetheless, weight opinion recently become optimistic month ago, without reason. an improve u outlook, come fruition, good region world. in asia, already see sign stabilisation industrial output pronounce contraction 2001. this effect back supply chain slump demand computer information technology product last year. while shape pick-up area remain far clear, contraction least appear abated. european growth slow anticipate 2001 – indeed economy euro zone record growth us. sign cyclical turn point emerge well, though early days. japan, well known, another story altogether. contractionary deflationary force continued, arguably become stronger, past year. restore japan economic health long process. be japan continue recent performance, materially bad – seem consensus view – growth world economy total start look 2002 progresses. measure year average basis, consensus forecaster suggest g7 country record growth 1 per cent 2002. this number 2001, chart shows, conceal pronounce pick-up profile growth year – zero 2001 2½ per cent 2002. bi review 15/2002 3 the australian economy let turn australian economy. a i sure well aware, affect global recession, channels. the obvious one reduction export growth. eighteen month ago, export value grow 25–30 per cent, growth price underlie quantity contribute half overall increase. that growth stop completely recent year. part tourism sector affect quite badly decline international travel collapse ansett. australian businesses, especially large businesses, look abroad quite actively, confidence cannot help affect unfold global story. my impression that, across wide range firms, manager respond threat difficult time curtail discretionary spend thing like travel, advertising, consultant like. they also, one must presume, look carefully plan capital expenditure. in addition, general populace daily diet read difficulty u countries. in light this, perhaps remarkable that, available evidence, economy seem record quite reasonable growth 2001 and, base preliminary data available, early part 2002. the response business survey suggest begin increase investment spend again. consumer confidence also hold well. hence, best judge, economy continue expand, reasonable prospect continue near term. nor due current strength house sector. this point i make detail elsewhere, even strip contribution house – operate direction recent year – find moderate growth economy past couple years, order 2½ per cent. in past twelve month least, compare well outcome us, europe, japan much asia. it slower, course, 4–5 per cent growth 1998 1999. but slow always go occur levels, context widespread recession around world, australia's performance good, much good would anticipate performance previous global downturn extrapolated. to attribute favourable outcome? a point recent statement monetary policy, rare external event, own, precipitate recession australia. to sure, impact effect event past quite substantial and, doubt, "multiplier" effect shock economy. but economy typically grow 3-4 per cent, shock affect production 1 even 2 per cent need something else work precipitate contraction economy overall. there usually need slump domestic demand precipitate outright contraction overall gdp. that occur because, say, excess capital spend businesses, excessive leverage, lead sharp correction investment (and employment), exacerbate slowdown already way external events. it might occur shock come along fundamentally erode business profitability hence reduce prospect investment. it might occur domestic macroeconomic policies, respond belatedly serious inflation pressure, face need tighten abruptly late business cycle. a point several occasion governor, extent problem occasion has, judge, small. true, rise inflation occurred, bank belief tighten phase 1999–2000 address longer-term problem might threaten front. we therefore felt could ease policy 2001, considerable time ahead likely peak inflation. that inflation expectation remain well anchor past year help this. investment excessive overall (though rule individual "mistakes") and, whole, business appear over-leveraged. this mean likelihood rising, rather falling, investment come year. the recent survey capital expenditure intention confirm occurring; indeed, suggest pace strengthen considerably second half year – although course early estimate expenditure. profit productivity it probably worth spend little time profits. business affect rise price input past couple years, result decline exchange rate. in addition, moderate slowdown economy presumably affect earnings. a result, 4 bi review 15/2002 corporate sector gross operate earn tend weaken, though recent data suggest decline may ended. there much large decline profit us. the chart below, prepare staff economic area, undertake comparison corporate sector profit national account share gdp, u australia. the australian data adjust remove interest cost depreciation make comparable way u data usually published. the australian profit share high us, make much difference level – possible difference relative size incorporate non-incorporated sectors, extent public versus private sector ownership capital stock, on. but trends, level relative longer-term averages, meaningfully compared. the difference extent fall profit since 1998 quite striking. u profit back 1990 levels; australian profit similar post-recession average, look nothing like recession scenario. this obviously partly downturn economy milder. but also make good prospect growth short term, greatly lessen likelihood abrupt adjustment investment, employment. long term, prospect profit rely heavily productivity performance, issue business policymaking community vital interest. productivity key business sustain profitable performance community whole since productivity growth ultimately source high live standards. it well know australian productivity growth accelerate 1990s, rate one percentage point per year high observe precede ten fifteen years. (this was, incidentally, high average rate productivity growth great degree acceleration productivity see u period.) it coincidence profit relatively well period, able co-exist rise real wages. during past couple years, rate expansion productivity first slow markedly, speed again. this standard cyclical pattern, employment move response economic activity, lag. hence employment lag slow activity, measure productivity slow even declines. the reverse happen growth pick up, first three quarter 2001. bi review 15/2002 5 the extensive program liberalisation economy past couple decade major drive force behind improvement trend productivity growth. a side note, australia tend allow much role "new economy" developments, adoption information technology, though research suggest may play great role conventional wisdom allowed. but big question future. leave aside recent cyclical up downs, strong trend productivity growth 1990s continue next ten years? on are, i suppose, optimist pessimists. optimist would argue fast productivity growth see past decade represent accelerate process "catch up" lead edge level productivity see globally, usually u economy. moreover, accept still gap productivity level australia world frontier least sectors. hence catch complete, process good productivity growth continue time yet. pessimist tend point depend right policies. they worry process liberalise market continue, even reversed, productivity performance suffer. they voice concern get hard build support liberalise ideas. both view merit, possible optimistic outlook, equally see importance sustain liberal market arrangement already exist, dispose towards sensible reform may possible time. good policy important, course – go without saying. but policy establish pre-conditions conducive enhance productivity. the outcome depend quite heavily you, business community. it you, all, who, pursuit profit, seek opportunity new product markets, good way organise business activity, good way motivate employee tap develop human capital. in simple growth account exercise use measure productivity, source genuine improvement productive technique consider (though considerable separate literature aim establish that). but productivity get hand somewhere – outcome effort people across economy find good way things. what macroeconomic policy contribute endeavour measure stability. we never rid business cycle, tendency businesses, household especially financial markets, alternate mood optimism pessimism. but past decade so, australian economy somewhat le volatile year year use be. that may explain partly small shock hit u abroad much 1990s (though asian crisis global recession 2001 big shocks). the economy's capacity handle shock also improved, factor due degree liberalise reform themselves. i would argue macroeconomic policy play role too, particular monetary policy 6 bi review 15/2002 regime seek respond likelihood significant build-ups inflationary disinflationary pressure, make contribution. it is, course, intention continue vein. conclusion in respects, global situation, without uncertainty, good year ago. a renew expansion world economy may well beginning, though probably moderate, rather strong. even though want throw hat far air yet, encourage see signs. australia come international difficulty well date. in underlie sense, slow growth experience late 1990s, slow growth would ideally like sustain medium term. but deep slump characteristic early world downturns, probability experience one soon seem recently diminished. this good news, perhaps u cast mind past short term, towards question sustain good, stable growth, good productivity performance, medium term. i sure that. bi review 15/2002 1 roger w ferguson, jr: a supervisory perspective disaster recovery business continuity remark mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, institute international bankers, washington, d.c., 4 march 2002. * * * good morning. i would like thank member institute international banker opportunity speak disaster recovery business continuity. this topic receive great deal attention federal reserve financial industry whole since september11. it's fair say follow september 11, (bankers supervisor alike) renew appreciation mean term "emergency preparedness." the federal reserve regulators, abroad, analyze aftermath terrorist attack view toward strengthen overall resilience financial system. this work benefit discussion lead member financial service industry past several months. in presentation, i want give flavor idea issue review. since many first-hand experience impact september 11, i intend dwell detail operational breakdown relate challenge face institution low manhattan. suffice say that, fortuitous combination exist plans, people, systems, tool extraordinary level cooperation among market participants, financial system recover remarkably quickly tragedy. however, cannot assume combination always work favor, therefore, regulator public strong common interest learn horrific experience september 11. what learn? let review key lesson believe emerge september 11. first, business continuity plan many institutions, although improve y2k preparations, clearly fully take account potential wide-spread disaster major loss inaccessibility critical staff. some firm arrange backup facility nearby build quite legitimate efficiency convenience, and, result, lose primary backup sites. very firm plan emergency would disrupt multiple site entire business district, city, region. second, business concentrations, market-based geographic, intensify impact operational disruptions. besides geographic concentration financial institution within new york city, critical market functions, particularly clear settlement funds, securities, financial contracts, rely entities. when even one entity operational problems, many market participant feel effects. moreover, significant telecommunication vulnerability result concentration become evident failure affect numerous institutions, within outside low manhattan. in fact, federal reserve staff personally involve set priority restoration key telecommunication circuit support financial service system week september 11. third, event september 11 graphically demonstrate interdependence among financial-system participants, wherever located. though organization locate outside new york city area affect much le within it, many felt effect disaster. the difficulty customer counterparties communicate banks, broker-dealers, organization low manhattan seriously impede ability determine whether transaction complete expected. in cases, customer affect action institution even business, example, fund security could deliver operational problem institutions. in fact, week september 11 liquidity bottleneck time become severe federal reserve need lend substantial amount directly institution discount window, besides provide billion payment system float uncleared checks, 2 bi review 15/2002 open market operations. we keep payment system open nearly midnight night week institution attempt clear payment queues. heighten liquidity need limit domestic financial institutions. the federal reserve set swap line major central bank allow foreign bank organization obtain liquidity directly authorities, prevent u.s. liquidity imbalance transmit overseas. most important, learned, result interdependencies, contingency-planning decision make individual institution may affect safety soundness institution also safety soundness institution and, indeed, function financial markets. a result, believe coordinate discussion sound practice business continuity involve financial industry regulator important part response event september 11. step financial institution take let turn step institution take improve preparedness business continuity planning. september 11 may lead change institutions' plan emergencies, well change ongoing operations. in addition range tactical steps, enhance security measures, update communication plans, strengthen real-time data backup, institution also make interest strategic choices. for example, many institution use traditional model business continuity base "active" operate site correspond backup site, often separate site data process business operations. this strategy generally rely relocate staff active site backup site maintain backup copy technology data up-to-date. in traditional model, backup capability ensure periodic testing. even so, maintain effectiveness backup sites, staff, system routinely use production often difficult. for example, week september 11, many institution find disaster-recovery plan particular business line always accessible up-to-date, sometimes backup primary site use different hardware software versions. finally, assumption key personnel could relocate always well founded. in contrast, institution move toward "split operations" model, two active operate site provide backup one another. each site absorb work another extend time. for bank organization nationwide operation (particularly grow mergers), site often hundred mile apart. for international firms, routine workload share among site different country different continents. this strategy provide almost-immediate resumption capacity, depend system support operation communication operate capacity site. the strategy also address many key vulnerability traditional model. for example, technology must keep current active operate site normal business operation proceed. at time, split-operations approach significant costs, term maintain excess capacity site add operate complexity. this approach may suit type business activities, trading, clearing, settlement, others. other business-continuity model may able provide high degree resilience. over time, technological change significantly affect range business continuity strategy and, importantly, relative cost benefits. whatever operate model chose, financial institution clearly reassess range scenario need address business-continuity planning. such scenario posit effect business operation much broad geographic area previously imagine (such city metropolitan area) involve consequence could harm significantly disperse organization's critical employees. institution also explore method provide great diversity telecommunication service eliminate point failure. contract provision audit oversight telecommunication vendor may heighten attention critical vulnerability. at time, many recognize overcome telecommunication vulnerability extremely difficult give current physical infrastructure. in long term, establish diverse telecommunication method (such internet wireless) move toward wide geographic diversification operation may address vulnerabilities. industrywide discussion telecommunication provider may help institution bi review 15/2002 3 avoid vulnerability expose september 11. some institution reexamine arrangement disaster-recovery vendor find vendors' "first-come, first-served" policy mean that. test backup plan also receive renew focus. test see long compliance issue item checklist critical part business operations. in wake september 11, many market participant find operate backup site discover problem connect communicate backup site displace entities. a result, financial institution seem receptive coordinate test backup facilities. in addition, several public private-sector initiative begin examine issue coordinate crisis management communication. overall, i believe financial institution address many key vulnerabilities. in large part, market demand this. customer increasingly require assurance financial institutions' operation continue expect even event disaster. we need maintain focus issue even harsh memory september 11 fade. we must also find way make business-continuity plan consistent, coordinated, transparent across industry. with mind, i discus step regulator taking. step regulator take the federal reserve financial service regulator want lesson address next disaster, whenever whatever may strike. first, talk industry colleague appropriate sound practices. however, i would stress still lot learn financial institution expert business-continuity planning. no one know certain threat (both man-made natural) likely face come years. we much le experience model predict operational risk credit market risks, indeed threat may idiosyncratic model all. a result, prudential supervisory model appear preferable time. through routine supervisory process, talk institution robustness disaster-recovery plan stop short set detail regulatory standard point. although i anticipate issue update supervisory guidance examination procedure business continuity long, i certain want approach issue checklist. in process, work closely regulators, include federal bank regulator security exchange commission. city region outside new york city without risk also need consider reasonable threats, man-made natural. i therefore please many institution city towns, like colleague base new york city seriously consider update implement business-continuity plans. institution also need define target recovery disaster consistent manner. although practice, expectation recovery time may differ depend scenario, critical functions, include safeguard transfer fund financial assets, vital domestic global financial system arguably continue minimal, any, disruption, even event major regional disaster. clearly, institution need plan continue serve customer major disruption, supervisory standard require many years. in addition, increasingly clear operational resilience large institution key market need reflect systemic impact across financial sector. expectation high institution whose activity significantly affect institutions, major clear settlement entities, institution act financial "utilities" functions. however, need balance compete issues. we ongoing interest safety soundness individual institutions, well systemic financial stability. but also recognize that, even though large nationally internationally active u.s. foreign bank institution key role play financial stability, also participate competitive marketplace. thus, need careful create undue burden handful institutions. 4 bi review 15/2002 conclusion six month september 11, much plan achieved, still much do. we must sustain current drive minimize eliminate vulnerability i discussed. we must view september 11 wake-up call improve resilience financial market institutions. we cannot afford ignore lesson learned. i ask cooperation view partnership. we need u september 11 day followed, again, necessary. but also look financial institution conduct honest appraisal vulnerabilities--or listen appraisal routine supervision institutions' u.s. operations--and take necessary action remedy significant operational weakness

march 2002. * * * first word thank invitation helsingborg discus matter swedish economy riksbank’s monetary policy. for particularly interest come since i live work year helsingborg 1980s. a publish minute show, riksbank’s late monetary policy meet 7 february executive board conclude shift occur risk spectrum overall tendency towards upside risk inflation one two year ahead. the board also make overall assessment time interest rate increase probably far economic statistic continue confirm upturn inflation remain high. in i say today i shall start appraisal, i place context extent try look ahead. inflation prospect determine repo rate when riksbank set repo rate, focal point analysis future inflation sweden. this analysis base turn three factor particular: total resource utilisation, path exchange rate people’s inflation expectations. inflationary pressure normally vary demand situation change resource utilisation. the strong upswing relation potential output, great risk fast increase price wage vice versa. that u work central bank around world talk frequently cyclical picture even though target variable actually inflation. the future value krona play part assessment inflation. exchange rate movement affect inflation directly show price import good services; also indirect effect aggregate demand. change value krona relative currency importance foreign trade consequence competitiveness swedish good services. turn finally inflation expectation among household firms, effect actual formation price wage thereby inflation. alter expectation liable influence price formation riksbank act monetary policy. there are, however, price impulse riksbank also handle. example last winter’s shortage snow restrict supply hydroelectric power, cattle disease push price meat, unusually cold weather europe raise price fruit vegetables. price shock type occasion large shift general price level time impact inflation probably transient. suppose price shock occur particular month; leave mark annual inflation rate come year drop statistics. a normally count time lag year monetary policy full effect inflation, counter temporary price impulse difficult particularly meaningful. monetary policy accordingly focus instead forecast inflation one two year ahead. occasional shift price level can, however, affect inflation prospect permanently alter general perception inflation’s path long run. to put briefly, temporarily high inflation induce general belief inflation also high year ahead, monetary policy must intervene. even economic situation give grind worry inflation, case resolute action may call high inflation become entrench via inflation expectations. this quite simply because, term decrease output employment, prevent inflation expectation rise le costly push become establish high level. 2 bi review 15/2002 these, then, type assessment we, member riksbank’s executive board, form picture prospect inflation. we look various angles, consider risk opportunities. four time year riksbank present comprehensive account; present work year’s first inflation report. let remind interested, report easily download website: www.riksbank.se. perhaps i add addition text, site provide equally relevant statistic behind charts. two route central bank any central bank explicit target face choice extreme form look something like this: either aim keep inflation continuously target admit deviation may last quite time. if inflation keep close target time, constant need sizeable repo rate adjustments, attendant mark fluctuation market interest rates, output employment. if temporary deviation central bank’s target tolerated, hand, monetary policy implement smoothly. a gradual adjustment output employment ultimately bring inflation back line target. both route drawbacks. negative effect employment output major change repo rate liable erode public confidence central bank monetary policy regime. at time, undue acceptance large deviation inflation target may weaken target’s credibility lead rise inflation expectation high cost ultimately bring inflation back target. a result, central bank tend prefer monetary policy strategy lie somewhere two extremes, avoid excessively large interest rate adjustment hesitate adjust call for. the riksbank normally formulate monetary policy view inflation one two year ahead. this unfortunately mean repo rate set aid forecast forecast err. moreover, always possibility price shock a-cyclical still affect rate inflation. a forward-looking policy advantage, however, permit implementation smooth yet firm. the riksbank react inflation forecast determine manner forecast include assessment extent inflationary impulse transient, over-reactions avoided. the supply shock i refer early occur past year example price fluctuation that, monetary policy strategy riksbank chosen, occasion deviation inflation target. this first time inflation affect occasional factors. in late 1990s, example, successive deregulation electricity telecom market result deviation target, difference time gap downside. what happen opposite. with monetary policy strategy, natural case strike reasonable balance maintain fix value money avoid excessively large fluctuation economic activity. it cannot stress strongly although riksbank’s sight consistently target, inflation always tend hover around bull’s-eye. look back, however, see ever since target instituted, inflation average close it. the intention continue case future. more sign recovery so transitory price shock give great cause concern. thing bad cannot rule possibility part increase inflation stem strong activity earlier. such effect usually show time tend persist. during strong upward phase, firm begin pas rise business cost consumer form high prices. perhaps precisely see recently, least extent. support conclusion may lie fact that, accord late statistics, average wage level sweden rise somewhat fast compatible 2 per cent inflation target. this may indicate resource utilisation sense strain count earlier. if economic activity sweden rise moderately, lead time weaken inflationary pressure, risk inflation would diminish. but activity rather show sign freshening, risk exist high inflation continue incorporate bi review 15/2002 3 perception inflation long run, possible effect on, example, future wage negotiations. that course must happen. a scrutiny current cyclical picture reveal grow number sign activity abroad, unite states, way improving. this something also affect condition swedish economy. a majority lead indicator point direction. although upward phase contain risk i shall returning, still good deal evidence recovery rest world well sweden may way materialise late year. a factor often contribute cyclical swing movement stocks. when stock plentiful sale falling, firm often cut back production fall demand. in way, stock adjustment initially accentuate cyclical downturn. when reduction stock ultimately come end, firm may step production even though demand yet start recover. this drive cyclical upturn perhaps positive effect may way. there sign unite state particular also sweden. a continue recovery require accompany broad sustain increase demand; otherwise upswing liable relatively brief. in respect may still uncertainty, mainly perhaps regard american economy. the economic imbalance unite state still large stock-market value high, historically relation current cyclical phase. however, high productivity compare rest world may make problem le troublesome. household save admittedly become somewhat high relative disposable income since end last year level remain low compare early years. unemployment continue rise. against background grind expect growth come year high late 1990s. but overall economic policy expansionary, successive recovery second half-year, though course upside downside risks. turn europe, seem clear sign strong recovery. lead indicator admittedly point positive business mood prospect germany – large economy euro area – still uncertain unemployment rise high initial level. the euro area accumulate imbalance unite state may help maintain recovery begun. in sweden, economic policy charge economy good deal stimulus help generate broad increase demand stock cycle begin favourable effect prospect international economy brightening. a result low tax increase transfers, example, thing suggest household purchase power rise comparatively strongly year. see complete economic cycle, riksbank’s instrumental rate comparatively low. consider rate inflation sign activity pick up, real repo rate (the repo rate le rate inflation) say low. then weak exchange rate, subdue effect international slowdown help stimulate export-oriented sector. all amount inconsiderable stimulus general demand swedish economy, stimulus look like materialise successively. how heavily tread accelerator? if inflation, even disregard temporary effects, target initially, activity enter upward phase economic policy’s impact economy expansionary, monetary policy ought contribute somewhat light foot accelerator. but unduly high inflation stem transient increase price level economic upturn yet assured, may indeed advisable somewhat defer upward adjustment instrumental rate. it likely around aspect deliberation riksbank circle executive board finally adjust come inflation report next discus monetary policy 18 march. that still almost fortnight ahead statistic due published. in meantime, six u board form opinion step step decide whether increase repo rate already march whether possible go waiting. personally i share concern inflation prospect number colleague express speech recently. bi

unite states. the unfold concern recent month quality accounting, auditing, disclosure practice major nonfinancial financial company give add importance discussion here. a bank supervisors, increasingly recognize importance sound account disclosure risk-focused examination policies, capital adequacy approaches, risk-management practice address grow complexity bank organizations. a organization grow size scope, outside investor difficulty understand particular firm's unique combination risk business line earnings. modern risk-management tool describe risk way traditional account standard recognition measurement cannot. thus, disclosure firms' risk-management position risk management strategies--not necessarily another account schedule--is become key component improve market transparency. tonight, i would like address role disclosure describe risk exposure financial organizations. evolution risk management the last decade twentieth century were, without doubt, period dramatic change financial engineering, financial innovation, risk management practices. traditionally, net interest income primary source income bankers. deposit interest rate unite state fix regulator 1970s rarely changed, fixed-rate, term loan create significant income volatility. by end 1970s, however, banker unite state face simultaneously deregulation interest rate deposit rise interest rate due prevail high inflation. in 1980, price credit control enact curb inflation increase market volatility. banker find pay high rate outstanding six-month certificate deposit receive

bank begin match repricing frequency loan investment deposit fund sources. scenario create determine sensitivity net interest income vary interest rate loan deposit growth patterns. large bank begin

credit-risk management evolve similar way. new tool supplement credit judgment individual lend officer make decision within criterion establish credit policy 2 bi review 14/2002 organizations. today,

adjust. transparency require practice advance, must approach use firm disclose financial condition performance well risk profile risk-management activities. nonetheless, intend unintended risk opaqueness come complexity raise serious issues, particularly entity become large complicate hence increasingly difficult supervise. the federal reserve bank supervisor around world recognize importance market discipline encourage sound risk management practice promote stability financial markets. effective market discipline complement bank supervision regulation. but prerequisite

international account standard board consider improve account financial instrument standard consolidate financial statement achieve great transparency companies' exposure special purpose vehicle

provide internal audit consult service clients. possible regulatory measure explore many fundamental reform development private-sector organizations. improvement account audit standard need address potential problem identified. in particular, would helpful fundamental principle standard could revise emphasize financial statement clearly faithfully represent economic substance business

monitor risk change business climate --including credit, market, liquidity, operational risks. disclosure consistent information use internally risk manager could beneficial market participants. information sensitivity change underlie assumption could also meaningful financial statement users. company ensure meet letter standard exist also financial report disclosure focus really essential

services, u house representatives, 27 february 2002. * * * since july, i last report conduct monetary policy, u.s. economy go period considerable strain, output contract time unemployment rising. we federal reserve system act vigorously adjust monetary policy endeavor limit extent downturn hasten completion. despite disruption engender terrorist attack september 11, typical dynamic business cycle re-emerge prompt firm economic activity. an array influence unique business cycle, however, seem likely moderate speed anticipate recovery. at time last report, economy weakening. many firm respond realization significant overcapacity developed. the demand capital good drop sharply, inventory uncomfortably high many industries. in response, business slash production, result decline income amplify cyclical downturn. real gross domestic product grow second quarter contract third. a coincident deceleration activity among world economy evident past year, owing, least part, retrenchment

14/2002 in week follow attacks, along drop activity confidence, equity price fell markedly, lender become cautious, boost risk premiums, especially credit already consider weak. in response, federal reserve reduce short-term interest rate considerably further. longer-term yields, include mortgage rates, fell extraordinarily low levels. the monetary stimulus provide visible interest rate also rapid growth liquidity final month year, gauge broad monetary aggregates. a fourth quarter progressed, business consumer confidence recovered, doubt buoy success war terrorism. the improve sentiment seem buff decline economic activity. indeed, past several months, increase sign emerge force restrain economy past year start diminish activity begin firm. the appearance signs, circumstance level real federal fund rate low level, lead federal open market committee keep policy unchanged meet late january, although retain assessment risk tilt toward economic weakness. one key consideration assessment economy close turn point behavior inventories. stock many industry draw level firm soon need taper rate liquidation, already do so. any slow rate inventory liquidation induce rise industrial production demand product stable fall moderately. that rise production will, thing equal, increase household income spending. the runoff inventories, even apart large reduction motor vehicle stocks, remain sizable fourth quarter. hence, production run well sales, lift income spend inevitable cessation inventory liquidation could significant. but impetus growth activity short-lived unless sustain increase final demand kick positive effect swing inventory liquidation dissipate. most recovery post-world war ii period receive boost rebound demand consumer durables house recession-depressed level addition abatement inventory liquidation. through much last year's slowdown, however, spend household sector hold well prove major stabilize force. a consequence, although household spend continue trend up, potential significant acceleration activity sector likely limit past cycles. in fact, number cross current outlook household spending. in recent months, low mortgage interest rate favorable weather provide considerable support homebuilding. moreover, attractive mortgage rate bolster sale exist home extraction capital gain embed home equity sale engender. low rate also encourage household take large mortgage refinance homes. draw home equity manner significant source fund consumption home modernization. the pace extraction likely drop along decline refinance activity follow backup mortgage rate begin early november. but mortgage rate remain low level continue underpin activity sector. consumer spend receive considerable lift sale new motor vehicles, remarkably strong october november owe major finance incentives. sale recede somewhat incentive scale back, remain surprisingly resilient. other consumer spend appear advance solid pace recent months. the substantial decline price natural gas, fuel oil, gasoline clearly provide support real disposable income spending. to persistent effect ongoing growth total personal consumption expenditures, energy price would need continue declining. future price suggest outcome offing, though forecast record market le impressive. change household financial position recent year probably damp consumer spending, least degree. overall household wealth relative income drop peak multiple 6.3 end 1999 around 5.3 currently. moreover, aggregate household debt service burden, define ratio households' require debt payment disposable personal income, rise considerably recent years, return last year previous cyclical peak mid-1980s. bi review 14/2002 3 however, neither wealth burden debt distribute evenly across households. hence, spend effect change influence also evenly distributed. for example, increase debt burden appear disproportionately attributable higher-income households. calculation staff federal reserve suggest ratio household liability annual income top fifth household rank income, account 44 percent total after-tax household income last year, rise 1.10 end 1998 1.20 end third quarter 2001. the increase low four-fifths half large. although high-income household experience much strain meet obligations, others might. indeed, repayment difficulty already increased, particularly subprime market consumer loan mortgages. delinquency rate may well worsen delay result strain household finance past two years. large erosions, however, seem likely, overall level debt repayment delinquency not, now, appear pose major impediment moderate expansion consumption spend go forward. although macroeconomic effect debt burden may limited, already see significant spend restraint among top fifth income earners, presumably owe drop equity prices. the effect stock market households' spend le evident. moderate-income household much large proportion asset homes, continue rise value house provide great support net worth. reflect difference portfolio composition, net worth top fifth income earner drop far bottom 80 percent. a consequence, exclude capital gain loss calculation, convention national income accounts, personal save upper fifth, negative 1999 2000, turn positive 2001. by contrast, average save rate low four-fifths households, income, generally positive second half 1990s fluctuate narrow range past two years. accordingly, change consumption expenditure result bull stock market, demise, reflect shift spend upper-income households. the restrain effect net decline wealth past two year presumably not, yet, fully play could exert damp effect overall growth household spend relative income. perhaps central outlook consumer spend development labor market. the pace layoff quicken last fall, especially september 11, unemployment rate rise sharply. however, layoff diminish noticeably january, report unemployment rate decline though adjust seasonal influence difficult last month. moreover, initial claim unemployment insurance decrease markedly, balance, provide evidence improvement labor market conditions. even economy road recovery, unemployment rate, typical cyclical fashion, may resume increase time, soft labor market could put something damp consumer spending. however, extent restraint depend much rise unemployment result weaken demand good service much reflect strengthen productivity. in latter case, average real income worker could rise, least partially offset loss purchase power stem diminish

factor influence consumer demand important consequence economic outlook come months. but broad contour present cycle been, continue be, drive evolution corporate profit capital investment. the retrenchment capital spend past year half central sharp slow experience overall activity. the steep rise high-tech spend occur early post-y2k month clearly sustainable. the demand many new technology

firm re-evaluated capital investment programs. uncertainty economic prospect boost risk premium significantly, rise, turn, propel required, hurdle, rate return markedly elevate levels. in cases, business require new investment pay much rapidly previously. for much last year, result decline investment outlay fierce 4 bi review 14/2002 unrelenting. although weakness pronounce technology area, reduction capital outlay broad-based. these cutback capital spend interact with, reinforce by, fall profit equity prices. indeed, strike feature current cyclical episode relative many early one

customers. to sure, growth hourly labor compensation moderate response slow inflation deteriorate economic conditions. a significant falloff stock-option realization form compensation relate company performance likely factor. but past year, even small hourly compensation increase outstrip gain output per hour, balance, precipitate mark decline profit margins. business managers, little opportunity raise prices, move aggressively stabilize cash flow trim workforces. these effort limit rise unit costs, attenuate pressure profit margins, ultimately help preserve vast majority private-sector jobs. to extent business successful stabilize eventually boost profit cash flow, capital spend begin recover noticeably. part reduction price power observe cycle reverse firm demand enable firm take back large price discounts. though adjustment would tend elevate price levels, underlie inflationary cost pressure remain contained. to sure, output per hour likely accelerate year much typical recovery business delayed, past recessions, shed worker first indication weaken demand. but slack labor market increase productivity hold labor cost check result rise profit margin even inflation remain low. improve profit margin assure prospect rise final demand would likely accompany decline risk premium current elevate level toward normal range. with real rate return high-tech equipment still

extraordinarily low cost equity capital available many firms. nonetheless, recent more-favorable economic development gather momentum, uncertainty diminish, risk premium fall, pace capital investment embody new technology increase. even subdue recovery begin soon would constitute truly remarkable performance american economy face severe decline equity asset value unprecedented blow terrorist foundation market systems. for, tentative indication contraction phase business cycle draw close ultimately confirmed, experience significantly mild downturn long history business cycle would lead u expect. crucially, imbalance trigger downturn could prolong difficult period fester. the obvious question change economy recent decade provide resilience whether change persist future. doubtless, substantial improvement access business decisionmakers real-time information play key role. thirty year ago, timeliness available information vary across company industries, often result difference speed magnitude bi review 14/2002 5 response change business conditions. in contrast situation prevail today, business real-time data system enable decisionmakers different enterprise work essentially set information. in early years, imbalance inadvertently allow build extent inevitable correction engender significant economic stress. that process correction accompany economic financial disruption often lead deep prolong recessions. today, business large quantity data available virtually real time. a consequence, address resolve economic imbalance far rapidly past. the apparent increase flexibility american economy arguably also reflect extent deregulation past quarter century. certainly, energy sector still tight regulatory fetter 1970s, flexibility today would markedly less. that collapse enron barely register relatively recently develop market natural gas electric power encouraging. although terrorist attack hit air travel especially hard past months, deregulation industry demonstrably increase quantity flexibility, profitability, air travel past twenty years. truck rail deregulation add flexibility movement good across nation. both deregulation innovation financial sector especially important enhance overall economic resilience. new financial products--including derivatives, asset-backed securities, collateralize loan obligations, collateralize mortgage obligations, among others--have enable risk disperse effectively will to, presumably capable of, bear it. shock overall economic system accordingly le likely create cascade credit failure. lender opportunity considerably diversified, borrower far le dependent specific institution funds. financial derivatives, particularly, grow phenomenal pace past fifteen years, evidently fulfil need hedge risk readily deflect early decades. despite concern complex instrument induce (an issue i address shortly), record performance, especially past couple stressful years, suggest balance contribute development far flexible efficient financial system--both domestically internationally--than twenty thirty year ago. a consequence increase access real-time information and, arguably, extensive deregulation financial product market unbundling risk, imbalance likely readily contained, cyclical episode overall le severe would case otherwise. if indeed case--and must consider speculative evidence gathered--the imply reduction volatility, thing equal, would low risk equity premiums. other things, however, may wholly equal. the technology appear main cause apparent increase flexibility resiliency may also impart different form vulnerability could intensify intensify business cycle. from one perspective, ever-increasing proportion gdp represent conceptual distinct physical value add may actually lessen cyclical volatility. in particular, fact concept cannot hold inventory mean great share gdp subject type dynamic amplify cyclical swings. but economy concept form important share

february 2002. * * * governor dai, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure china i feel especially honour invite deliver speech people’s bank. first, i would like wish prosperous new year, sign horse. i would also like take opportunity thank governor dai staff, among things, hospitality prepare excellent programme delegation. ever since china open outside world 1978, major trade nation thank social economic reforms. the process turn china major economy strengthen political power. in 2000, size chinese economy, measure term gdp, pass usd 1 trillion mark, rank fifth behind unite states, euro area, japan unite kingdom. to accompany china’s grow economic financial weight international community, eu commit develop comprehensive partnership country. the ecb play part co-operation international bilateral meetings. for example, meet regularly central bank context imf, g20 bi exchange view global economic financial issues. in fact, i already meet governor dai year (actually, last week) hong kong, bi special governors’ meeting. europe asia also co-operate closely asem (asia-europe meeting) process, launch bangkok 1996. this develop broad forum in-depth consultation european asian partner prompt range co-operation initiatives. for example, april year ecb organise seminar “regional economic, financial monetary co-operation: european asian experiences”. of course, i would also like recall eu long favour china join world trade organisation, done, i like congratulate you. on bilateral basis, four summit meet eu chinese leader hold since 1998. leader exchange view eu-china relation well international regional issue common interest, agree fourth summit 2001 eu china continue effort promote stability, peace development world. meanwhile, 2001 also witness strengthen relation ecb china. follow visit pbc delegation head governor dai ecb june, agree establish regular dialogue two central bank enhance co-operation issue common interest. towards end year, vice-president, mr. noyer, invite twice delegation european commission china (once beijing november shanghai december) speak subject euro cash changeover. on occasions, mr. noyer outline importance process whole world, review relevant issue country outside euro area. today, i would like dwell topic – euro. let begin give update euro cash changeover. i talk recent global economic development impact euro area, turn international role euro. euro cash changeover let first turn introduction euro banknote coins. while euro introduce new currency 1 january 1999, euro banknote coin issue become legal tender country participate euro area begin year. with cash changeover, process introduce single european currency completed. pay single currency daily transaction throughout euro area regard achievement historic proportion major step towards great european integration. now, three day remain national currency denomination cease legal tender, i say operation progress smoothly successfully, even beyond expectations. 2 bi review 13/2002 the introduction euro banknote coin complex ambitious undertaking. in addition understand collaboration part public, require organisational, logistical technical effort part sector directly involve use banknote coins. by end 2001, 6.4 billion euro banknote worth eur 133 billion amount volume around 80% euro banknote circulation frontloaded (i.e. pre-delivered) banks. with regard euro coins, 37.5 billion coin 90% coin circulation total value around eur 12.4 billion frontloaded. broadly speaking, sub-frontloading – pre-delivery bank retailer professional target group – represent overall amount 10 20% frontloaded amount. give that, term transactions, around 70% banknote put circulation via automate teller machine (atms), quick adaptation machine one key factor smooth changeover. in total, 200,000 atm either site bank branch site, example shop centres, converted. this achieve within le one week. a result, average, 75% cash transaction already effect euro one week. on whole, euro banknote coin introduce considerably fast originally foreseen, least favourable attitude quick acceptance european citizens. i like mention changeover also smooth outside euro area. the euro banknote receive positively third countries. information public generally adequate euro banknote readily available bank exchange offices, cases. with regard frontloading central bank outside euro area, i mention 26 central banks, mainly central eastern europe, mediterranean area africa, request frontloaded euro cash. the total value euro banknote provide central bank wholesale bank outside euro area amount eur 4 billion. overall, eurosystem proud grateful actors’ contribution historic process. the enthusiasm european citizen get hold euro cash see clear vote unite europe. recent global economic development let briefly review current international environment. i feel quite relief world economy prove relatively resilient shock terrorist attack september last year. the event 11 september aftermath undoubtedly increase uncertainty, time contribute substantially already ongoing deterioration confidence countries. however, sign global economic downturn may come end around end 2001. at current juncture, mild recovery generally expect start course 2002 accelerate 2003. the risk previously envisage connection 11 september event appear largely evaporated. nevertheless, level uncertainty precise time strength recovery remain high. while i reasonably optimistic sustainability recovery that, expect, start year, i also aware remain downside risks. these risk relate, instance, imbalance build past episode exceptionally strong growth world economy partially corrected. example imbalance protract current account deficits, household corporate indebtedness, overinvestment certain industries, fragility financial sector countries. in context, important issue extent trade finally pick historical low witness second half 2001, beneficial international transmission mechanism transform current limit sign recovery virtuous circle world growth. needle say protectionism and, generally, obstacle international trade integration would counterproductive also respect. in context, i think agree china’s entry wto significant step towards progress world trade development. economic outlook euro area let turn economic outlook euro area. overall, 2001 rather disappoint year regard macroeconomic performance: growth activity potential consumer bi review 13/2002 3 price inflation 2% limit set ecb price increase medium term. this disappoint performance result unfortunate combination adverse supply demand shocks, originate large extent development external environment. these include sharp increase oil price 2000 early 2001, slowdown u economy terrorist attack unite states. take together, adverse shock lead protract weaken demand – external domestic side – considerable uncertainty regard outlook growth. look ahead, expect negative impact growth inflation adverse factor diminish pave way satisfactory macroeconomic performance year next. most recently, projection show real gdp growth 2002 whole somewhat low 2001, would consistent recovery growth course year. at end year, economic growth reach level close potential growth. for time being, however, strength precise time recovery remain uncertain. a number positive factor identify support upturn growth euro area. first, regard domestic side euro area economy, important reason expect recovery fundamental imbalance would require endure correction process. second, regard external environment, encourage sign stabilisation outlook growth global level, relate mainly positive news u economy. other indication improvement economic activity that, owe ecb’s stability-oriented monetary policy, finance condition favourable. moreover, decline consumer price inflation observe second half 2001 expect course 2002 support high growth real disposable income, which, turn, underpin growth domestic demand. we continue expect medium-term upward pressure inflation. at time, however, annual inflation rate euro area somewhat erratic begin year. preliminary hicp data january 2002 saw increase inflation, due large extent exceptional short-lived factors. i like emphasise that, notwithstanding many anecdotal report price change associate introduction euro note coins, currently little evidence significant effect aggregate inflation figures. bar unforeseen developments, govern council expect annual hicp inflation fall safely 2% year remain level consistent price stability thereafter. international role euro last least, i like address use euro outside euro area. the introduction euro contribute emergence new economic player, euro area. the euro area include 12 country 300 million people. it also large trade partner world economy, account 19% world exports. let explain european economic monetary union modify global finance. i would like first comment building-up new integrate financial market within euro area, turn evidence role euro outside euro area. i finally explain two aspect (the domestic international role euro) intertwined. the euro european financial market the creation single currency one step integration process europe, start establishment european economic community 1950s. the integration among member state gain momentum completion single european market 1992. by time european central bank create 1998, capital movement eu already completely liberalised, commercial bank allow operate within entire european union since 1996. however, exchange rate fluctuation among currency eu country – although close size wide swing early 1990s – still implied, unhedged, currency risk eu-wide allocation investment portfolios. moreover, financial investor face diverse level monetary stability fiscal soundness across eu countries. the success nominal convergence process – precede start monetary union – governments’ commitment honour fiscal regulation associate monetary 4 bi review 13/2002 integration itself, reduce risk eu-wide investment even creation ecb. the irrevocable peg exchange rate effective start monetary union 1 january 1999 create unprecedentedly large single financial area europe. today, single interest rate prevail short-term financial market minor spread long-term bond yield among 12 euro area member states. since 1999 observe surge dimension domestic financial markets: euro-denominated security issue euro area resident (other shares) increase 20% around eur 7 trillion. new market segment – instance, corporate municipal bond – record strong growth. we observe market-driven integration process, stock exchange link other, create single trade platforms, settlement system infrastructure streamline creation cross-border hubs. every day, wholesale payment system euro (target) process around 200,000 large-value payment among credit institutions, 20% relate cross-border transactions. the latter amount increase cross-border activity 15% last two years. the euro outside euro area the significant size domestic market euro-denominated asset increasingly attract financial operator outside euro area. in particular, euro use international borrower currency secure funding. let give two examples. since launch euro, around one-quarter international money market instrument issue resident outside euro area denominate euro. this mainly due investors’ interest high liquidity bring creation integrate money market. before launch single currency, 8% international money market instrument issue non-euro area resident denominate legacy currencies. likewise, around 30% international bond note issue resident outside euro area currently denominate euro, oppose le 20% euro legacy currency prior 1999. also case, market expectation grow liquidity probably key drive force behind upward trend. let add that, outside euro area, euro use private agent also official sector. in particular, 50 country currently maintain exchange rate regime involve external anchor euro play role. a reserve currency, euro account 13% official reserve and, admittedly, play currently small role u dollar, whose share amount 66%. the ecb itself, hold large amount u dollar foreign reserves, contribute prevail role u currency official reserve currency. the current share euro international reserve comparable share reach euro legacy currency prior introduction euro, imply that, aggregate terms, reallocation official reserve u dollar. the link domestic international factor let elaborate briefly interaction domestic international factor determinant international use euro. without doubt, decide use euro another currency mean transaction, international market also ass economic policy carry various economic areas. in vein, commitment ecb price stability – define inflation rate 2% medium-term horizon – underpin international investors’ confidence purchase power euro-denominated asset maintain time. indeed, currency reach international status internal price stability ensure long run. international investor also consider size liquidity domestic financial market crucial. in regard, effort currently undertake promote integration financial market (with 40 measure adopt eu institutions) likely attract international financial operators. large liquid financial market imply low transaction costs, make efficient foreign agent trade euro-denominated financial instruments, well resort euro foreign exchange market. bi review 13/2002 5 it task ecb try influence directly international investors’ decision regard currency want invest, borrow lend. the international role euro ultimately depend upon market’s judgement. however, neutral stance ecb misinterpreted, increase use euro issue policy relevance ecb, require continuous monitoring. to sum up, creation euro facilitate deepen financial integration inside europe. moreover, single currency already consequence outside euro area, euro rapidly become second use currency world. conclusion to conclude speech, i pre-empt q a session first tell “what happen february?” from 1 march 2002, euro sole legal tender euro area, also become one main channel facilitate future co-operation ecb pbc. while china manage sustain strong growth open internal market part wto membership process, expect trade financial tie china eu grow even stronger. i attach great importance relation ecb pbc, i confident relation flourish time. “xie xie” bi review 13/2002 1 david dodge: canada’s experience inflation target flexible exchange rate: lesson learn remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, canadian society new york, new york city, 20 february 2002. * * * the canadian economy undergo dramatic transformation past decade. and emerge low-inflation economy, decline level public foreign debt private sector cost-conscious, productive, efficient, thank restructure investment new technology. there little resemblance economy one many u contend 1970s 1980s - one rack high variable inflation unsustainably large rise public deficit debt. since 1990s, canada’s monetary policy framework, base explicit inflation-control target flexible exchange rate, contribute importantly put canadian economy back right path longer-term prosperity. this main theme talk today. i conclude remark recent development outlook canadian economy. the mark 1970s 1980s: high inflation fiscal excess to put canada’s inflation-targeting approach monetary policy context, quick look economic history past three decade order. through 1970s 1980s, canada, like many countries, find high inflation, large fiscal deficits, rise public debt exact heavy toll economy. indeed, u struggle unhappy time need remind high, variable, unpredictable inflation increase uncertainty future. that distort key signal information individual business rely make important economic decisions. that lead exaggerate up down economic activity employment. that waste valuable economic resource - resource ought go productive uses, instead divert hedging, people seek protection rise inflation. to make matter worse, much 1970s 1980s, canadian government run large budget deficits. those deficit absorb major part national savings. the result accumulation public debt mean high risk premium interest rates. and these, turn, discourage investment equipment technology necessary improve productivity. to state obvious, sustainable situation. speak monetary policy, i tell take u long time lot work different policy framework arrive current approach. by late 1980s, become clear bank explicit policy framework, could easily clearly communicate public, necessary deal inflation problem. in january 1988, former governor john crow articulate clear need focus achieve price stability. a macroeconomic problem intensify late 1980s, become evident need explicit commitment path bring inflation down. the canadian experience: agree target inflation control february 1991 mark turn point process. at time, bank canada government canada, act grow share appreciation economic damage cause high inflation, agree adopt explicit target inflation reduction. 2 bi review 13/2002 subsequently, inflation come quickly - indeed, fast envisage agreement. by january 1992, already fall close 2 per cent. now, i want leave impression quick painless process. far it. indeed, magnitude imbalances, take strong medicine live high interest rate time. this cause lot economic dislocation pain short run. and even interest rate come down, still appreciable risk premium build rate reflected, least partially, fiscal problems. but fiscal adjustment get underway, financial market quickly take note risk premium reduce significantly. thus, able reap one key payoff low inflation. the original inflation-control agreement government renew three time - recently, may 2001. the current agreement, run end 2006, continue aim keep inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent target range. the fact aim midpoint essence, i shall explain later. through past decade, two different governments, increase share appreciation among canadian authority important contribution inflation control make good economic performance. i want underscore that, democratic society, essential central bank government share ultimate objective well-functioning economy. and take action, work co-operatively, contribute common goal - hence repeat emphasis today word like “shared” “agreement”. base canadian experience, i tell combination monetary policy aim low, stable, predictable inflation fiscal policy aim bring significant decline debt-to-gdp ratio work reinforce credibility policies. low predictable inflation provide credible monetary policy anchor when bank canada government canada jointly announce explicit inflation target 1991, purpose provide clear path inflation medium term help canadian make good economic decisions. to make good decisions, canadian understand central bank try do. at bank, expect target would help u communicate clearly specific policy objective road and, way, make action understandable everyone. the target would also provide good basis judge effectiveness monetary policy. the importance communication monetary policy also something i would like return later. right now, let tell learn experience inflation targeting. one lesson draw credible monetary policy require credible anchor. inflation target fulfill role successfully. they make inflation predictable firmly anchor inflation expectation well future. with inflation expectation solidly anchored, investor good ass future value investments. saver confident purchase power money unexpectedly erode inflation. wage bargain become le contentious labour disruption decrease. the duration wage financial contract lengthen considerably people confident inflation greatly exceed 2 per cent medium term. nor unduly concern risk deflation. altogether, real economy work good stable. moreover, significance increase credibility target change whole dynamic inflation process. for example, sudden temporary change energy prices, movement exchange rate, fee price economy wage way 1970s 1980s. again, inflation expectation well anchored. a main benefit credible monetary policy base inflation target help canadian economy avoid boom bust cycle past. this forward-looking framework inflation target act automatic stabilizer economy. let explain works. bi review 13/2002 3 when demand strong, push economy capacity limits, risk future inflation move appreciably target midpoint, bank raise interest rate cool economy. but work also direction. when demand weak, future inflationary pressure likely ease, case 2001, bank low interest rate stimulate economy, absorb economic slack, return inflation target midpoint. let stress midpoint inflation target range target, cap. that say, pay equal attention significant movement away 2 per cent midpoint - whether below. by work symmetrical way response surprise demand, inflation-targeting system help smooth peak valley business cycle promote sound, generally le variable, economic growth. in connection, let emphasize mandate, express preamble bank canada act, dissimilar u.s. federal reserve many central banks. our act enjoin bank “to mitigate influence fluctuation general level production, trade, price employment, far may possible within scope monetary action, generally promote economic financial welfare canada”. the symmetry monetary action go inflation-targeting framework best way achieve inflation control thus objective act respect output employment. in addition, monetary policy consistently deliver low, stable, predictable inflation likely provide great contribution sustain growth output employment. this bring key point i note earlier. it vital central bank communicate public financial market goal monetary policy. here too, inflation target play important role - make monetary policy action understandable transparent, make possible independent central bank hold accountable public. it also provide financial market clear view central bank operate time. finally, let u forget monetary policy action affect inflation lag six eight quarters. because lag, set policy, one want emphasize change price affect underlie trend inflation downplay temporary fluctuation volatile component consumer price index. that why, unlike central banks, explicitly choose focus underlie trend inflation use core rate operate guide. the core rate exclude eight volatile component consumer price index well effect change indirect taxes. but i add central bank downplay temporary price change good reason believe fee price economy affect inflation expectations. the reason able inflation target help establish monetary credibility anchor inflation expectations. inflation target flexible exchange rate my review canada’s current monetary policy framework would complete without reference key element - flexible exchange rate. monetary policy pursue one objective - keep inflation low mean promote economic well-being canadians. in pursue goal, choose inflation target anchor. and mean float exchange rate. but i want emphasize canada small open economy, structure production trade differ significantly unite states. a float exchange rate important facilitate adjustment economic disturbances, fluctuation world demand for, price of, products. it also facilitate adjustment change save investment flows. over last years, country around world move flexible exchange rate system adopt inflation target monetary policy anchor. today, i give flavour canadian experience area, i talk lesson learn past decade. i hope provide useful insights. let turn recent economic development outlook canadian economy. 4 bi review 13/2002 recent economic development prospect canada the immediate impact fallout last september’s tragic event new york, elsewhere unite states, lead sharp increase economic uncertainty around world, exacerbate effect global economic slowdown become evident last summer. in circumstances, bank canada move quickly aggressively low interest rates. the aim minimize economic effect terrorist act limit loss confidence home. since last september, cut overnight rate target 200 basis points, bring total reduction since begin 2001 375 basis points. the substantial monetary ease undertake 2001 maximum impact move year 2003. in addition, tax cut implement begin last year continue provide significant support canadian economy. further stimulus also come spend enhance national security. thus, monetary fiscal policy provide significant support move forward. moreover, improvement since fall geopolitical climate consumer confidence north america europe, increase sign global economy turn corner firm year progresses. for reasons, bank canada expect canadian economy gain momentum 2002. after grow modestly first half - 1 2 per cent, annualized basis - accelerate second half - something like 3 4 per cent - strengthen 2003. once economy start expand rate exceed growth potential output late year, considerable amount slack build past several month begin absorbed. still, could late 2003 actual level output canadian economy reach potential level. this imply core inflation probably average 1 ½ per cent second half 2002. total cpi inflation expect stay core rate late 2002, energy price remain near current levels. give profile output growth, bank expect inflation move back 2 per cent approximately two years. recent economic indicator canada support view recovery starting. household spending, particularly interest-sensitive purchases, strong expected. export lately show sign revival. the inventory adjustment progressing. and early evidence firm u.s. economy, world price non-energy commodity appear bottom out. moreover, national account data canada may well show slightly positive economic growth last quarter 2001 first quarter year. all available indicator suggest final demand fourth quarter strong anticipated. and healthy employment data january suggest strength continuing. also notable fact production, especially manufacturing, keep growth final demand close month last year. so part demand meet run inventories. this bode well come months, mean production likely begin increase. this another factor contribute momentum expect see economic activity year unfolds. this say uncertainty risk economic outlook, bank canada remain alert unfold developments. while expect fix investment begin increase second half year, much aware conditional upon recovery business confidence, especially large multinational enterprises. how quickly strongly profit confidence enterprise bounce back important bear strength sustainability overall economic recovery. * * * to sum up, past decade, canada make major economic strides. we solid anchor monetary policy, inflation expectation well grounded. fiscal health restore and, even short run, continue make progress bring public debt-to-gdp ratio. and significant business restructure take place, come. bi review 13/2002 5 thank improvements, canada fare good 2001 many countries. and encourage sign turnaround global economy strengthen final demand home, prospect canadian economy favourable. a look past current difficulty positive longer-term trend potential economy, i expect move forward enhance sense importance contribution sound macroeconomic policy good economic performance. i talk length today canada go foster climate low, stable, predictable inflation mean monetary policy framework base inflation target flexible exchange rate. the inflation target float exchange rate work well together - indeed reinforce other. this approach work extraordinarily well u last decade. and expect continue provide foundation prosperous future. 1glenn stevens: the economic outlook 2002 address mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, ceda economic political outlook conference, adelaide, 18 february 2002. * * * it pleasure invite speak ceda’s economic political outlook adelaide. i take part ceda function time year cities, particularly nice come adelaide. i would like note outset, benefit local audience, bank undertake considerable increase resource put "on ground" economic intelligence around country. during 2001, establish regional office victoria, western australia queensland. in states, bank’s branch early close original function – bank registry operations, currency distribution – either long demand customer overtake improve technology. the purpose office retain rba presence and, fundamentally, gather information local economic conditions. in south australia, course, bank still presence form branch operation conduct bank business south australian government. so part process strengthen liaison effort, last year re-positioned one economist head office adelaide branch. the local staff continual contact economic group head office take active part assessment economy preparation monthly board meetings. we find information gather local level extremely helpful grateful way businesses, government department agency group respond questions. the south australian economy turn reasonably strong performance past year, growth household demand run national average. in common states, south australia’s export exposure doubt mean business keep watchful eye event abroad. equally, apparent intention mine sector begin raise capital spending, accord available surveys, probably good south australia. i intend attempt detail analysis local economic conditions. instead, remark global national scenes. the world economy present few source uncertainty, hence le potential surprises, number year now, though perspective international business cycle, quite encourage sign present turn point. in australia, economy clearly cop international downturn pretty well far, good reason confidence performance come year. a happens, bank publish statement monetary policy, contain comprehensive analysis international australian economies. my task today elaborate theme document, rather bring new messages. the u business cycle on 26 november 2001, u national bureau economic research announce that, accord methodology use date business cycles, u economy reach end decade-long expansion march 2001, period contraction. that pronouncement effectively end debate whether would would recession – define nber “a significant decline activity spread across economy, last months, visible industrial production, employment, real income, wholesale-retail trade”. one apparently way eight months. it unusual, way, classification recession expansion lag actual event good months. in fact, unknown recession actually finish time data make clear one begin (though fact finish itself, course, know later). this case early-1990s recession unite states. note also not, yet anyway, two consecutive quarter decline gdp unite state – definition "technical" recession beloved headline writers. debate quickly move on, focus briefly role september 11 event affect economy. clearly, event cause recession. all dynamic typically associate contraction output train prior mid september – otherwise nber would able decide november recession way. moreover, direct impact attack was, despite horrify images, large u economy. arguably, though, come time u economy already contract accelerate adjustment business underlie reality emerging. certainly, event watershed commentators. those voice say would recession go quiet immediately, week nber’s pronouncement. but business cycle contraction definitely way prior september 11. the nber’s statement 12 week ago. between late november today, many observer begin talk u recovery. financial market price reflect change relatively early on, tend do. share market rally strongly last week 2001 early part year, though shine come little since then. bond market push long-term interest rate somewhat, credit spread corporate bond tend decline. forecast economic growth unite state appear stop falling, late actual figure gdp, weak absolute sense, strong expected, much strong many fear early day september 11. to small extent, reflect fact underlie u economy weather impact terrorist attack well. post-attack, financial system run quickly, especially give destruction physical infrastructure heart system. and american corporation cut investment spend sharply indeed, household continue increase spend consumer good services. macroeconomic policy supportive, tax cut affect household income second half 2001 – right need – rapid ease monetary policy begin early january 2001, continue force right year. in fact, one adopt view recession begin last march and, note recession typically (if typical recession) last year, set look sign upturn might near, one would find evidence real economy support view. inventory adjustment, part classical business cycle story – much part recession "new economy", especially production it good – begin quite early, well advanced. the adjustment investment spend quick. sign bottom part tech sector begin emerge. the adjustment business payroll may also go long way towards completion, judge recent labour market data. 3so analysis normal business-cycle dynamic increasingly suggest u economy could well begin new expansion soon. if does, u recession would deeper, probably shallower, one 1990–91, mild recession past three decades. such outcome mean yet assured, entirely possible setbacks, associate fluctuation sentiment. those incline pessimistic view would, course, point feature u economy i not, yet, mentioned. it seem likely, example, excessive investment certain area height euphoria return information technology. even though new investment slashed, overhang past investment might remain – hence scope early return rise business investment spend may limited, though depend speed equipment become obsolete, much high itc-type investment for, say, buildings. to extent good deal investment simply "wasted", presumably much overhang – case question whether full extent lose wealth entail yet apparent. we could also add true state corporate balance sheet uncertain general, highlight recent revelation account irregularity high-profile u firms, american share valuation still seem high historical standards, support exceptionally strong forecast earn growth. household expand spend beyond rise income past year – indeed do number years. that sustain long, especially give subdue gain wealth. can household sector keep u economy tick business sector sort out? or loss wage income result high unemployment dampen consumers’ enthusiasm? opinion uncertainty differ. the weight opinion has, i think rightly, become optimistic lately, pessimist doubt recession quickly without reasons. even relatively optimistic might concede factor may well mean rate expansion initially relatively modest, certainly slow growth see late 1990s. other area world economy what regions? i think see evidence number country east asia contraction industrial production come end close month 2001. these country hit hard global tech sector slump 2000 2001, affect exports. some country badly affect asian crisis 1997 1998, extensive exposure technology production, singapore taiwan, suffer much occasion three four year ago. but east asia whole, impact serious. in contrast event asian crisis, macroeconomic policy occasion act way cushioned, rather reinforced, impact global events. exchange rate allow decline, monetary fiscal policy generally eased. activity seem stabilise recently. semi-conductor price firm appreciably, collapse first nine month 2001. a example roller-coaster ride producer area experienced, consider price memory module publish web-site call dramexchange.com. in october 2000, price quote 128mb sdram module us$10. by october 2001, fall us$1. some fall was, doubt, decline (very short) life span high-technology component familiar – drive productivity improvement competition. however, much fall presumably reflect cyclical dynamics. over past months, price rise around us$3.50. it encourage small east asian country see this, see hopeful sign expansion unite states, remain powerful force drive business cycle externally orient economies. in europe, growth slow noticeably 2001. however, survey one see early sign turn improvement economic condition year ahead. japan, unfortunately, quite different position. japan affect tech sector slump, also afflict powerful force work domestic economy. deflate asset prices, associate pressure corporation bank sector asset quality, generalise price deflation producer price even consumer prices, make difficult situation. these dynamic operation years, appear intensify past year so. conventional macroeconomic policy push limits. structural reform necessary painful short term. while attention (understandably) fix development unite states, big threat world economy term drag aggregate economic activity may well japan. how thing play remain extremely uncertain. 5 but overall, bar sudden major intensification contractionary force japan, reason think global economic activity begin improve year. a pretty strong policy stimulus applied, lead unite states, timely fashion. global short-term interest rate unusually low. in addition, price oil, play important role produce slowdown, fall substantially past year. these two factors, plus outworking inventory overhangs, would usually enough produce cyclical upturn. a i sketch above, see evidence begin appear consistent view. for reasons, recent statement monetary policy make clear, pessimism unite states, hence world economy, exist month ago waned. the question may soon be, whether upturn, strong durable prove be. at stage, unclear, probably remain while. implication australia it well recognise australian economy quite resilient face global recession. growth first three quarter 2001 run annualised rate 4 per cent. even moderate increase gdp december quarter, observer expect, would mean growth full year would order 3½ per cent. that compare well growth unite state zero period, outcome major country group, also zero. in past period global downturn, australia rarely outperform major countries; historically, tendency period weakness was, anything, pronounce g7 group. this time different, though global recession affect australia: impact export become increasingly clear past six month so. the value exports, grow 25-30 per cent per annum one point, little change compare year ago. the contribution growth gdp net export volume run 2 percentage point year june 2001, negative second half 2001. so two question posed. first, occasion, far least, do good others? and second, continue? a lot make house upswing currently increase activity employment construction sector associate part manufacturing. it true help growth present, likely fade middle year. but course equally true "paid for" boost large contraction – unprecedented size, fact – second half 2000. we take brief large house downturn time world economy still acceptably well, get benefit upswing house world slowed. the time not, course, something control. look up down house sector, still case australian economy perform good episode global recession. this deny growth decline – underlie sense, strip house fluctuations, growth might run something like 2½ per cent 2000 2001. that noticeably slow outcome 1998 1999 (which exceptional). but still good performance u major countries, good extrapolation historical experience previous global downturn might suggested. we also, course, keep mind full effect global downturn australia probably yet apparent. even so, begin get early piece economic information 2002, seem business consumer confidence hold quite well, sign improvement demand labour. all consistent growth continue thus far. so question remain occurred. one major factor help problem dog u past episodes, hence exacerbate business cycle downturns, present occasion. the obvious one central banker would nominate inflation, increased, beyond manageable levels. core inflation pick 1½ per cent 1998 1999, 3¼ per cent, reading, 2001. a i sure know, centre-piece australia’s monetary policy regime inflation target 2-3 per cent, average. this system place since 1993, work well australia period. it require bank move policy instrument keep medium-term inflation outcome consistent target. during 1997 1998, inflation target. monetary policy’s response ease, seek interest rate low enough engender strong expansion aggregate demand economy. the intention allow inflation increase little, back target. by second half 1999, apparent period below-target inflation draw close. in anticipation high inflation, policy begin move interest rate unusually low level "normal" levels, process continue august 2000. 7 during 2001, even inflation still increasing, ultimately move target, monetary policy ease substantially. we felt previous tighten phase do enough ensure rise trend would persist, therefore latitude offer support growth face contractionary shock head way abroad. even though recent cpi figure interpret many bite high side, still think outlook inflation return target next four six quarters. the reason behind set statement. for purpose today, point flexibility put interest rate pre-emptively earn prepare put rise inflation cards. policy operate fashion. another imbalance manage avoid occasion excessive investment. here distinct contrast unite states, business investment spend exceptionally high historical standard 2000, slump sharply. it item spend which, component aggregate demand, push unite state recession. in australia, business investment share gdp peak far back 1998, gradually decline three years. while people might look say terrible outcome, i tend look say won’t fall further. indeed, investment historically low levels, rise likely fall next couple years. the forward-looking data provide ab survey say thing. to could add australian share market never characterise extent excess see elsewhere, household corporate balance sheet are, large, pretty good shape – though household carry good deal debt past. prior financial excess would highly likely play part worsen downturn occurred; avoid bad excess big help. we add fiscal policy expansion 2000 remarkably well-timed perspective stabilise business cycle. yet another factor australia’s term trade slump way often do past; indeed, quite recently term trade rising. this importance support domestic incomes, point cycle when, historically, income reduce global price developments. then exchange rate. the decline currency first half 2000 well explain time, doubt confer advantage australian producer tradeable good services. there is, however, exchange rate story that. a float exchange rate system mean adverse change capital markets’ sentiment towards country automatically reflect tight domestic financial conditions: exchange rate take least adjustment. that mean domestic demand crunch pressure currency. this particular piece economic structure help economy adapt shock international capital market effectively alternative, fix exchange rate, would allow. that flexibility without limit, course, need complement effective monetary policy strategy provide anchor system – inflation target come in. so number factor assist economy cop external shock. can good performance continue? to state obvious, depend long international economy remain weak. no economy remain insulate global problem indefinitely. but consensus view global growth – thing begin improve 2002 progress – correct, australia’s prospect pretty good. the general effect low interest rate still filter economy time yet. prospect upswing business investment would good scenario, would help counteract impact domestic demand wan house cycle. the good growth see 2001 help put floor labour market, due course, improve condition abroad would offer good prospect exporters. this rule temporary weak period australian growth point year, world economy improving, macroeconomic policy support growth investment begin upswing, would unlikely activity would fall away sharply long. none assured, large part global recovery itself, apparently likely was, sure thing. but nothing ever assured. what appear change recent month balance risk global growth australian economy long "tilted downside", way was. it still possible conceive weak outcome consensus expect – first time year, also possible conceive possibility thing could strong generally expected. conclusion the year 2001 saw major change perception health world economy, recession near-recessions several major countries. a early 2002, appear point deep gloom behind us, people start think shape renew period expansion probably get way year. this improvement assure could setbacks. but position is, respects, decidedly preferable year ago. for australia, good news, even though benefit show lag. the economy hold quite well face international weakness, continue so, time least. if recent hopeful sign global pick-up turn sustain period expansion, even moderate pace, australia well place continue turn good macroeconomic outcome slightly long term. bi review 39/2002 1 joseph yam: complaint bank role hkma speech mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hong kong association bank half-yearly dinner, hong kong, 24 june 2002. * * * i delight opportunity speak half-yearly dinner, i grateful organiser choose even happen coincide quarter-finals, semi-finals final world cup. this has, i sure agree, excite tournament far. one strike feature record number yellow red card issue player referee fouls, unsporting behaviour form misconduct. the reason put forward include worsen behaviour play field, strict application rule referees, great tendency among player complain real imagine grievances. whether good bad game matter debate: certainly make interest television. but world football see rise grievance complaints. it phenomenon affect many area life hong kong, include relationship consumer banks. complaint bank increase. we may take comfort fact that, set million bank consumer transaction take place every day, still form small number. there also many way explain increase start point possibility decline standard service. but increase matter concern hkma, least because, although subject much public scrutiny football referees, posse almost unlimited power decision. around year ago i speak half-yearly dinner subject consumer protection bank industry. in speech i set various option identify hkma effective handle consumer complaint banks. today i go address subject. you might wonder whether i run topics, whether hkma get stick groove. but i raise subject three reasons: • first, enhancement standardisation procedure handle complaint bank themselves, hkma's guideline subject issue february, industry's code bank practice, basic question complaint resolve individual bank remain unanswered. other courts, external dispute resolution mechanism bank customer hong kong. • secondly, number complaint bank receive hkma increase almost twofold first five month year compare period last year. there enormous surge complaint since last quarter last year. this rapid growth number complaint could indicate quality customer service deteriorating. whatever reason, pose additional burden concerned. • and thirdly, hkma find difficult cope situation. we divert staff resource important task time retrenchment. bad still, fact hkma explicit statutory responsibility resolve consumer complaint cause disappointment complainants. i please see debate issue revive recently, discussion consumer protection bank sector legislative council financial affair panel early month. i like even contribute debate two ways: • first, set i understand power hkma - - bank ordinance relation deal consumer complaint banks; • secondly, summarising, light recent debate, i believe next step improve handle complaints. the bank ordinance complex statute 200 page much amend since original enactment 1960s. the mandate hkma is, however, set plainly section 7(1) ordinance, state that: 2 bi review 39/2002 "the principal function monetary authority ordinance shall promote general stability effective work bank system." we pursue mandate license criterion ongoing supervision banks. we complement supervisory work variety initiative bank reform programmes, ultimate intention promote general stability effective work system. for example: • first, deposit insurance scheme, detail plan stage, promote general stability system protect individual depositor certain limit. • secondly, commercial credit reference agency, expect launch voluntary, market-based scheme not-too-distant future, promote effective work system - large economy - help bank channel lend creditworthy small enterprises. • thirdly, public consultation privacy commission soon commence broad proposal share positive consumer credit data - facility which, introduced, help address issue concern bank stability: dramatic rise consumer default personal bankruptcies. all measure implication individual customer banks, rationale derive ma's principal function: promote general stability effective work system. the important thing note "principal function" ma bank ordinance relate general, "macro", systemic issues, safety soundness bank system whole, relationship individual consumer banks. the hkma's involvement promote encourage proper standard conduct sound prudent business practice section 7(2) bank ordinance incidental primary function promote stability effective work bank system. nevertheless, even absence explicit legal mandate consumer protection, hkma become increasingly involve area, particularly help develop code bank practice enforce banks' compliance code. one recent real-life example quite appal case mistake identity recently come attention. the debt collection agency certain bank pursue debt innocent entirely unconnected third party happen live last know address real defaulter. the agent identify bank act collect debt. it keep pester innocent third party one month police find bank act complaint lodge hkma bank. but explanation give bank, complainant ourselves, mistake identity could arise measure would take prevent sort thing recurring, satisfactory. without go details, explanation raise question answered. this, view, give rise general supervisory concern bank business practices, practice relate debt collection generally. we therefore take matter code bank practice committee, industry association since remind member improve monitor performance debt collection agencies. we also tighten monitor issue, aware letter issue end last month. more half complaint receive debt collection: necessarily extreme case i described, many, view, raise similar supervisory concerns. take action question bad business practice use debt collection agency was, view, clearly within ma's power section 7(2), since could threaten reputation bank concern also bank system whole. however, would stretch power far apply "micro" region individual consumer complaint cost quality bank services. we frequently receive complaint fee charge make bank appear unreasonable complainant - example imposition charge dormant small deposit accounts. our practice complaint refer bank concern ask reply direct complainant. a long satisfy transparency standard code bank practice met, take view fee charge commercial decision intervene. in handle complaint bank services, hkma's role limit ensure process complaint handle ai fair efficient. we limit role dispute bi review 39/2002 3 resolution. even want intervene formally cases, difficult see how, legally speaking, could so. the sanction available section 52 ordinance - trigger specify sanction - make clear intervention ma ai must response issue affect health ai whole, interest depositor creditor whole, broad public interest. the ordinance confer power arbitrate disputes, name shame, require bank pay compensation rectify mistakes. there penalty kick yellow card red card available ordinance. to use power sanction available section 52 settle consumer complaint would rather like send whole team simple case offside. needle say, present arrangement give rise certain amount frustration. the complainant naturally assume body supervise bank - hkma - sort complaint bank recover financial losses. not surprisingly, every complainant discover cannot satisfy kind explanation legal power i give evening. some get angry, persist complaints. a take matter authorities. we divert staff resource time-consuming task deal rise number complaints. but limit without affect main responsibility mandate. clearly, something need done. what option available? what step taken? an obvious solution tackle problem source reduce grind complaint. this require bank maintain improve quality service improve complaint-handling procedure customer dissatisfaction deal quickly decisively. initiative bank industry co-operation hkma take past year promote process. they include major revision code bank practice, set basic standard personal bank service - issue debt collection - place emphasis transparency. they also include monitor compliance code hkma specific guidance hkma handle process complaints. in view recent surge number complaints, hkma industry association write ai urge sufficient resource devote handle complaint remind step monitor performance debt collection agencies. we believe initiative help promote high standard consistency handle complaints. we shall supplement initiative appropriate. but, matter high quality service, smooth efficient handle dissatisfy customer may become, always complaint misunderstandings. in fact, quite often easy complain, complaint - even time general quality service may improving. high expectation part public, great complexity service product contribute great volume complaints. le positively, difficult economic environment contribute friction bank customers, example great incidence default debt one hand great tendency among banks, time tight margins, go debt. whether good time bad, certain volume complaint healthy phenomenon encourage improvement service complaint upheld, improvement transparency misunderstand occur. on subject important way bank handle people's money, always complaints, need continue develop machinery deal them. let deal quickly option identify hkma survey last year which, i read correctly, debate within industry community rule out. the first option establishment separate bank ombudsman along line practice jurisdictions. this is, senses, roll royce solution would provide separate agency, process resolve complaints, power arbitrate complaint award compensation. it would, however, costly solution, would take considerable time implement. under system, process handle complaint would probably also quite resource-intensive, mean clear would able address full range complaint made. i think consensus present, reflect recent discussion legco financial affair panel, neither current volume nature complaint deficiency exist arrangement would justify creation elaborate machinery. the second option would give hkma clear mandate arbitrate resolve consumer complaint power impose sanctions. this option could go way towards address current gap expectation bank customer hkma exist powers. however, i think consensus right time 4 bi review 39/2002 hkma give role. it would require considerable increase resource form cost recovery bank industry, would also require address concern conflict interest different branch organisation - problem insoluble, would nevertheless require careful thought. this, least time being, seem prefer option. the weight opinion seems, then, fall third option, rely mainly industry ensure complaint properly handled. there three thing bank help promote self-regulation: • first, ai strictly follow code bank practice, issue industry associations. they comply form substance well. for example, relation debt collection, enough incorporate relevant provision code service agreement debt collection agents. they also pro-actively check agent actually follow provision collect debts. • secondly, ai ensure complaint deal fairly thoroughly. again enough efficient complaint handle policy procedure place. it important policy procedure conscientiously implement staff. where complaint justified, ai prepare offer complainant restitution compensation. • thirdly, ai ensure adequate level transparency provision bank product services. this important give proliferation innovative sophisticate product retail bank market. ai must let customer know true cost credit ensure advertise promotional material contain mislead information. self-regulation would success without involvement industry associations. over past six months, industry association take much active role develop code bank practice. they set code bank practice committee, far effective enhance role industry self-regulation market conduct. the committee respond effectively promptly public concern banks' business practice provide appropriate guidance interpretation code even amend relevant provision code. the question industry associations' involvement resolve customer disputes, whether relate code, controversial. although hkab ordinance provide association certain power relation conduct regulation, principal concern whether industry-run scheme would necessary credibility, since bank would effectively police themselves. the rapid growth number complaint cause concern cause alarm. the current framework self-regulation industry work reasonably well past reason cannot continue bite help bank themselves. we monitor situation carefully rush costly options. meanwhile, bank must help tackle problem source: careful avoid give grind complaint deal complaint arise fairly promptly. all rule role hkma. how best participate? i believe continue play support resource role, development tools, code bank practice guidance procedures, handle complaints, monitor role ensure system self-regulation develop hkab member work effectively. we also help educational point view clarify option member public wish complain bank disseminate information leaflets, website, tools. a part clarification must set limit hkma take bank consumer complaints: currently work clarification. self-regulation market, support guidance regulator, is, view, sensible appropriate way forward market economy hong kong. i therefore please general consensus seem point direction. whether approach succeed depend much effort energy put bank sector. it also influence trend complaint come month - rising, fall otherwise - light many factor bi review 39/2002 5 give rise complaints. the hkma, partnership hkab, monitor developments, i note legislative council panel also revisit issue six month time. let conclude one point, i hope become clear discussion issue. the outcome discussion may come disappointment say hkma evil plan take world grab power responsibility whenever can. the fact that, although technically "statutory" body, cannot pursuit policy strictly control legislation, matter ultimately legislative council decide. i have, i hope, show legislation, stands, permit u many thing many complainant would expect wish u do. in set various alternative approach complaint handle objectively can, have, i hope, make clear hkma seek, even welcome, expansion power satisfy expectations. on contrary, time continue challenge shrink resources, think sensible concentrate energy core responsibilities. we therefore welcome present consensus issue and, together hkab parties, shall best ensure works. bi review 39/2002 1 bruno gehrig: review swiss economy introductory remark prof bruno gehrig, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 14 june 2002. * * * development financial market from swiss vantage point, situation financial market first half 2002 predominantly influence exchange rate development swiss franc. the appreciation euro, set 11 september 2001, arrest fail bring sustain correction exchange rate. moreover, u dollar, too, decline since april. at begin june, fall low level swiss franc two-and-a-half years. there several reason decline u dollar – approximately 7% euro swiss franc since end march, approximately 6% vis-à-vis yen – : imponderable global political significance, grow doubt concern sustain upswing unite state – exacerbate collapse enron – scepticism investor respect future development yields. the record u current account deficit increasingly finance mean short-term capital flow abroad, which, nature, volatile. against background, high-risk investment generally show weak trend. equity market u dollar lose value gold price, bond swiss franc move up. a may repeatedly observe uncertain times, high demand swiss franc result great attraction exert currency foreign particularly also domestic investors. one reason extremely high international net creditor position country (139% gdp). in time instability, swiss investor reduce risk invest large part hold (or yield thereon) home currency hedge foreign-currency balance great extent previously. both strategy strengthen demand swiss francs. with interest rate differential swiss franc foreign currency investment widen since spring, «price» pay investor «safe haven» offer swiss franc has, however, risen. the yield differential long-term investment euro swiss franc amount almost two percentage points; since start year alone increase approximately 40 basis points. interest rates, reach relatively low level country, extent mitigate economic burden associate appreciation. they probably also contribute slight recovery euro vis-à-vis swiss franc past days. in first half 2002, capital market rate influence economic expectation unite states. the positive economic data march trigger vigorous rise long-term u interest rate approximately 50 basis point within brief time. with economic indicator expectation since april, long-term yield fell back mid-2001 level. the expectation reflect future market concern development money market rate – therefore also monetary policy – undergo mark downward adjustment, notably u dollar, also euro swiss franc. hope vigorous rapid economic recovery give way realistic assessment. the snb asset manager in context statutory mandate, national bank manage sizeable asset

this provide possibility spread fixed-interest investment evenly across various maturity currency widen range instruments. among currency (graph 1), u dollar euro predominate share 42% 46%

mostly implement internally team eight portfolio managers. we resort external asset manager investment approximately sfr 4 billion (global bond mortgage-backed securities). our entire investment activity systematically monitor risk specialists. in 2001, yield 5.2% achieve foreign exchange reserves. the average yield past four year 6.3%. a comparison similar investment – example, average yield swiss investment trust investment fund foreign currency bond – show remarkable result. gold hold (sfr 21 billion) swiss franc asset (sfr 5 billion securities, sfr 16 billion repos) also contribute earn monetary assets. the overall yield largely determine gold price exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate credit risk play less role. in past year, overall aggregate income monetary asset amount approximately 4.5%. other early years, price gold contribute positive yield. still, gold price subject strong fluctuation development difficult foresee. moreover, past, unfavourable currency movement expected. these influence clearly work past year. the appreciation swiss franc noticeable adverse effect yields. in first quarter, soar gold price lead yield approximately 3% monetary assets. in second quarter, considerable loss result currencies; loss already cancel part positive overall yield first quarter. this illustrate strong yield fluctuation asset exposed. with current composition

duisenberg, president european central bank, occasion 30th economics conference "competition region integration emu", vienna, 13 june 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, here vienna, exactly one hundred year ago, joseph schumpeter embark upon university study school law political science. he promise young student ambition academics, politics business. already, age 22, publish first work would soon become one young holder doctorate, young private teacher young professor austria. joseph schumpeter become know one foremost representative famous austrian school economics. he influence economic thought, particular, introduce innovation source economic dynamics. accord schumpeter, economic development dynamic process, disturbance economic status quo. the real challenge capitalism, therefore, create destroy economic structure process call "creative destruction" this, maintained, essence economic development, process define implementation entrepreneur new production combinations. i believe schumpeter would interest topic i want discus today. my speech euro catalyst integration competition emu, or, words, economic growth adjustment euro area. both high, sustainable economic growth ability adjust smoothly change economic environment require economic integration competition. this, turn, closely link process structural reform, which, use schumpeter's words, see necessary precondition dynamic economic process, disturbance economic status quo. the introduction euro act catalyst dynamic process structural change. in speech today i address follow topics. i first talk link european integration euro, argue increasingly competitive dynamic society raise need structural reforms. however, reform also important smooth function monetary union, point i discus next. finally, i ass progress make structural reform euro area far discus single currency already benefit euro area's economy, act – formulate title speech – catalyst integration competition. a single currency single market a natural start point topic today adoption single market programme 1985, pave way famous four "liberties" establish european treaties: free movement goods, services, labour capital. after adoption single market programme, become increasingly clear potential internal market could fully exploit relatively high transaction cost link currency conversion uncertainty associate exchange-rate fluctuation persisted. indeed, single currency see necessary complement or, fact, crown achievement single market. that said, reach end development single market. instead, i see euro facilitate economic integration. for example, country currency tend trade would country different currencies. in addition, single currency foster formation single financial system. by increase price transparency, reduce transaction cost foster competition, euro act powerful catalyst economic integration process euro area. last, least, common currency also powerful symbol citizen euro area integration reach new level. a approach first summer holiday season since introduction euro note coins, increase 2 bi review 39/2002 number people europe will, themselves, experience practical advantage single currency. the impetus euro give economic integration growth regard opportunity europe, also necessity world innovation globalisation. over last decades, world economy become ever integrated. we witness strong expansion international trade capital flow increase competition. behind change several underlie factors. among important rapid technological progress, lead dramatic reduction transportation cost unprecedented increase information process capabilities. policy measure also support globalisation trend, loosen restriction trade liberalisation capital movements. this panorama show live dynamic competitive world, ability innovate adjust change economic circumstance become even important before. in respect, schumpeter's think lose anything relevance. on contrary; dynamic, ever-changing economic environment, entrepreneur innovative sensitive new opportunities. the regulatory framework form laws, rule regulation influence economic behaviour, thus provide right incentive innovation, dynamism economic growth. the eu head state government recognise that, order improve function single market enhance economic growth potential eu, regulatory framework modernise reform needed. somewhat two year ago, lisbon european council formulate strategic goal decade, namely "to become competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world". the lisbon strategy establish comprehensive reform agenda aim overcome exist fragmentation inefficiency many different areas. this provide major political impetus progress field structural reform i much welcome. the european council aim increase potential gdp growth rate around 3% per year, objective achieve steady progress broad range reform made. whether objective meet hinge partly capacity improve mobilisation available labour resources. in regard, one explicit objective set lisbon summit raise eu-wide employment rate 70% work age population 2010. in order achieve lisbon objective, crucial progress systematically control evaluated. in context, broad economic policy guideline member state community play particularly important role. this overall framework co-ordination economic policies, particular, relate fiscal structural policies. in order fulfil role, broad economic policy guideline have, recent years, enhance several ways. they become operational use concrete recommendation general country-specific parts. moreover, within overall process policy co-ordination, increase emphasis place implementation. to end, european commission introduce comprehensive implementation report ass extent eu member state follow policy recommendations. i fully support changes. a know, recent spring meet european council, second "follow-up" meet lisbon, take place barcelona early year. the conclusion barcelona summit demonstrate strong political thorough preparation technical detail need european union meet ambitious economic, social environmental objective set lisbon summit. the successful introduction single currency best proof ingredient indispensable. the main point relevant council formations, european parliament member state take necessary step rigorously implement structural reform agenda agree lisbon confirm barcelona. why structural reform important? structural policy cover wide range area instruments. among commonly discuss microeconomic regulation implement product, labour financial markets. among things, regulation encompass competition policies, entry barriers, tax benefit systems, state aid, employment protection rules, education training, well incentive give research development. they important two main reason since enhance economic growth bi review 39/2002 3 potential facilitate adjustment economic change. let say word two reasons. first, structural policy one many factor determine rate economy grow, although many factor influence rate economic growth. some factors, change demand conditions, temporary effect economic growth, whereas others, rate growth work age population capital stock, well increase productivity, long-lasting effects. it latter type factor, however, determine potential growth rate economy. these components, particular growth employment productivity, influence structural policies. change tax benefit systems, example, help mobilise unused labour potential economy make financially attractive accept job. this could lead good use supply side potential economy. the third factor, productivity growth, influence several ways: increase competition, facilitate investment, encourage enterprise innovation improve workforce's skills. structural policy particular importance monetary policy. they allow economy grow high rate, sustain basis, without create inflationary pressures. however, structural reform important economic growth, also increase adaptability economic shocks. adaptability concern economy's ability adapt respond change economic conditions. it ability shift resource area recession boom areas, something key successful function monetary union. under emu, member country unable use country-specific monetary exchange rate policy address country-specific shocks. the adjustment economic fluctuation therefore take place adjustment mechanisms. without price wage flexibility mobility production factors, economic shock would lead low economic growth high unemployment. let say word important role adjustment mechanism monetary union. the theory optimal currency area ever since idea emu launched, discussion ensue whether whole part europe would optimal currency area. the optimal currency area theory define set mechanism might set motion participate country region, monetary union, hit asymmetric shock. first, adjustment shock might come domestic price wage changes, thereby alter real exchange rate without change nominal exchange rate. secondly, migration production factor might act adjustment channel. these flow labour capital facilitate high degree economic financial integration country participate union. in addition this, theory optimal currency area also something say similarity shock affect country region monetary union. in respect, degree trade financial integration often considered. trade financial integration may tend lead similar economic development respective country region monetary union, reduce likelihood asymmetric shock increase economies' ability adjust shocks. so far theory, let move practice. i focus two adjustment mechanisms: price-wage flexibility factor mobility. a host empirical study mechanism undertake euro area. how well euro area measure two criteria? price wage flexibility there broad agreement price flexibility low across euro area country comparison unite states. in euro area, price flexibility good service hamper trade barriers, continue state aid several sector and, generally, lack competition sector dominate monopoly state own enterprises. low wage flexibility also important factor behind lack price flexibility euro area. many study indicate comparison unite states, real wage relatively inflexible europe. more specifically, i mean downward responsiveness real wage level unemployment limit europe us. there are, however, notable difference across country euro area. let also mention potential link flexibility product labour markets. reform one area likely effect across markets. for example, reform lead flexible 4 bi review 39/2002 product market might improve performance labour market. if regulation set business loosened, employment creation also likely increase. similarly, labour market reform might also impact product markets. for example, labour market reform may improve extent difference skill productivity reflect wage differentials, could affect prices. more generally, flexible labour market allow company adjust economic change great ease. factor mobility let turn second adjustment mechanism, mobility factor production. change price levels, product labour markets, also trigger migration factor production. if country region affect negative output shock market clear instantaneously, unemployment rise. worker will, therefore, tend migrate regions. the might true capital: negative output shock make capital obsolete reduce profitability, investor would tend move fund regions. this adjustment mechanism two limitations. first, migration labour capital involve transaction costs. moreover, doubtful whether mechanism efficient country region hit temporary shock. therefore, factor mobility seem suitable adjustment mechanism case permanent shock price wage rigid. several study find labour mobility within unite state two three time high europe. this result confirm persistence regional unemployment difference europe. overall, conclude empirical study degree wage-price flexibility factor mobility relatively limit euro area. the lack adjustment mechanism euro area should, however, exaggerated. euro area country highly integrate term trade financially. a i explained, high degree trade financial integration may lead similar economic development across euro area countries. in addition, optimal currency area property likely evolve time. the irrevocable fix exchange rate introduction single currency may lead convergence production export structure economy euro area, thereby reduce risk future asymmetric shocks. this argument often refer "endogeneity" optimal currency area hypothesis. hence, accord endogeneity literature, euro area could gradually become optimal currency area, introduction euro. more generally, bear mind empirical study whether country enter euro area constitute optimal currency area base historical data. these data refer regime flexible fixed-but-adjustable exchange rates. in short, regime shift monetary union may impact economic structure may alter conclusion draw basis historical data. progress make structural reform euro area some people say central banker professional sceptic whose job point economic risk weaknesses. have listen far, i imagine may find degree truth this. let tell you, however, euro area recently see many change innovation go right direction. and i please able tell many change directly, indirectly, relate euro. let u close look three area change: financial markets, product market labour markets. financial market the first area i want discus financial markets. there ample evidence financial market way go national demarcation line effectively disappear. henceforth, still significant potential financial market integration euro area. financial market integration drive global developments, advance information technology, fall communication cost standardisation products. it also support european commission initiatives. a main policy initiative contribute financial market integration financial service action plan. eu head state government agree implement financial service bi review 39/2002 5 action plan 2005, latest, achieve fully integrate risk-capital security market 2003. the groundwork latter prepare committee wise men call lamfalussy group. on wholesale markets, measure facilitate raise capital eu-wide basis, common rule concern prospectuses, target adoption 2002. in addition, legislative proposal financial statement list company common legal framework single market security derivative close adopted. we, ecb, fully support initiatives. i would like stress, however, successful timely implementation financial service action plan difficult without continue commitment member states. the integration financial market would facilitate cross-border capital flow towards productive uses, could also serve catalyst structural reform markets. for example, impact product market reforms, aim ease restriction create business, likely reinforce well-functioning risk capital market, efficiently channel necessary fund investor begin entrepreneurs, place. the euro make spectacular impact financial market euro area. concrete example impact integration money market, explosive growth euro-denominated corporate debt market wave consolidation among intermediary exchanges. these fundamental changes. the surge euro-denominated corporate debt, example, help finance wave merger acquisition european corporate sector show large deep single financial market help strengthen europe's competitiveness. product market let turn product markets. the pace liberalisation differ considerably across country sector euro area, leave ample room reforms. whereas integration good market relatively advanced, shortcoming still exist regard integration service industries. most barrier integration service sector appear due national regulations, example administrative procedure set subsidiary euro area countries. regulatory barrier along line reduce competition services, thus keep price level would expect fully integrate market. more progress make regard integration good market regulatory reform network industries. here too, positive macroeconomic effect discerned. owe increase number competitors, price network industries, telecommunications, start decline, particular industry country liberalise earlier. the initiative telecommunication sector show reform succeed increase competition previously shelter sector considerably enhance productivity low prices. a network industry provide input rest economy, may also increase rate economy grow without create inflationary pressure. nevertheless, important unfinished agenda remain tackle almost network industries. in order reap full economic benefits, important reform network industry accompany appropriate regulatory framework ensure non-discriminatory access bottleneck infrastructure generally, "level play field" market participants. the quality regulatory framework considerable impact extent potential price fall due structural reform network industry achieved. another instrument available reduce distortion competition state aid policy. state aid subsidy weaken incentive company improve efficiency, enable le efficient survive expense efficient. although still substantial difference euro area countries, overall trend towards reduction state aid levels. another positive development transparency state aid policy improve result publication new state aid register state aid scoreboard european commission. the impact euro processes, lead competition, cannot overestimate go far beyond mere abolition intra-european exchange rate introduction common note coins. the single currency open euro area product market major impetus competition integration increase transparency price across borders. investment also benefit euro area company long insure exchange rate movement within euro area indeed indication direct investment euro area strongly increase since start emu. overall, euro give new impetus initiative take 1980s establish truly integrate internal market. 6 bi review 39/2002 labour market progress labour market reform become evident increase employment-intensive growth euro area. it interest note job creation hold reasonably well recent years. during first three year emu, 6 million job create euro area versus 3.5 million us. the unemployment rate euro area decline almost 11% 1997 slightly 8% 2001 (which still high). on supply side, employment rate, particularly case women, increase considerably, along proportion part-time job temporary contract total employment. euro area average participation rate are, nevertheless, still u scandinavian countries. the explanation job-rich growth lie structural change labour market wage moderation. government policy generally improve labour market performance euro area countries. a number country low marginal tax rate order make tax system employment-friendly. many country target tax cut low end labour market particular. these measure contribute high demand low-skilled workers. nevertheless, marginal tax rate still remain high countries. some progress also make introduction part-time flexible work contract practices. in addition government policies, sign gradual change labour market behaviour relate wage formation process. discipline seem improve field past decade. such change, result low inflation expectations, important. furthermore, seem grow awareness that, single currency environment, price increase loss competitiveness generate excessive wage settlement cannot compensate exchange rate depreciation may directly result loss jobs. look ahead, crucial social partner continue adhere moderate wage developments, since one prerequisite foster employment maintain favourable outlook price stability medium term. in respect, cause concern regard ongoing wage negotiations. the wage formation process also seem undergo changes. in majority euro area countries, sign gradual trend towards decentralise bargain flexibility low bargain levels. this seem happen, mostly informally, clause allow firm deviate sectoral central wage agreement accord financial situation firm sector. this encouraging. the outcome wage bargain allow appropriate wage development overall economy, also adequate wage differentiation across sectors, region firms. this make easy account local conditions, unemployment, productivity profitability differential across sectors, region firms. in short, labour market reform have, general, go right direction recent year benefit positive development clear. however, progress rather uneven across country areas. in many area important reform yet get ground. for instance, change make regard employment protection policy euro area countries, remain amongst strict industrial countries. furthermore, almost euro area countries, reform target unemployment benefit system make slow progress. at time, significant mismatch labour demand supply still present along number dimensions. all show large structural problem remain need solved. what need do speed labour market reforms? this difficult question, least euro area labour market still heterogeneous. each country identify root cause labour market deficiency implement appropriate corrective measures. however, area reform apply many, all, euro area countries. improve job mediation, education training, mention examples, help towards make match process efficient. in addition, euro area country need ensure tax benefit system make work pay. reform tax benefit system increase work incentives, profitability competitiveness consequently labour supply demand. at time, important ensure tax-benefit reform undertake without jeopardise long-term sustainability public finances. bi review 39/2002 7 conclusion lady gentlemen. joseph schumpeter teach u economic development consist continuous introduction new combination product mean production. he teach u process involve incessant mutation economic structure within, destroy old create new. in today's dynamic, ever-changing economic environment, entrepreneur innovative sensitive new opportunities. the regulatory framework design way allow happen provide right incentive innovation, dynamism economic growth. today's dynamic society also require increase ability market adjust smoothly change economic circumstances. this true monetary union, member country long able use country-specific monetary exchange rate policy address country-specific shocks. in environment, adjustment mechanism need price wage flexibility factor mobility. structural reform contribute good function adjustment mechanism foster integration competition. the relationship integration, competition single currency work directions. the euro already contribute integration competition continue future. it impact clearly visible financial markets, single money market create deep, liquid bond market encourage surge debt issuance corporate sector. in product markets, euro important impact cross-border transparency prices, act catalyst trade. finally, regard labour markets, wage formation process show sign increase flexibility labour market reform start go right direction. overall, single currency contribute forcefully integration competition, act powerful driver enhancement single market create environment – i sure – schumpeter would enjoyed. thank much attention. bi review 38/2002 1 tony latter: hong kong's currency board today - unexpected challenge deflation speech mr tony latter, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, conference "alternative exchange rate regime globalise world", organise eesti pank mark ten year currency board estonia, tallinn, 11 june 2002. * * * the conquest inflation those u today study economics almost certainly period least mild, quite rapid inflation. and u central banker majority work life struggle cope inflation. so hardly surprise back 1983, hong kong authority peg hong kong dollar unite state dollar, seriously contemplate deflationary scenario. the u inflation rate early 1980s average 4% pa and, possess special forecast capability field, must reckon would remain near figure. in addition, textbook would tell u structural developmental factor would tend make hong kong's inflation rate somewhat fast u - indeed ensue fourteen years. neither significantly low rate u inflation situation hong kong's rate significantly u rate would consider likely. yet hong kong find consumer price level 12% peak four year ago, gdp deflator 15% peak 22% low relative u four year ago. what explanation, one live this? there general consensus, support recent imf analysis research conduct within hkma, hong kong's deflation predominantly cyclical. i shall return hong kong minute, let first dwell moment global slowdown inflation. over past four year rate consumer price inflation average 2.5% usa, 1.7% euroland, minus 0.3% japan, minus 0.3% mainland china. in six economy east south-east asia take together, inflation rate fell 2.7% average four year 4.4% precede four.1 this widespread slowdown inflation, case emergence deflation, cyclical phenomenon. there are, i believe, fundamental institutional structural factor contributing. underlie force a. successful central bank first commitment monetary authority combat inflation evident success (or even over-achievement instances). with many represent today, i need elaborate further. b. the supply side - history repeat second argument world merely revert natural historical state decline price levels, follow interruption second world war ensue decades.2 the current deflationary tendency is, view, drive it revolution also evolution china emerge economy huge competitive price-reducing force world markets, manner reminiscent productivity surge market open 1 average malaysia, philippines, singapore, south korea, taiwan thailand, weight nominal gdp. indonesia exclude considerable institutional political instability period - suffer particularly intense inflation 1998-99. 2 i grateful eisuke sakakibara lucid exposition point address last month hong kong foreign exchange market practice committee. the 69th annual report bank international settlement (pages 77-81) provide interest snapshot topic, see three year ago. 2 bi review 38/2002 produce fall price level part globe close decade nineteenth century. allow digress moment history. a illustrate accompany charts, thirty year 1865-95 consumer price estimate fall 48% unite state 27% unite kingdom - average compound rate decline 2% 1% respectively.3 this generally regard supply-side-driven phenomenon arise rapid productivity growth alongside abundant labour supply, aid opening-up new market globally. real gdp growth average 5-6% (boosted immigration) usa 1?% uk period. subsequently, modest inflation take over, inflation reach serious scale first world war.4 the inter-war year rather different late nineteenth century episode. there mixture deflation inflation - former result monetary policy mistakes, associate great depression, supply-side force plainly evident half century earlier. inflation really become re-established significant scale second world war, persist remainder twentieth century. most recently, potential problem pose deflation, particularly financially develop world debt balance sheet interact, become apparent, notably perhaps japan. all all, perhaps mix message historical examples. it may possible live comfortably modest pace deflation, especially reflect benign supply-side influences. nevertheless, monetary policy might usefully engage avert it. c. globalisation pervasiveness law one price return factor behind current price trends, one aspect globalisation may especially relevant. this rapid expansion range globally trade output (in contrast efficiency gain within pre-defined range), resultant implication prices. in past common observe rapid domestic inflation economy enjoy fast productivity growth, wage rise price non-tradables accelerated, drag consumer price index. this mechanism, base assume clear analytic distinction price behaviour tradables non-tradables, may still work, surely powerful use be. the range tradables expand relative non-tradables. while long acknowledge progressively good become tradable of, example, advance freight transportation, revolution respect service may significant. thus, many service past produce country consume nowadays out-sourced offshore access somewhere else world click mouse - back-office processing, multi-functional call-centre services, legal advice, logistics management, design service everything clothe buildings, even certain form medical consultation education, name few. moreover, buyer service increasingly elect travel elsewhere consume them. thus international price elasticity wed ceremony, game golf, hospital health spa treatment, conference facility ever rising. soon remain location-specific activity - heritage tourism perhaps, even immune pressure law one price, one consider compete heritage site around world. i see evidence hong kong impact process broad-based globalisation, i sure happen elsewhere too. liberalisation trade policy achievement wto also contributed. thus, deflation drive part expansion intensification competition across ever large range sector countries. this may explain price surprise macro-policy front recent past downside, central bank digest ingredient reason temporarily knock course it. 3 for uk, peak-to-trough comparison would 1873-95, average compound deflation rate 1.7% pa. 4 my thank hkma colleague daryl ho lu dai research historical data. bi review 38/2002 3 hong kong in hong kong, contributor deflation past year general strength u dollar process price equalisation across border mainland, although imf hkma find latter effect rather weak overall well publicise example might lead one believe.5 hong kong's deflation, 12% cpi term four years, seems, however, considerably could account list essentially non-cyclical factors. we therefore infer much cyclical. to extent currency board responsible cycle? about half fall cpi attribute collapse property prices, fee directly indirectly cpi. this turn largely result burst previous asset price bubble. this part deflation may appear obviously link domestic monetary condition rather global cyclical factors. however, although clear monetary condition hong kong were, consequence tie u currency board mechanism, loose mid-1990s one might ideally wished, although empirical research suggest relationship property cycle interest rates, relationship find particularly robust powerful one. moreover, factor contribute develop property price bubble mid-1990s, strong overall performance economy, link rapid development mainland china, euphoria ahead return hong kong china 1997, demographics, impact local land release public house policies.6 the cessation reversal influence help explain subsequent downturn. all all, therefore, quite range factor come together produce deflation hong kong. there would little point ask precisely much deflation blame currency peg since, answering, one would need specify sort monetary policy authority would pursue instead currency board. in absence liquidity trap (possibly significant proviso age), possible choose policy could succeed narrow objective eliminate deflation, whatever cost benefit term policy objectives. but currency board regime rule choice, sense cannot escape ascribe significance explanation hong kong's price deflation. doe price deflation matter? in address question, attention tend focus fact negative inflation may certain circumstance imply undesirably high real rates, that, particular, rule negative real interest rate (at least measure simplistically adjust nominal rate immediate past price movements), may deem appropriate period deflation. but obvious real rate much influence intertemporal consumption decision - example, little evidence people abstain purchase electronic good past several decade despite fairly certain knowledge price would low tomorrow, limit extent one delay buy food clothing. and, regard investment spending, real interest rate calculate reference cpi relevant, user cost - nominal interest rate relative expect future net yield asset question, adjust depreciation. price different asset class adjust accord market force user-cost arithmetic, may particularly sensitive change broad price level per se. in light, least questionable whether mild overall deflation would material impediment investment decisions. what might significant impact deflation via interest rate effect deflationary process real income profits. if price drive competitive forces, profit squeezed, may impact adversely future investment. it may serve harsh signal need restructure diversify. at time, nominal wage remain unchanged, worker gain real income. we witness hong kong, little sustain consumption 5 see philip schellekens, "deflation hong kong sar", imf work paper, forthcoming; jiming ha kelvin fan, "price convergence hong kong mainland", hkma research memorandum, forthcoming. 6 for full analysis see wensheng peng, "what drive property price hong kong?", hkma research memorandum, forthcoming. 4 bi review 38/2002 caution job security. after while, nominal pay begin adjust downwards unemployment begin rise. although may still true many work good (having suffer reduction pay le amount price deflation four year period), many others lose job settle lower-paid positions. meanwhile, reduction real profit correspond buoyancy real wage may dampen investment spending, although support empirical evidence scarce. overall has, practice, prove difficult identify impact deflation good service prices, itself, may activity. in general, however, degree downward wage flexibility hong kong probably great elsewhere, economy believe good able others cope type deflationary pressure avoid severe distributional disequilibria. deflation asset price rather different issue. we certainly experience negative wealth effects, particularly household expenditure, result sharp drop property prices. one factor enable hong kong live deflation perhaps good economy resilience bank system ability cope debt deflation. a long tradition fairly conservative prudential oversight bank leave strong enough weather recession. although demonstrate live deflation, modest positive rate inflation might nevertheless prefer current modest negative rate. and would certainly desirable avoid gyration property price sort bring sharp deflation recent years. however, regard exchange rate viable instrument try dispel deflation. we would consider worthwhile sacrifice long track record discipline monetary stability purpose. conclusion - lesson 1990s allow set conclude remark contest specific question pose panel, namely "fix versus float - learn 1990s?" my answer fall two parts. first, 1990s serve confirm already become apparent experience currency board 1980s, namely currency board viable and, arguably, optimal regime certain type economy, all. the necessary condition success include sufficiently flexible cost prices, sound bank system, adequate fiscal discipline requisite foreign exchange reserve back monetary base, preferably free encumbrance. not desideratum satisfy one instance 1990s' currency board, since pass history. the second lesson concern novel feature emerge late 1990s persist current decade - namely deflation. society globally re-learning live this, gap lifetime. it seem perfectly possible live modest deflation, ancestor did, adapt it. we reasonably confident u economy, whose monetary stance hong kong tied, develop way make problem - indeed - worse. while float regime plainly provide great flexibility attempt influence price level (although attempt may always succeed), hong kong see reason abandon monetary regime, serve economy well almost twenty years. bi review 38/2002 5 source: international historical statistics: europe 1750-1993 / b. r. mitchell, london: macmillan reference; new york, n.y.: stockton press, 1998 bi review 38/2002 1 nout wellink: the role national central bank within european system central banks- example de nederlandsche bank

nederlandsche bank’, oesterreichische nationalbank conference ‘competition region integration emu’, vienna, 13-14 june 2002 * * * introduction i would first like thank oesterreichische nationalbank invite conference take challenge discuss role national central bank europe. clearly, role undergo fascinate metamorphosis introduction single currency. suddenly, strong, european dimension add institution traditionally largely confine national boundaries. consequently, national central bank europe peculiar sort double identity. on one hand, deeply root national tradition sovereignty, reflect specific national task responsibilities. on hand, part system central bank responsible fully supranationalised monetary policy related, common tasks. let briefly outline paper role national central bank europe. first, i shortly discus general framework european system central banks. subsequently, i touch system task relate national responsibilities. here, i specifically spend time financial stability supervision. clearly, policy area see major development recently, national european level. the european system central bank what exactly european system central banks? what explain unique institutional operational set-up? these crucial question analyse role national central bank or, matter, understand monetary union general. nevertheless, question seldom asked, let alone answered. since second world war, european integration co-operative effort common objective principle override size power individual participants. the european system central bank product reflection european community member states. hence, fundamental notion underlie system joint equal responsibility carry task assign treaty. in set-up, ecb operate legal entity link speak system thus make joint responsibility task possible. the govern council high decision-making body ecb, consist executive board member governor national central banks. apart fundamental notion joint responsibility, two guide principle treaty determine operational side system. first, subsidiarity prescribe responsibility lie low possible level. in context european community, principle respect national sovereignty reflect heterogeneity member states. second, treaty prescribe efficient allocation resources. in words, system effective least cost. in practice, may trade-off principle subsidiarity efficiency, gross inefficiency should, course, avoided. task european system central bank now, basic system framework mind, let turn actual task national central bank follow system. in paper, i cover task decide execute monetary policy, foreign reserve management, collection production statistics, external relations, operational aspect payment system banknotes. give time constraints, i limit conduct monetary policy. 2 bi review 38/2002 the fundamental notion joint responsibility add value sense offer check balance monetary policy process. for example, participation ncb-governors increase accountability quality decision-making. indeed, give joint responsibility price stability, national central bank right, also obligation, fully prepare governor capacity ecb-council member. although fundamental system, notion joint responsibility allow institutional flexibility come effectiveness monetary policy – clearly lie heart monetary union. let first emphasise present size (18 members) govern council never stumble block effective, necessary, rapid decision-making. nevertheless, perception that, emu-enlargement, size team could hamper effectiveness monetary policy. that treaty nice go far offer possibility restrict number vote govern council monetary policy. clearly, basis fundamental notion system built, governor remain equally involve future monetary policy decisions. however, may vote time. moreover, participation ncb-governors continue offer check balance enhance quality decision-making. let turn guide principle subsidiarity. clearly, principle imply that, large extent, speak system take care input outputs. give heterogeneity euro area, bottom-up approach system task make sense. thus, deal economic, structural, even linguistic difference national preferences, speak good position operation monetary policy. the go manage payment system collection statistic – task i leave aside moment. moreover, governor respective central bank bring specific local knowledge enhance healthy competition within system – example area research. of course, explained, conscious potential trade-off subsidiarity guide principle efficiency. a such, deny efficiency gain achieve production distribution banknotes. we need pursue possibilities. financial stability bank supervision – national task ncbs this bring central bank task fall outside exclusive domain european system central banks. for dutch central bank, task take around half staff relate international financial relations, advise government, financial stability bank supervision. under subsidiarity principle, responsibility lie close sovereignty nation state. nevertheless, clear link synergy task european system central bank – which, fact, important reason national central bank tasks. let limit financial stability supervision – give importance recent european discussions. accord treaty, european system central bank whole shall contribute smooth conduct policy pursue competent authority field prudential supervision financial stability. the collective responsibility contribute policy follow financial stability task national central banks. this involvement financial stability natural reflection tasks, include monetary policy, payment system – vary extent – bank supervision. monetary policy rely financial stability order effective. in addition, exercise oversight national payment systems, central bank guard systemic risk could transmit via systems. there therefore clear synergy financial stability tasks. central synergy wealth knowledge financial system central bank´s active presence financial markets. again, structural difference financial system across euro area mean financial stability task appropriately locate national level, although communication co-ordination across border increasingly important. whereas national central bank financial stability task, direct competence field prudential supervision. the choice delegate supervisory task central bank is, course, base national circumstance preferences. however, important synergy financial stability supervisory task ignored. i come back issue i discus supervisory arrangement netherlands. in general, important stress national european level national central bank remain involve discussion bi review 38/2002 3 prudential supervision. this essential proper execution financial stability task and, such, enable system contribute smooth conduct supervisory policies. recent development europe regard supervision recently, perception increase cross sector cross border financial integration result demand enhance supervisory structure europe. i fully subscribe ambition speed regulatory process supervision europe. moreover, convergence supervisory practice would serve level play field european financial markets. last year, european committee chairmanship mr brouwer – director dutch central bank – make several recommendation point. a i explained, involvement national central bank continue offer welcome expertise assess supervisory need challenge financial integration. concern topic directly relate financial stability systemic risks, national central bank frontline european discussions, together counterpart ministry finance. however, i would warn suggestion introduce single european supervisor. it misconception expect top approach design supervision europe would promote financial integration. clearly, would simply ignore structural difference national level. indeed, practice emu show critical mass integration need institutional convergence (i.e. introduction euro) work catalyst. likewise, i would warn suggestion financial stability perspective, number supervisor consolidated. here again, principle subsidiarity allow necessary check balances, would lose one supervisory giant europe. supervisory reform netherlands this bring me, promised, supervisory arrangement netherlands. in relative terms, consolidation integration dutch financial sector well-advanced. first, experience show future challenge cross border supervision may merely european, rather global dimension. moreover, face horizontal integration, division supervisory task netherlands recently streamline along functional lines. thus, organisational link dutch central bank (as bank supervisor) insurance supervisor strengthened. this allow integrate approach prudential supervision. on hand, issue relate conduct business consumer protection concentrate financial market authority. these recent reform country subscribe basic principle effectiveness subsidiarity i refer earlier. thus, case term efficiency effectiveness reallocate supervisory task already assign central bank. here, synergy task financial oversight acknowledged. moreover, link role lender last resort. with supervisor in-house, quick effective assessment make nature crisis – include whether involve liquidity solvency difficulties. consequently, central bank good insight risk financial system large. finally, necessary check balance – particular regard supervisory autonomy accountability – retained. conclusion let conclude. it likely european system central bank continuously evolve interplay hub speak – exploit efficiency gain extent principle subsidiarity allows. however, federal shape system firmly root national component central bank reflect main driver european integration – nation state. in short, imply that, anything short political union, fundamental principle collective responsibility system remain place. all central bank fully involve fulfil collective responsibility. moreover, unique structure european system central bank double identity participant add important value. the monetary policy process gain individual expertise, knowledge network national central bank improve quality decision-making offer check balances. the system set-up also enable great synergy execution 4 bi review 38/2002 national central bank tasks. i refer respect national responsibility financial stability, – case dutch central bank – task supervision. i convince that, base fundamental notion collective responsibility guide principle subsidiarity efficiency, system continue generate good joint individual policies, provide proper check balance even enhance european integration process general. a such, national central bank might even contribute loosen root existence - nation state would dissolve political union. but even then, difference structure, culture language remain, need similar, regional body keep monetary union operational. refer theme conference, perhaps future generation witness birth new entity – regional central bank. bi review 37/2002 1 susan s bies: bank performance corporate governance remark m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, 112th annual meet tennessee banker association, hot springs, virginia, 11 june 2002. * * * good morning. thank invitation speak member tennessee banker association today. i really enjoy get talk many old friends. some ask i surprise new role governor federal reserve board. i must say big surprise amount read i do. i haven’t read much many different topic since i graduate school! not i get discus economics monetary policy, also bank regulation operation issues. even though i experience federal reserve bank first tennessee bank total twenty-six years, i find wear hat central banker make consider issue face financial industry new ways. i hope year i continue meet group like i stay date issue important bankers. in comment today, i address: first, financial performance u.s. banks, particular, community banks; second, improvement bank large small make measure manage risk; and, third, responsibility director senior manager corporate governance. in view, topic integrally link and, light current question confidence america’s corporations, quite timely. fourth finally, i would also like mention proposal federal reserve issue comment change discount window. financial condition u.s. bank last year exceptional many respects, unite state slip appear mild recession, terrorist attack september. in response, federal reserve reduce interest rate every meet federal open market committee 2001 additional three time meetings, total eleven rate cut accumulate 475 basis points. the federal reserve move policy bias address weakness, one risk inflation weakness balanced. credit quality deterioration concentrate large corporations, several file bankruptcy. serious concern arise integrity corporate management financial reporting. argentina’s economic difficulty remind us, yet again, exposure emerge economy could present substantial risk. give events, u.s. bank system remain strong, possibly large part recession country seem relatively mild short-lived. more directly, strength seem also reflect improvement risk management many bank great awareness throughout industry institution promptly address problem emerge. this time bank industry regulatory agency appear do that--acted promptly--and without go far unnecessarily constrain credit. much weakness among bank recently concentrate large regional money center banks, rather small institutions. bank earn reach record level first quarter 2002, one high quarterly return-on-assets ratio ever report 1.33 percent. net interest income driver strong revenue, despite low commercial loan volume. loan loss provision significantly first quarter 2001, although level fourth quarter. high charge-offs concentrate commercial loan large bank credit card specialty lenders. what area may present heighten risk community bank today? first, past decade, community banks--particularly asset range $100 million $1 billion--have actively expand commercial real estate lending. since early 1990s, large community bank expand commercial real estate portfolio 13 percent aggregate asset 22 percent. to date, credit generally perform well, comment intend suggest material concern. these credits, however, account group’s increase nonperforming 2 bi review 37/2002 asset past year. give checker history commercial real estate lend increase relevance many community banks, portfolio must monitor manage carefully. we often see cyclical nature commercial real estate link general level economic activity. the loss anchor firm k-mart, example, may reduce market value certain shop center consumer traffic financial strength nearby business well. the second area potential risk relate interest rates. for industry overall, federal reserve’s rate cut last year may prove mix blessing. low interest rate undoubtedly ease payment pressure many borrower prevent deterioration quality bank loan portfolios. liability-sensitive bank saw fund cost fall fast loan investment yields, half bank wide net interest margin first quarter 2002 2001. however, low interest rate begin narrow net interest margin institutions. rate pay deposit close effective floors, yield loan portfolio low record volume refinance fall prime rate. many bank respond low rate sharply reduce investment treasury shift fund mortgage-backed securities, search high yields. give historically low interest rate recent mortgage originate refinance one might expect loan would much slow prepay previous ones. a result, effective maturity, duration, bank security portfolios--and many loan portfolios, well--has extended. clearly, i forecast interest rates, something i’ve already learn central banker never do. nevertheless, interest-rate environment could present bank great challenge late year. even stable rate could present increase risks, save money market deposit account deposit flow bank quickly come last year. we ask long depositor would content earn currently low rate equity market improve interest rate rise again. at point, even loyal customers--those fix incomes, particular--may blink take step improve returns. turn longer-term outlook, prospect community banks? they historically high profitability, measure return average assets, large regional money center bank and, individual-institution basis, enjoy relatively strong asset deposit growth. a study recently publish federal reserve bulletin examine growth rate past fifteen year large small banks. adjust data merger acquisitions, author find small medium-sized banks--defined 100 largest--grew fast large bank virtually every year 1985 2000. moreover, small banks, 1,000 large term assets, grow fast deposit total assets. the bank old-fashioned way, earn asset large institutions. although small bank pay high average deposit rate large bank paid, net interest margin still much higher, grow differential recent years. measure return assets, small bank do well good large bank handful year past decade half. manage risk the health financial institution today also reflect improvement risk management process ongoing bank years. increasingly, entire risk management process become quantitative, reflect enhance ability low cost collect process data also improve technique measure manage risk. large bank organization quantify borrower’s probability default, bank’s loss give default likely exposure time default--practices upon try construct new international capital standards. the great use credit score has, seems, improve risk management well. such tool perform even good effect recent economic slowdown incorporated. consumer credit model develop 1990-91 recession, reliability predict credit quality current slowdown yet determined. further, already observe increase delinquency subprime lending. since many borrower bi review 37/2002 3 significant access credit previous recessions, ultimate default rate also help validate strength new statistical models. community bank greatly improve management interest rate risk recent years. information develop model use identify sensitivity market change mix loan deposit part asset/liability committee meet community banks. a result, manager good anticipate change net interest income respond appropriately unique competitive conditions. community banker also develop new revenue stream help manage risk diversify source earnings. in addition, fee income stream help increase cross-sell ratio key customers. this turn improve customer loyalty, another factor help manage risk stabilize revenue. provide personal touch serve community bank well, conduct sound market research price reflect competition, customer value, risk become important success. the arthur andersen matter corporate event currently address provide good risk management lesson banker try increase earn cross sell products. when line officer compensate sale cross selling, strong, independent quality assurance risk review function become even essential. for public account firms, strong quality assurance function need protect core business integrity attestation service firm try win consult contracts. in banks, credit still dominant risk exposure, chief credit officer make sure unacceptable credit risk take win fee income business whose net revenue may cover credit exposures. corporate governance another critical element risk management effective corporate governance. a banker bank directors, specific responsibility manage risk financial institution effectively oversee system internal controls. not activity bank central credit intermediation, country bank fund activity part federally insure deposits. these deposit low cost source fund banker government’s guarantee. bank director expect understand every nuance bank oversee transaction. they look management that. they do, however, responsibility set tone regard institutions’ risk take oversee internal control process reasonably expect directive followed. they also responsibility hire individual believe integrity exercise high level judgment competence. interagency policy hold board director responsible ensure organization effective audit process internal control adequate nature scope businesses. the report line internal audit function information director receive impartial unduly influence management. internal audit key element management’s responsibility validate strength internal controls. if internal audit outsourced, best practice use firm external audit engagement. internal control responsibility line management. line manager must determine level risk need accept run businesses, assure combination earnings, capital internal control sufficient compensate risk exposures. staff area accounting, internal audit, risk management, credit review, compliance, legal, independently monitor control process ensure effective risk measure appropriately. the result independent review routinely report executive management board directors. both executive management board engage enough process determine review fact independent operate area design review, senior officer role speak freely issue need addressed. audit committee member regular time meet talk outside auditor without manager present. best practice audit committee process lay many times, include 1980s treadway commission 2000 blue ribbon committee. beyond that, board director manager periodically test stand ethical business practices. for example, ask, “are get technicalities, 4 bi review 37/2002 adhere letter spirit law? be compensate others base contribution organization, take advantage positions?” my intent today remind everyone importance maintain sound ethical practice help protect reputation bank. a recent event demonstrated, fail market enforce discipline. and discipline harsh. quality account practice the current framework financial report unite state effectively represent performance corporation time. indeed high quality account standard country one critical reason capital market efficient. but lesson past month remind u account rule bent. for six year i member emerge issue task force financial account standard board. this rulemaking body deal divergence practice. the eitf’s role provide timely financial report guidance divergence practice developing. in time i serve eitf i come understand professional could disagree best account standard apply new type transaction. that heart struggle keep account standard current. the rapid pace business innovation make impractical rule place anticipate every business transaction. rather, complex dynamic world business becomes, important account base strong principle sufficiently robust provide framework proper account new type transactions. further, need insist high professional standard permit financial officer auditor benefit “gaming” rules-based account standard increase complexity, particularly unite states. the core basic account principle professional standard follow every corporate accountant every outside auditor would insist answer “yes” questions: “does account method select faithfully represent economics transaction? doe disclosure provide user financial report sufficient information discern nature significant transaction risk organization?” but rule alone guarantee good financial reporting. for enron recent examples, weak corporate governance practice apparently permit sham transaction mislead financial report occur. outside auditor err try much please pay client. they forget professional role provide assurance user financial report quality financial report meet expectation marketplace. some observer assert new account standard needed. i know specific many irregularity recently come light. but judge publicly available information, i believe need restore integrity corporate accountant quality audit process rather extensive new account standards. one reason account unite state become rule-based tend add new account standard abuse occur even abuse result account audit failures. discipline auditor occur account standard manipulated. the present industry-driven process clearly work new oversight process need ensure audit quality. give human nature, must expect rule sometime broken. but expect oversight board enforce penalty appropriate situation discourage others break rule future. corporate board account officer need shoulder responsibility too. the surprise typically occur bank due nature risk exposure quality risk management practices. in addition apply sound account treatments, manager must ensure public disclosure clearly identify significant risk exposures--whether balance sheet--and effect firm’s financial condition performance. i particularly want emphasize disclosure need standard account framework exactly all--otherwise would certain create statistical artifact implication safe harbors. rather, insist entity disclose belief stakeholder need evaluate risk profile. the uniqueness risk business line complex organization mean disclosures--to effective--should different bank. that approach take develop basel ii capital accord. disclosure rule build rigidly risk bi review 37/2002 5 management process continue evolve may make le effective describe risk profile specific organization. but banker voluntarily improve disclosures, rule written. propose change federal reserve discount window operation a probably know, board governor recently request public comment proposal revise federal reserve’s discount window programs. before i get details, i’d like emphasize implementation proposal would entail change stance monetary policy. there nothing proposal would necessitate change target federal fund rate level interest rate generally. the board propose establishment new type discount window credit, call primary credit, would replace adjustment credit, currently federal reserve’s main lend program. primary credit would available short term backup source liquidity depository institution generally sound financial condition. there would prohibition lend proceed primary credit loan depository institutions. unlike adjustment credit, currently extend below-market rate, primary credit would extend rate would usual level short-term market interest rates, include federal fund rate. by restrict eligibility generally sound institution eliminate incentive institution borrow exploit below-market discount rate, primary credit program considerably reduce need federal reserve discount officer review fund situation borrowers. and since sound institution use primary credit, bank le concern use window would signal incorrectly experience significant fund difficulties. a result, federal reserve expect institution will use window. this increase willingness, ability institution resell proceed discount window loans, improve function window safety valve reserve market individual institutions. the interest rate primary credit would set procedure identical currently use basic discount rate. that is, board director reserve bank would set rate, subject review determination board governors. in proposal, envision interest rate primary credit would initially set 100 basis point target federal fund rate. if adopted, program would align lend practice major central banks. the board also request comment seasonal credit program. the seasonal credit program establish 1973 address difficulty relatively small bank substantial intra-yearly swing fund need face lack access national money markets. however, fund opportunity small depository institution expand significantly past decade result deposit deregulation general development financial markets, call question continue need seasonal program. the board seek specific comment whether small depository institution still lack reasonable access fund market continue need seasonal lend program. the board would also like comment method set seasonal credit discount rate, currently average federal fund rate certificate deposit rate, well propose primary credit rate. we would value comment aspect proposal. the ninety-day comment period end august 22. information address comments, information propose revision, find board governors’ website. conclusion in closing, i commend industry, generally, successfully deal challenge 2001. the industry demonstrate fundamentally sound well positioned. banker support development risk management process type risk relevant particular institution. sound accounting, auditing, disclosure, consistently applied, long heart efficient markets. though quality bank account control system strong, banker heed lesson learn enron breakdown account audit processes. strengthen corporate governance need prevent abusive practice occur institutions. 6 bi review 37/2002 a banker bank regulators, responsible conduct affair competence integrity. let’s take opportunity time like present make bank system even stronger. bi review 37/2002 1 bruno gehrig: global economic trend implication financial market infrastructure speech prof bruno gehrig, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, 11th international security service association (issa) ubs executive development center, wolfsberg, 12 june 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, it honour pleasure opportunity give open speech 11th issa symposium. i delight choose switzerland venue conference hope feel comfortable relax beautiful spot lake constance. i gladly accept invitation although i expert professional field. but i was, still am, use service rather intensively: 1980s head security sale trade ubs, late ceo asset management bank, investor currency reserve swiss national bank (snb). i would like use time allocate reflect global economic trend implication financial market infrastructures. afterwards, i outline consequence change oversight authorities, face similar challenge capacity commercial service providers. global economic trend what global economic trend perceive daily business? let focus prominent ones: alleviation barrier trade good financial assets, factor affect overall demand supply securities. alleviation barrier trade good financial asset barrier trade goods, service financial asset progressively lift last decades, lead grow interaction among national economic systems. this grow interaction connectedness people commonly refer globalisation. country participate process see domestic financial market become integrate market abroad. two factor shape characterise process. first, technological innovation sharply reduce transportation telecommunication costs. some figure take imf study illustrate impressive change1. table 1 communication computer costs, 1960-2000 cost 3-minute phone call, new york london (in 2000, usd) price computer peripheral equipment relative gdp deflator (year 2000=1000) 1960 60.42 1,869,004 1970 41.61 199,983

review 37/2002 in 40 years, telecommunication cost shrink factor 150, computer cost become around 1900 time cheaper. a consequence, information disseminate almost real-time low cost. second, financial crisis become frequent. most time, drive rapid inflow outflow capital. we still vividly remember crisis mexico, asia, russia argentina. obviously, crisis restrict financial sector, profound impact real economy well. the lift restriction cross-border hold trade financial asset unleash massive capital flows. accord world bank figures, global debt equity flow (excluding foreign direct investment) expand five time since 1991, usd 794 billion usd 4.3 trillion2. without doubt, development reflect long-term trend. more investor decide globally basis risk-adjusted expect returns. take place system increasingly integrate capital markets, capital allocation become efficient. the side coin, however, increase volatility financial markets. indeed, portfolio investments, particular market relatively high liquidity, become erratic, fund injection withdrawal respond quickly new information. accord imf, asset manage institutional investor mature market estimate usd 30 trillion 1998. thus, shift huge portfolio likely exacerbate economic cycle possibly lead contagion among financial markets. the impact portfolio re-balancing powerful macroeconomic policy seem unsustainable financial institution show fundamental weaknesses, often regard financial strength, supervision transparency. experience show enhance financial integration has, whole, result high growth great convergence among economies. admittedly, sector gain process; also loser practically country involved. nevertheless, benefit liberalisation exceed costs. the call return raise voice therefore seem inappropriate. on look ahead, path success liberalisation process depend effect inequality gap within countries, effect increase volatility financial markets, deal with. securities: demand supply integrate capital market operate primarily basis supply of, demand for, securities. this always case. bank deposit loan use play much significant role. yet deregulation rise institutional investors, security become central tool capital allocation. the unite states’ strong net import capital illustrate fact. let’s look figure take imf report3. the net foreign purchase u long-term security almost double 1995 2000, rise usd 232 billion usd 456 billion. take close look reveal interest facts. during period, net foreign purchase corporate bond stock increase 3 15 times, reach usd 182 175 billion respectively. the net foreign purchase corporate security amount 30% entire net purchase u long-term security 1995. in 2000, account 80%. during five-year period, net foreign purchase agency bond increase 5 times, net foreign purchase u government bond shrink massively due strong supply reduction well investors’ move towards higher-yielding financial assets. one major consequence demand security issue corporate sector increase impressively last years. this strong demand reflect diversification need enhance capacity investor apply sophisticate portfolio management strategies. in addition, clear trend towards collateralisation financial claim risk mitigation technique. indeed, collateral widely use today underlie derivative market financial assets, include gold. collateralised transaction also gain momentum payment system 2 world bank (2001): “trends private capital flows” (table 2.3), global development finance, chapter 2. 3 d. mathieson g. schinasi (2001): “international capital markets:

first, rely increasingly repo transaction implement monetary policy. like many peers, swiss national bank, traditionally operate exclusively basis foreign exchange swaps, steer liquidity supply primarily repo transactions. second, central bank typically grant intraday credits, relevant smooth settlement payment systems, collateral. intraday repos available swiss national bank since 1999, demand zero interest. the trend toward collateralisation create additional business opportunity provider financial market infrastructure, also increase systemic relevance. indeed, since linkage among cash, securities, derivative market become close, failure - either provider major participant - likely cause disturbance affect different market time. in addition collateralisation, appetite security forcefully stimulate change need private public wealth owners: ongoing institutionalisation save process, facilitation direct market access internet technology, disintermediation bank system due credit risk consideration relative decline attractiveness bank deposits. on supply side, corporate sector increasingly rely bond finance rather traditional bank borrowing. in us, private debt security amount usd 7 trillion. the ratio bank credit gdp remain le stable around 10% last 50 years, ratio bond finance gdp rise sharply 15% 1985 25% 2000. bond finance within european corporate sector also catch up, strongly support inception euro begin 1999. in short, supply security bind grow further; cyclical up down likely, trend point upwards. notwithstanding obvious difference economies, generally true corporate sector make progress exploit potential advantage offer open capital markets. the european corporate bond market seem especially interest case. since inception euro, stag impressive take-off, even though institutional, legal account environment still far optimal. central banker good reason welcome developments. not probably make saving-investment process efficient, also allow good distribution credit market risk - anything - enhance stability robustness financial systems. 4 bi review 37/2002 financial process market continue become internationalise obvious impact security operations, liquidity collateral management procedures. what kind challenge create market infrastructure one hand, oversight authority hand? let address two question following. implication financial market infrastructure a first requirement financial market infrastructure must capable cop increase cross-border security operations, also time-critical nature. therefore, particular effort make ensure intraday finality, shorten settlement cycles, coordinate operate hour among individual system standardize communication procedure well message formats. a know good i, easy say done, since still rely heavily technology system tailor domestic need peculiarities. the current coexistence several non-interoperable platform imply extensive amount costly manual intervention. a second requirement - link first one - relate objective reduce clear settlement costs, especially cost cross-border security operations. a discuss giovannini report4 mandate eu, domestic clear settlement arrangement within member country seem reach level cost efficiency, - large - comparable dtcc (depository trust & clear corporation) u achieved. by contrast, whole cross-border domain far cost-efficient, mainly due fragmentation term market infrastructure practices, well differ legal, tax account frameworks. the obvious question is, therefore, realise efficiency gain cross-border context. one way - probably appeal one - consolidate market infrastructures. within european union, currently 20 central security depositories. although consolidation seem unavoidable, le clear achieve model best suit integrate financial markets. should priority give vertical horizontal integration? on one hand, vertical integration present advantages. since trading, clear settlement occur within organisation, reduce legal operational risks. on hand, vertical integration may entail cross-subsidies, disguise effective cost trading, clear settlement. in addition, model may also tend rely rents, impossible user switch providers. horizontal integration, however, allow user select interlink providers, expose ongoing competition. yet feasibility model depend whether cost-efficient way user route transaction prefer provider. in case, emergence pole around euronext deutsche börse show consolidation process begun. from swiss perspective, swx si engage race - really hunters, give relative size, partner prove technology know-how. financial market infrastructure also subject high competitive pressures. the drive force behind pressure are, without doubt, technological innovation expect profit result achievement economy scale and, possibly, economy scope. three kind competitor distinguished. first, competition among exchanges, clear settlement organisation within across country increased. indeed, trading, clear settlement, physical location become le le relevant. a confront pressure daily business, certainly know good central banker i refer to. second, non-financial institution may provide trading, clear settlement service financial markets. more precisely, i think alternative trade systems, also outsource partner payment security process centres. third, maybe le visible, grow significance, competitive pressure exert large custodians, especially global custodians. indeed, global custodian rely worldwide network sub-custodians offer easy access markets, also develop in-house clear settlement procedure competitive costs. without doubt, financial market infrastructure face great challenge term high technical requirements, necessity achieve efficiency gains, high competitive stakes. i believe market force - rather political pressure - drive consolidation process. the 4 the giovannini group (2001): cross-border clear settlement arrangement european union, brussels. bi review 37/2002 5 many change take place also challenge oversight authorities. it task analyse systemic implication go particularly cross-border level, make sure change enhance, endanger, soundness financial system. let address issue conclude part. implication oversight authority i begin quote alexandre lamfalussy, chairman committee wise men, which, year ago, publish famous report security regulation within eu5. lamfalussy clear assert “the current [securities] regulatory system working”6. indeed, unclear sometimes even contradictory regulation inconsistent implementation regulation among country impair creation single capital market within european union. start premise, i would like specify kind challenge oversight authority face share idea role institution like swiss national bank be. but first all, i would like clarify fundamental point. some people claim oversight authorities’ objective promote stability financial system hide undue interventionist activism. well, claim beside mark. let quote andrew crockett, bi general manager chairman financial stability forum7: “[…] systemic stability critically determine collective behaviour individual market players. […]. and supervisor need analyse interaction individual incentive systemic outcomes.” in words, systemic stability depend negative externalities, price internalise market, deal with. thus, waste time discuss whether regulatory intervention necessary not, rather oversight authorities, focus systemic risk, shape process. keep mind, challenge oversight authority face numerous well-known. the giovannini group list le 15 barrier efficient cross-border settlement procedure within european union. these barrier categorise accord technical nature, fiscal implication legal aspects. a remarkable feature report distinction market force achieve regulatory authority do. in particular, several issue cannot tackle private sector, e.g. harmonisation legal, regulatory, taxation account frameworks. a first challenge need global oversight. this need arise several factors. in term so-called horizontal approach, trading, clear settlement security operation already occur different institution locate several different jurisdictions; virt-x sis-clear two examples. for time being, cross-border infrastructure deploy activity complement domestic systems, likely play significantly powerful role future. oversight authority tend prefer pragmatic approach, one regulatory authority take role lead overseer consult relevant authorities. such model already put place among central banker context continuous link settlement system. a second challenge oversight authority face lie risk dimension cross-border security operations. indeed, whereas nature risk remain basically same, probability occurrence adverse event risk exposure clearly increased. the add dimension cross-border activity lie spill-over effect due direct link systems. credit, liquidity operational risk event occur one jurisdiction may indeed trigger systemic crisis spill foreign financial markets. these kind linkage among different system explain oversight authority recently focus payment systems, also security clear settlement systems. a problem potentially relevant systemic term availability intraday liquidity foreign currencies, typically restricted, non-existent. this restriction hamper liquidity management integrate multi-currency environment. nowadays, much urgent need market participant make time-critical payment previously. moreover, must 5 the committee wise men (2001): final report committee wise men regulation european security markets, brussels. 6 a. lamfalussy (2001): “reflections regulation european security markets”, société universitaire européenne de recherches financières, suerf study n° 14, vienna. 7 a. crockett (2002): introductory speech third joint central bank research conference risk measurement systemic risk, basel. 6 bi review 37/2002 able react simultaneously several currency even trouble circumstances. their liquidity management could facilitate strengthen significantly able obtain short-term liquidity require currency cross-border collateral pool. such collateral pool would boost ability large market participant react, thereby reduce system’s vulnerability disturbances. in addition, would result efficiency gains, maintain pool collateral portfolio would certainly le costly keep several currency-specific portfolios. in view manifold legal technical obstacles, one tempt deem collateral pool vision. however, vision come true: take cls, continue link settlement system, go operation near future. central bank private sector must direct joint effort research feasibility collateral pool, payment risk committee new york8. a third challenge relate in-house clear settlement mechanism global custodians. this commercial function undergo remarkable process concentration last years. some service provider become significant stability system see september 11 last year. independent specific event question arise whether regulatory control keep development everywhere. from organisational point view, problematic custody activity lie grey area bank supervision system oversight. in country - switzerland - task derive bank supervision system oversight perform separate authorities, regulatory framework risk incomplete least suboptimal unless two authority succeed establish strong cooperation link. this aspect seem important global custodian tend become direct competitor traditional financial market infrastructures. in view challenges, good reason critically reassess rule regulation relate security clear settlement well way oversight responsibility implement practice. a predominantly national approach serve market need longer. and essentially sectoral solution, payment system regulator security regulator cooperate integrate way, inappropriate. indeed, official private sector initiative give impetus debate highly welcome. the cpss-iosco recommendation security settlement systems, issa recommendation 2000, group thirty’s ongoing work contribute improve understand challenge face. and issue really understand appropriate response formulate implemented. in switzerland, several countries, supervision security clear settlement system still work progress. a draft revise national bank law submit discuss parliament near future. the revise law presumably enter force around 2004. it intend explicitly vest responsibility oversee payment system well security clear settlement system swiss national bank. the revise law thus formally express efficient secure financial market infrastructure imperative implementation monetary policy stability financial system. the inclusion clear settlement system follow obvious fact that, give linkages, infrastructural function considerable systemic importance. this true since snb has, year now, implement monetary policy exclusively repo transactions. the snb fulfil expand mandate closely cooperate authorities. domestically, snb work hand hand federal bank commission (fbc). the snb focus systemic issues, fbc - bank supervisor - deal institutional aspects. this job-sharing base premise authority able make use comparative advantage. internationally, market development foster cross-border cooperation oversight authorities. for instance, institution sega intersettle (sis) “the settlement network” heavily involve current reshape europe’s financial market infrastructure. however, legal reform yet place, many open question exactly modus vivendi oversight function look like. we address step step pragmatic way. many issue set-up mechanism information sharing, need on-site examinations, disclosure oversight proceed still discuss clarified. we process define basic principle implementation tool pertain new oversight responsibilities. 8 the payment risk committee establish feed new york 1993 mean integrate input lead u commercial bank discuss implement recommendation improve quality risk management payment security settlement systems. bi review 37/2002 7 conclusion i would like conclude speech fundamental remark. in field financial market infrastructure, alternative close cooperation private market player oversight authorities. on one hand, make sense field well rely market force stimulate, energetically possible, eagerness progress innovation. on hand, take consideration economic force work area limit free play market force require oversight authority take active role. first, clearing, settlement payment system entail network characteristic potentially negative externality internalise individually optimise market players. it thus aim oversight authority take account financial infrastructure whole, thereby focus link components. in terms, system “too interlink fail” must therefore oversee special care. second, since clearing, settlement payment service base production process high fix costs, risk consolidation may lead monopolistic market result. oversight authority must therefore also make goal prevent potential abuse market power. against background, trust-based cooperation financial service provider oversight authority remain key continue successful development efficient secure financial market infrastructure meet fast-changing need future. bi review 36/2002 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, frankfurt, 6 june 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, mr. papademos, new vice-president ecb, i report outcome today’s meet govern council ecb. the govern council undertake comprehensive examination monetary, financial economic development consider evidence become available since last meet 2 may 2002. notwithstanding recent decline inflation, outlook price stability medium term remain le satisfactory expect month ago. however, economic outlook still subject uncertainty. further evidence need fully ass upward risk price stability medium term. against background, govern council decide leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. start analysis first pillar monetary policy strategy, three-month average annual growth rate m3 decrease 7.4% period february april 2002, 7.6% period january march 2002. while high annual growth rate m3 still partly reflect portfolio shift liquid position occur last autumn, normalisation development m3 early 2002, trend towards moderation recently interrupted. in addition, annual rate growth loan private sector stabilise recent months. a regard second pillar, expectation gradual recovery real gdp growth euro area confirm eurostat’s recently publish first estimate real gdp growth. these preliminary estimate show improvement quarter-on-quarter growth rate –0.3% last quarter 2001 moderately positive rate first quarter year. moreover, business consumer confidence strengthen recently, reflect data publish commission. look ahead, available forecast point continue strengthen domestic foreign demand, relate favourable external environment, sound domestic fundamental absence major imbalance within euro area. overall, suggest real gdp growth euro area line potential growth late year, increase expect 2003. despite rather positive outlook, assessment short-term dynamic real activity still surround uncertainty. moreover, future oil price development economic imbalance elsewhere world economy remain element risk. turn price developments, eurostat’s early estimate indicate annual hicp inflation fell 2.4% april 2.0% may. however, decline mainly due base effect relate spike hicp inflation may 2001. moreover, first month year hicp inflation exclude volatile item energy unprocessed food price remain stubbornly high, reflect particular trend service prices. while decline annual inflation rate possible short run, medium-term outlook remain le satisfactory expect month ago. over recent week exchange rate euro appreciated. this contribute contain inflationary pressures, still early ass impact exchange rate development outlook prices. a state number occasions, le satisfactory picture short term due partly sequence adverse rather specific shock prices, include recent oil price increases. in principle, shock unwind time therefore affect medium-term perspective price stability long past upward tendency price become entrenched. the outcome recent wage negotiation region euro area cause concern, especially view negative impact could continue employment creation. high wage increase must spread across euro area give inflationary pressure, would unfavourable consequence competitiveness, employment growth consumption, avoided. at juncture therefore particularly important monetary policy remain vigilant regard evolution key factor determine outlook prices. 2 bi review 36/2002 regard fiscal policy euro area, vital member state maintain medium-term perspective compliance framework

absorb fiscal cost population ageing. this reform agenda, well urgent structural reform relate product, labour financial markets, address forthcoming broad economic policy guidelines. overall, reform reflect key challenge euro area expand potential non-inflationary growth reduce high level unemployment. the govern council call upon member state make fast progress accelerate deepen structural reform order provide economic agent proper incentive enhance efficiency entrepreneurship progress towards knowledge-based economy proclaim lisbon agenda confirm barcelona. we disposal questions. susan s bies: lesson re-learned recent breakdown corporate account remark m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, institute international bankers, new york, 10 june 2002. * * * good afternoon. thank invitation speak today member institute international bankers. my remark traditional “what learn from...” format, rather realistic re-learn enron recent, well-publicized breakdown accounting, auditing, corporate governance. a regulator deal type issues, i find i draw experience bank financial management accounting. i also want continue meet group like i stay aware current issue face bank managers. i go touch three broad area address issue arise recent breakdown corporate accounting: current state account audit unite states, role banker play user financial information, good corporate governance practice banker apply within organizations. let clear premise. the root cause breakdown corporate financial report widely disclose past month ineffective corporate governance, financial reporting, risk management practices. the lesson re-learn recent event news anyone. rather, recent event serve wake call corporate boards, management, auditor follow fundamental traditional professional ethical standard conduct control processes. the issue new, scope frequency breakdown concern. a news report congressional testimony various aspect breakdown occur, corporation auditor address issue raise compromise reputation organizations. account practice complex organization first, let address state account audit practices. merger business innovation increase scale scope large organizations. further, significant development financial theory technology lead development financial instrument facilitate separation reallocation risk party will able bear them. a byproduct development become ever difficult outsider understand financial position complex organizations. the current framework financial report unite state effectively represent performance corporation time. indeed high quality account standard country one critical reason capital market efficient. but lesson past month remind u account rule bent. for six year i member emerge issue task force financial account standard board. this rulemaking body deal divergence practice. the eitf’s role provide timely financial report guidance divergence practice developing. in time i serve eitf i come understand professional could disagree best account standard apply new type transaction. that heart struggle keep account standard current. the rapid pace innovation i mention make impractical rule place anticipate every business transaction. rather, complex dynamic world business becomes, important account base strong principle sufficiently robust provide framework proper account new type transactions. in course work, financial officer auditor face conflict need client, management board corporation engage them, professional ethical standard outside parties--investors, customers, creditors--expect them. while auditor engage board directors, user auditors’ opinion third parties. if outsider need independent assessment standardize financial information, company could design account system way desire support business objectives. but effective function u.s. capital market require basic information financial condition performance organization prepare present consistent way outsider use information compare different companies. thus, need insist high professional standard permit financial officer auditor benefit “gaming” rules-based account standard increase complexity, particularly unite states. the core basic account principle professional standard follow every corporate accountant every outside auditor would insist answer “yes” questions: “does account method select faithfully represent economics transaction? doe recognition, measurement disclosure provide user financial report sufficient information discern nature significant transaction risk organization?” but rule alone guarantee good financial reporting. for enron recent examples, weak corporate governance practice apparently permit sham transaction mislead financial report occur. outside auditor err try much please pay client. they forget professional role provide assurance user financial report quality financial report meet expectation marketplace. some observer assert new account standard needed. i know specific many irregularity recently come light. but judge publicly available information, i believe need restore integrity corporate accountant quality audit process rather extensive new account standards. one reason account unite state become rule-based tend add new account standard abuse occur even abuse result account audit failures. an example banker relate fa 115--accounting investment securities. when standard developed, perceive abuse handful bank sell security investment portfolio take gain income, leave underwater security portfolio. such “cherry picking” abuse even old standards, say investment portfolio use trade accounts. discipline offend bank outside auditor would provide warn organizations. problem cannot solve without address root causes. at time new rule create work. it may appear problem solve “something” done. but unless root cause addressed, problem recur cost private sector additional regulatory burden. and let remind one root cause recent event outside auditor fail serve board director interest third parties. discipline auditor occur account standard manipulated. the present industry-driven process clearly work new oversight process need ensure audit quality. achieve sound account disclosure practice complex bank organization corporate board account officer need shoulder responsibility too. banker unique perspective this. banker heavy user financial report information, whether make business loan, underwrite debt issue, manage asset trust account. thus, banker consider perspective preparer user support alternative account disclosure. bank become complex organization themselves. investor find hard understand quality financial performance risk exposure banks. thus, banker lead development transparent financial report disclosures. generally accept account standard tend focus point-in-time information. the movement fair-value account mislead user information gain loss realized. these point-in-time snapshot fail convey information reader financial statement help understand quality earnings. the surprise typically occur bank due nature risk exposure quality risk management practices, include use off-balance sheet vehicles. to keep board director investor aware unseen risks, banker turn internal control report systems. bank take lead role evolution risk management, discipline provide framework good disclosure. in addition apply sound account treatments, manager must ensure public disclosure clearly identify significant risk exposures--whether balance sheet--and effect firm’s financial condition performance, cash flow earn potential, capital adequacy. equally important disclosure risk manage underlie basis value estimate include financial reports. a sound risk management system continually monitor risk change business climate--including credit, market, liquidity, operational risks. disclosure consistent information use internally risk manager could useful market participants, would information sensitivity change underlie assumptions. company meet letter standard exist; sure financial report disclosure focus really essential help investor market participant understand business risk profiles. i particularly want emphasize disclosure need standard account framework exactly all--otherwise would certain create statistical artifact implication safe harbors. rather, insist entity disclose belief stakeholder need evaluate risk profile. the uniqueness risk business line complex organization mean disclosures--to effective--should different bank. that approach take develop basel ii capital accord. disclosure rule build rigidly risk management process continue evolve may make le effective describe risk profile specific organization. but banker voluntarily improve disclosures, rule written. financial institution continue improve risk management reporting. when comfortable reliability consistency information reports, begin disclose information market, perhaps summary form. not would disclosure provide qualitative quantitative information market, also result discussion risk management practice would help market ass quality risk oversight risk appetite organization. bank also consider way communicate information financial health customers. banker know reputation place risk lead significant loss business even liquidity runs. while customer continue shop k-mart despite bankruptcy, bank customer leave hint impropriety loss occurs. at time, bank customer interpret financial report corporations, especially bank complex operations. this dichotomy face always look disclosures. information overload overwhelm reader financial reports. a form corporate communication, banker may want tailor various disclosure different audiences. bank supervision account disclosure the federal reserve long support sound account policy meaningful public disclosure bank financial organization objective improve market discipline foster stable financial markets. the concept market discipline assume great importance among international bank supervisor well. the january 2001 proposal amend augment basel capital accord, call basel ii, seek strengthen market’s ability aid bank supervisor evaluate capital adequacy. the proposal consist three pillars, tools: risk-based capital (pillar i), risk-based supervision (pillar ii), disclosure risk capital adequacy enhance market discipline (pillar iii). this approach capital regulation, market-discipline component, signal sound account disclosure continue important aspect supervisory approach many year come. the goal basel process develop risk-sensitive framework provide appropriate incentive bank organization maintain strong capital position sound risk management systems. the history 1990s, include episode global financial instability spread small country international capital market banks, underscore need maintain adequate capital internationally active banks. basel ii would also improve risk disclosure many bank worldwide. the proposal recommend specific disclosure good convey institution’s capital adequacy risk profile. the incentive basel ii greatly diminish opacity cloak many international financial institution help bring convergence international norm bank disclosure. i believe counterparties expect, indeed force, great disclosure. but basel ii effective end 2006. recent history certainly teach u understand drive counterparty’s financial performance risk appetite necessary accurately price transaction even decide whether engage transaction. improve organization’s disclosure every financial report--and begin now. corporate governance a bankers, director specific responsibility manage risk effectively oversee system internal controls. not activity bank central credit intermediation, country bank fund activity part federally insure deposits. these deposit low cost source fund banker government’s guarantee. bank director expect understand every nuance bank oversee transaction. they look management that. they do, however, responsibility set tone regard institutions’ risk-taking implement sufficient control reasonably expect directive followed. they also responsibility hire individual believe integrity exercise high level judgment competence. all bank agency issue guidance describe proper role bank officer director regard policies, procedures, information systems, controls. for example, bank agency hold board director responsible ensure organization effective audit process internal control adequate nature scope

governor norge bank (central bank norway), sparebanken møre, ålesund, 4 june 2002. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * norway unique fully develop economy major oil exporter. last year, norway world’s third large exporter oil. in future, become increasingly important exporter natural gas. the present value remain petroleum reserve estimate nok 2 200bn, roughly 1½ time current gdp. the bulk norway’s petroleum wealth extract period 40 years, 1990 2030. new technology significant impact future production potential. in spite rapid production growth, estimate present value petroleum wealth increase 35-40 per cent last ten years, measure real terms. a example, register oil reserve ekofisk field large today field start production 30 year ago. revenue petroleum sector generate fiscal surplus 10-15 per cent since 2000. a similar surplus generate current account, reflect capital outflow government petroleum fund. even 1998, oil price fell 10 usd/barrel, norway fiscal surplus 4 per cent gdp. the existence abundant natural resource mix blessing. experience elsewhere suggest sudden occurrence major income flow tend undermine future production potential. in long term, difficult ensure efficient distribution wealth within generation without trigger rent-seeking behaviour among household firms. in short term, volatility income flow term trade pose challenge monetary fiscal policy. the mix bless national wealth new problem. vigilant observer already aware 17th century. in modern economic language, moroccan ambassador spain point problem deteriorate competitiveness 300 year ago (see chart 2). the main long-term challenge economic policy return petroleum wealth phase economy without deterioration future growth potential. even substantial petroleum reserves, human capital far important resource. it account 80 per cent norway’s national wealth (present value future labour). income oil gas transfer financial asset government budget. these transfer large term gdp, still minor compare human capital. oil gas reserve account 7 percent national wealth today, whereas 2030 reserve reduce 1-2 per cent. to meet challenges, norwegian government petroleum fund establish 22 june 1990. it main objective manage asset distribute wealth generations. it also serf buff shocks: change petroleum revenue absorb fund, domestic economy. this reduce need structural adjustment thus promote exchange rate stability. the fund invest foreign markets. investment spread equity fix income instruments, well across countries. the net annual inflow fund equal net fiscal surplus plus return fund’s capital. in march 2001, broad majority norwegian parliament (the storting) adopt new set guideline fiscal monetary policy. accord new guideline fiscal policy, petroleum revenue phase approximately pace expect real return government petroleum fund. the guideline make fiscal policy predictable anchor long-term strategy. it also make policy robust change oil price ensure petroleum wealth benefit today future. the guideline imply structural non-oil budget deficit equal 4 per cent total value fund. the non-oil deficit thus finance return fund, ensure long-term fiscal balance continue phase petroleum revenues. the use petroleum revenue accordingly increase long petroleum fund expanding. fiscal policy contribute stimulate aggregate demand norwegian economy every year. this annual expansionary fiscal impact pose challenge stabilisation policy general monetary policy particular. underlie real expenditure growth exceed mainland gdp last 4 years. nominal growth 2002 7 per cent. (the deflator, mainly wages, 4½ per cent). measure share gdp, public expenditure grow rapidly. in 2002 alone, share increase 2½ percentage points. accord revise national budget, increase expenditure 7 per cent year lead estimate growth public sector consumption 1½ per cent. the rest spend government transfer wage growth. this consistent close adherence new fiscal guidelines. the new guideline fiscal monetary policy introduce simultaneously, independent other. fiscal policy gear towards phase oil revenues; monetary policy give explicit responsibility macroeconomic stabilisation. monetary policy orient towards low stable inflation. the inflation target set 2½ per cent. monetary policy affect economy considerable variable lags. the key rate set basis overall assessment inflation outlook two year ahead. if appear inflation high 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate increased. if appear inflation low 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate reduced. it important avoid inflation rate low avoid inflation rate high. up march 2001, bank pursue exchange rate stability european currencies. implicitly, mean inflation norway keep target euro area. from 1999 onwards, ecb’s target define inflation rate 2 per cent. since introduction inflation target, underlie inflation rate around 2½ per cent. the rate increase headline cpi show somewhat wide variations, average 2¼ per cent 1990s. the use oil revenue must counteract tight monetary policy. a tight monetary policy imply relatively high interest rates, strong krone, both. a fiscal policy create demand resource public service shelter sectors, industry expose foreign competition may face difficulty find labour high labour costs. the contest resource likely lead real appreciation krone deterioration competitiveness expose sectors. the krone exchange rate appreciate result wide interest rate differential norway countries. combine low growth abroad increase trade low-cost country china, lead fall import prices. the relatively high price increase norwegian product reflect high wage growth tight labour market. the krone exchange rate, measure trade-weighted index, appreciate around 13 per cent last two years. however, krone exceptionally weak mid-2000. the krone 4-5 per cent strong today early 1990s, strong previous high early 1997. thus, recent strong show krone without precedent. change oil price time important factor behind exchange rate movements. empirical evidence show exchange rate affect mainly large fluctuation oil price. the krone tend depreciate oil price low, happen russian crisis 1998. on hand, krone appreciate accordingly oil price surge 1999 onwards. hence, relationship oil price exchange rate evident last two years. since late 2001, however, currency may use hedge upside risk oil price, may contribute appreciation. another factor behind appreciation krone current low risk premium global currency market (measured global risk index, gri). since begin year, low risk premium accompany strong krone. development gri also important factor russian crisis 1998-1999. when global risk premium interest rate low, investor may turn higher-yield currencies. there also tendency peripheral currency attract increase attention volatility major global currency subdue risk premium low. the interest rate differential important explanation movement krone exchange rate, least since summer 1999. a high interest rate differential accompany strong krone. the krone appreciate significantly since begin year, however, apparently somewhat explain interest rate differential alone. one explanation may market participant react sign pressure economy adjust interest rate expectation long term. this impact longer-term interest rates. thus, movement exchange rate may result change forward rates, well current interest rates. since early january, 12-month money market differential appear follow krone exchange rate closely 3-month differential. the pressure internal resource seem result expectation tight monetary conditions, contribute recent appreciation krone. the nominal appreciation krone accompany significant real appreciation norwegian labour. measure local labour costs, cost competitiveness deteriorate since 1997. for time, profit expose sector affect increase labour costs, krone depreciated. however, depreciation could last, would ignite domestic inflationary pressures. tight labour market condition warrant relatively tight monetary policy. norwegian interest rate high, however, wage growth compare countries. on contrary, recent appreciation krone cushion effect inflation thus interest rates. since 1998, increase labour cost 5 7 per cent. this year’s wage negotiation exception. it seem evident wage growth significantly high previous estimate 5 per cent year. the carry-over next year also substantial, especially retail trade public sector. it evident year’s wage negotiation labour market tight. norge bank keep interest rate unchanged executive board meet wednesday, 22 may. the bank change stance future inflation risks. the main reason higher-than-projected wage increases. accord bank’s assessment risk associate inflation outlook, appreciation krone cannot fully counteract strong wage growth, fast growth consumption, high oil price somewhat favourable global economic outlook. bi review 35/2002 1 jaime caruana: asset price bubble - implication monetary, regulatory international policy speech mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain, federal reserve bank chicago, chicago, 24 april 2002. * * * one central topic debate among economist traditionally reason economic cycles, factor may amplify smooth them, whether authority aim iron and, so, done. more recently, role financial sector dynamic economic cycle emerge key question debate. i would like focus today problem pose regulator policy-makers asset price bubble credit cycle, share think regulatory device recently introduce spain deal problems: so-called forward-looking provisioning, also refer dynamic statistical provision. the pro-cyclical behaviour bank sector, generally accept literature, receive increase attention academics, policymakers market participants. there grow feel financial sector contribute swing real activity may even intensify accelerate them. feedback effect credit growth rise asset price increasingly evident, although yet well understood. transmission channel financial sector real sector become flexible, rapid complex. this particularly clear industrial countries, whose financial market sophisticated, also affect emerge markets, logical consequence rapid integration global financial markets. i focus issue first part speech, particular whether recent behaviour financial market exacerbate volatility cyclicality real economy. insofar case, next question regulator ask whether might result increase weight financial sector economy spontaneous financial market developments, new risk management technique market participant and/or by-product prudential regulation might unintendedly amplify financial cycles. this debate gain momentum recently context discussion new basel capital accord. one issue identify discussion precisely extent factor old new regulation favour excessive pro-cyclicality. but overemphasise point. it true certain degree cyclicality risk management technique regulation unavoidable also sensible. we regulator ask bank risk-sensitive risk-sensitive usually mean pro-cyclical behaviour. the second part address deal forward-looking provision system recently adopt spain. the merit regulation introduce incentive good risk management banks, time attenuate cyclicality financial sector and, thereby, swing real economy. in conclude remark i try summarise main lesson learn discussing, design implement new system, emphasis broad economic view rather purely supervisory one. let bring forward main conclusion: regulatory mechanisms, like dynamic provisioning, provide incentive sound risk management anti-cyclical nature therefore moderate cyclical swings. * * * * * recent experience number country show credit expansion asset price increase - bubble - mutually reinforce process (see graph 1). asset price may start rise economy new investment opportunity appear simply overly lax financial conditions. when asset price rise value collateral, make finance easier, increase demand assets. that turn push asset price upward. in downturn, value collateral drops, finance possibility decline, thus credit growth, process often reinforce financial institution pursue much cautious credit policy incur loss make small profit phase cycle. tight credit policy reinforce recessionary force provoke additional reduction asset prices. 2 bi review 35/2002 this sequence affect different category asset (commercial property, residential property, equity), whose impact real economy transmission channel differ. commercial property seem particularly link business cycle, residential property large impact consumption. equity price intertwine business profit investment also relate spend wealth effects, depend role equity play determination financial wealth. this interaction credit cycle asset price bubble pose number challenge authority regulators, monetary policy financial stability domains. in upswing, inflationary pressure relate excessive credit growth compound financial imbalance result unwarranted optimism part corporation household excessive risk-taking part financial institutions. in downturn, recessionary deflationary force aggravate credit contraction result excessive risk aversion lenders. the possible explanatory factor potential amplification cycle financial sector many-faceted complex. first, heighten competition bank sector financial market lead upturn risky strategy correct rise bad debt become evident downturn. second, seem tendency economic agent overreact change environment, lead over-optimism time plenty over-pessimism bad times. third, herd usually reinforce exist trend cause overshooting. fourth, use common assessment risk management tool market participants, finally excessive shortsighted focus “shareholder value” may also amplify swings. prudential regulation may also occasionally prove conducive excessive emphasis short term assess risks. what authority counter tendencies? debate among academics, policymakers market participant intense recent years, far settled. this area particularly open discussion, new idea new evidence forthcoming. indeed, way monetary stability financial stability interact seem particularly complex topic, impact specific measure field uncertain. a far monetary policy concerned, debate whether react asset price one interest recent years. insofar asset price contain useful information help predict future price -and output- developments, clearly include set indicator central bank us decision-making. this not, however, easy may sound. first, empirical evidence usefulness asset price predict future price output development conclusive. and second, integration asset price macroeconomic model pose series practical difficulties. bi review 35/2002 3 go one step further, relate question whether monetary policy react directly asset prices, impact latter inflationary prospects. the argument would deflate asset price bubble early stage contribute “per se” long-term financial monetary stability. against view, i tend share position argue asset price bubble difficult identify practice and, even assume correctly recognised, lot uncertainty asset market would react policy changes. furthermore, strategy may prove difficult communicate public. a concern financial policy, regulators’ task ensure long-term soundness financial system entail create right incentive market participant react excess give cyclical position avoid excessive misalignments. to end essential, first, encourage good knowledge risk assumed, long-term orientation analysis and, consequently, prudent management within financial institutions. second, great heterogeneity among financial market player avoid mimetic behaviour seem desirable, although something market would normally develop themselves. third, great transparency disclosure authority private institution would help market participant focus fundamentals. fourth, good understand evaluation liquidity pattern financial market call for, part market participant supervisors. finally, regulatory authority obviously introduce rule promote short-term strategies. let focus relationship bank credit, loan loss provision loan losses. there ample international evidence cyclical pattern credit, strongly correlate gdp growth, show graph 2 case spain (with elasticity high one, mean real product grows, credit tend grow more, real product falls, credit likewise tend fall even more). demand supply effect difficult disentangle credit cyclical dynamics. on one hand, economic activity tend cause credit demand. at time, credit ration tend diminish economy boom tighten economy recession. both demand supply seem account therefore credit cyclical swings. competition key factor explain credit supply dynamics. strong competitive pressure may exacerbate trend towards loose credit condition upturn, fight market share coincide observation low non-performing loans, lead towards over-optimistic perception low risk. the probability loss exist moment loan granted, become apparent ex-post, emergence default problems. most credit risk mistake actually make 4 bi review 35/2002 expansionary phase, optimism prevailing, although downturn become evident. empirical estimate show strong correlation credit growth bad loans, average lag around three year (see upper part graph 3). this mean credit expansion process likely lead credit quality problem roughly time horizon. the average duration economic cycle (from boom bust) similar. this imply bank look contemporary bad loan determine credit risk policies, restrain credit increase risk premia downturn. the high cost fund bank-dependent borrower fee back activity, reinforce recessionary forces. i turn provisions. in spain, year 2000, loan loss provision strongly pro-cyclical (as many countries), largely link volume contemporaneous problem assets. this static provision backward-looking, base past events. only account loan loan borrower fail repay case situation borrower deteriorate significantly. a consequence, ratio provision total loan fell therefore period economic growth tend rise considerably downturn (see low part graph 3). a result this, latent risk loan portfolio properly recognise profit loss account old system. in period economic expansion fall doubtful loan go hand hand decrease provisions, turn allow bank manager improve bottom-line profits. however, one argue something wrong level profit show latent credit risk loan portfolio properly take account. intrinsically every loan expect (or potential) loss recognise cost mean early provision. otherwise, picture true profitability solvency bank time could distorted. more dangerously, overvaluation profit might lead increase dividend could undermine solvency bank. therefore, acknowledgement latent loss prudent valuation principle (similar mathematical reserve set aside insurance companies) contribute correct cyclical bias currently exist profit loss account. the management credit risk bank sector perhaps something learn insurance practices. theoretical paper bank credit risk management also go direction, stress importance proper price (i.e. interest rate charge cover expect loss well cost hold capital unexpected losses). estimate expect loss bank ass borrower first step sound risk management. proper risk management obviously primary task bank manager shareholders. but we, bank supervisors, evaluate effectiveness bank’s policy practice assessment loan quality provision practices. the ability bank’s loan review system identify, classify, monitor address loan credit quality problem timely manner bi review 35/2002 5 assess supervisor regular basis part risk-based approach. a misclassification asset (and correspond under-provisioning) always present bank head profitability solvency difficulties. sound credit risk management practice banks’ level, include acknowledgement expect loss due time, collide certain extent current account framework. the problem stem fact framework support notion provision basis expect losses, result recognition loss frequently delayed. some answer give accounting-rules setter problem (i.e. full fair value accounting) may important drawbacks. i touch upon later. let briefly summarise content dynamic provision. in december 1999, bank spain introduce new solvency provision, so-called statistical dynamic provision, focus statistical risk embed unimpaired portfolio. it start apply july 2000. the main idea behind provision try capture, together provision spanish system, expect losses. from moment loan granted, impairment specific loan appears, positive default probability (no matter low might be) follow statistical distribution expect loss. the expect loss know statistical sense yet identify specific loan operation borrower. a risk appear begin operation, statistical provision requirement. with system, provision run parallel revenue therefore distribute cycle allow good map income cost profit loss account. the statistical provision establish work practice addition “old” exist provisions: “old” provision well expect losses, “new” dynamic provision added. in good year net “specific” provision low (or even negative, substantial recoveries), new provision accumulates. but bad year “specific” provision increase sharply, eventually exceed gross burden statistical provision. the net result system provision distribute cycle, provide good recognition expect losses. more specifically, amount statistical provision difference measure latent risk (i.e. expect losses) specific provision (that cover impair assets). in good time specific provision low statistical provision positive. however, slowdown, impair asset rise, specific provision requirement increase statistical provision become negative. this mean statistical fund (accumulated previous years) start used, proceed (the difference latent risk specific provision) credit profit loss account. therefore, thank mechanism statistical provision, burden credit risk profit bank institution good spread cycle accordance evolution expect losses. the new scheme offer bank two options. first, use internal measurement statistical credit risk second, use standard method. the bank spain expect future increase number institution able show robust computations, framework integrate credit risk management system. however, probably next year two, bank use standard method. in standard system supervisor set parameters. the portfolio distribute six blocks, accord relative riskiness different assets, off-balance sheet item credit risk. a vector coefficient (ranging 0 1.5%) apply exposure contain six blocks. the result figure estimate expect loss bank portfolio. the computation produce aggregate annual gross burden (i.e. expect loss) that, relative terms, equal average annual net insolvency burden bear spanish bank system last fourteen years. this time span cover full economic cycle. you might note internal approach calculate expect loss latent risk square perfectly basel ii developments. the new provision start vector coefficient result burden low average. this take account improvement risk management since last cyclical peak (93/94), facilitate acceptability scheme among institutions. probably scheme adjust come years, basis experience gain application. 6 bi review 35/2002 a limit three time annual gross burden put accumulate statistical provision, avoid unnecessary excessive accumulation fund event prolong cyclical bonanza. at present, impairment asset credit risk historical low spain; remain foreseeable future, due good economic conditions. the new provision thus accumulate significant amount funds, reasonable, acceptable impact bottom line profit loss account. those fund allow extra solvency loss cover tide turns. technically, new provision consider value adjustment. in publish account deduct book value credit item produce it. it consider reserve integrate regulatory funds. the annual account shall report various solvency provision (or value adjustments), method computation. the statistical provision tax-deductible expense although bank use asset account anticipate tax (i.e. impact profit loss neutral still negative term cash flows). finally, give considerable internationalisation bank system recent years, important keep mind statistical provision require individual level member consolidate bank group. it possible counter positive statistical provision requirement one bank negative one another bank group. this individual bank approach reinforce statistical provision requirement square well fact expect loss arise individual bank portfolio level. by now, probably wonder real impact statistical provision spanish bank system. a far profit loss account concerned, statistical provision depository institution represent around 12% 2001 total operate margin. at end 2000 statistical fund reach 15% maximum amount (remember cap three time latent risk) end 2001 stand 27%. at current rates, statistical fund reach peak end 2004. a far cyclical behaviour banks, soon say, tend think anti-cyclical nature statistical provision influence bank behaviour. i must confess gain acceptance among bank institution new provision scheme easy. bank reluctant see bottom line profit indented, argue spanish provision system already demand (tight asset classification rule plus on-site monitor enforcement bank spain inspectors, mention high solvency ratio international standards). apart banks’ initial, understandable, criticism, voice raised, although loudly, dynamic provisioning. some readily refuted. others merit careful discussion alternative propose may affect financial stability. the obvious criticism system dynamic provision smooth bank profits. it true statistical provision tend smooth profit course cycle. but le true current ex post provision system (i.e. set aside specific provision impair asset appears) artificially increase volatility banks’ profits. and important, increase volatility latter case le economic fundamental (i. e. expect losses) account rules. if expect loss appear begin operation, bank start provision outset. this mean increase provision decline bank profit expansionary periods, credit risk expand most. when downturn arrive expect loss turn real losses, impact provision profit would low since significant amount expect loss previously acknowledged. to extent extra volatility bank profit result insufficient recognition expect losses, dynamic provision restore part distortion created. from prudential point view, clear dynamic provision limit dangerous capital erosion time plenty, require bank provision expect loss avoid pay dividend (remember insurance case). some observer mention need ex ante provision since future margin income enough cover expect losses. for supervisors, however, rely future margin income might overly adventurous stance. bi review 35/2002 7 let expand this. first all, experience painfully show u price loan always properly adjust risk involve operation (even take account fee future customer relationships). i already talk strong competition market share over-optimism. secondly, even risk properly priced, proceed high margin could pay shareholder time impairment appears. moreover, dynamic provision allow timely recognition income cost stem bank loan portfolios. an alternative current account framework promote international fora. i talk full fair value account (ffva), i would like underline word “full”. it quite clear ffva has, time being, insurmountable drawback commercial bank theoretical practical nature. i would place big question mark ffva feasibility. dynamic provision reasonable approach fair value loan without numerous drawback ffva. the statistical provision increase volatility profit facilitate prudent risk management. to conclude, let emphasise provision regulation spain introduce prudential reasons. it three main advantages: first, provide bank incentive good risk management (i.e. risk appraisal, pricing, internal models, etc.). second, reconcile good risk management sound prudent account practices. and finally, anti-cyclical nature (therefore mitigate tendency reinforce cycles). overall, three advantage summarise one: reinforce soundness single bank institution whole system. my answer first question pose begin speech that, although risk management technique may induce risk-sensitive behaviour, risk-sensitive usually mean pro-cyclical, necessarily case good regulatory practices, dynamic provisioning, adopted, contribute tame economic financial cycles. let finish add word caution. regulatory device per se suffice attain safe sound bank system. a proper risk management culture deeply ingrain banks’ practice also necessary condition reach goal. consequently, bank regulator work hand hand improve financial stability. bi review 35/2002 1 i j macfarlane: overview australian economy open statement mr i j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, sydney, 31 may 2002. * * * mr chairman, normal timetable interrupt last november’s election, slightly year since appear committee. since extremely eventful year, i fair bite work today fill gap. look back hansard last meet may 2001, i see i explain low interest rate three time (in february, march april). at time meeting, i pretty confident australian economy recovery path short housing-induced setback second half 2000, none u sure go happen unite state rest world. external event see crucial fortune evolution monetary policy. a turn out, event unfold two distinct phases: – over rest 2001, world economy continue weaken. the unite state mild recession, consumer spend hold prevent deep early ones. on hand, business sector pronounce recession judge fall industrial production, business investment corporate earnings. most major country negligible growth year, g7 country whole, growth virtually zero year. even so, look time could much worse. for last year, therefore, receive gloomy news world economy. after brief respite mid-year, bad news begin re-emerge july-august, much australia ease monetary policy 5 september. then event 11 september induce new bout gloom, real fear world economy would weaken 2002 experience prolong deep recession. monetary policy ease virtually everywhere. in case, even though economy remain good shape, ease anticipation weaken prospect world economy would eventually flow domestic economy. – the second phase begin early month year, become increasingly clear early fear 2002 go realised. the u economy grow quickly final month 2001 first quarter 2002 anyone expected. in addition, receive good news non-japan asia europe. it pretty clear 2002 year recovery world economy, imf forecast good growth year. the debate long whether recovery, whether average below-average recovery. there still good deal uncertainty robust u recovery inventory correction passed, i.e. second half year. some bubble-type distortion fully unwind still fair bite caution around, include federal reserve board. so world economy comfortable outlook year ago, still uncertainty remaining. what australian economy? the story much le exciting, result lot satisfying. a know, gdp grow 4.1 per cent 2001, high among comparable oecd countries. we safely claim australian economy weather world recession without experience one. this first time experience outcome occurred, must give u confidence soundness economy. but get carry away, concede: • by standard early world recessions, last year’s mild short one, observer may reluctant classify fully-fledged recession. 2 bi review 35/2002 • we escape scot-free. if average growth 2000 2001, come 3 per cent experience modest slowing. a well good gdp growth, experience quite good employment growth past year. it appear slowdown economic activity result trough-to-peak rise unemployment 6 7 per cent, half rise already whittle away far 2002. this extremely good news first time three decade international downturn result peak unemployment rate australia low predecessor. at point proceedings, i usually review previous set forecast i give committee present new set period ahead. i continue tradition, bear mind full year new data available u review. last may, two four quarter 2000/01 available us, i say expect year-on-year gdp growth year 2 per cent; event, come 1.9 per cent. my forecast year-on-year gdp growth 2001/02 3 3½ per cent, current forecast (still two quarter yet come) 3.6 per cent. so, even though big swing international outlook meantime, last 18 month seem turn much expect (unlike previous six month extent housing-induced setback take u largely surprise). on price front, still see gst bulge pas system meet last may. the forecast i present time pass through, rate inflation measure cpi would settle 2½ per cent. in fact, “spot on” four quarter september quarter 2001, december quarter inflation rise 3.1 per cent, march quarter 2002 2.9 per cent. so, average, slightly underestimate rise inflation. for year ahead, i.e. 2002/03, forecast economy continue grow 3½ 4 per cent complete eleventh year expansion enter twelfth. the outlook inflation period could best summarise remain near top target range, although expect go slightly time, come back up. this view express quarterly statement monetary policy release early month. in short, outlook economic growth inflation economy long need boost provide expansionary stance monetary policy. we take first step towards return monetary policy neutral set early month, and, unless unforeseen development intrude, continue process go ahead, time carefully examine incoming data, abroad, ensure development remain track. i return theme late presentation, i examine economic outlook little detail. in look ahead, always ask balance risk lies. another way express ask: main risk economy adjust monetary policy? in view, important risk would expansionary force economy would increase excessive degree, bring likelihood inflation would rise present position top target range something excess it. in process, would also expect imbalance emerge would ultimately bring current expansion end. of course, cannot entirely rule alternative outcome whereby economy slow put sufficient downward pressure inflation threaten fall bottom range, would put low probability outcome. a case time, extent identify risk downside, come mainly abroad. even though u economy grow quickly first quarter year, strength recovery still uncertain, risk world economy unstable political situation middle east indian sub-continent. on domestic front, easily identifiable area spend exert dampen influence late year likely house-building, largely many house build construction able continue former rate. but overall, bar unforeseen international event, find hard see serious risk downside australian economy. we cannot rule slightly below-average growth, would regard anything significantly adverse unlikely. instead, condition much conducive strong economic growth last year. the turnaround world economy mean positive force growth year ahead rather dampen influence. this good exports, investment confidence bi review 35/2002 3 general. a well, consumer business confidence return quite high level couple setback last year. business investment quite restrain past couple year pick accord plan business supply abs’s capex survey. this surprise give relatively healthy profit situation, high level business confidence expect growth spending. these buoyant condition may also encourage business attempt rebuild profit margins, factor underpin inflation next year so. thus, believe monetary policy maintain present stance much longer, little risk serious slowdown, high risk economy time would overheat. this provide basis view monetary policy return neutral setting. i think widespread agreement assessment situation, inevitably people agree. one doubt sometimes see express fear rise interest rate “choke expansion”. not surprisingly, feel fear misplaced. at one level, amount say expansion fragile continue monetary policy keep permanently expansionary setting. we also care continue expansion, feel least risky way neutral interest rate setting. at another level, fear may reserve bank err tight side. of course, possible, track record support view. over past decade so, thing stand monetary policy fast rate economic growth permit compare comparable countries, tendency over-achieve inflation reduction. where differ observer mainly interest medium run, i.e. want sustain expansion rather maximise speed next year. we consistent approach best part decade, serve u well. i would like change subject highlight committee press release announce today’s hearing, namely credit card reform. the reserve bank release consultation document december last year. in it, proposed, subject consultation, three major change four party credit card scheme operate australia: – first, new transparent standard set interchange fee credit card transaction would lead reduction fees, thus merchant service fee pay businesses; – second, end prohibition impose card scheme prevent merchant pass cost accept credit card cardholders; – third, elimination restriction entry credit card scheme keep potential competitor deposit-taking institutions. after release document, allow interest party till mid-march prepare submissions, go submission thoroughly since then. we want give party every opportunity put view forward, even involve multiple meetings. we still process and, finished, release find sometime end june. during period, reserve bank engage public debate subject, even though participant credit card industry quite vocal. we see role stage essentially umpire adjudicate compete view financial institution card scheme one side, consumers, retailers, billers, etc. side. of course, umpire role inhibit committee ask question wish to. bi review 34/2002 1 mark w olson: the european union’s financial service action plan testimony mr mark w olson,

bank organization conduct commercial bank financial service unite state aggregate u.s. asset $1.7 trillion. these figure demonstrate globalization new concept recent process. a u.s. industry expand foreign operations, u.s. supervision evolve take account fact bank operate many different legal regulatory environments. we strengthen exist cooperative relationship bank supervisor country establish new one u.s. bank continue expand operation countries. at federal reserve, conduct bilateral consultation individual authority participate international group financial service supervisors. we engage eu counterpart bilaterally groups. the federal reserve federal bank agency participate regularly basel committee bank supervision, form order improve communication cooperation among supervisor internationally active banks. some key achievement committee include 1988 basel capital accord, create first time internationally accept standard assess level bank capital. the accord replace uneven system national standard allow bank expand internationally competitive basis. similarly, committee adopt minimum standard consolidate supervision 1992, establish principle bank subject supervisory regime financial statement consolidate subject review home country authorities. both capital accord principle consolidate bank supervision become internationally recognize standard bank supervisor aspire meet. nine member state european union also member basel committee representative european commission participate observer. the federal reserve eight nine eu countries, european commission observer, also participate joint 2 bi review 34/2002 forum, group establish basel committee, international organization security commissioner (iosco), international association insurance supervisor (iais). the joint forum discus issue arise operation financial service conglomerate develop principle appropriate supervision entity operate within financial groups. these group meetings, well many work group meet specific issues, provide regular opportunity u.s. regulator meet discus issue common interest european officials. in addition regular meet international groups, federal reserve longstanding relationship national regulator european union staff european commission. for internationally active bank organization operation unite state european union, national supervisor may participate joint examination particular institutions, confer specific issue meet periodically discus institution’s operation financial condition. ongoing communication recognize critical effective supervision. home host countries’ interest further dialogue strong supervisory relationships. regular contact commission staff go back 1980s eu consider adopt second bank directive, aim promote internal market establish so-called “european passport” bank charter eu. under passport, bank charter one eu country entitle establish branch eu country authority supervision home country rules. since time, several u.s. bank take advantage early eu regulation establish local bank european member state, use “passport” establish branch eu member countries. european subsidiary u.s. bank able take advantage passport principle “national treatment.” national treatment generally mean country provide parity treatment domestic foreign-owned firms, result equality competitive opportunity. national treatment long prevail practice respect foreign bank operate unite state practice incorporate statute 1978 enactment international bank act (iba). this principle also incorporate various trade agreement unite state party, north american free trade agreement (nafta) general agreement trade service (gats). the eu member state also subscriber gat consequently national treatment principle contains. implement national treatment difficult precisely one country try adapt legal regulatory structure foreign firm incorporate different home country environment. this challenge federal reserve face year seek apply u.s. law adopt system bank hold company foreign bank generally bank hold company structure. the unite state also require foreign bank subject comprehensive consolidate supervision home country supervisor buy bank country. under law, federal reserve must evaluate supervision system different yet ensure fairly apply principle national treatment. u.s. private sector firm may concern new regulatory supervisory initiative eu proposal may require change exist operation and/or report standards. there may also concern initiative design european firm industry would properly take account home country supervisory structure regulatory practices. foreign bank express similar concern u.s. regulatory initiative past. at federal reserve, find open transparent regulatory process crucial help u understand proposal affect foreign bank problem arise, give u useful information evaluate merit particular complaints. we time propose regulation foreign bank governments, include european commission, file adverse comments. these comment help u reevaluate regulation determine whether supervisory regulatory objective could achieve different way, consistent principle national treatment. with respect implementation fsap european union, european union obligation ensure rule adopt consistent principle national treatment. it expectation european commission member state seek so. federal reserve staff meet commission staff discus number matters, include application financial conglomerate directive u.s. bank organizations. the federal reserve commit continue dialogue commission matter mutual interest, bi review 34/2002 3 bilaterally part financial market discussion lead treasury department. we understand commission begin engage industry consultation part rule write process endorse process allow affect institutions, include foreign-based, participate actively process. the fsap far reach agenda. i comment briefly three issue particular interest u.s. bank organizations. with respect conglomerate directive, understand impetus directive come joint forum’s principle supervision financial conglomerates. the three parent body joint forum (the basel committee, iosco iais) concern that, although individual financial company within group might subject prudential supervision, consolidate financial group might subject appropriate oversight. this turn could lead relationship transaction could pose financial risk regulate part group. the joint forum’s principle develop help assure material gap supervisors’ understand inter-affiliate relationship within financial group could ultimately result financial instability. we understand eu financial conglomerate directive concern issue. in unite states, u.s. bank organization long subject consolidate supervisory oversight. we believe federal reserve’s supervisory program practice bank hold companies, include financial hold companies, fully consistent requirement contemplate eu’s financial conglomerate directive. with regard capital adequacy directive develop credit institution investment firm european union, also believe ultimate product present difficulty u.s. bank organizations. the european commission mindful work underway basel supervisor committee replace exist basel capital accord comprehensive risk sensitive framework assess organization’s capital adequacy. when eu issue capital adequacy directive public comment 2001, commenters raise concern regulatory burden would impose institution would subject eu capital rule basel capital rule national level. the eu committee responsible capital adequacy directive recognize potential burden take step ensure eu directive consistent possible final revise basel accord. technical work group basel committee communicate eu technical draft group objective harmonize two framework full extent possible. the sweep change basel capital initiative intend internationally active bank organizations. the eu capital adequacy directive intend apply much wide range institutions, international operation well purely domestic. thus, capital adequacy directive likely address eu specific issue small institutions. internationally active european bank currently subject basel capital rule adopt individual countries, well exist eu capital adequacy directive. some difference two set rule exist. supervisors, however, aware difference continually strive minimize associate regulatory burden institutions. because basel revision eu capital directive revision underway tandem similar estimate time frame completion, good likelihood final product substantively significantly consistent current basel eu capital rules. the fsap also contemplate mandate adherence international account standards. currently, bank organization european union may prepare annual financial statement accordance account standard international account standard board (iasb), u.s. generally accept account principle (u.s. gaap), and/or national standards. the use u.s. gaap usually limit bank organization company whose security publicly trade u.s. stock exchange register security exchange commission. in many cases, company also provide separate financial statement base national account standard disclosure rules. the european union require eu company list eu exchange currently follow national standard follow iasb standard 2005 require eu company currently follow u.s. gaap adopt iasb standard 2007. the eu also work adopt international audit standard external audit eu companies, include banks. the iasb independent international account profession independently funded. it adopt many structural element fasb unite states, intend promote independent, objective standards-setting environment. many senior american account 4 bi review 34/2002 expert serve iasb staff. iasb gaap many similarity u.s. gaap iasb plan propose extensive enhancement standard late year. the federal reserve long support sound account policy meaningful public disclosure bank financial organization objective improve market discipline foster stable financial markets. the concept market discipline assume great importance among international bank supervisor well. the recent proposal basel committee amend basel capital accord (called basel ii) seek strengthen market’s ability aid bank supervisor evaluate bank organizations’ risk assess capital adequacy. it consist three pillars, tools: minimum risk-based capital requirement (pillar i), risk-based supervision (pillar ii), disclosure risk capital adequacy enhance market discipline (pillar iii). this approach capital regulation, market-discipline component, signal sound account disclosure continue important aspect supervisory approach. the federal reserve u.s. bank agency also actively involve effort basel committee promote sound international accounting, auditing, disclosure standard practice global bank organization companies. for example, official federal reserve board member standard advisory council advise iasb trustee projects, proposal standards. the u.s. bank agency active support basel committee work iasb’s technical advisory group enhance iasb’s standard financial instrument bank disclosure basel committee’s project international group promote sound global bank audit practices. in conclusion, i believe european union encourage continue program strengthen modernize rule financial service firm operate europe. this increase competition, enhance efficiency contribute economic growth eu globally. we please european commission broaden consultation comment process proposal consider fsap. supervisory regulatory measure benefit significantly open transparent process affect company may participate. we would expect european commission member state national authority apply fsap’s measure u.s. firm fair national treatment basis. u.s. bank organization dynamic competitive rest world. accordingly, confident u.s. firm benefit strengthen efficient european market financial services. willem f duisenberg: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, brussels, 21 may 2002 * * * i take pleasure appear today continue regular exchange view report ecb’s assessment economic monetary development decision take govern council. moreover, i like take opportunity address introductory remark two issue relate growth potential euro area economy wage developments, raised, among matters, letter you, madam chairman, send recently follow-up presentation ecb annual report committee vice-president ecb. economic monetary development the evidence become available since last testimony committee 23 january 2002 indeed make u confident recovery way euro area. at time, recent development consumer price inflation euro area le favourable expected, mainly due specific partly temporary factors. relate this, outlook price stability appear somewhat le favourable turn year. however, still uncertainty strength economic recovery they, turn, imply existence uncertainty regard inflation outlook - uncertainty diminish since govern council meet 2 may. let elaborate assessment economic outlook euro area. start analysis first pillar ecb’s monetary policy strategy, annual growth rate m3 remain high first quarter 2002. the high annual growth rate still reflect portfolio shift liquid position occur last autumn, economic financial environment characterise high uncertainty, euro area investor show particularly mark preference liquid holdings. at time, saw moderation short-term dynamic m3 early 2002. however, m3 growth recently start decline and, time being, reversal early liquidity build-up proceed slowly. the persistence excess liquidity could become risk price stability, particularly time economic recovery euro area. in addition, also consider annual rate growth loan private sector continue decline march, also early indication decline may come end. overall, information first pillar therefore continue deserve particular attention. a regard second pillar, certain trough economic activity euro area reach end last year. the rise business confidence recent month visible indication improvement economic conditions. while recovery expect initially proceed gradual pace, euro area real gdp growth rate line potential growth late year. these expectation rebound real gdp growth euro area share recently publish forecast international organisations, paint similar picture. a reversal past reduction inventories, process way, high export growth, drive positive international environment, contribute gradual economic upswing. overall, domestic external factor foster recovery. sound fundamental absence major imbalance euro area would require long correction process support positive outlook euro area economy. yet, despite positive element point towards economic recovery, uncertainty remain strength current upswing. these partly relate development oil price speed recovery consumption. in addition, risk economic recovery euro area relate imbalance elsewhere world economy. turn prices, recent development consumer price inflation le satisfactory expect end last year, annual inflation rate expect decline level safely 2% 2002 stabilise thereafter. at present, partly result high oil prices, inflation rate 2002 whole could turn somewhat high expect end last year. for price stability maintained, essential past upward shock inflation rate remain one-off nature become entrench expectation economic agents. recently publish inflation forecasts, development indicator inflation expectations, recent trend wage neither confirm contradict entrenchment. while acknowledge monetary policy cannot affect inflation development short term, determine put achievement risk. it therefore particularly important juncture remain vigilant regard evolution key factor determine outlook prices. the rather protract upward trend service price is, respect, one factor closely monitored. in addition, prospect price stability depend largely wage moderation. it mistake believe high wage rise per se increase aggregate demand real terms. on contrary, excessive wage claim increase cost create inflationary pressures. by so, risk reduce competitiveness, employment growth, thus consumption. wage moderation key factor maintain price stability, also support job creation economic growth sustain basis. in regard, important bear mind key challenge euro area remain improvement condition increase productivity. this would expand trend potential growth thereby create, support wage moderation, condition reduce high level structural unemployment euro area. in respect, speeding-up structural policy measure aim increase productivity utmost importance. for purpose, 2002 broad economic policy guideline set condition step pace economic reform. this require acceleration deepen structural reform labour, product financial market order provide economic agent proper incentives. a regard fiscal policy, vital member state maintain medium-term perspective compliance framework stability growth pact. in particular, utmost importance already do manage transition budgetary position close balance surplus order ensure smooth effective function stability growth pact future. let strongly emphasise member state concern must honour commitment make achieve balance budget 2003-04. moreover, government pursue ambitious reform regard size structure public expenditure revenue, also order create room tax cut absorb fiscal cost population ageing. monetary policy best contribute long-term growth prospect euro area remain firmly focus maintenance price stability. this create stable monetary environment economic agent operate in. at time, great flexibility labour, product financial market together sound fiscal position wage moderation support objective maintain price stability create stable condition foster employment creation. such interaction policies, policy actors, accordance treaty, consistently pursue assignment responsibilities, best possible way enhance long-term welfare citizen euro area. i please answer question now. bi review 33/2002 1 joseph yam: the asian crisis - lesson future open remark mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hkma fifth distinguish lecture: “the asian crisis: lesson future”, hong kong, 21 may 2002. * * * i delight welcome fifth hkma distinguish lecture, introduce speaker, dr stanley fischer, discussant, dr stephen grenville. the title stanley fischer’s lecture “the asian crisis: lesson future.” in weeks’ time shall mark fifth anniversary outbreak asian financial crisis - day so, incidentally, celebrate entirely unconnected event, fifth anniversary establishment hong kong sar. asia world go many ordeal since 1997, crisis perhaps seem much past really is. but effect - physical psychological - still us. it important continue study cause effect see lesson present. i speak length many previous occasion asian financial crisis, i intend today sit back listen. let me, however, make three brief observations. the first that, five year on, limit progress make resolve one fundamental problem help make crisis devastate many economies: deficient global financial architecture, outgrow market use it. there indeed reform internationally individual economies, much great alertness threat stability pose volatile, high-velocity international capital flows. but much still remain done, capital flow get bigger, risk crisis remains. paradoxically, risk increase false sense security bring two three years’ absence kind contagion shake many part world nineties. the second observation that, absence international solutions, number economy region adopt local approach problem. some choose go slow even step back financial liberalisation introduce tighten restriction controls. while understandable - case effective short-term measure - approach regrettable shut many benefits, well dangers, globalisation. in hong kong, control kind practical realisation global link supply lifeblood, take different approach. we choose enhance policy credibility great transparency strengthen tighten rule-based monetary system. my third observation say asian crisis death knell asia economic force - many - seem wrong. there remarkable resilience, even worst-hit economies, reform restructure help put number economy back foot even time global economic downturn. progress evenly spread throughout region, still cause anxiety. but, world economy show sign recovery, prospect region, dazzling, look somewhat brighter. it great pleasure introduce speaker discussant. from late eighty recently, stan fischer much centre world economic financial crisis - solution - first world bank first deputy manage director subsequently senior adviser imf. he play practical role - often crucial one - addressing, prevent resolve crises, write extensively subject. asia, le region world, benefit expertise, honour talk lesson learn recent crisis. steve grenville serve 20 year reserve bank australia, deputy governor bank 1996 2001. before join reserve bank, serve oecd paris, spend time imf indonesia. he play pivotal role asian crisis, instrumental australia’s involvement three large support package region. it great honour discussant today. 2 bi review 33/2002 stan steve old friend mine. i therefore think right comment position find career total around 40 year central banking, try see shed light eternal question: “what happen central banker cease central bankers?” i speak position intense personal interest recent resignation don brash governorship reserve bank new zealand leaf - i tell - doubtful distinction longest-serving central bank chief region. don brash, reputation make original career choices, reportedly go politics - precedent which, let stress, i intention following. stan steve follow imf would doubt refer “two-corner solution”. since leave imf early year, stan firmly anchor one world’s large bank finance group vice-chairman. i name bank here, hkma currently tenant build bear name. to avoid give impression hkma subsidiary bank, always try pretend build call something else, refrain mention name stationery, deliveryman taxi-drivers, anyone else. it sufficient say bank question year celebrate 100th anniversary hong kong. steve go opposite end two-corner solution enter float world academic consultants. since leave reserve bank australia six month ago, take appointment adjunct professor national centre development study australian national university. he also work economic consultant, mainly, i understand, asia-related topics. whatever corner stan steve chosen, important thing continue give expertise region organisation which, though different, important presence asia. they also share expertise u today. so without delay, let welcome call first upon speaker, dr stanley fischer, deliver fifth hkma distinguish lecture. dr fischer, please. bi review 33/2002 1 guy quaden: new view firms’ investment finance decision open address mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, national bank belgium conference, brussels, 27-28 may 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, i really please welcome national bank belgium 2002 conference. my wish, one wishes, since i become governor, share member board, stimulate scientific co-operation bank academic community particular belgian academic community modus operandi mutual respect independence. two year ago, national bank belgium organise conference “how promote economic growth euro area” celebrate 150th anniversary. on occasion, i announce bank would call international conference every two year encourage debate academic professional economist work central bank policy make institutions. at time, bank also decide joint research project economist belgian academic researcher would precede conference. the project start march 2001 end current conference result research presented. the bank request belgian academic community express interest participate joint research project submit proposal concern content analysis one several sub-items general project, preferably empirical content make use available panel data firms’ balance sheet sources. all receive nineteen proposal academic community. since conference also foreign speaker invited, force select limit number among proposal received. this selection base number criterion but, especially, compliance coherence overall research project. allow explain reason lead particular choice topic conference. everybody acknowledge investment key variable economics. capital accumulation play pivotal role determine process long-run economic growth, clearly evidence previous international conference two year ago, also important drive force business cycles. although investment represent relatively minor fraction gdp, major part output fluctuation drive firms’ investment behaviour. for conduct monetary policy, is, therefore, crucial understand mechanism drive essential component interest sensitive expenditures, particular, monetary policy affect investment spend firms. give investment important element complex transmission mechanism monetary policy, give continuous change economic behaviour institutional structures, continuous interest central bank kind research easily motivated. despite best effort economist work various research institute central banks, remains, however, imperfectly understood. this is, course, large extent due volatility investment itself, many time high gdp. by choose theme second international conference bank want encourage research field economics. in respect, pioneer work dale jorgenson, analyse investment decision neo-classical framework, speak taxation issue today, two major strand literature developed, examine implication capital market imperfection uncertainty investment behaviour. our distinguish invite speakers, lenos trigeorgis, jean-bernard chatelain, charles himmelberg julian franks, give overview subject contributions. the first strand show presence information asymmetry firm weak balance sheet may become financially constrain sense cost external fund substantially increase unable attract external funds. in circumstances, effect change monetary policy-controlled interest rate transmit increase user cost capital also impact financial structure firm. indeed, increase policy rate result large interest payments, hence worsen firm’s cash flow ability self finance, decrease value asset could use collateral new loans. a consequence, firm likely expose problem asymmetric information, react monetary tightening. variation availability credit result change monetary policy may act important channel transmission, since 2 bi review 33/2002 financial friction amplify effect change policy-controlled interest rates. in order ass monetary policy stance important policy maker know whether friction present not. a second recent strand theory business investment address impact uncertainty investment. the main insight literature firm, uncertain future know investment sink cost, may choose postpone investment order obtain information future market conditions. one show that, case, require rate return undertake investment project increases. it clear that, hereby, uncertainty introduce additional friction investment decision process, likely temper effect change policy-controlled interest rates. therefore, also respect, monetary authority need evaluate precise time magnitude frictions, cause uncertainty. a requirement use micro data, know aggregation blur identification important part behaviour economic agents. so, study aggregate level often fail find economically significant relation investment user cost capital, relation utmost importance transmission monetary policy. this failure attribute literature so-called simultaneity bias. use micro data allow alleviate problems. moreover, micro data allow analyse important economic question cannot address use aggregate data sets. this precisely case one want identify existence financial frictions, individual balance sheet position particular firm matters. next, i want review importance launch euro ecb’s price stability policy investment behaviour. the introduction single currency three year ago provoke fundamental change environment public private sector operate. first, apparent change elimination exchange rate risks. together low transaction cost transparent markets, create new opportunity company within euro area. second, euro give impetus process financial integration enhance widen deepen euro area financial markets. this evolution may appear beneficial firms, still financially constrain unable execute investment plans. especially young risky firm often suffer insufficient tangible assets, might serve collateral external funds, and/or develop activity highly risky term future returns. since typically enterprise tend bring new technology market, financial market deepening, trigger euro, may contribute boost investment economic growth. although launch euro, exchange rate currency euro area country become irrevocably fix national currency expression currency, resident euro area euro arrive introduction new euro banknote coin begin year. since first january, 300 million citizen europe share tangible currency. this event foster transparency efficiency. not mere launch euro, especially rigorous credible pursuit ecb objective price stability assign treaty maastricht, stimulate investment contribute sustain long-run economic growth. first, price stability allow change relative price easily observed, since obscure fluctuation overall price level. this enhance transparency allow economic agent make better-informed decisions, result efficient allocation resources. second, monetary stability also eliminate uncertainty future private decision-makers face manage businesses. if provider fund convince price stability maintain future, require “risk premium” cover future inflation. by reduce risk premia real interest rate may fall, monetary policy give incentive invest. finally, credible policy price stability also make le likely firm divert resource productive us stockbuilding order hedge inflation. in high inflation environment is, indeed, incentive accumulate real good since expect become expensive near future. to sum up, ecb’s monetary policy maintain price stability affect expectation market participant future price development succeed achieve necessary degree credibility. the continuous low inflation expectation reflect ecb successful task, create basis low long-term interest rates. these significant positive effect government budget many country stimulate investment. stabilise expectation also show beneficial ecb itself, since enhance predictability bi review 33/2002 3 conditional relationship major macroeconomic variable diminish uncertainty involve conduct monetary policy. before leave floor first speaker, professor dale jorgenson i would like thank invite speaker discussant accept invitation actively take part event. i also grateful belgian team research effort explore factor drive business investment belgium. finally, i want thank participant whose large attendance today certainly contribute success conference too. i hope conference help u good understand mechanism underlie investment behaviour discover policy need foster it. i wish productive conference. bi review 32/2002 1 bank japan’s may report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 22 may 2002. * * * the bank’s view2 the pace deterioration japan’s economy moderated, production start pick reflect increase export progress inventory adjustment. with regard final demand, business fix investment continue decrease private consumption remain weak. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment downtrend. meanwhile, net export (real export minus real imports) increase due recovery overseas economies. industrial production start pick up, reflect increase export also progress inventory adjustment whole. however, firm maintain stance reduce personnel expense give persistently strong excessiveness employment. therefore, employment income condition household continue worsen, reflect decrease number employee fast pace decline wages. turn outlook, respect domestic demand, business fix investment expect follow downtrend while, judge mainly lead indicator firms’ investment plans. private consumption also likely remain lackluster mainly due worsen employment income conditions. in addition, government spend basically project continue downward trend. meanwhile, export conditions, overseas economies, especially u.s. east asia, likely follow recovery path. the worldwide inventory adjustment it-related good come end except good network equipment. moreover, yen still low last autumn. under circumstances, export project continue moderate recovery. industrial production likely follow gradual uptrend support increase export also progress inventory adjustment. this increase production help corporate profit recover, particularly manufacture sector, expect gradually support domestic private demand business fix investment. overall, japan’s economy project stop deteriorate whole since increase export production lead improvement corporate profit turn, domestic private demand. however, addition weak employment income conditions, pace increase export production likely remain modest balance. therefore, take positive effects, stem development export production, spread across nonmanufacturing sector, small firm households. with regard outlook overseas economies, essential element exports, various uncertain factor include u.s. economy, development crude oil price effect global economy. amid persist fragility uncertainty economy, continuous attention still keep mind unstable movement foreign domestic financial markets, include foreign exchange market, would easily exert negative influence economy. on price front, import price continue rise mainly due high crude oil prices. domestic wholesale price almost flat recently since decline machinery price reduction electricity charge offset increase import price effect progress inventory adjustment. however, consumer price corporate service price continue decline. a condition surround price developments, past depreciation yen rise crude oil price regard factor support price time being. however, since domestic demand project remain weak time, balance supply demand expect 1 this report base data information available time bank japan monetary policy meet hold may 20 21, 2002. 2 the bank’s view recent economic financial developments, determine policy board monetary policy meet hold may 20 21 basis monetary policy decisions. 2 bi review 32/2002 keep exert downward pressure prices. furthermore, factor ongoing technological innovation machinery, deregulation, streamline distribution channel restrain prices. in addition, fast pace decline wage may also work factor push price downward, mainly service price sensitive wage developments. reflect factors, domestic wholesale prices, tend greatly affect exchange rate crude oil prices, likely le flat time being. on hand, consumer price expect stay gradual decline trend. a financial market, short-term money markets, outstanding balance current account bank japan recently move around 15 trillion yen bank continue provide ample liquidity money market. in circumstances, overnight call rate continue move around zero percent. moreover, interest rate term instrument remain steady. yield long-term government bond move range 1.3-1.4 percent recently. yield spread private bond (bank bond corporate bonds) government bond contract slightly. however, spread bond low credit rat government bond still remain wide. stock price level whole basically move range 11,000-12,000 yen. in foreign exchange market, yen appreciate reflect overall downtrend u.s. dollar due mainly weak u.s. stock prices. with regard corporate finance, private bank become cautious extend loan firm high credit risk continue active extend loan blue-chip companies. the lend attitude financial institution perceive firm become severe. in corporate bond cp markets, issue environment firm low credit rat continue severe whole, environment firm high credit rat improve recently. credit demand private sector continue follow downtrend mainly firm decrease business fix investment continuously reduce debts. amid developments, private banks’ lend continue decline 2-3 percent year-on-year basis. the year-on-year growth rate amount outstanding corporate bond issue decrease somewhat. the year-on-year growth rate amount outstanding cp issue continue decline, although amount still well previous year’s level. the year-on-year growth rate monetary base april increase due partly continue high liquidity demand even enter new fiscal year, reflect system failure major bank group. the year-on-year growth rate money stock (m2 + cds) remain around 3.5-4.0 percent. fund cost firm continue extremely low level whole. overall, recent financial environment remain extremely easy whole term money market conditions. the deterioration financial position firm come halt. however, stance investor toward firm high credit risk remain severe lend attitude private bank become cautious. hence, development behavior financial institution corporate finance continue require close monitoring. bi review 32/2002 1 villy bergström: forecast business cycle speech mr villy bergström; deputy governor sverige riksbank, elmateriel leverantörernas förening (association swedish electrical installation material), stockholm, 15 may 2002. * * * monetary policy exact science during 1990s many central bank formulate explicit target monetary policy. sverige riksbank formulate target 1993 annual inflation rate, measure accord consumer price index (cpi) two per cent tolerate deviation interval +/- 1 percentage points. deviation target level rule rather exception. monetary policy exact science society machine; would neither possible desirable keep inflation precise level, particularly short term. in recent year swedish economy subject relatively large disturbances. on international front, asia crisis russia crisis, well severe fluctuation stock market oil prices, effect us. in sweden, rise fall it sector, well deregulation electricity telecommunication market ensue price falls, affect price production. such crisis change policy rarely predicted. this mean riksbank always make “mistakes”, benefit hindsight. however, self-evident particularly valid assess monetary policy. what really count direction monetary policy basis information available time decision taken, do possible predict future perfect accuracy. when experience major disturbance change economy, cannot merely concentrate effect prices. let illustrate reference oil prices. if assume oil price rise. inflation rises, mean real wage fall, partly result petrol heat oil become expensive, mean consumer le money spend goods. this lead decline demand thereby price goods. high oil price thus lead rise price low demand, long term subdue inflation. it difficult predict oil price always reflect demand supply situation, also connect politics. the current situation illustrate difficulty. be oil price rise increase global demand growth high assumed, political uncertainty middle east important factor? what resource situation within economy? a price rise occur resource utilisation way lead rapid profound decline. rise oil price situation strain resource lead spread effect, general rise price within economy. we thus high inflation rate time subdue effect production employment. if monetary policy aim every situation use interest rate hike eliminate effect oil price rise inflation, could lead deterioration production employment. if transitory effect inflation expect abate without spread price affect inflation expectations, may good reason leave repo rate unchanged. a gradual adaptation monetary policy direct achieve inflation target couple year ahead allow u take account employment growth. that riksbank’s policy base achieve inflation target 2 per cent one two year ahead. act terrorism, war natural disaster increase uncertainty it important observe knowledge effect monetary policy complete. the purpose deviation interval make clear deviation probable, ambition try limit them. in practice, monetary policy govern way make forecast inflation one two year ahead. if forecast time horizon high inflation target raise repo rate, lower, cut rate. so think affect monetary policy? to put simply, repo rate affect swedish market rate (the interest rate channel), banks’ lend general public (the bank channel) well asset prices, share prices, exchange rate (the 2 bi review 32/2002 exchange rate channel). the size impact make change interest rate households’ mortgage share price vary time. monetary policy also effect via households’ companies’ expectation future. an inflation target 2 per cent shall act kind nominal anchor expectation regard future development inflation thereby affect pricing, rate wage-setting. when come set price wages, major role play expectation party labour market company household riksbank react. that say, trust riksbank average deliver inflation rate around 2 per cent. we know forecast uncertain. we tolerate deviation interval medium-term target horizon (normally 1-2 years), also try ass uncertainty forecast forecast make. be normal level uncertainty, high normal low normal? this illustrate inflation report mean uncertainty interval different outcome inflation. this interval take account total assessment. act terrorism, war natural disaster lead great uncertainty. this make even difficult make assessments. good target-fulfilment historical terms, last year raise question during period 1970-1992 inflation sweden amount average 8 per cent year, real wage scarcely increase all. since inflation target first apply 1995, inflation measure und1x (the underlie inflation rate) average 1.8 per cent year real wage increase average 2.8 per cent. on whole, must regard good level target fulfilment. last year, however, inflation 2.8 per cent, measure way. and look recent years, underlie inflation rise past two years. let therefore give brief outline forecast consideration recent years. during period 1998-2000, average growth rate 4 per cent year. at begin 1999 inflation begin rise, initially explain rise oil prices. it become increasingly clear shortage arise labour market risk lead high wage increase thereby high inflation. we estimate swedish economy broad upturn phase, rise resource utilisation risk inflation rate high target level. in november 1999 raise repo rate early 2000 similar assessment made. during autumn 2000 saw ahead u situation stable strong upturn economic activity would gradually lead high level resource utilisation rise inflation. at begin 2001 receive number statistic indicate slowdown, particularly usa. the federal reserve surprise everyone interest rate cut january, two ordinary monetary policy meetings. the slowdown spread. the riksbank forecaster begin revise growth forecast sweden internationally. the share it bubble burst together rise oil price high real interest rate 1999 2000, lead synchronous downturn economic activity around world. during course 2001, make several major downward revision forecast international growth. the economic downturn assume subdue effect swedish inflation via direct indirect channels. in mid-2001 decline real economy whole become mark expected. however, development price deviate sharply forecast make riksbank analysts. when inflation surprisingly rise considerably spring 2001, assessment make largely due factor transitory nature, partly cause disturbance supply side. meat price rise sharply result livestock diseases, electricity price rise considerably, partly result normalisation follow extreme price fall previous year electricity market deregulated, also unusually low level snow winter season 1999-2000, lead shortage water power station dams. there also production problem oil refineries, lead sharp rise petrol prices. we note early spring 2001 even adjustment make transitory factors, inflation rise expect estimate risk resource utilisation, affect inflationary pressure primarily follow year, could high 2000 early believed. the krona weaken considerably spring 2001, add concern inflation. a majority executive board decide raise repo rate summer 2001. however, downward revision growth forecast continue autumn follow act bi review 32/2002 3 terrorism september, considerable insecurity. the terrorist attack come sensitive time u economy, already downturn phase, albeit relatively good growth consumption. it estimate attack would entail deep prolong economic downturn repercussion entire global economy. steer interest rate cut around world, include sweden. nevertheless, inflation continue rise. a cold winter europe, problem swedish apple harvest poor fish catch lead rise price fruit, vegetable fish autumn. it obviously easy get catch detail fail see underlie changes. however, could see even clearly rise inflation merely due transitory factors, entail broad rise primarily domestic prices. this could connect fact secondary effect high energy food price make great impact consumer channel. another important factor wage growth, despite weak development demand, become even problematic. within many industries, instance, construction, retail trade, bank insurance, well public sector, wage rise considerably 2001. at end 2001/beginning 2002, signal confidence indicator economic activity might reach low level usa also sweden optimism regard future begin spread. the effect terrorist attack appear limited, although sector hit hard. to sum up, conclude aid slide (oh 1 the riksbank’s forecast gdp 1999-2003) year 2001 entail constant downward adjustment growth forecasts. at time, conclude opposite regard inflation forecast (oh 2 inflation forecast 1998-2002), force revise upwards again. if right recovery begin sweden abroad, conclude economic downturn one mild post-war period, partly result resolute stabilisation policy. however, slowdown sweden rest world 2001 unexpectedly severe relation forecast make 2000. the fact forecaster miss turn point economic cycle unique particular downturn, quite common phenomenon. i return current situation, first look back time. historical pattern repeat be possible learn lesson history? both yes no. if one study economic slowdown past three decades, one see differ considerably regard causes, sequence event recovery. there simple, cyclical pattern automatically repeated. at time, clear experience element common previous cycles.1 in industrial nations, include usa, economic downturn 1990s become mild compare downturn 1970s early 1980s. deep recession unusual arise combination major structural problems, bank crises. the fact industrial nation enter economic downturn together rule rather exception. the decline begin 1990s different, due different type disturbance. the german reunification mean germany europe go way extent. bank crisis hit different country different point time. in sweden also large increase real interest rate follow footstep change inflation rate defence fix exchange rate, contribute crisis sweden become deep industrial nation and, addition, bad recession sweden experience since 1930s. the downturn experience unusual decline production usa germany low usual many european country decline growth all. in sweden, too, slowdown appear one mild post-war period. growth expect decline single quarter. during previous downturn economic activity least one quarter negative result growth since 1970 economic downturn always lead decline production average four quarters. households’ consumption relatively strong many country downturn also explanation country avoid decline production altogether. however, 1 see, instance, box early economic downturn riksbank’s march inflation report box imf’s recent economic outlook. 4 bi review 32/2002 strong household consumption, primarily usa, raise question regard sustainability strength recovery, give initial low level save among u household relatively high indebtedness. the fact large mistake forecast make turn point economic activity nothing unusual pattern able distinguish 1990s, short-lived downturn long upturns, appear hold true. economic policy contribute stability a number different factor may contribute upturn economic activity become longer, downturn shorter, variation production declined. various study bring different explanations, i would like point question speculation fact. one explanation could economic policy contribute increase stability. fiscal policy large number country change towards balance budget avoid unsustainable build-up debt, monetary policy give clear focus maintain price stability. a great emphasis combat inflation institutional change make central bank independent, go hand hand stabilisation policy appear successful counteract fluctuation economic activity many countries. change production methods, include alter pattern adapt stock new technology, may enable demand supply good capital match quickly before, contribute mild downturn long upswings. a factor could contribute percentage service gdp increase production service short lead times. expansive economic policy - good year swedish economy a low inflation rate tidy public finance provide room manoeuvre face downturn economic activity. a changeover towards expansionary economic policy large number industrial nation lay foundation recovery year. in usa substantial change monetary policy begin 2001. on top come considerable fiscal policy stimulation. monetary policy europe sweden also expansionary. however, many large country europe still struggle large budget deficits, limit fiscal policy scope action. last year sweden one large surplus public save eu. this enable expansionary fiscal policy. this year households’ disposable income expect increase almost 5 per cent, almost 80 per cent come increase transfer low tax charges. such large increase income happen occasion past decades. despite slowdown economic activity, employment increase strongly unemployment continue fall. however, labour market split two parts, fall employment manufacture increase service industry. at time, float exchange rate regime contribute significant change pattern. historically, devaluation krona necessary climax crisis several occasion 1970s 1980s crisis cause fix exchange rate combination cost development lead cost crisis. the slowdown 2001 different extent industry’s competitiveness strong. the weaken krona began, fortunately, year industrial activity slow down. this contribute strong development net export 2001. this probably important factor behind slowdown slowdown rather recession sweden. although otherwise major differences, note decline gdp export finland much great sweden. while industrial production sweden decrease 5 per cent, fell 10 per cent finland. whether due factor exchange rate open question, reasonable assume development krona subdue decline swedish economy. certainly, may time aggravate inflation problems. if krona continue develop along path estimate riksbank many analysts, continue strengthen 2002 2003, help ensure economic upturn grow overheating. bi review 32/2002 5 the economic situation monetary policy it clear minute recent monetary policy meet riksbank paint fairly bright picture swedish economy future. the international recovery, particularly usa, may become slightly strong believe earlier, this, combine continue weak krona, benefit swedish exports. however, development ericsson telecommunication industry constitute cause concern uncertainty. at time, significance one single sector exaggerated. industrial activity sweden continue strengthen. both order intake industrial production indicate recovery way. this also reflect various confidence indicators. with regard consumption, also sign turnaround way; households’ confidence indicator demand banknote coin point direction. retail trade sale stabilise possibly slight upturn begin year. this apply particularly consumption durable goods. low real interest rate expansionary fiscal policy indicate consumption pick up. development price wage leave lot desired, i mention beginning. it mumbo jumbo productivity level around 1.5 per cent inflation target 2 per cent incompatible wage rise 4 per cent. the scope wage rise maximum 3.5 per cent normal profit levels. our assessment wage development come two year around 4 per cent, i.e. level compatible inflation target, unless productivity develop good expected. high wage increase expect one cause behind riksbank’s two interest rate hike march april. however, wage increase differ different sector different professional categories. particularly high wage rise note service industries. in part industry wage white-collar worker increase rapidly blue-collar workers. this, together considerable problem attract qualify personnel certain part public sector, entail risk great wage drift, particularly situation economic activity improved. relative wage change normal element dynamic economy, swedish labour market previously show large relative change often lead compensatory wage drift. some large group wage rise around 5 per cent - apply service industries, construction sector white-collar worker industry - large group receive le 3.5 per cent would necessary achieve inflation target. construction activity next year in line economic activity, construction activity decline slightly last year, although estimate temporary phenomenon. large resource allocate infrastructure measure development third generation mobile telephony, estimate lead increase activity future. there numerous indication residential construction continue increase, albeit low start level. the continue positive development households’ disposable income lead increase new build renovation housing. subsidy build rental apartment blocks, support student accommodation ecological construction also expect stimulate investment housing. see slightly long term perspective, low rate new build insufficient meet demand. a shift age structure probably lead increase house investment percentage gdp. however, even price wage comprise problem industry. the preliminary result show construction worker receive wage increase excess 5 per cent last year, productivity amount 1.4 per cent unemployment among construction worker almost 10 per cent. unemployment construction industry vary geographically, however, rate 3 per cent stockholm 19 per cent in, instance, gävleborg norrbotten regions. relative productivity construction sector appear declining. the gap percentage employ percentage gdp increasing. this mean every person employ construction industry provide decline contribution gdp, relative terms. during 1990s difference increased, recover somewhat recent years. this perhaps partly explain fact still large manual element neither desirable possible eliminate. at time, probable entire industry low degree rationalisation industries. this also visible development price construction service build materials, far industrial products, despite relatively weak demand (oh 3 development price build materials). there 6 bi review 32/2002 something unhealthy industry wage price rise despite relatively weak demand linger unemployment industry whole. let conclude say recover swedish economy way swedish economy good foundation build, surplus public finance sweden’s international trade. inflation hopefully way down. at time, wage formation price behaviour general comprise element uncertainty economic activity begin pick up. personally, i consider indicate possibility interest rate hike necessary future. however, next monetary policy step depends, always, happen analysis make. there always uncertainty tighten monetary policy 0.5 percentage points.

the riksbank bi review 32/2002 1 willem f duisenberg: challenge ecb’s monetary policy speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, upon receive european banker year award behalf govern council ecb, frankfurt, 16 may 2002 * * * introductory remark lady mayor, karl-otto, andrew, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, on behalf govern council european central bank, may i say special honour receive european banker year award 2002. the council, two weeks’ time direct monetary policy three half years, proud recipient prestigious award. since set june 1998, govern council discuss deliberate atmosphere collegiality consensus. the search broadly share resolution within council ensure balance judgement could reach regard true state euro area, cover vast geographical area comprise highly diverse national economies. the council’s consensual approach foster long-term perspective preserve continuity past. seek obtain broad consensus policy decision explain carefully public basis euro-area aggregate evidence threefold effect. it shield govern council member pressure originate home countries; impose discipline monetary policy continuous, multilateral check time consistency policy direction within council; counter public suspicion national bias may inform policy decisions. internal governance essential tool response many challenge confront ecb since early days. at start economic monetary union face extraordinary task conduct policy limit area-wide data, several conventional statistical indicator still construction and, course, euro area undergo major regime shift. moreover, hard press - follow asian russian crisis 1997 1998 - handle difficult unpredictable situation think would spiral downwards. and time attend unique task lay foundation future action, thereby complete work initiate european monetary institute. the ecb guide towards full possession necessary economic detail new unique monetary area economic weight comparable unite states. so must come surprise many birth euro january 1999 go well. indeed, resound success. the transition euro virtually free technical faults. we create almost overnight unify money market, which, despite formidable transaction overload, function smoothly start. short interest rate volatility remain well contained, main refinance operations, along stand facility reserve requirement system average provisions, since guarantee money market development remain closely line ecb’s intentions. the arrival euro banknote coin 1 january year also go smoothly. we supply 300 million people new mean payment sixty day replaced, without technical failure psychological regret, currency serve centuries. exchange old national banknote coin new euro denomination massive operation require enormous technical effort, perfect logistical co-ordination economic wisdom. it success, again, exceed expectation many - perhaps even dreams. from outset, people europe enthusiastic euro quickly adopt new money. key factor behind successful monetary policy but let move main subject today: key institutional factor underlie govern council’s policy. i shall also consider many challenge - addition changeover - face since inception single monetary policy. 2 bi review 32/2002 first, well-designed institutional framework emu key factor set stage successful monetary policy. the treaty establish european union assign ecb unambiguous responsibility maintenance stable scale value agent internalise expectations. and shield monetary policy political interference. price stability diminish investment risk, reduce cost capital lengthen horizon lender borrower wish engage credit arrangements. this multiply opportunity agent exercise entrepreneurial spirits, pursue spread technological advance contribute well-being society large. technological factor agents’ attitude towards consumption, save work combine government thrift legislation determine real basis economic well-being. any attempt central bank change balance real force short run expense stability currency futile self-defeating. today, broad consensus among economist monetary policy suitable tool fine-tune economic developments. any attempt sacrifice medium-term goal price stability effort meet short-term objective ultimately weaken stability currency. to prevent monetary policy disrupt economy, need make keep independent pressure arise short-term political electoral objectives. a second key factor behind successful monetary policy macroeconomic policy framework lay treaty. while preserve value currency primary occupation, treaty recognise ecb operate vacuum. so, create harmonious institutional structure area share responsibility across policy domain carefully avoided, single monetary policy find stand safeguard virtuous principle discipline policy counterparts. the stability growth pact central component structure. the past three decade teach u fiscal laxity, far enhance collective prosperity, make endeavour central bank preserve value money costly painful. the principle underlie pact restrain ultimately reverse appear unrelenting growth public liabilities. this reduce long-term cost borrow make easy task single monetary authority. within framework treaty provision set place implement stability growth pact, national government exchange views, agree general guideline policy recommendations, share frank assessments. for part, ecb accept invitation participate informal dialogue government political actors. this do clear understand purpose share information insights, receive guidance instruction matter monetary policy. the institutional balance upon dialogue rests, adequate balanced, delicate time fragile. we thus take note increase alarm voice call coordinate action monetary fiscal authority become loud authoritative recently. accord voices, ‘policy mix’ improved, monetary fiscal authority agree ‘common standard define general principles’ guide policy conduct time. we note idea concern. if step taken, would undermine independence grant ecb pursue mandate. they would alter incentive economic actor discharge respective duty best ability. they would blur policy responsibility instil perception monetary policy may become subservient need logic political cycle. not least, would, implication, severely damage central bank credibility, turn would cause painful costs, term high interest rates. the exchange information advice, notably across policy domains, explicitly fiscal monetary jurisdictions, never turn reciprocal interference. the success monetary policy fundamentally depend central bank credibility. central bank independence, fundamental principle modern monetary governance, never challenged. a third key factor behind successful monetary policy ecb’s monetary policy strategy communication policy public. the govern council clearly state ecb’s objective framework use guide actions. the govern council also transparent assessment current economic situation risk price stability involved. there ambiguity monetary policy would respond possible change economic environment balance risk price stability. all provide sufficient information policy actor take step deem necessary. at time, policy actor also know ecb react decisions. bi review 32/2002 3 when set ecb, major challenge govern council devise monetary policy strategy. this strategy, announce 1998, new one, specially design euro area. and compare strategy central banks, perhaps complex one. it therefore surprise lead many discussions. in fact, ecb sometimes criticise adopt strategy focus one, two indicators. some observer claim ecb, adopt two-pillar strategy, might eventually downgrade importance reference value broad money growth. in view, would spell danger fall back discretion. other observers, meanwhile, advocate central - virtually all-encompassing - role inflation forecasts. a evident, well advise yield either calls. it would unwise base policy privilege indicator single forecast, exclusion piece information, change world statistical inference elusive guide real-time perception reality. we choose broaden, rather narrow, perspective economy. force decide, choose err, anything, side evidence needed, rather disregard key information; opt inclusive rather exclusive. this choice rule use simple rule internal use external communication. a central bank want mislead public elementary logic two term linear reaction formula, surprise whenever circumstance demand. so observer never succumb easy temptation blame central bank fail obey simple rule. more fundamentally: never lose sight complexity ‘economic story’ behind conduct monetary policy world uncertainty. in interaction public, ecb never depart honest faithful - time seemingly unwieldy - account complex reality. we share public evidence reach govern council ahead policy discussions. we describe detail economic rationale behind policy decisions. those decision explain press conference first meet council every month, monthly bulletin, numerous speech member council testimony european parliament. just listen i say current state economy direction save time effort devote uncover allege secret central bank thinking, individual view member govern council. experience four year how three key factor set stage successful monetary policy impact function govern council ecb’s monetary policy? look back past years, i see mutually reinforce viewpoint two pillar serve balance comprehensive basis analysis prior monetary policy decisions. at time, complex process cross-check information gather two pillar sharpen - rather diminish - awareness change condition economic environment. when confront new development economic environment, govern council never hesitate take resolute, timely action pursue policy stance best serf purpose maintain price stability medium term. regard condition maintain price stability, january 1999, single currency bear environment inflation rate hover around 1%, upper limit range consider consistent price stability. at time, sign risk deflation context depress global economy financial distress follow asian russian crises. we respond cut interest rate 50 basis point april 1999. when, remainder 1999 2000, analysis indicate external shocks, namely sharp rise oil price depreciation euro, increasingly put pressure prices, assessment monetary credit aggregate signal existence generous liquidity condition euro area, raise rate seven occasions. between november 1999 october 2000 interest rate increase total 225 basis point order counteract emergence risk price stability euro area. in early 2001, analysis start signal decline inflationary pressure medium term. but 2001 price development affect surge food cost drive unprecedented health 4 bi review 32/2002 crisis disrupt important segment primary sector. at time, low actual prospective economic growth one factor support outlook inflation rate approach level line definition price stability. it worth note first decision low policy rate take may 2001, is, actual consumer price inflation peak euro area. this clear indication medium-term forward-looking orientation policy. between may november 2001, low policy rate total 150 basis points. in order forestall imbalance may visible evident first sight, rarely catch guard events. on one occasion - terrorist attack unite state 11 september - lose nerve. we react without hesitation move swiftly ensure financial market continue function effectively. by large, claim maintain firm course action day-to-day business, guide monetary policy strategy, shock experience receive timely appropriate monetary policy response. inflation keep control even face substantial adverse shocks. conclude remark in conclusion, i believe institutional precondition stable currency macroeconomic success place europe today. the institutional construct treaty pave way single monetary policy europe last success. the ecb - strategy - successfully implement framework within pursue mandate. and daily execution policy, ecb display firm hand clear sense direction counter inflationary risk emerge. market seem acknowledge achievement. continuous adverse price shock do little shake conviction european statute competence ecb indefinitely effectively contain inflationary deflationary forces. this constantly reflect well-behaved inflation expectations. despite fact recent increase oil price currently tend slow fall hicp inflation, long-term expectation inflation remain 2%. certainly, le entirely satisfy recent price developments. recently publish inflation forecasts, development indicator inflation expectation recent trend wage neither clearly confirm entirely defuse risk entrenchment upward tendency prices. at juncture, therefore particularly important remain vigilant regard evolution key factor determine future price developments. while acknowledge monetary policy cannot affect inflation development short-term, determine put achievement risk. bi review 31/2002 1 koh yong guan: regulatory approach global capital market keynote address mr koh yong guan, manage director monetary authority singapore, ma capital market seminar 2002, singapore, 2 may 2002. * * * ma capital market seminar lady gentleman good morning warm welcome ma capital market seminar. for participant abroad, i wish pleasant reward time singapore. we choose “evolving regulatory approaches” theme underscore importance regulator keep pace development global capital markets. advance technology enable instantaneous seamless access diverse capital markets. at time, consolidation specialist financial institution financial conglomerate cross-border presence redefine traditional notion market boundaries. the consequent growth cross-border transaction pose regulatory challenge national regulator supervise global market players. a see recent months, single event one market create significant ripple effect elsewhere. these development lose regulators. have le 12 country represent today bear testimony importance attach learn fellow regulators. one key reason organise capital market seminar facilitate exchange view share ideas. the occasion also provide opportunity regulator get know one another better. we hope interaction presentation panel discussion provide ample opportunity participant share experience challenge home markets. to provide global perspective, honour distinguish speaker u security exchange commission, uk financial service authority, australian security investment commission. the presentation lead industry practitioner add important market dimension. to start programme morning, let put three broad proposition regulator reconcile with, keep demand global capital markets: (a) first, need cross-jurisdiction regulatory collaboration; (b) second, grow impetus international standards; (c) third, regulator regulation respond facilitate capital markets’ continue innovation growth. the need regulatory collaboration the importance cross-border regulatory cooperation evident cross-border element regulator’s job. local investor buy financial product overseas foreign fund substantial stake locally-listed stocks. capital market intermediary compete vigorously add value, service global orders. even market seek direct presence, form trade terminals, different jurisdictions. increasingly, cross-border operation long conduct predominantly via telephone fax wires, proprietary network capable channel order fund across globe almost instantaneously. such proprietary system combine reach internet pool isolate pocket liquidity single global market. with aid international rat agency global issue managers, corporate entity part raise fund wherever price cheaply available minimal hassle. on demand side, investor recognize importance global liquidity market diversification. by take 2 bi review 31/2002 advantage financial link provide intermediaries, retail investor become empower actively manage global portfolio investments. in environment, single national regulator afford focus activity take place domestic markets. to achieve objective investor protection systemic stability, cross-border regulatory cooperation imperative. the sep 11 incident demonstrate degree financial market interweave illustrate need collaboration. all recall event result closure u market 4 work days, also justify temporary closure several market asia, delay trade hour others. the reality regulator world find ass situation, update one another, decide action take respective markets. systemic risk also increase trend towards commoditisation, ie volume business competitive costs. the concentration volume key node large global custodian represent exposure market participant entity locate jurisdictions. meanwhile, cross-border capital flow significantly increase magnitude market adjust shock evidence asian crisis. the system allow international trade conduct hub also conduit volatility transmit globally. for risk satisfactorily managed, collaboration necessary. regulatory collaboration take many forms. it begin interaction occasion this, represent opportunity compare notes, discus issue exchange views. such informal regular contact discounted. indeed, i understand colleague series telephone conversation e-mail regulatory counterpart elsewhere aftermath sep 11 contribute considerably quick appreciation type, magnitude, issue could expected. this contribute avoidance instability individual markets. look back, agree market stand remarkably well. international meet joint forum iosco step towards set foundation structure line communication amongst regulators. participation iosco taskforces require resource help develop good appreciation characteristic unique markets, alternative approach address regulatory concerns. it recognition ma devote resource active participation iosco’s committee work groups. we also find memorandum understand (“mou”) useful instrument set mutually agree procedure regulator may exchange information provide mutual assistance. since mid-1990s, ma enter number mous ensure level regulatory collaboration keep pace capital market linkage place. a formal arrangement enshrine mou may necessary cases, helpful amongst jurisdiction substantive capital market linkage trade arrangement place. impetus international standard the second proposition grow impetus international standards. in regard, iosco take lead put forward set principle member subscribe to. some principle necessarily pitch broad level, allow member agree key area regulator focus attention. the challenge ahead continue work systematically principle cross-reference quantifiable standards. there several reason international standard important. danger weak link system the first interconnect market mean transaction involve intermediary market different jurisdiction always expose weak link. a example, localise weak link clear custody network use cross-border transaction buckle stress far reach repercussion smooth function counterparties market jurisdictions. bi review 31/2002 3 benchmarking the second reason that, whereas regulation develop local usage, international standard invariably develop close scrutiny different regulators, derive rigorous debate sometimes protract fine-tuning. the end product usually laudable standard serf good yardstick domestic practice benchmarked against. investor protection the third reason common set standard facilitate sound regulatory oversight base consistent treatment cross-border market activities. with regulator use standard assess systems, product practices, market player deal foreign institution instrument take comfort institution product regulate base similar high standards. efficiency & cost save and fourth reason establishment set standard subscribe internationally effect align regulatory practice different jurisdictions. this allow international financial institution operate different market similar feature rule draw accord international standards, benefit low compliance costs. give choice, business proposition point view, fund managers, issuer financial adviser would wish expend resource compliance system keep track different requirement procedure different markets. much work already underway develop international standard specific subjects. within iosco, ma participant various work group include internet project team implementation committee which, name suggests, task implement 30 iosco principle security regulation. apart iosco, number forum also propose recommendation respective areas. these include basle committee’s work set globally accept principle risk-based capital among banks; group 30’s work area standardise otc documentation; collaborative effort bank international settlement iosco recommend standard security settlement systems. indirectly give impetus international best practice imf world bank’s financial sector assessment programme (“fsap”). under initiative, assessor collaborate regulator participate jurisdiction benchmark financial system practice global standards. ma convince effort represent considerable value-add global regulatory environment participate support initiatives. we undertake fsap year. a international financial center, also commit contribute international financial stability member financial stability forum, find involvement various work group invaluable. the establishment international standard best practice way forward become even compel globalisation continues, regulator prepare stay engage process. in so, recognise initiative draw international standard also add value prompt regulator re-examine exist regulation review policy rationale behind them. this useful bring date practice back line international best practices. improvement comply globally accept principle benefit market’s growth long term attract participant strong internal controls. call responsive regulation my third point concern role regulator regulations. market call indeed demand regulation responsive need innovation growth. if globalisation change international outlook markets, blur sectoral boundary transform financial market within. with merger acquisition 1990s financial industry, cross-selling become prominent today bank seek distribute investment insurance product stockbroker offer cash management check accounts. insurance corporation part 4 bi review 31/2002 concentrate effort promote investment-linked policies. the trend part demand-driven customer seek one-stop financial house provide convenient integrate approach money management. notwithstanding global economic downturn check m&a activities, market player let effort gain competitive edge consolidate position alliances. the regulatory response trend towards integrate supervision. this allow regulator supervise range activity efficiently take holistic view financial service market. the uk fsa one example integrate supervision one roof australia’s security investment commission australian prudential regulation authority ambit cut across different industries. a product line converge, regulator set rule careful inadvertently pick choose win models. put another way, similar activity involve identical risk issue regulate equal basis avoid tilt play field. failure result regulatory arbitrage cause activity migrate towards loose controls. in singapore, regulator banking, security insurance activity consolidate mas. specific capital market, integrate legislation security future industries, harmonise regulation financial advisory business support cross-selling products. what critical however, regulatory responsibility divide consolidate one agencies. the override objective equitable treatment consistency approach measurement management risk. capital requirement illustrate clearly. most regulatory model move away set fix minimum capital regulate activities. in bank capital market intermediaries, regulator adopt refine risk base regulatory approach. where risk take similar profile therefore, capital charge align base consistent principle. this even risk management regime banking, security insurance sector retain distinctive feature recognise difference businesses. legislative initiative singapore in singapore, heart regulatory framework capital market security future act (“sfa”) enact september last year. the sfa omnibus act set regulatory framework capital market. it seek cover single rulebook range capital market activity undertake singapore, convenience market participants. the sfa introduce single license regime cover various activity security futures, fund management corporate finance advice modular approach. this shift away fold capital market activity category deal securities, provision investment advice. in place, new license framework design accommodate individual slice capital market value chain. to complement modular license intermediaries, ma announce introduction risk base capital framework take effect late year. under framework, capital market licence holder need maintain capital sufficient business risk undertake, accord respective operations. complement sfa financial advisor act govern provision investment advice sale collective investment product across financial institutions. this include banks, insurance companies, capital market intermediary well independent financial advisers. a common code conduct business practice promulgate fa act, set minimum standard investment advisers. conclusion in concluding, little doubt new financial landscape domestically internationally throw challenge opportunity regulator market player alike. it time change renewal try test mean thing come scrutiny market continually innovate. the challenge u regulator put place regulatory framework operate system flexibly meet market demand innovation dynamism, without compromise safety soundness system. bi review 31/2002 5 i hope give food think spark question discussion next days. it remain encourage make opportunity give voice view course seminar. i doubt much share learn speakers, one another’s experiences. i wish lively useful seminar. thank you. bi review 39/2002 1 niklaus blattner: review swiss economy introductory remark prof dr niklaus blattner, member govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 14 june 2002 * * * gold sale since may 2000, national bank sell gold long require monetary policy purposes. a total 1,300 tonne gold plan dispose agreement gold sale conclude 26 september 1999 fifteen european central banks. this agreement limit total quantity gold sell signatory september 2004 2,000 tonnes. to date, sell almost 520 tonne gold, correspond 40% total quantity earmark sale. a show periodic bank returns, conduct regular sale approximately one tonne day. we consider method flexible, le costly good suit characteristic market strategy choose bank england, hold gold auction own. our average sell price reach usd 279.4 per ounce (level 31 may 2002), usd 2 high average london gold fix price, benchmark price gold. this performance has, degree, realise thank national bank allocate somewhat high portion central banks' total annual quota 400 tonne since september 2001. due bullish gold market, slight increase sale quota favourable effects. translate swiss francs, average sell price settle sfr 15,140 per kilogram. since sale began, price per ounce fluctuate usd 256 usd 330 (see graph). recently, surpass level usd 320 per ounce. such high level record short period recent years, example reaction central bank gold sale agreement september 1999. what strike current gold rally persistent prove far. several factor contribute new trend: • a key factor support high gold price mines' change hedge policy. in order reduce part price risk future production, mine company may engage forward sale gold similar hedge transactions. the commercial banks, turn, act counterparties transaction hedge risk borrow gold central bank resell immediately. this increase amount gold offer directly market. the gold lend central bank flow back lender upon expiration forward contract. if mine company hedge less, gold offer reduce correspondingly. in second half 1990s, gold producer massively expand hedge positions, lead increase supply thus contribute depress gold price. since 2000, especially recent months, picture changed. the mine opt another strategy cut back price hedging. this strategy change partly attribute positive expectation regard gold price. a result central bank agreement gold sales, producer long fear large-scale sale central banks. moreover, seem producer recently become upbeat assessment private investment demand. it interesting, respect, gold producers' hedge activity tend accelerate market trends. when expect price decreases, price fact decrease fast result hedging, expect price rises, price rise fast owe decrease hedging. such strategy changes, always due change market expectations, reckon future well. • revive private investment demand industrialise country also contribute give gold price boost. this phenomenon particularly pronounce japan, europe unite state also see gold demand booming. economic imponderables, concern financial health companies, heighten political tension different part world, terror attack september 2001 concomitantly subdue stock market cause investor increase hold 2 bi review 39/2002 yellow metal. it seem gold is, time being, assume role safe investment. • fabrication demand gold, contrast, jewellery well industrial uses, contract recent months. in industrialise countries, decline mainly bring economic slowdown. the high gold price, however, also play role, especially develop countries. in country india, account quarter gold demand, precious metal hold first place save purposes. investor use le fix portion disposable income purchase gold. in time rise gold prices, investor buy correspondingly le gold. from development draw two conclusions: • in long term, main element influence gold price expectation change private investors' demand, mines' production cost well central banks' fundamental attitude towards gold reserves. • in short medium term, change producers' hedge policy central banks' gold holdings, well speculative demand trigger noticeable shift gold price. these price movements, upward downward, may relatively significant gold market liquid, experience shown. under point view, central bank gold sale agreement september 1999 stabilise effect, since make operation central bank transparent eliminate important source uncertainty. our sale continue complete programme, i.e. sell 1,300 tonne gold. i take risk predict development gold price, one thing certain: remain volatile. our possibility actively hedge gold risk restrict agreement september 1999. in particular, may conduct hedge transaction amount sale quota allocate u current year. we therefore convince strategy regular sale remain appropriate. the principle guide operation past two year – namely fulfilment commitment central bank agreement, transparency communication situation-adapted handle day-to-day business – remain relevant. management free asset the market value free asset portfolio – consist yet unsold portion 1,300 tonne gold proceed already effect gold sale – amount sfr 21 billion end may. the free asset portfolio manage separately reserves, facilitate transfer future beneficiary legal framework put place. a i mention early on, possibility actively

chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 14 june 2002 * * * the national bank decide leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.75% - 1.75%. for time being, three-month libor keep middle target range. since last assessment 21 march 2002, national bank adjust monetary policy. on 2 may 2002, low target range three-month libor 0.5 percentage point current level. some time earlier, 27 march 2002, already low repo rate approximately 10 basis points, lead correspond change three-month libor. in cases, act response appreciation swiss franc, lead undesirable tighten monetary conditions. since march 2001, national bank ease monetary policy substantially, low target range three-month libor total 2.25 percentage points. after cyclical downturn second half last year, sign world economy start pick up, also benefit economic activity switzerland. however, uncertainty regard upswing switzerland persist. for time being, national bank thus maintain expansive monetary policy stance. this jeopardise price stability. assume three-month libor rate remain stable 1.25%, average annual inflation expect hover 0.9% 1.6% next three years. for 2002, national bank still anticipate growth rate around 1%. the difficult situation world economy mark influence development business activity switzerland past months. follow decline third quarter 2001, economy stabilise fourth quarter, first quarter 2002 gross domestic product rise somewhat. notably export capital spend decline period, private government consumption well construction industry exert stabilise influence. on whole, development past six month fulfil expectations. we assume swiss economy grow extremely moderately potential mid-2002. growth likely pick perceptibly second half 2002. consumption remain robust strengthen economic activity. the actual upswing, however, trigger high export these, turn, depend improve economic condition worldwide. with slight time lag, capital spend also expect grow markedly again. a already stated, still believe real economic activity increase around 1% 2002. in 2003, growth continue approach potential, thereby clearly exceed year's level. unemployment unlikely rise much more, production gap gradually disappear course come year. i shall describe development inflation past month explain new inflation forecast detail. the dot green curve graph show inflation forecast december 2001. at time, assume three-month libor rate would remain stable 1.75% accordingly expect slight general rise inflation approximately 1.5% end 2004. the fluctuation inflation predict 2002 reflect basis effects. last december's forecast base assumption u economy european economy would stagnate mid-2002 would gradually return potential growth path. our forecast december 2001 slightly overestimate development inflation first quarter 2002 time slightly underestimate inflation second quarter 2002. the deviation forecast path due mainly development oil price change time collect data clearance sale price clothe shoes. year-on-year inflation, measure national consumer price index, rise 0.6% first quarter 2002 0.4% fourth quarter 2001. in april, inflation increase 1.1%, decline may 0.6%. the distinct rise april largely due yet high oil price high price clothe shoes. at 1.6%, price pressure domestic good still clearly exceed foreign goods. the dash red curve graph show late inflation forecast, table contain correspond average annual inflation. our new forecast rest assumption surprisingly strong first quarter, growth u considerably weak second quarter year. subsequently, however, u economy gradually return potential growth path. 2 bi review 39/2002 in europe, economy stagnate middle year accelerate markedly. we expect dollar/euro rate remain current level oil price around $25 per barrel. on assumption three-month libor rate remain stable 1.25% next three years, inflation average 0.9% 2002, move 1.3% 2003 reach 1.6% 2004. the forecast inflation accelerate time. throughout forecast period, however, remain within range price stability. until mid-2003, forecast inflation considerably influence basis effects, explain various fluctuations. after largely determine monetary policy effects. until begin 2004, new forecast similar forecast december 2001. in new forecast, however, inflation rise rapidly end forecast period barely within range price stability. this difference primarily due even expansionary monetary policy compare last december. with global economy improve swiss business activity pick up, enduringly expansionary monetary policy time lead high inflation rates. we consider current level three-month libor rate appropriate time enable economy return sustainable, inflation-free growth. monetary policy decision-making difficult present circumstances. give strength swiss franc considerably relax monetary policy cut interest rate much european central bank. we aware expansionary policy entail certain risks. yet believe view sluggish development swiss economy strength swiss franc conduct reasonable policy. to adopt restrictive monetary policy would premature present time might jeopardise still fragile economic recovery, notably export sector. we also opinion still sufficient leeway counter increase price pressure good time price stability currently threatened. the national bank must ready will react change world economy. at moment, see mainly two risk might compel u reassess situation adjust monetary policy course. for one thing, economic recovery europe might delay somewhat. for another, swiss franc could come upward pressure. in cases, national bank would react adequate means. to conclude remarks, i would like reiterate role exchange rate play monetary-policy decision-making process. we live system flexible exchange rates. such system advantageous switzerland, exchange rate fluctuation reckon with. we currently go period characterise strong swiss franc. in past, always phase swiss franc tend strong. experience also shown, though, always corrective phase well. it national bank's responsibility maintain price stability medium term, thus create favourable environment development sector economy. for monetary policy, exchange rate extremely important measure, influence price level directly via import price well indirectly via capacity utilisation export sector, thus via economic growth. particularly last nine month exemplify strong influence exchange rate switzerland's monetary policy. we always neutralise tighten monetary conditions, bring appreciation swiss franc, render swiss franc investment le attractive. we aware fact measure provide relief sector economy time extent. the present situation difficult export industry part tourism sector. we forget, however, enterprise rest europe also contend unfavourable conditions. high inflation call massive pay rises, see countries, may cause production cost surge. switzerland industrial location remain attractive. it advantage include low inflation, high social stability, performance-oriented well-trained employees, trade union awareness economic correlations, first-rate public infrastructure administrative system and, last least, low interest rate level favourable finance possibility first-class financial centre. the export industry's situation improve rapidly global economy, particular european economy, start rebound. experience show export industry always everything power increase productivity remain competitive internationally current exchange rate environment. it effort must support strengthen domestic competition switzerland. the export industry remain key engine growth switzerland essential basis prosperity. bi review 39/2002 3 the main tick horizontal axis indicate

susan s bies: bank supervision application develop country speech m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, world bank group's finance forum 2002, chantilly, virginia, 20 june 2002. * * * i please participate finance forum 2002. a former banker current bank supervisor, i would like focus remark process build strong system financial supervision regulation. generally speaking, i believe sound supervisory framework must dynamic must closely mirror reality financial sector created. a such, though best practice industrial country important start point think enhance supervisory frameworks, one also bear mind single framework rarely fit type bank organization bank systems. my comment today include overview evolution bank supervision unite states, discussion fundamental element system, review aspect u.s. experience may provide lesson supervisory development emerge markets. i would like conclude remark discussion basic supervisory issue relate foreign bank organization continue challenge supervisory agency around world. evolution u.s. supervisory system in not-too-distant past, federal reserve supervisory agency unite state rely considerably validate financial account record on-site examination ass safety soundness bank organizations. examiner also spend significant time value account balance perform detail review individual loan risk assets. labor-intensive effort go verify compliance bank laws, regulations, report requirements, test adequacy internal controls. these procedure enable examiner obtain detail assessment bank organization’s financial condition time examination. since examination conduct annually bank business change slowly post world war ii war period, framework provide supervisor reasonable assessment safety soundness bank industry. however, aware, 1990s pace consolidation, expansion, innovation u.s. bank industry begin accelerate, particularly among large institutions. the emergence large, complex bank organization use new financial instruments, particularly derivatives, enable organization change risk profile rapidly. a result, point-in-time evaluation derive transaction validation valuation-oriented bank supervision become insufficient ensure bank organizations, particularly large complex bank organizations, operate safe sound manner. moreover, increase complexity volume financial transaction across large institution begin significantly strain examiner resources. along financial innovation, risk management system bank organization also begin evolve around time advance information technology, significantly reduce cost obtain analyze data increase sophistication risk management models. more sophisticate risk management system give bank institution accurate view risk-adjusted return capital. value-at-risk model adopt measure expect loss give level probability, financial product swap derivative use manage interest-rate risk effectively. on credit side, bank already access considerable information borrowers, sophisticate risk-modeling technique compliment management’s view credit risk. these model include credit score consumer lend kmv model corporate financing, estimate option-based price model information contain stock price probability default. a result, evolution industry 1990s render traditional point-in-time, transaction validation, valuation-based supervisory system inadequate. at time, advancement risk measurement industry allow supervisors, evaluate bank soundness, rely directly information banks’ internal risk management systems. do so, however, 2 bi review 38/2002 necessitate test systems, thus current model risk-focused supervision developed. at core, risk-focused supervision relatively simple concept: supervisor expect concentrate effort ensure financial institution use process necessary identify, measure, monitor, control risk exposures. give risk profile u.s. bank organizations, risk divide six categories: credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, reputational. more time allocate examination plan process, supervisory team ass important risk face organization structure examination activity around assess test adequacy it’s management important risks. thus, application risk-focused supervision unite states, examiner verify adequacy bank organization’s risk management systems, include whether appropriate degree transaction testing. one aspect sound risk management change 1990s importance sound corporate governance. in particular, bank director senior manager responsible see bank effective internal controls, include internal audit function. effective internal control ensure implementation bank policy procedure design limit manage risk otherwise promote sound business practices. for example, internal control procedure give front- back-office responsibility independent unit within corporation reduce ability individual hide loss bank management thereby reduce operate risk. an internal audit function, turn, verify bank’s internal control procedure function intended. therefore, another critical aspect system risk-focused supervision bank examiners’ assessment evaluation bank’s internal control internal audit function. the application risk-focused supervision unite state support strong culture market discipline. the extent content financial disclosure unite state develop markedly past decade collective effort corporate sector government authorities. although recent event illuminate weakness account audit profession unite states, knowledgeable observer believe quality information release firm country continue sound. further, long-standing independence regulatory community unite state foster environment bank expect correct timely fashion case correct deficiency uncover supervisory process. our supervisory system successfully change new risk-focused approach, transition difficult early stages, particularly supervisory staff long career field. examiner time struggle shift evaluate risk risk management system make independent valuation large portion institution’s risk assets. also, examiner misperceive risk-focused supervision mean eliminate even cursory review less-important business line transaction test examination process. in fact, continue struggle issue current approach, particularly since system thoroughly test adverse condition bank sector. it crucial new system remain flexible view rapid evolution bank industry ground core supervisory concepts, maintain adequate control environment--an issue i return end remarks. applicability system develop country i believe basic principle risk-focused supervision relevant supervisory system industrial develop countries. however, i would caution attempt introduce u.s. supervisory model exist country countries, particularly characteristic bank sector differ markedly unite states. even unite states, different approach supervise large, complex bank organization small community banks. first all, u. s. financial system base several fundamental factors. the first well-developed rule law enable regulator administer responsibility effectively. this legal framework also ensure enforceability contracts, remove problem borrower unwilling rather unable repay loans. for example, ability seize collateral borrower default essential bank mitigate risks. a know, difficulty regard contribute bank loss many country around globe. bi review 38/2002 3 the second fundamental element system availability large volume high-quality financial information. for bank corporations, sound system account disclosure provide accurate, timely, complete information need bank properly ass manage risk supervisor ensure institution operate safe sound manner. the third element u.s. supervisory agency operationally independent sufficiently fund carry duties. in addition, supervisory staff must basic understand credit analysis risk management bank organizations. we also know experience connect lend weaken bank system distort incentive bank owner manager manage risk properly. thus, fourth critical element underlie system restriction disclosure lend bank affiliates, shareholders, managers. a similar concern underlie separation bank commerce, something i personal experience i work federal reserve bank st. louis thirty year ago. my responsibility include implementation new regulation one-bank hold companies. for first time one-bank hold company long could bank nonfinancial subsidiary. this separation eliminate temptation bank might evaluate commercial affiliate’s loan application le objectively unaffiliated firm. in country still develop system bank supervision, separation reduce need bank supervisor ensure arm’s-length transaction bank commercial affiliates, thus free scarce supervisory resources. finally, system establish supervise activity for-profit, private-sector, commercial banks, wholly incompatible bank system contain widespread government-directed lending. once responsibility take risk remove bank managers, incentive monitor manage risk greatly diminished. moreover, incentive supervisory authorities, part government structure, criticize lend grant behest government limited. a result, one first step toward implement rigorous supervisory framework must elimination practice bank sector. in absence fundamental elements, application u.s. supervisory system many similar system likely unsuccessful. i encourage colleagues, provide valuable skill resource develop countries, continue focus bulk attention introduce improve critical element infrastructure effective supervision country lack attributes. in addition, i mentioned, one key aspect supervisory approach unite state increase reliance evaluation test banks’ risk management systems. this aspect supervisory approach probably least relevance develop country lack fundamental factor i outlined. the grow sophistication global bank organizations’ internal risk-rating system lead basel committee propose incorporate model calculation capital requirement basel ii capital accord. however, use model calculate capital requirement likely restrict limit subset internationally active bank organizations, give model’s reliance accurate data expense involve develop techniques. a undoubtedly aware, bank country poor data resource constraint unlikely employ high-quality risk management systems. rely system use bank measure safety soundness institution may give supervisor little useful information condition bank sector. instead, supervisory policy procedure create develop country focus risk environment market. for example, information supply bank organization poor audit profession underdeveloped, examiner focus validate account records, value risk assets, verify accuracy financial statements. unite state supervisor play role early evolution bank system. if bank sector engage primarily straightforward credit-extending deposit- take activities, system gear toward intensive credit review transaction test may appropriate. certainly year regulatory report verification large scale transaction test allow supervisory system develop skill assess borrowers’ ability repay, verify adequacy internal controls, recognize signal report information may reflect true condition financial institution. it difficult gauge whether, without experience, could shift effectively current risk management intensive system supervision. 4 bi review 38/2002 another issue receive great deal debate country supervisory system around world whether single regulatory body efficient supervise financial institutions. a aware, u.s. bank supervisory system compose large number regulatory agencies. the federal reserve argue creation single regulatory body outside central bank, give valuable information supervisory process provide u maintain financial-market stability. however, compel argument make regard efficiency create house entire financial supervisory apparatus one roof. in case develop countries, central consideration structure character government itself. in country strong tradition bureaucratic control economic decisionmaking, consolidate regulatory function may prove counterproductive agency would tremendous power check balances. further, consolidation likely large problem supervisory agency independent government functions. current issue face global supervisor finally, i would like discus key issue relate supervision foreign bank organization arise dramatic fashion every years. this issue importance ensure bank organization maintain control foreign affiliate sound independent local management’s influence. history show foreign affiliate particularly vulnerable internal control problems. the failure bar bank loss incur institution daiwa bank and, recently, ally irish bank directly relate failure proper control foreign affiliates. in case loss could avoid ensure bank’s control procedures--for example, segregation duty conduct thorough independent internal audits--were function properly. even risk-focused approach, supervisor must ensure bank management provide adequate control aspect business, even appear relatively minor scope. a number bank organization develop country also difficulty relate inadequate control recent years, particularly bank country weak supervisory oversight. the difficulty create significant loss bank organizations. the lesson case develop country supervision basic control function critical organizations, matter size, bank operate overseas must monitor carefully continuously. relate case broad issue implement rigorous supervisory structure foreign bank organizations. we see market increase competition produce open bank sector foreign institution enhance efficiency. for develop countries, introduction foreign competition likely also introduce transfer skill local bank community. staff train foreign banker often move local institutions, foreign banker involve train local bank staff. for example, people’s republic china, prominent u.s. bank organization provide train staff executive state-owned, local banks--training organization belief benefit business long run increase sophistication market whole. yet perspective home country supervisor, introduce appropriate supervisory apparatus important monitor activity bank enhance host supervisor’s understand global institution supervisory framework home country market. the development clear supervisory framework foreign bank organization improve safety soundness bank sector whole. and addition, supervision foreign bank organization may provide train opportunity host supervisor develop countries, give quality information risk management practice many foreign bank organization operate market. conclusion the increasingly integrate nature financial sector around world increase importance sound bank supervision financial markets. the u.s. experience provide valuable lesson development effective supervision develop countries, lesson must view within institutional context market. the early stage development system may hold important practice develop countries. i wish best important work field greatly enjoy opportunity speak today. bi review 38/2002 1 jaime caruana: presentation bank spain’s annual report speech mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain, govern council bank spain presentation annual report, madrid, 14 june 2002. * * * a year ago i address first presentation annual report, year 2000. at time i highlight importance impend event: introduction euro note coins. this event clearly symbolise culmination monetary union europe, process set train ten year early come fruition background enormous expectation free uncertainty. it fair today start stress success cash changeover, notably smooth despite complexity inherent singular, large-scale radically novel operation. underpin success collaboration sector concerned: household firm and, particular, bank system distribution sector, without whose contribution changeover note coin would simply unviable. the fact far-reaching change find widespread support society ultimately reflect european citizens' acceptance new currency confidence benefit may reap it. with culmination process, euro area consolidate extensive stable monetary zone. this effective instrument increase prosperity european citizen one suit play lead role international monetary system. it also magnet european country whose integration area give great worldwide influence. a dynamic process way area economy flexible best equip physical, technological human capital benefit participation common european venture. to date, spanish economy able draw progressive economic monetary integration europe move towards correct structural imbalances, real convergence core european country pursue increase external openness. in parallel, spain re-geared economic policy towards stability push liberalisation financial, factor product markets. this modernisation openness drive lead substantial change spain's position world economy, include strategic ownership interest certain region invest strongly. undoubtedly, main challenge face spanish economy consolidate position background heighten competition, rapid technological change future european union enlargement. the annual report present today illustrate benefit spanish economy obtain participation economic monetary union, even particular circumstance generalise slowdown world economy, case 2001. the advantage stem price stability, budgetary discipline reform undertake enable phase lacklustre growth overcome without halt progress real convergence. the pattern differ previous cycles, imbalance incubate expansionary phase would inescapably result period recession job destruction. in first part address, i shall give overview world economic development last year discus response euro area economy new international setting, pay particular attention performance spanish economy. in second part, i shall refer matter relate financial stability, bank supervision role banco de españa areas. the world economy the slowdown world economy 2001 short-lived mild expected, despite emergence several adverse shock thought, time, would strongly negative impact. first, correction speculative bubble industry closely relate new technology telecommunications. this prompt substantial decline companies' earn share price stock market, rapid adjustment over-investment build up. next repercussion dear oil price 2000, partly correct 2001 rebound year. further, crisis turkey 2 bi review 38/2002 argentina highlight vulnerability emerge economy certain shortcoming architecture international financial system. and finally, attack 11th september, specific strongly depressive effect confidence. despite build-up adverse effects, world economy prove notably resilient. this strike consider occasion downturn coincide three main area (the unite states, european union japan), priori heighten risk deep prolong decline world output. with exception japan, industrialise country avoid go recession, emerge economies, although see decline growth rates, whole remain buoyant develop countries. the open month 2002 gradually confirm great buoyancy world economy. this clear unite states, also perceptible countries. activity, confidence employment indicator firmed, gdp growth forecast revise upwards. nonetheless, element uncertainty remain place strength time ongoing recovery. these relate essentially persistence certain imbalance u economy (linked mainly shortfall private save high foreign deficit), weakness japanese economy crisis beset certain emerge countries. it worth inquire cause world economy's resilience face shocks. firstly, probably indicative great microeconomic flexibility develop emerge economies. it appear structural reform recent years, aim increase adaptability responsiveness economy adverse effects, begin bear fruit. consequently, crucial reforms, especially time plenty, cost lower, lean time arrive economy spontaneous adjustment mechanism place reduce cost duration crisis. secondly, macroeconomic policy standpoint, recent economic slowdown show importance sufficient fiscal monetary policy leeway able react adverse disturbances, mean turn price public finance perform favourably economic upturns. fortunately, occasion, slowdown find main economy relatively balance inflationary budgetary situation. this conducive monetary policy response (which intense unite states, step sharp reduction pace activity country) operation automatic stabilisers, without jeopardise long-term fundamentals. the notable exception japan. here room additional stimulus demand side owe economic financial problem inherit previous years. and lead economy go recession third time ten years. in industrialise countries, prompt economic policy response largely account mildness slowdown. thirdly, part explanation swift recovery main economy face aforementioned shock lie fact efficient, sound financial system place, propitious smooth work monetary policy transmission mechanism. i return idea late discuss financial stability. in main countries, then, cut intervention rate feed appropriately banks' lend deposit rates, liquidity provide central bank pass credit channel household firms, expenditure decision taken. the exception japan, financial sector's problem prevent pass-through monetary policy stimuli. fourthly, limit knock-on effect turkish argentine crisis emerge countries, contrast similar previous situations, also contribute explain slowdown world economy relatively mild. this phenomenon notable give two relatively large country potentially systemic significance involved. and particularly argentina, big sovereign issuer among emerge countries. the orthodox discipline policy main emerge country reward occasion international financial markets. a dispersion spread testifies, market appear increase ability discriminate country good bad fundamentals. this great ability partly due increase transparency emerge country themselves, result reform recent year include application statistical code standard good practice. it also partly attributable improve risk management investor international financial markets. bi review 38/2002 3 in sum, behind great resilience world economy face adversities, appear positive factor tend increase economies' capacity spontaneous adjustment, responsiveness macroeconomic policy discipline exert international financial markets. hence importance persevere come year along lines, especially bear mind grow economic financial interdependence different country region exposure global shocks. euro area monetary policy the euro area fell prone slowdown affect world economy 2001, although impact euro zone differ areas. the initial idea euro area could sustain growth hold reality. indeed, particular feature area (such notable fall residential investment germany) exacerbate slowdown activity 2001. nonetheless, euro area appear emerge slump relatively satisfactorily, help absence significant imbalance economic policy response contribute shorten recessionary bout temper impact employment. at onset 2001 inflation rise path, influence various essentially temporary factor dear oil prices, crisis meat industry depreciation euro. it trajectory change mid-year, partly follow oil prices, fell 2% december. although inflation stand 2% level throughout year, medium-term inflation expectation broadly converge towards level consistent price stability. this contribute wage moderation, prevent temporary rebound price durable effect inflation. thus, backdrop mark progressive slowdown activity, moderate cost pressure price expectation part agent coincide monetary authority’s targets, inflation outlook improve year unfolded. the monetary policy stance, mark tighten carry 2000 different macroeconomic setting, gradually become accommodative new circumstance several interest rate cut applied, prove conducive economic recovery. i would like underscore two different factor pivotal assessment inflation outlook intensity monetary policy response 2001. the first wage moderation, second reaction economic authority attack 11th september, particularly light sizable rise economic uncertainty immediate deterioration confidence levels. the firm, concert response monetary authority main economic area soften initial impact financial market mean effect world economy relatively short-lived, though sharp, confine specific sectors. broadly, design euro area members' fiscal policy 2001 prevent expansionary discretionary measure adopted. such measure would jeopardise sustainability recent fiscal consolidation achievement and, give lag measure operate, could counter-productive effect cyclical stability economy area. however, available estimate structural budget balance show that, aggregate level, slight deterioration last year result tax cut apply certain country cyclical weaken become apparent. further, fiscal result show that, certain countries, enough room manoeuvre available absorb budgetary effect slowdown without draw close limit set stability growth pact. clearly, case consolidation drive make sufficient attain balance budgetary position. in respect, paramount importance emu member maintain commitment enter pact symmetrically, reflect conclusion barcelona summit. the appropriate response economic policy slowdown 2001 therefore contribute recovery european economy apparently way since begin current year. the intensity duration new phase recovery influence condition factor largely external area, oil prices, sustainability u recovery, give persistence financial imbalances. but, all, sound recovery depend ability european economy underpin growth domestic factor supportive robust investment increase productive capital. 4 bi review 38/2002 the monetary policy stance tailor prospect maintain price stability. particularly important respect (besides oil prices, already hamper reduction inflation first half year) continue wage moderation which, countries, begin questioned. the single market monetary union provide european economy particularly suitable framework develop growth potential consolidate one central pivot world economy. notwithstanding, area still lack sufficient flexibility innovative capacity compete satisfactorily dynamic areas, mainly technologically advance industries. the barcelona summit clearly show ability european authority pinpoint key issue design blueprint reform (of differ ambition equal importance) make europe dynamic economy. while great ambition would conceivably desirable, meet target lay barcelona schedule would entail qualitative change enormous importance. the spanish economy the weaken international economy loss buoyancy european economy contribute 2001 prolong gradual slowdown activity spain train since previous year, first symptom previous lengthy expansionary phase run course discerned. consumption investment construction main underpinnings growth economy, productive investment export chief component dampen it. that said, gdp increase 2.8% 2001, clearly figure 1.5% post euro area. the maintenance high job creation rate 2001, set slow trend mark general development economy, favourable financial condition place contribute sustain household income help underpin consumer spend residential investment. however, decline course investment capital good steepen face heighten uncertainty, worsen expectation slow final demand, generous financial condition unable offset. the effect activity reinforce fall growth rate export early month 2001. in event, trend apparent begin year 2002 (namely great growth economy quarter-on-quarter term something loss steam job creation consumption, accompany check rate decline investment continue sluggishness exports) consistent scenario gradual recovery, fail dispel uncertainty intensity scale. the profile spanish inflation rate 2001 similar euro area whole, albeit maintain positive gap. after rise open months, wake dear food energy product prices, inflation dip appreciably second half year, largely due course oil price international markets. at end 2001 stand 2.7% year-on-year terms. however, initial data 2002 show mark rebound 12-month growth rate consumer price record euro area whole, due partly temporary factor reabsorb come months. of concern u persistence spanish economy inflationary bias reflect inflation gap euro area, especially manifest behaviour unit labour costs. i shall refer risk entail later. the change cyclical pattern spanish economy a i say outset, feature recent slowdown spanish economy show different pattern behaviour follow previous cycles. the factor account change relate condition great macroeconomic stability attain spanish economy convergence towards integration euro area, progress make term structural reforms. these factor bear balance nature upturn second half ninety mildness recent deceleration. the great macroeconomic stability underpinned, known, notable fiscal consolidation drive wage moderation. in upturn, condition provide economy significant expansionary boost, prompt rapid convergence towards real income bi review 38/2002 5 level core european countries, without translate emergence significant macroeconomic imbalances. during recent phase low economic growth, absence imbalance leave expansionary phase continue favourable monetary condition temper intensity adjustment, allow real convergence continue. the presence credible environment price stability fiscal equilibrium necessary condition headway real convergence spanish economy, move phase recovery. consequently, particular attention must pay fiscal policy stance monetary financial conditions. the year 2001 saw attainment balance budget, without slowdown spanish economy prevent strict compliance commitment make stability programme, consistent requirement stability growth pact. last year, moreover, new fiscal discipline measure adopt contribute maintain sound public finance medium term. i refer budgetary stability legislation new regional government finance arrangements, increase degree fiscal co-responsibility regional government transparency requirement demand general government. i already mention monetary financial condition spanish economy generous rest euro area, although significance difference lessen demand lose momentum. the credit aggregate grow high rate third year running. that said, slow year, step cyclical developments, although remain insufficient. the growth finance spanish household corporation translate last year fresh increase sector’s debt percentage gdp, rise lend household house purchase prove particularly notable. the great ease private sector able finance spend decision contribute limit depth ongoing cyclical slowdown, expense incur high debt levels. the increase private debt logical response new set low interest rate spanish economy, also increase exposure sector potential adversities. a expansionary effect process adaptation economy new environment ease off, progress towards real convergence similar rate present require growth underpin stable factors. main challenge face spanish economy this overall positive assessment spanish economy, even recent slowdown, nonetheless conceal presence certain rather unsatisfactory aspects. these include positive gap euro area term price cost growth, flatness investment capital good low productivity gains. to real convergence, problem must overcome. in connection, economic policy action gear primarily promote competitiveness, broad sense term, aspect link behaviour price cost combine others relate growth potential. regard behaviour prices, despite substantial progress make towards nominal stability since mid-nineties, persistence inflation differential euro area pose risk respect future competitiveness. the wage restraint characterise recent phase spanish economy pass unevenly sector expose competition shelter it. in expose sectors, price increase cannot far remove make abroad, whereas shelter sector continuous tendency widen margins, irrespective economy cycle. hence, combination rather inflexible wage structure still-insufficient competition certain service sector lead phenomenon dual inflation, fee inflation gap euro area. another fundamental variable economy's competitiveness productivity, although difficult measure interpret. clearly, lie behind low labour productivity gain recent year beneficial effect employment-promoting policies, raise economy's employment-generating capacity. however, research indicate low gain may also reflect low increase certain component stock capital insufficient incorporation technological progress. 6 bi review 38/2002 the significant mean expand economy's growth potential therefore incorporation worker labour force. this suitable way improve spanish economy’s endowment utilisation productive factors, maintained. but cannot sole avenue. in parallel, investment must bolstered, especially form capital conducive incorporation technical progress innovation. policy supportive flexible efficient corporate environment aim good function economy must also persevere with. the investment new technology recent year already positive influence spanish productivity, although overall effect blur le dynamic behaviour type investment. look ahead, step-up investment technological capital require complementary promotion investment human capital capital good help spread innovation across economy whole. a regard policy aim promote market flexibility efficiency, liberalise momentum reform undertake must carry further. the annual report underscore advisability land market reform, give consequence formation real estate price cost influence labour mobility. it stress need pursue liberalisation competition policy network industry (telecommunications, electricity, transport distribution, etc.), benefit good work spread productive activities. in labour market, persistently high ratio temporary permanent employee alongside high unemployment level (especially among certain groups), labour shortage certain industry regions, highlight need press ahead reform. in particular, incentive effective participation labour market must improved, must decentralisation collective bargaining, good suit condition firm face workers' characteristics. to conclude part address, let stress importance build balance budget obtain 2001 introduce improvement structural aspect general government conduct. public spend must increasingly efficient, contribute increase economy's stock capital productivity. moreover, necessary adjustment make due attention grow demand make public sector result age population (to cover pensions, health, care aged, etc.) lead long run situation jeopardise public finances. financial stability i shall devote second part address financial stability. from perspective, i shall discus main consequence earlier-mentioned shock international financial system undergo last year. i like begin reflection draw crisis experience certain emerge countries. first, let mention importance compatibility exchange rate regime choose country overall economic policy institutional structure. no exchange rate regime can, own, protect economy financial crisis accompany appropriate coherent policies. a second reflection presence adherence legally sound, open stable institutional framework respectful creditors' debtors' right way generate confidence support international financial market way domestic save shortfall may financed. my third reflection consider need clear, credible criterion beforehand distribute cost crises. such criterion strike balance domestic foreign private creditors. coverage shock experience international financial system last year would incomplete without reference set shortcoming highlight so-called enron case, go beyond particular scope company reveal weakness institutional systemic nature. these event significant since show that, even economy sophisticate institutional arrangements, type conduct great destabilise potential may occur. the enron case important quantitative term also, especially, qualitative terms, witness series legally dubious practice go beyond strictly financial field: conflict interest, serious corporate governance shortcomings, bi review 38/2002 7 excessively ad-hoc account practice deviate prudential principle fair view real economic situation, manipulation information, etc. and set inoperativeness internal external control mechanism company. we thus face broad litany serious problem affect many institutional requirement element vital maintain confidence, efficient allocation resources, orderly work financial system effective supervision thereof. i shall return matter later. but let first say that, face above-mentioned multifarious shocks, international financial system show capacity resilience view highly satisfactory. it easy ass factor contribute increasing, extent, resilience. among them, however, mention make following: priority give stability many monetary fiscal authority precede long expansionary phase; improve work integrate good inform international financial market increasingly flexible trade systems; high level solvency, via fund provisions, attain bank previous upturn, make easy soak loss arising; and, finally, advance make many bank risk management, provide good risk identification monitoring, risk diversification reallocation risk towards final investors, increasingly efficient derivative markets. despite resilience international financial system, independent development within system aforementioned event perturb market repercussion bank supervision. these worthy mention. before so, however, i shall offer brief overview financial situation last year spain. spanish bank system inevitably, spanish financial system affect 2001, albeit unevenly, aforementioned shocks. the economic slowdown throughout year translate less rate bank activity previous years, result growth total asset 7.3% consolidate terms. though this, growth rate credit remain high, especially respect mortgage lending, make increase level debt and, turn, saw credit market gain weight relative security markets. the spanish bank system scarcely affect shock discuss earlier, exception argentine crisis, whose repercussion telling. notwithstanding, bank weather storm cause argentine crisis thank appropriate prudent provision policy. although mean reduce earnings, still continue outgrow major international banks. the cyclical turnaround also lead increase bad loans. yet owe relatively strong growth credit, reflect default ratios, hold historical lows. the solvency spanish bank institution bolster last year, break trend see since 1997, although improvement mainly attributable secondary capital. a result, credit institutions' capital adequacy ratio stand three percentage point regulatory minimum, calculate accordance spanish rules, almost five percentage point high accord criterion basel bank supervision committee. a result low rate bank activity, combine impact crisis argentina, consequence full implementation statistical provision unfavourable performance stock markets, growth net attributable earn tax decline 6.9% 2001. although growth one-third post previous year, compare peer country may view satisfactory. this result possible thank favourable contribution traditional business segment spain. reverse trend prior years, net interest margin pick slightly operate expense fell. a consequence foregoing, fall return equity cushioned. spanish bank thus successfully negotiate relatively difficult year. contribute this, undoubtedly, improvement lengthy expansion general risk management, containment cost reinforcement solvency. these improvement build on. regard latter issue, i wish highlight significant stabilise role 8 bi review 38/2002 so-called statistical provision begin play. the provision design promote provision foreseeable loss generate credit risk time risk assumed, when, year later, loss begin emerge, frequently downward track cycle activity low profit loss account weakened. i shall conclude section reference position 2001 spanish security markets. apart decline equity index trade favour fix income, i might mention significant headway make market integration, crystallise creation hold company group exist secondary derivative markets, together security clear settlement systems. this process vertical integration enable unquestionable economy scale scope offer security industry spain harnessed, thereby enhance efficiency strengthen competitive position international stage. bank supervision i shall commence final part address, dedicate bank supervision, summary event last year international spanish financial system. give speed change financial environment, supervision require ongoing effort improve adapt change circumstances. this mean prove equal market innovations, development trends, also involve attentive sensitive change arise demand society make financial system supervisors. accordingly, supervisor test principles, theory procedure reality event financial systems. both within outside spain, last year provide u representative case weakness leave room complacency require fresh think responses. the rest speech deal aspects. let begin note new initiative seek take field may consider isolation. it must part two-dimensional framework. first matter international co-ordination, since market interrelate currently case, stability behaviour system international facet. and second multi-disciplinary dimension, since, reveal welter problem i discuss connection enron case, become increasingly evident bank supervision model may expect efficient rest institutional apparatus underpin rationale market economy function properly. among institutional underpinnings, two which, although affect companies, i consider particular importance work credit institution proper supervision. the first need reinforce market discipline. on basis adequate, reliable update information compile companies, duly verify independent auditor impartially evaluate analyst rat agencies, discipline simultaneously act deterrent penalise imprudent, inappropriate simply mistake behaviour. the second concern strengthen corporate governance. bank supervision cannot replace company director senior manager performance function discharge responsibilities. naturally, then, contribution bank director senior manager essential sounder, stable efficient system attained. achieve appropriate corporate governance standard contribute corporate health, increase market confidence promote efficiency economy general. legislators, supervisor and, all, entity promote sound function company follow key aspects: management transparency; reliability integrity account information; protection shareholders; appropriate treatment conflict interest. also vital accountability board director suitability composition procedural rules; guarantee key decision adopt appropriate collegiate body duly record convey market sufficient transparency; set audit, remuneration appointment committee clear objective ensure effectiveness. to effective, adoption code area support appropriate structure procedures. it also require substantial participation commitment company's director managers. specifically, i like stress importance good corporate bi review 38/2002 9 governance audit committee suitably compose commit non-executive director form majority. a complement good corporate governance structure, credit institution equip sound risk culture. such culture infuse design work organisation management criteria, system methods; found control procedure whose reliability duly tested; application oversee department possess sufficient power independence. all substantiate internal external auditor highly visible market. finally, i would like stress need type financial institution apply due diligence. they know client systematically monitor operation might prevent, necessary curb, money launder fund terrorism also attempt use financial system illegal unethical purposes. beyond obligation individual corporation observe comply law, good practice area important supervisory dimension, play decisive role prevent curb serious risk pertain reputation, legal risk, on. despite unquestionable importance market discipline good corporate governance, complement bank supervision and, therefore, cannot replace respect essential task, namely "to promote sound function stability financial system", stipulate article 7 law autonomy. without exceed term legal mandate, proper compliance requires, i state earlier, bank supervision able adapt change environment. one group change cover aspect financial innovation, concentration internationalisation, i.e. development present system attendant trends. bank supervision must know capture interpret latter, part threefold aim: encourage positive aspects; eliminate, least minimise, process may prove harmful; adapt procedure new circumstances. only way bank supervision, observe full system's underlie rationale initiative agents, able avoid correct, low possible cost, imperfection markets, especially externality may harm third parties. the second le important group change bank supervision must adapt relation demand pose society. i consider two demand particularly significant. the first grow social demand supervision promote sound, stable efficient financial system systems, moreover, govern increasingly strict code conduct give rise practice conduct subject ever-higher standards. among practical consequence demand are, among others, improvement transparency, corporate governance banks’ knowledge clients, i mention earlier. on basis tenets, within framework international co-ordination i refer to, bank system internationalised, interdependent, liberalised, dynamic complex present require increasingly le intrusive incentives-based form regulation, along preventive supervision. to achieve regulation supervision are, national international levels, set aside ever resources. the relevance matter duly reflect work different group international level, address associate accounting, financial regulation corporate governance facets. in eu, may mention action envisage financial service action plan, work group high level group company law experts. and international domain work international account standard board. in spain financial law, currently passage parliament, herald many improvements, one particularly significant bank supervision. this is, namely, possibility consider breach disciplinary rule situation whereby credit institution’s solvency viability jeopardise administrative account shortcoming deficiency internal control procedures, include relate risk management. the methodology know supervision bank activity risk approach, banco de españa working, provide framework suit meet challenge pose spanish bank supervision aforementioned aspects. the banco de españa assign resource complement traditional supervision evaluation forego qualitative 10 bi review 38/2002 aspects, include corporate governance code practice, procedure structures. the result evaluation bear determination institution’s risk profile. let conclude section reference great demand make supervisor society information transparency. the obligation professional secrecy impose supervise national international standard necessary discretion constructive bank supervision must pursue compatible great supervisory transparency. indeed, allow good knowledge, thus control, are, moment time, priority goal supervision, problem faces, procedure resorts, mean assign result measure draw forego element together. in order meet - view - fully legitimate demand, foment knowledge discussion matters, bank supervision report, advance age preparation, shortly released. this complement new publication "estabilidad financiera" ("financial stability") launch september last year. in capacity eurosystem central bank additional function great importance entrusted, continue make progress 2001 along line mark future last year. major change initiate area human resource management technology, directorate bank supervision, internal audit, administration works, note issuance circulation, control account reorganised. in changes, collaboration bank's staff excellent. i thus first thank deputy-governor directors-general support co-operation and, behalf, express profound gratitude bank's staff positive attitude hard work. particular acknowledgment due who, directly indirectly, participate physical introduction euro. without dedication effort, success changeover would possible. finally, let convey gratitude member council invaluable support co-operation. their contribution fundamental ensure collegiate decision-making, add depth quality process. bi review 37/2002 1 bank japan’s june report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 13 june 2002. * * * the bank’s view2 japan’s economy show sign stabilize distinct increase export pick-up production, although domestic private demand remain weak. with regard final demand, business fix investment continue decrease private consumption, despite resilience, remain weak whole. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment downtrend. meanwhile, net export (real export minus real imports) increase markedly due recovery overseas economy also effect restock abroad, mainly it-related goods. industrial production pick up, reflect increase export completion inventory adjustment. the rebound production begin affect employment conditions, albeit marginally, increase overtime work hour new job offer mainly part-time workers. nevertheless, firm still maintain stance reduce personnel expense long term perspective consequence, household income continue decrease noticeably. in sum, employment income condition household overall remain severe. turn outlook, export project continue trend mainly it-related good amid ongoing recovery overseas economies, especially u.s. east asia. however, pace recovery likely become somewhat slow future present, effect overseas restock dissipate. support upturn export also completion inventory adjustment, industrial production expect accelerate momentarily follow gradual uptrend. meanwhile, respect domestic demand, public investment project follow decline trend private demand likely remain weak immediate future. nevertheless, increase export production mention continues, corporate profit recover, particularly manufacture sector, gradually positive impact domestic private demand business fix investment. overall, japan’s economy project stop decline whole since increase export production lead improvement corporate profit turn, domestic private demand. however, consider force restrain economy stem excessive employment debt still persistently work, take positive momentum spread across nonmanufacturing sector, small firm households. the outlook overseas economies, particularly u.s. economy, also accompany various uncertain factors. amid persist fragility uncertainty economy, continue bear mind unstable movement foreign exchange financial market home abroad would easily exert negative influence economy. on price front, import price become almost unchanged continue upward pressure rise crude oil price around early spring offset recent appreciation yen. domestic wholesale price also almost flat since decline machinery price reduction electricity charge offset effect increase import price past progress inventory adjustment. however, consumer price corporate service price continue decline. a condition surround price developments, balance supply demand expect still keep exert downward pressure price amid persistently weak domestic demand while, although progress inventory adjustment support price degree. moreover, factor ongoing technological innovation machinery, deregulation, 1 this report base data information available time bank japan monetary policy meet hold june 11 12, 2002. 2 the bank’s view recent economic financial developments, determine policy board monetary policy meet hold june 11 12 basis monetary policy decisions. 2 bi review 37/2002 streamline distribution channel continue restrain prices. under circumstances, import price likely turn down, domestic wholesale prices, sensitive import prices, edge remain flat little further. on hand, consumer price expect stay decline trend time current gradual pace. this partly slow growth import consumer good expect alleviate downward pressure price extent, fast pace decline wage may possibly reinforce ongoing decline prices, especially service prices. a financial market, short-term money markets, outstanding balance current account bank japan recently move around 15 trillion yen bank continue provide ample liquidity money market. in circumstances, overnight call rate continue move around zero percent. moreover, interest rate term instrument remain steady. yield long-term government bond mainly move range 1.3-1.4 percent recently. yield spread private bond (bank bond corporate bonds) government bond continue contract. however, spread bond low credit rat government bond still remain wide. stock price level whole basically move

perspective speech m kristina persson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, conference sverige kyrkokamerala förening, sundsvall, 11 june 2002. * * * first all, i would like thank invitation participate congress opportunity expound riksbank’s view swedish economy present time. by way introduction, i intend discus role monetary policy general level present riksbank’s view economic situation inflation prospect basis recent executive board meeting, decide leave repo rate unchanged. i shall also describe risk scenario see development beyond forecast horizon. in conclusion, i shall briefly touch issue i personally interest time, namely economic aspect potential swedish membership eurosystem. the role riksbank let first clarify riksbank’s task explain monetary policy decision taken, i.e. monetary policy strategy formulated. the riksbank statutory duty maintain price stability since 1 january 1999. we choose put operational term mean set inflation target. this define stipulate annual inflation rate, measure term consumer price index (cpi), two per cent tolerate deviation plus/minus one percentage point. monetary policy thus conduct keep purchase power krona stable regard basket good buy average swedish household. this mean central wage agreement signed, average wage-earner able fairly sure nominal wage increase entail term purchase power. a predictable rate inflation also serve rudder domestically-oriented company set prices. low stable inflation expectation reduce uncertainty concern real effect borrow save krona household company cost income sweden. this mean resource within economy allocate good way consumer price vary. a monetary policy credibly aim towards inflation target thereby create good condition growth. moreover, monetary policy conduct aid symmetrical inflation target often counter-cyclical function. this mean stimulate effect economy downturn economic activity, inflation rate normally low then, vice versa. that, words, philosophy behind riksbank’s inflation target. the sverige riksbank act also establish riksbank shall autonomous, mean six member executive board, make decision steer interest rates, may seek receive instruction government parliament. the idea thus free maintain price stability tempt concentrate short-term consideration make decisions. it may appear target force riksbank give low priority development real economy. we target monetary policy. however, preparatory work riksbank act state shall “without set aside price stability target, support objective general economic policy aim achieve sustainable growth high level employment”. in event, assessment future path real economy play important role decisions, development economic activity important component determine inflation. however, even important contradiction good growth price stability long term, quite contrary. if look development 1990s, growth 1992 average 3.0 per cent year, despite fact inflation target level several years. unemployment time decline 9 per cent around 4 per cent. this compare 1970s 1980s, inflation approximately 8 per cent growth average 2 per cent. contribute positive development fact 2 bi review 37/2002 good access free resource economy crisis year begin 1990s. an important part riksbank’s monetary policy strategy clarity openness regard base monetary policy decisions. the purpose create support price stability target understand govern interest rate decision among general public. this also reason executive board member often travel round make speeches. openness clarity part contribute stabilise inflation expectation society reduce risk unnecessary tension financial markets. a monetary policy effect time lag, interest rate decision base forecast price development one two year ahead. if forecast show rate high inflation target, interest rate raised, vice versa. in words, instrumental rate adjust total assessment inflation 1-2 year ahead, take account risk scenario, line target. the assessment describe riksbank’s inflation reports, issue 4 time year. a economy time time subject unforeseen shocks, deviation forecasts, even forecast well-founded. if, instance, fruit-growers’ harvest affect insects, price fruit rise, water reservoir filled, electricity price could rise cattle europe suffer various diseases, price meat foodstuff rise. if riksbank try make adjustment type temporary price disturbance, would probably lead large swing monetary policy unnecessary fluctuation demand production. it would therefore wrong give impression inflation always two per cent. on hand, important riksbank adapt instrumental rate inflation forecast one two year ahead line target. this mean company household rely temporary deviation upwards downwards temporary. in retrospect look outwards the attack world trade center pentagon 11 september last year increase uncertainty already weak global economic activity would develop. even then, signal evident slowdown industry poor development stock market cause riksbank make downward revision growth forecasts. the risk terrorist attack would undermine confidence future prospect among household companies, usually negative effect demand. a inflationary pressure vary accord demand change level resource utilisation, event cause riksbank central bank decide low instrumental rate shortly attacks. now almost exactly nine month passed, conclude impact global economy le feared, although sectors, airline industry, hard hit. furthermore, see increase sign economic activity improve usa europe. one factor often contribute turnaround economic activity companies’ stockbuilding. when stock well-filled sale decline, company cut back production become even low demand. this destocking push economic activity begin with. when cutback stock gradually reach end, company increase production without wait demand increase. this give increase strength upturn activity. it probable case right now; accord several indicator production begin increase certain amount optimism begin spread. the total economic policy expansionary many countries, provide additional fuel sequence events. the economic situation usa europe this mean demand sweden’s important export market increasing. the turnaround particularly noticeable usa. there, residential construction household demand uphold economic slowdown stimulation policy. in addition, strong productivity within u industry contribute improve profit margins. however, upturn usa expect fairly modest, mainly household expect increase low level savings. (diagram 1 - save usa). there large bi review 37/2002 3 save imbalance u economy. sooner late adjustment expected. the weaken dollar see recently may indication adjustment process begun. the deficit current account amount 3.9 per cent last year. on top this, households’ wealth form share expect continue develop weakly rapid price increase property expect subside. the u labour market appear likely improve end year, give subdue development real wages. (diagram 2 - unemployment usa, euro area, germany france). at time, risk imbalance save usa adjust rapidly forcefully result u economy may lose speed. if american household sector increase save thereby reduce debt burden rapidly currently predicted, could lead poor development consumption expect stagnate economy. the factor could trigger sequence event include, instance, u share price continue fall decline house prices. on hand, development usa could strong positive spread effect surround world great estimated. a large part sweden’s export euro area economic activity country therefore particularly important us. the improve growth prospect usa contribute recovery europe. however, continue weak development european labour market unexpectedly high inflation rate probably subdue recovery somewhat. germany, important market swedish products, still show weak development. accord lead indicators, european company become optimistic recently. however, profit margin push fact productivity fall productivity falls, labour unit cost rise, turn reduce scope investment. this could explanation recent high inflation rate euro area. when level economic activity rise productivity increases, inflation rate expect subside. in addition, high inflation rate partly explain “secondary” effect early price increase food energy, possibly rounding-off effect introduction euro banknotes. (diagram 3 - inflation euro area) growth prospect good several important swedish export market rest europe. the level activity finnish economy still poor, benefit, like swedish economy, global improvement economic activity. in denmark norway, private consumption stimulate tax reductions. there also sign turnaround industrial activity uk, private consumption continue develop favourably. however, also risk development europe: euro area main cause uncertainty wage developments. high wage increase metalworker germany may spread sector country euro area. there thus possibility rate wage increase inflation euro area high main scenario depict riksbank. the economic situation sweden the inflation report publish time interest rate decision paint mainly bright picture swedish economy near future. the assessment downturn economic activity shallow relatively short-lived. the recovery global market growth, swedish good amount 2-3 per cent year, lead increase swedish exports. over next years, increase expect become 7-8 per cent year. at time, households’ disposable income improving, contribute increase consumption. this year expect increase almost 5 per cent, almost 80 per cent come increase transfer reduce tax charges. an increase income size occur occasion past decades. during 2003 2004 increase expect almost 3 per cent year. it primarily strong development disposable income expect contribute increase consumption come years. consumption durable goods, fridge tv expect increase particular. an expect recovery stock market (albeit modest) slight rise property price factor contribute increase consumption sweden. public consumption sweden also expect grow, approximately 1 per cent year. 4 bi review 37/2002 a whole, industrial activity sweden show several sign improvement, although upturn still proceed fairly slow pace. the recovery fragmented. base industry forestry steel period recovery motor vehicle industry also show improvement. the telecommunication product industry, hand, experience continue deterioration demand. in mid-april ericsson present interim report paint gloomy picture prospect near future company warn redundancies. this development source concern uncertainty. at time, significance one particular sector over-emphasised; employment ericsson correspond approximately one per cent total number employee sweden. in recent times, swedish economy characterise clear division two parts. employment manufacture decline great part 2001 development continue spring 2002. on hand, employment private service sector increase last year, although rise subdue slightly spring. a generally weak demand industry, combine problem structural nature information telecom sector lead considerable cutback employment vacant production capacity within part economy. at time, expansionary economic policy contribute factor sustain demand consumer good services. this explanation employment remain high total level even strengthen somewhat 2001, despite decline economic activity. development spring 2002 indicate slight weaken labour market although growth swedish economy expect recover year, positive effect unemployment probably delay next year. the number job vacancy increase first four month year, number notice redundancy declined. however, unlike last year, many vacancy temporary summer jobs. in addition, number person notify redundancy could rise near future result ericsson’s cutbacks. a problem swedish economy large increase percentage young old member population 2003 2004, limit supply labour. the labour supply also affect regulation unemployment benefit, sickness insurance, etc. formulated. the large number employ person absent work result sickness reason also comprise significant uncertainty factor. it difficult estimate extent people could come back work boost production capacity. (diagram 4 - number employ persons, excl. sick absentees). the public sector expect provide positive contribution growth employment entire forecast period. while employment industry expect increase latter part forecast period. during 2001 wage increase 4.3 per cent, accord preliminary data. it partly due high rate wage increase inflation riksbank’s target level 2001-2002. the wage statistic receive far year indicate continue high rate wage increase, approximately 4 per cent. the design central wage agreement slightly weak labour market situation important factor subdue rate wage increase. the weak growth productivity 2001 fall profit also subdue effect wage developments. during 2003 2004 labour market situation expect gradually improve, could contribute large wage drift. a large part (70 per cent) wage determine local level. at time, inflation expect slightly lower, subdue effect wage agreement signed. on average, wage expect increase 4.1 4.3 per cent respectively 2003 2004. price wage formation influence inflation expectation among different party concerned, therefore comprise important part monetary policy analysis. since march, households’ inflation expectation remain around 2.5 per cent one year ahead national institute economic research’s late economic barometer show companies’ inflation expectation remain le unchanged. (diagram 5 - actual inflation (cpi) well households’ companies’ inflation expectations). in april, inflation measure term cpi amount 2.5 per cent. the effect disturbance supply temporarily contribute high price energy certain foodstuff last year abated, contribute decline inflation rate. in short term, inflation expect continue decline temporary effect disappear inflation measure. (diagram 6 - bi review 37/2002 5 inflation. outcome main scenario). the forecast underlie inflation, measure und1x, 1.9 per cent one year ahead 2.0 per cent two year ahead. however, uncertainty inflation forecast increase recently several reasons. between 2000 2001 gdp growth subdue 3.5 1.2 per cent, time inflation rise 1.4 2.7 per cent annual average. one possible explanation unexpected development production capacity economy increase slow rate last year. the production gap, comprise difference actual potential production, play important role riksbank’s assessment inflation. the basic idea total demand economy exceed production capacity, create price pressure economy lead inflation. potential growth thus production level compatible price stability. production capacity depend factor labour supply, production technology, capital stock, well institution regulatory framework affect way economy functions. these factor also affect development demand economy. the fact gap arise actual potential production could due price production factor slow move fact take time production demand adapt change. a economy affect different type disturbances, potential production capacity level production vary time. disturbance temporary, winter little rain reduce water level reservoir power stations, last - instance, new production technique affect capital stock industrial structure. many disturbance occur affect supply demand economy. accord calculations, present inflation report, production capacity slowdown could decline approximately 3 per cent begin 2000 1 per cent end 2001. at time, important emphasise production capacity cannot measure reliable simple manner, mean type calculation characterise uncertainty. gdp growth sweden estimate amount 1.5 per cent year, 2.7 per cent 2003 2.6 per cent 2004. an important issue whether production capacity increase economy pick up. after all, long-term production capacity determine whether growth compatible low inflation thereby provide sustainable positive development income welfare economy. the important factor regard development near future labour supply productivity. the labour force increase considerably recent years, mainly thank increase employment trade industry. at time, reduction average work hour counteractive effect. the decline average work hour past year partly due economic downturn, overtime fallen. however, also appear structural factors, rise level absence due sickness central agreement short work hours, behind decline. this indicate reduction labour supply could least partly last nature. the decline productivity 2001 limit comparison decline 1977, 1980 1990. great openness towards world around us, high level education 1990s certain improvement competitive pressure indicate productivity continue high 1970s 1980s. however, also presuppose productivity information telecommunication sector return good level. there also risks: inflation rise expect last spring, partly due price increase temporary nature. the rest primarily due wage development service industries. when employment begin rise again, labour market strained, risk new central wage agreement sign come year affect fact others previously receive high wage increases. to summarise: low inflation consolidate central government finance mean room manoeuvre meet economic downturn. last year sweden one large surplus public save eu, enable expansionary fiscal policy. the slowdown 2001 also differ problem period 1970s 1980s manufacture industry’s competitive situation strong start. the weaken krona begin soon one year industrial activity slow contribute strong development net export 2001. nor lack competitiveness decline productivity lay behind depreciation krona - financial flow result decline 6 bi review 37/2002 stock market portfolio investment connect ap pension fund give opportunity invest asset abroad. a recovery swedish economy begin swedish economy good foundation stand on, surplus central government finance sweden’s trade abroad. inflation way down. at time, wage formation price behaviour general comprise uncertainty factor economic activity gradually pick speed. it may therefore necessary implement interest rate hike future. however, next monetary policy stage depends, always, happen regard economic activity, inflation world around us. development beyond forecast horizon the uncertainty forecast increase ahead look, despite interest look beyond two-year forecast horizon main scenario. economic development past decade characterise considerable free resource follow crisis end 1990s. that case today, even le case two years’ time, economic upturn continue expected. this change focus economic policy. a decisive factor economic growth development production capacity, i mention earlier. it production capacity govern development demand compatible price stability. here worry tendencies, i touch upon earlier. the labour supply sweden risk develop le favourably beyond forecast horizon result demographical changes. short work hour would effect. on hand, measure may take increase supply labour thereby affect development opposite direction. this effect could obtain by, instance, low absence due sickness. it clear way labour market function play decisive role economic growth come two year beyond forecast horizon. an important issue sweden near future whether shall take part third stage emu. this decide government parliament, follow referendum question. the timetable decision determine political process. statement by, instance, prime minister göran persson indicate referendum hold early next year. if result “yes”, parliament would decide send application european commission ecb examine whether meet convergence criteria. in connection make decision application, sweden would probably also take position participation erm2. the government say early sweden take part stage three emu, would logical first tie krona exchange rate mechanism. the economic criterion inflation rate, long-term interest rates, exchange rate stability budget balance debt public sector. follow scrutiny, european parliament council europe would give opinion commission’s proposal ecofin council would take decision whether sweden could participate. if sweden accept member eurosystem, would negotiation membership could occur exchange rate krona would fix euro. parliament decide early 1997 sweden keep door open future membership create high possible level readiness action, mean technical practical preparations. the riksbank therefore work internal emu preparation several year now. what would economic consequence membership eurosystem sweden? swedish participation stage three emu essentially political issue executive board riksbank take stand. on hand, early general council riksbank declare favour emu membership two occasions, 1994 1997. so, economic consequence would membership eurosystem sweden? one advantage, opinion, strength stability entail belong large currency area rather small one. fluctuation value currency ought decline, would reduce uncertainty. the evident economic effect emu membership would transaction gain result currency border disappearing. these cost inconvenience bi review 37/2002 7 exchange currency one visit trade different country euro area. another concrete advantage administration cost company force bear safeguard undesirable fluctuation exchange rate would disappear. it probably great significance economy single currency would promote competition advantage consumers, would meet low price thereby money leave purses. when party use currency unit, possible make price comparison countries. competition also facilitate work hold back inflation. the emu particular importance scope trade. many economist try estimate gain look way fix float exchange respectively affect trade, find little difference. however, single currency fix exchange rate. there considerable practical psychological differences. professor andrew k. rise berkeley usa, together economists, instead compare trade within monetary union trade country outside monetary union, make adjustment fact monetary union often share language, culture regulatory frameworks. when professor rise present study sweden time ago, claim emu could increase trade integration much 30-50 per cent course decades. this could lead increase swedish welfare ten per cent long term. rise admit figure uncertain economist believe much low figure trade gains. so disadvantages? give one’s currency entail also give right self-determination economic policy. the instrumental rate would long set stockholm, frankfurt would reflect economic situation large monetary area. the criticism swedish membership eurosystem often concern possibility able conduct independent stabilisation policy circumstances. this base supposition swedish economy could reason become synch economic development euro are, term asymmetric shock. an independent monetary policy currency, addition fiscal policy, give u opportunity stabilise economy - form shock-absorber lose joint monetary policy steer inflation economic prospect throughout entire euro area. this primary reason calmfors commission, examine consequence sweden participation third stage emu, conclude sweden wait join eurosystem swedish labour market wage formation show sufficient flexibility able manage serious shock.1 it often forget one point eu union shall function insurance; country strong stand together stand alone. in practice, also case swedish economy come synch euro area, due shock control, mistake make economic policy. there also many indication covariance sweden euro area increase join eurosystem, trade integration euro country would strengthened. increase trade great openness outside world positive effect development growth incomes. in opinion, european integration emu form part stop border eu, first step towards great global openness. conclusion i today account current monetary policy situation sweden assessment form basis decision last week leave repo rate unchanged. a low inflation rate (2%), target monetary policy, create good growth welfare; rather see fundamental condition ensure party - trade industry, organisations, government parliament - successful work improve sweden’s economy various different means. in words, extensive complicate interplay determine well country’s economic potential realised. the riksbank best ensure monetary policy provide contribution here. thank listening! 1 emu commission enquiry

canada, great halifax partnership, halifax, nova scotia, 11 june 2002. * * * thank invitation speak today. it pleasure come halifax see excite thing happen city province. i’d like congratulate great halifax partnership role community development. you recognize outstanding work community economic growth, innovative approach make partnership model private public sector co-operation. financial market efficiency my remark today concentrate two themes. late on, i want talk bite bank canada’s view economy. but first, i would like address important subject; is, promote efficient operation canada’s financial markets. rather approach topic detailed, technical way, i want speak two quality essential efficient operation: trust transparency. let take minute describe quality important bank. i think provide good illustration quality equally important private sector, particularly light enron, relate question corporate practices. i start quick definition i mean trust. it’s term that’s closely relate two important words: confidence credibility. trust, i use term today, simple belief something someone without support evidence. trust develop group people share understand rule behaviour govern system society work well make thing good everyone. with trust, le effort expend keep tab others, system run efficiently. with trust, people develop confidence others will, fact, say do. and time, trust builds, credibility trustworthy. i tell experience trust important enabler bank canada’s key functions. and nowhere true relevant conduct monetary policy. we work hard past decade build trust policy explicit inflation targets. and effort bolster move towards great transparency. the economic benefit establish trust during 1970s 1980s, bank canada ample experience operate environment canadian significantly le confidence bank’s ability safeguard domestic value currency. inflation choppy unpredictable, bank canada struggle come appropriate anchor monetary policy. however, recent years, canadian gain confidence keep inflation low, stable, predictable, thank system explicit inflation target success meet them. this trust think kind social capital—a share asset benefit everyone, include central bank. this capital valuable must squandered. what efficiency? quite bit. if think back 1970s 1980s, people spend great deal time effort try hedge inflation. resource put productive us spend devise way protect value savings. then, 1991, government canada bank agree system explicit inflation-control targets. a may know, current agreement target 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent band total consumer price index. since adopt inflation-control system consistently successful meet target. a result, inflation expectation fall line target well anchored, near term, well future. 2 bi review 37/2002 with trust place, social capital earned, list economic benefit canada long indeed. le time, energy, money spend protect oneself inflation. labour financial contract lengthened, amount time lose strike lockout dropped. what more, dynamic inflation process changed, point inflation become much stable predictable. inflation expectation le vulnerable swing external value canadian dollar, change key energy prices. all allow bank conduct monetary policy easily. and allow financial market business operate efficiently. of course, economy also undergo number necessary changes, include massive restructure private sector restoration fiscal health. together, change lead good economic performance. transparency support system before i move on, i want say word transparency. like many major central banks, embrace notion good conduct monetary policy people understand central bank think why. the bank canada dramatically increase number opportunity update canadian economic outlook. we use four monetary policy report updates, well eight fix announcement date year, share think economy. we want canadian good grasp goal framework use achieve goals. our explicit inflation target give canadian yardstick measure central bank doing. in view, le flexible yardstick, better. it one thing goal “low inflation” “price stability.” but bank government canada agree much effective explicit target inflation people know meet commitment. so result effort increase transparency give people clear yardstick use measure performance. all enhance bank’s accountability reinforce trust foster inflation targeting. after all, it’s lot easy trust institution open goal strategies, offer clear way measure performance. trust private sector this relevant central bank entire business financial community. trustworthy business standard one important form social capital. trust paramount efficient operation financial markets. and financial market key ingredient well-functioning economy. this trust include confidence player involved—the people run companies, watch them. it also include trust information require make sound investment decision disclose fully accurately. moreover, disclosure must fair—there must confidence insider trade information available everyone. only component trust place healthy, efficient financial market benefit everybody. generally speaking, component place canada. but enron collapse unite state remind u cannot complacent situation. so lose something like enron occurs? skepticism set truthfulness routine financial disclosures. company find expensive raise fund trust broken, few investor will participate, remain demand premium increase risk misled. a lack reliable information also lead investor make poor investment decisions, capital misallocated. in short, financial market operate le efficiently, few benefit everyone. avoid widespread loss trust require systematic coordinate effort fix flaw weakness undermine investor confidence. bi review 37/2002 3 it important set reasonable rules—so chief executives, boards, auditor truly fairly disclose financial position public companies—and invest public rely truth, fairness, completeness disclosure. now, spite specific flaw enron collapse revealed, become clear much public’s confidence efficient operation financial market remain intact. but must continue vigilant. restore confidence financial statement form foundation financial market operate. i already speak way clear yardstick help bank improve transparency. the idea hold true financial statements. clear accurate corporate reporting, together reliable information investors, essential. equally importantly, information must present straightforward manner. earn report use disclose information, bury it. we can’t pretend hundred complicate page lead type disclosure facilitate efficiency. next, confidence must constantly earn corporate manager directors, auditors, analyst investment advisors, rat agency regulators. reputation threaten event like enron, suspicion insider feather nest expense shareholders. obviously, wrong analyst actively share firm use assessment promote firm. but subtle conflict interest don’t involve illegal fraudulent activity—for example, auditor truly independent company audit. risk assessment another issue need attention, particularly company outside financial sector. this involve list financial file thing could go wrong. company need tell investor handle external risk face risk choose take part business strategy. after all, investor require sign form tell broke risk tolerance buy stock. surely then, company issue stock able give investor honest disclosure assessment risk involve investment. the fallout enron prompt debate need tough financial market rules. if determine new rule need written, must picayune regulation simply give unscrupulous roadmap evade spirit rules. it observance spirit well letter regulation must aspire achieve. and unscrupulous market participant practice revealed, authority must come full force. to otherwise market disservice. only strict reprobation restore maintain confidence rule enforced. regulatory supervisory body around globe begin deal fallout enron high-profile bankruptcies. in unite states, financial account standard board look proposal determine so-called “special-purpose entities” consolidate company balance sheets. the security exchange commission propose new rule detail timely corporate disclosure. here home, canadian institute charter accountant (cica) ask account standard oversight council closely monitor account financial report issue raise enron. the cica also look way boost auditor independence. i also aware account profession regulator work develop oversight body promote high-quality audit public companies. the toronto stock exchange make change guideline effective corporate governance. parliamentary committee senate banking, trade commerce committee also launch investigation canadian market post-enron. the market respond we see much self-evaluation market participant recent months. i encourage seriously issue taken. the market enforce discipline. corporate board re-examine role take close look do companies. 4 bi review 37/2002 investor demand great reconciliation pro forma financial statement generally accept account principles. major firms, response demands, change corporate report methods. for example, firm announce plan include, expense, cost executive stock options. and standard poor’s introduce new benchmark report corporate earnings. those change aim accurately describe revenue cost associate companies’ primary businesses. we feel step like helpful advance debate fair accurate method report company’s true financial state. these positive example participant work together enforce spirit—not letter—of rule financial market operate. in end, everyone need trust financial markets—to know right rule place rule enforced. we must continue build social capital, promote efficient operation financial markets, benefit market bring everyone society. the current outlook economy now, i would like say word nova scotia economy. like rest canada, nova scotia’s economy prove strong expect past year. indeed, statistic canada report last week province’s employment rate return all-time high may. nova scotia buoy strong offshore oil gas production last year. the study commission great halifax partnership paint excite picture future impact offshore development. the province also make important stride build sector diversify economy, bode well future. we’ve see tremendous expansion information technology life science sectors. that include commercialize excellent research do nova scotia university foster technology company capitalize province’s telecommunication infrastructure. turn outlook canada whole, economy grow robustly—expanding annual rate 6 per cent first quarter—well expectations. and reflect extraordinary number job create since begin year. employment grow almost quarter million job past five months. canada demonstrate clear economic momentum. consumer spending, particularly interest-sensitive items, continue show strength. business investment long act drag growth, sign begin recovery investment machinery equipment. corporate profit rebounding, continue support business investment. while domestic performance bode well, geopolitical uncertainty weak profit among large multinational firm may inhibit strong rebound investment around world period time. let sum up. canada’s economy grow fast pace, operate high level, anticipated. and mean move towards full production capacity quickly expected. core inflation also run slightly high anticipated, 2.2 per cent april. against backdrop, last week, bank raise target overnight rate 25 basis point 2.50 per cent. this second increase target rate, aim withdraw substantial amount monetary stimulus economy. with domestic economy show strong momentum, bank take whatever action necessary keep inflation near 2 per cent target medium term. and best contribution bank canada make promote strong, sustainable economy canada. 1 eva srejber: sweden european integration speech m eva srejber, deputy governor sverige riksbank, ibc euroforum: nordic banking, stockholm, 3 june 2002. * * * let begin state limit i intend set subject speech: i intend focus financial integration within eu discus company individual benefit advantage create integration field. my start point is, thus, great integration financial area mainly bring advantages, cause seek analyse force behind development. a different public rule regulation play important role development financial sector, also reason discus number question policy nature already agenda strengthen co-operation within eu. this largely matter achieve balance provide scope product development efficiency production financial service europe, create right condition stability predictability financial system. from white paper financial action plan ten year ago, 1992, final date realise common market eu basis programme white paper present european commission 1985. in paper commission describe total almost 300 different directive adopt order realise full mobility goods, services, capital person within european community. twenty-four directive concern financial activities, include liberalisation capital movements. almost directive also come decide within set time period, number favourable condition create bring vigorous competition different eu member states. a lot also happen field contribute strengthen development within eu regard supply demand financial services. the important drive force behind development relate general internationalisation process, new communication technology deregulation part government rule regulations. when euro late introduce single currency twelve eu member states, provide ‘finishing touch’ abolish uncertainty exchange rate development large part europe. at time, disappointment possible create market completely without border type financial activity within eu even quickly, obstacle still remain. these obstacle partly link rule regulation govern financial activity - therefore principle possible influence them. the eu work implement financial service action plan, implement 2005. it include 42 new amend directive bear financial sector. disappear exchange rate risk … it easy conclude dramatic decline interest rate spread country introduce euro, region around 5 0.3 percentage point government bonds. some decline is, course, connect consolidation government finance eu member states, long national currency remained, investor often also demand premium manage exchange rate risk. the remain interest rate spread largely explain different credit rat member state euro area, carry different baggage weight debt previously incurred, well difference liquidity different bond issues. the introduction euro also contribute increase breadth depth european capital market case lead almost complete integration part money market trade closely connect eurosystem’s monetary policy transactions. to sure, quintessence common monetary policy uniform interest rate condition liquidity supply across entire monetary union. this also lead integration deposit markets, i.e. short-term finance without formal collateral. … remain deficiency infrastructure on hand, thing move rather slowly regard integration cross-border money market trade collateral. this difficult equate value different type collateral fall different national legal systems. security trade different country whole make difficult fact infrastructure still adapt make transaction buyer seller different country simply cheaply within individual countries. one cite example obstacle cross-border financial transaction cost make payment one country another. now ec regulation prescribe price make payment euro country high payment within country, underlie infrastructure involve de facto high cost make payment across borders. other example national difference concern provision aim establish good consumer protection, make expensive difficult practice create efficient competition across borders, supplier financial product must adapt market strategy individual country. one might believe internet would break national fragmentation open way demand-based international market traditional bank services, far electronic bank service mainly use national basis. there also numerous example tax system discriminate domestic international financial transactions, course impede customers’ incentive use foreign suppliers, even offer favourable term actual service. integration contribute great welfare despite difficulty move ahead quickly financial integration eu, estimate may extensive enough future make contribution one half per cent gdp annual basis.1 the actual figure perhaps see exact, reason expect unequivocally positive connection financial integration real growth basis development trend observe far. a large market make possible benefit economy scale economy scope. this mean increase economic welfare financial system’s customers, provide sufficient degree competition maintain market efficient system supervision oversight ensure stability system upheld. if, instance, european security fund could operate market condition american ones, could become much large now. accord source above, could entail annual save european fund saver 5 billion euro - close 50 billion kronor!2 more diversify demand a efficient supply also presuppose change demand side. if element national think financial investment reduced, saver would also able benefit broad supply products. at time, essential increase financial exposure towards company financial operator country occur control forms, i.e. high degree transparency regard risk attach them. this particularly important regard financial commitment normally long duration, e.g. investment connection life insurance. there reason believe demand financial service continue drive force behind integration process give basis structural change financial markets. increase corporate finance security one trend undoubtedly reinforced. similarly, households’ save fund probably show rapid increase future, particularly order secure future pensions, call capacity diversify investments, geographical spread particular important aspect. in two latter aspects, however, europe long way behind unite states. one obvious difference u europe bank system play much big role here. this 1 heinemann, f & m jopp (2002): the benefit work european retail market financial services, report european financial service round table. 2 idem. 3 largely historical reasons, also importance continue structural development financial system, since prove much difficult integrate financial institution financial markets. the obvious trend bank system europe consolidation within individual country large units. on hand, bank establish countries, - relatively modest - consolidation occur cross-border merger acquisition general lead radical change market within eu service traditionally offer bank household small companies. within area bank sector still substantial over-capacity eu, seem take time phase out. however, number bank western europe expand eastern europe contribute modernisation bank system former plan economies. internationalisation drive force my point thus far drive force behind development financial sector connect increase international competition increase awareness international opportunities, regulatory system also become international. within legal community constitute eu, financial legislation apply 15 member states, financial service action plan agenda implementation 2005 also affect condition operation financial sector sweden. in addition, single currency create dimension opportunity bring truly integrate financial market country adopt euro, efficient build system use large market within smaller, individual currency areas. in order benefit fully dimension, necessary strengthen incentive make infrastructure efficient, order conduct cross-border trade financial services, e.g. regard payments, clear settlement operator different countries. le detail government rule regulation financial service the political system, power rule regulation financial sector, thus important task regard ensure effective competition maintain reduce uncertainty regard financial transactions. a number initiative also take strengthen financial integration. this involve delicate task prioritise remove obstacle cross-border operation ensure fundamental consumer protection discriminate effect. ten year white paper single market realised, new action plan within eu aim remove remain obstacle borderless trade financial services. this necessarily see failure regard initial ambitions, also result new trend financial system make new demand regulatory systems, welcome political system embraces. and also emerge partially new view purpose government rule regulations, process take time base long tradition fairly detail provision regard transaction allow forbid what. this apply least financial service primarily aim household sector, make difficult continuously adapt financial sector change market condition entail considerable cost consumers. now emphasis ensure produce service clear show offer risk may involve different financial commitments, give customer great scope decide want make arrangements. continue pressure political initiative the eu high ambition make european economy efficient. at summit meet lisbon two year ago head state government adopt strategy aim make eu competitive, knowledge-based economic area world year 2010! financial integration play important role realise strategy. prior recent informal meet finance minister central bank governor eu, take place oviedo spain, work group study condition speed financial integration. this group make review important welfare function financial system refer profit efficient financial sector generate. they also illustrate obstacle remain within eu i mentioned. on basis analysis, group draw conclusion measure public sector could contribute realise political ambition within eu. the finance minister central bank governor eu member state endorse group’s conclusions. they thus emphasise 42 measure financial service action plan must indeed implement member state late 2005, way open market create new obstacle integration. public supervision financial activity need become uniform within eu, enable operator financial activity several country cover similar condition facilitate co-operation national supervisory authorities. competition within financial sector intensified, particular different financial operator afford equal access clear settlement systems. furthermore, exist element tax discrimination identify removed. the position consumer strengthen make easy obtain information financial service wish use. they may also need good support consumer complaint board eu member states, fight rights, needed. general principle regulation in list measure i would personally like draw attention principle regulation necessary financial sector general nature base aspect transparency openness access different markets. this create right condition active competition market force efficiently adapt new trend supply demand financial services. more general principle prudential regulation also improve scope high efficiency supervision financial institution - institution oblige today report many different authorities, well authority follow principle countries. within framework clear rule promote competition, general minimum protection small consumer risk victim event financial failures, e.g. form deposit guarantee normal bank savings, code conduct operator financial market avoid abuse form insider trading, etc. it important maintain high level confidence institution market function way customer expect function. it quite possible combine good general consumer protection flexibility range product could make production efficient. on hand, far-reaching harmonisation detail conduct business rule would probably involve great cost consumer would stand gain completely harmonise services. the principle form basis eu’s regulatory framework financial sector great extent base general orientation. the directive generally establish criterion minimum harmonisation order enable financial operator active throughout entire union. on basis, authorisation supervision principle perform authority within one member state, normally home country institution question. this “licence” conduct financial operation thus recognise authority member state financial institution able operate establishment respective home country. in way, ec directive security market lead minimum harmonisation condition trade financial instruments, e.g. issue prospectus contain insider trade could limited. limitation practice the problem difficult apply model rule regulation fully many different national peculiarity hard away with. this therefore provide scope authority also host country apply supplementary provisions, practice impede cross-border competition. such provision often attribute form general good, hard define - even hard disclose hide protectionist background. another problem legislative work within eu difficult continuously modernise rule regulation adapt new market conditions. the legislator several case one step behind market, mean one hand new product operation may encompass new freedom movement single 5 market, hand protection legislation aim provide undermined. this problem come particular focus last year, regard security market within eu, committee wise men head former emi head alexandre lamfalussy propose simplify procedure entire legislation process. a know, directive adopt council minister european parliament co-decision procedure, complex process even directive include detail provision regulated. a efficient method would limit directive fundamental principle delegate detail design development special committee. furthermore, involve national supervisory authority close legislation process, idea make easy quick adapt rule regulation new market trend behaviour. since lamfalussy group’s proposal touch delicate division responsibility council ministers, european commission european parliament, difficult negotiation need gain acceptance new model, apply proposal directive present recently security market eu. perhaps pitfall ahead work make eu legislation financial service efficient, ambition achieve result field clearly raised. efficiency stability must - - go hand hand so far i talk lot importance efficient financial market effective mean adapt legislation new conditions. however, measure ensure stability financial system least important. an economic policy aim macroeconomic stability fundamental precondition stable financial system. however, sufficient - special measure aim directly financial system also required. regulation ideally work consultation legislator supervisory authority central bank order facilitate different role play authority promote financial stability. i would like emphasise contradiction increase significance financial transaction stable financial systems, provide good opportunity ass realism risk financial commitments. the review capital adequacy rule bank prepare good example overall purpose rule maintain financial stability combine good scope individual bank apply regulation way effective them. a bank enjoin good monitor risks, capital requirement adapt risk exposure achieve de facto, without need detail provision individual cases. this also build system assurance fundamental stability maintain within system without unnecessary encroachment efficiency financial sector. an efficient monitor institution market central able ass risk tension nevertheless arise over-investment finance loan lead financial bubble regulation abused. in particular, regulatory framework make general character, great demand put sufficient resource good competence authority concern order carry monitor well-informed way. here, also necessary interplay central bank supervisory authority implement exist regulation good manner. and integrate financial sector become within eu, large number people potentially affect tension crises, make demand well-oiled channel monitor different country concern different type financial activities. this involve merely good system mutually provide information happen thing go smoothly, also maintain readiness identify problem intervene acute crisis might arise could threaten stability system. it complicate build kind readiness come authority different country different traditions, different principals, responsibility different part financial system, etc., nevertheless extremely important network co-operation field develop further. new requirement co-ordination supervision oversight the basic model financial supervision within eu shall carry national authority is, opinion, natural efficient mean keep watch financial operator markets. however, require supervision operation market affect financial conglomerate also sufficiently co-ordinated. within eu discussion come type authority best suit exercise supervision financial system: central bank overall responsibility safe efficient function payment system, independent financial supervisory authorities, involve monetary policy decision consequence individual institutions. in sweden apply latter model, i consider work well environment. on one hand, risk conflict interest monetary policy decision supervisory decision thereby avoided, hand provide scope coordinate supervision financial operation pursue different institutional forms, e.g. bank insurance, within financial conglomerates. other eu country model also ambition quarter change division responsibilities. in opinion, reason settle particular institutional solution supervisory work; important ensure good function arrangement apply. a large issue might institutional consequence whether sufficient integrate eu rely co-operation co-ordination national authority whether control authority need take leader role require ensure co-operation function well. a discussion recently intensify within eu also involve question type institution case responsible authority european level. here i believe would best wait see build upon path currently political scope realise, namely ensure co-operation exist authority function efficiently. some conclusion financial integration ongoing process throughout world positive welfare effect country accept ensure adapt regulatory framework make possible. international co-operation take place within several body order develop regulatory framework, sweden affect particular legislation within eu. when design rule regulation financial sector, important identify essential element counteract stability problem without make product development efficiency difficult. there distinct advantage focus overall framework legislation without many details, would obscure view hamper continue adaptation. when come implementation rule regulations, co-operation require central bank supervisory authority order enable financial system develop effectively without risk overall stability. a general framework legislation make supervision simpler, instead make great demand competent analysis operational condition financial sector. at riksbank therefore invest develop competence within field responsibility oversight payment system, play central role regard function whole financial sector. svein gjedrem: monetary policy wage growth address mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), general assembly employers’ organisation navo, 11 june 2002. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 22 may previous speeches. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * norway’s economic policy base guideline fiscal monetary policy. the guideline fiscal policy state use petroleum revenue central government budget shall equivalent expect real return government petroleum fund. this mean capital fund utilised. monetary policy orient towards low stable inflation. historically, period high inflation always follow downturn. low stable inflation therefore foster stability economy. establish guideline economic policy new. both fiscal monetary policy subject rules-based framework throughout post-war period, exception last half 1970s first half 1980s. monetary policy clear anchor since 1986. the phase petroleum revenue central government budget shall equivalent expect return petroleum fund. most phase petroleum revenue take place next ten years. with four per cent return petroleum fund, use petroleum revenue rise almost five per cent mainland gdp 2010. the inflation target provide anchor expectation concern future inflation interest rates. the inflation target set 2½ per cent. monetary policy affect economy lag. the current level inflation provide adequate basis determine level interest rate set today. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. two year thus reasonable time horizon achieve inflation target. economic agent act assumption inflation rate 2½ per cent. if appear inflation high 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate increased. if appear inflation low 2½ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate reduced. there symmetry here. it equally important avoid inflation rate low, avoid inflation rate high. the interest rate important monetary policy instrument. it affect price inflation two channels: demand domestic good service krone exchange rate. change labour cost influence rise price domestically produce good services. the tight labour market is, high wage growth be. demand good service determine great extent tight labour market be. high level private public consumption, investment export sustain demand labour. when supply labour limited, competition labour push wages. a tight monetary policy stance high real interest rate curb domestic demand. in many countries, low stable consumer price inflation goal monetary policy. consequently, assume import price inflation remain subdued. however, price inflation nonetheless vary pace global economic developments. the krone exchange rate also play important role determine import prices. a strong krone exchange rate curb price import goods, weak krone exchange rate result high prices. when rise interest rate norway widen differential domestic foreign interest rates, investment nok increase, krone exchange rate rise. price inflation may vary considerably month month. this variation may due random temporary conditions, fluctuation electricity price petrol prices, effect change real taxes. when ass interest rate, disregard effects. statistic norway construct indicator adjust price inflation - cpi-ate - measure use examine result monetary policy performance. a sharp rise labour cost currently fuel brisk growth price good service produce norway. inflation keep bay rise price import good close zero. a strong krone exchange rate, increase trade china eastern european countries, reduction tariff global downturn keep import price low. if krone exchange rate remain today’s level, import price inflation remain subdued. wage growth remain five seven per cent every year since 1998. it appear year’s wage settlement result similar outcome. strong wage growth result tight labour market. the interest rate high norway oecd countries. this direct result considerably high nominal wage growth norway. the phase petroleum revenue increase demand labour public sector enterprise sell good service households. with little slack economy, employment internationally expose sector must decline. a competitiveness deteriorated, manufacture employment scale back waves. competitiveness deteriorate around 10 per cent 1994 2001. if wage norway relative country develop along line last year krone exchange rate remain present level end year, competitiveness deteriorate around seven per cent. growth public spend last year year estimate seven per cent. this considerably strong growth value-added private sector mainland economy, estimate around four per cent. the guideline fiscal policy follow closely. real growth public consumption estimate 1½ per cent. in words, growth production public service moderate, even though public spend rise sharply nominal krone term steep increase cost produce public services. this reflect high wage growth public sector. there also substantial increase transfer household sector connection social security system. a result, strong growth central government allocation translate sharp rise household consumption, growth public service production remain moderate. this expect steep increase public sector allocation economy available resources. employment labour force participation rate high. the labour market tight. unemployment remain low, limit available resources. there slow growth labour force. work hour reduce increase number vacation days. in addition, outflow labour market rise last year result early retirement use disability pensions. strong wage growth generate demand great efficiency private enterprise government agencies. strong wage growth may thereby increase outflow discourage worker various social security pension schemes. all all, expect increase labour force 0.3-0.4 per cent year ahead. wage increase year’s settlement high. wage settlement internationally expose sector set trend wages. wage increase sector around five per cent, appreciably high number shelter industries. this break pattern past years. many enterprise shelter sector can, principle, pas high wage cost customers. monetary policy must reduce possibility pass cost order curb inflation. this do partly keep growth demand good service control. in addition, strong krone may result importation good service previously reserve domestic producers. in rural area towns, local government employment alternative work agriculture, fisheries, local service production small-scale industry, public sector, nationwide agreements, wage trendsetter. wage growth public sector may therefore important source high inflation. in public sector, high labour cost result costly income settlement limit extent pass customers. on hand, rise cost increase pressure raise central government allocations. many probably expect central government pick bill labour cost rise sharply. in business sector - profitability requirement - high labour cost must match increase productivity. in principle, central government impose requirement government agencies. how requirement meet practice decisive impact development central government expenditure and, consequently, interest rate krone exchange rate. urban bäckström: the importance well-functioning stock market remark mr urban bäckström, governor sverige riksbank, world federation investor 20th world congress, stockholm, 7 june 2002. * * * first i want express gratitude invitation attend congress briefly discus importance well-functioning stock market. let start say important network transport, electricity telecommunication function properly, essential that, example, payment transacted, capital save channel profitable investment project household firm get help handle financial uncertainty risk well possibility spread consumption time. financial market constitute important part total infrastructure every economy pass stage domestic production. the financial system perform three main tasks: firstly, handle payments; secondly, channel save investment good return future consumption; thirdly, spread reduce economic risk relation players’ require returns. a smooth function activity facilitate economic growth low cost risk promote production good service well employment. in way financial system contribute increase prosperity. the stock market one important source company raise money. experience teach u price share asset important part dynamic economic growth. rise share prices, instance, tend associate increase business investment vice versa. share price also affect wealth household consumption. therefore, central bank tend keep argus eye development stock market reflect financial system functions. another reason oversight financial stability. today, i would like confine brief remark aspect fact share weigh considerably heavily household portfolio case thirty year ago. what implication trend? increase interest stock market investment in recent decade financial system western country undergo remarkable transformation. one feature development disintermediation. a portion fund involve save finance flow directly financial market instead rout via banks’ traditional lend deposit operations. the general public’s heighten interest invest stock market, either directly mutual funds, important component process. statistic show recent decade share make increasingly large proportion households’ financial asset many countries. thirty year ago sweden, bank deposit liquid asset little risk make almost 60 per cent households’ financial wealth, le 20 per cent today. the major part adjustment financial portfolio go share good deal take form insurance saving. the trend towards form save high risk accentuate new rule insurance companies, permit high proportion shares, although arrange indirectly. similar tendency find industrialise countries. so sweden save move away traditional bank deposits. this positive trend. however, long-term save require ability manage associate risks. stock price fluctuate widely, mark contrast stability bank deposits. this something could affect individual investor household, also economy large scale. therefore, i think it’s important discus risk financial sector general stock market particular. this could even important many newcomer enter stock market. allow quote following: “with pass year, noise level stock market rises. television commentators, financial writers, analysts, market strategist overtalking get investors’ attention. at time, individual investors, immerse chat room message boards, exchange questionable often mislead tips. yet, despite available information, investor find increasingly difficult profit. … stock price skyrocket little reason, plummet quickly, people turn invest children’s education retirement become

pull financial price away trend level. over-reactions occur excessive euphoria drive price unduly high, undue pessimism push far. new theoretical empirical argument put forward notion financial market

soundness efficiency system protection interest depositor investors. before proceed further, i would like touch aspect regulatory framework institute islamic bank industry malaysia. in malaysia, embark concept dual bank islamic bank system operate parallel conventional bank system. in context, islamic bank system comprise islamic bank conventional bank offer islamic bank product services. in regard, main challenge regulator formulate regulatory framework islamic bank line syariah principles. our approach two-fold, firstly adopt exist international regulatory standard comply syariah, secondly develop separate regulatory framework address unique characteristic islamic banking. a far first approach concerned, islamic bank conventional bank islamic window observe similar international standard well prudential supervisory concern basel concordat minimum rwcr 8%, statutory reserve requirement, corporate governance standards, risk management standards, financial disclosure know customer policy. they also subject similar supervision, surveillance monitor central bank. these policy implement efficiently requirements, all, injunction syariah. 2 bi review 35/2002 the second approach refer implementation islamic bank within conventional set-up. bank negara malaysia advocate “bank within bank” concept conventional bank islamic window enable islamic bank division conventional bank provide strategic focus autonomy, maximise synergy economy scale capitalise cost efficiency. these measure would also act firewall ensure strict compliance syariah. to achieve objective, make mandatory conventional bank establish dedicate islamic bank division within bank, create observe minimum islamic bank fund, open separate clear account central bank facilitate effective separation payment system well separate account disclosure. have policy infrastructure place, able operate dual bank system structure systematic manner. lady gentlemen, although regulation place, close oversight update statistical reporting, support close monitor early warn system, necessary measure avoid bank failures. the global experience show bank failure due economic financial crises. the global experience show bank failure cause lack good corporate governance bank institutions. lack transparency, lack oversight, weak internal controls, lack check balances, incompetent director abuse power among element poor corporate governance. hence, even best regulation supervision best financial safety net cannot prevent bank failures. the regulation bank institution therefore need complement reinforce good corporate governance. in context bank industry, corporate governance involve manner business affair individual bank institution govern board director senior management, economic return generate owners, day-to-day run operation business consideration interest recognise stakeholder include depositors; behave safe sound manner, compliance applicable law regulations. in context, transparency conduct bank institutions, facilitate proper account standard reflect true fair value bank operation would lead great accountability responsibility part bank’s management. islam strongly advocate form positive governance. these value ethical conduct already build inherent muslim community. islamic corporate governance serf underlie principle economic well-being ummah, universal brotherhood, justice equitable distribution income. therefore, virtue islam always advocate corporate governance, challenge u lie application. for islamic bank institutions, good corporate governance already embed aspect operations. the issue corporate governance therefore foreign islamic banking. in malaysia, principle corporate governance well document apply across business entities, particularly public list companies. a good corporate governance part islamic values, islamic bank institution need adapt code ethic corporate governance business. in malaysian context, good corporate governance practice apply conventional islamic bank institutions. to enhance standard corporate governance bank sector bank negara malaysia introduce measure include among others, specific guideline code conduct directors, officer employee bank institution guideline directorship prohibition loan directors, staff interest corporations. the main objective guideline engender public confidence bank institution ensure management board director exhibit integrity professionalism run bank institutions. bank institution prohibit extension finance credit facility relate party include director staff well family member interest corporations. such prohibition aim prevent misconduct irregular practice provision finance whilst ensure fair equitable treatment public. these governance universal nature therefore, islamic bank institution would face difficulty adopt values. secondly, objective prevent conflict interest accord responsibility bank institution provide complete accurate information. bank negara malaysia undertake number initiative promote transparency good bank practice islamic bank bi review 35/2002 3 institutions. to achieve objectives, bank negara malaysia adopt all-encompassing approach focus strengthen institutional capacity islamic bank institutions, broaden range financial product service deepen islamic financial market intensify research development effort well create awareness addition strengthen regulatory framework islamic banking. one aspect carry bank negara introduction structure framework determination rate return islamic bank operations. previously, various mode framework disclosure rate return use islamic bank institution has, certain extent, make difficult ass performance islamic bank industry. it also create distortion rate return spread vary significantly among islamic bank institutions. the new framework address issue uniformity bank require observe single framework, thereby reduce potential distortion rate return, generate equitable distribution income, well increase level transparency. on part regulator, provide u good mean assess efficiency islamic bank institution well profitability, prudent management fairness. in dual bank system operate malaysia conventional bank also provide islamic bank facilities, regulator accountable instil confidence public existence firewall conventional islamic funds. since introduction dual bank system malaysia inception islamic bank institution participate islamic bank scheme (ibs banks), bank negara malaysia make mandatory islamic bank operation institution separate conventional bank operations. apart requirement internal separation account books, step take require conventional bank disclose fair true value islamic bank operation form balance sheet profit loss statement part note account principal financial statement conventional banks. this duly reflect different risk unique characteristic inherent islamic bank compare conventional banking. a distinct feature islamic bank vis-à-vis conventional bank requirement set-up syariah advisory council within islamic bank. from perspective corporate governance, establishment syariah advisory council important instil public confidence purity operation islamic bank institutions. the syariah advisory council serf check balance ensure management operation islamic bank institution deviate islamic principle formulation policies. towards end, bank negara malaysia currently draw guideline strengthen exist syariah advisory committee islamic bank institutions. amongst others, guideline outline role responsibility syariah advisory committee islamic bank institution view ensure decision-making process require syariah input undergo necessary thorough rigorous process. lady gentlemen, with establishment islamic financial service board (ifsb), envisage level transparency quality corporate governance islamic bank institution enhanced. the ifsb expect play prominent role promote prudent, transparent robust development islamic financial service industry promulgation international prudential standard consistent syariah principles. we honour malaysia choose ifsb secretariat hope ifsb achieve noble objective effective prudential standard set body islamic financial institutions. lady gentlemen, while significant progress achieve islamic bank remain much undertake regulator well industry true potential realised. this seminar one platform regulator financial institution come together share view experience regulatory issue particularly pertain account standards, financial framework transparency islamic bank operations. i also hope participant would take opportunity acquire much knowledge possible two day invaluable insight present distinguish speakers. on note, i wish successful seminar. thank you. bi review 35/2002 1 masaru hayami: the economy - recent development challenge speech mr masaru hayami, governor bank japan, kisaragi-kai, tokyo, 30 may 2002. * * * introduction there finally positive sign japan’s economy begin stabilize enter new fiscal year. however, ten year experience tell u sustainable growth cannot realize unless growth potential strengthen productivity growth. while economic activity show sign improvement, complacent. rather take advantage favorable development promote structural reform specific measures. such effort doubt augment resilience economy rejuvenate business activity improve consumer confidence. in sense, fiscal year crucial economy order return sustainable stable growth path. today, i would like review recent economic development monetary policy management, follow main issue financial system faces. recent economic development development domestic overseas economy amid synchronous deceleration world economies, japan’s economy continue deteriorate begin last year. yet, pace deterioration recently somewhat moderated, production start pick reflect increase export progress inventory adjustment backdrop recovery overseas economies. the u economy confront contraction phase since around end-2000 retrenchment information-technology (it) sector, tragic event early september increase uncertainty. however, due stabilize force progress inventory adjustment it sector resilient consumer spend well effect monetary fiscal policy stimulus, increase sign recently u economy begin recover. in march, federal reserve board thus revise assessment foreseeable future say “the risk weight mainly toward condition may generate economic weakness” “the risk balanced” respect prospect price stability sustainable economic growth. in response indication u economic recovery, export production east asian economies, highly dependent export us, start increase decline domestic demand near end. european economy also show sign recovery. japan’s economy also bask movement toward recovery overseas economies, evidence increase export east asian country us. inventory adjustment progress many industries, lead gradual recovery production. but yet see unequivocal movement toward recovery domestic demand, play key role sustainable recovery. capital investment continue decline consumer spend remain sluggish cumulative worsen employment income environment. april ‘outlook report’ what outlook japan’s economy? the bank japan released, exactly one month ago, ‘outlook risk assessment economy prices’ - so-called ‘outlook report’ - give standard scenario economy one year ahead entail risk factors. the economic outlook fiscal 2002 early fiscal 2003 describe report summarize follows. first, recovery export production continue, lead improvement corporate profit capital spending, particularly manufacture sector. therefore, 2 bi review 35/2002 standard scenario japan’s economy economy expect stop deteriorate towards latter half fiscal 2002. second, even though might case, take time export production recovery manufacture sector spread economy whole, include non-manufacturing sector, small firms, households. this because, give high level labor’s relative share (wages/value add output), corporate sector continue pursue restructure effort thus persistent pressure employment wage expect remain. consequently, even economy stop deteriorating, autonomous recovery likely gain much momentum. third outlook price development aforementioned prospect economy. indication change also emerge price front recently. the domestic wholesale price index (wpi), represent upstream development price transmission process, level reflect progress inventory adjustment rise oil prices, thereby narrow decline index year-on-year basis. how change affect overall price developments, consumer price index (cpi) particular, deserve deliberate review. a i previously mentioned, however, take time domestic demand exhibit distinct recovery, supply-side factor import low-priced goods, technological advances, deregulation likely remain force push price down. how wage decline affect service price also warrant attention. bear factor mind, likely take long period various price indexes, especially cpi, turn positive year-on-year basis. in relation standard scenario, outlook report identify risk factor might induce deviation upside downside. recently, downside risk trigger overseas economy certainly diminish substantially, undeniable outlook overseas economy still difficult pin down. in particular, sustainability recovery u economy still uncertain give low personal save rate household sector, high level household debt, exist pressure adjust capital stock private sector. a somewhat weak u stock market late might mirror market participants’ lack confidence respect prospect corporate profits. due attention continue require global economic implication development oil price instability emerge economies. in addition, yen depreciate dollar end last year, start appreciate since early spring year. some correction optimistic prospect u economy expectation recovery japan’s economy might factor behind development. careful monitor thus also warrant respect development foreign exchange market international capital flows. domestic factors, include resilience domestic demand, effect disposal non-performing loan (npls) structural reform, well prospect long-term interest rate stock price also deliberately assessed. a detail explanation factor main text outlook report 1. what i would like convey today domestic factor closely related. for example, disposal npls financial institution structural reform economy two side coin, also deeply relate financial market asset price developments. on one hand, long-term interest rate rise absence economic recovery stock land price plunge, would adverse impact management financial institution financial intermediary function, would result hamper smooth pursuit structural reform corporate front. on hand, positively disposal npls structural reform development receive financial market offer key smooth implementation structural reform. the npl problem, structural reform economy, asset price financial market development eventually critical factor decisive influence resilience recovery domestic private demand. firm household reactivate spend investment consumption clear prospect demand recovery follow resolution various structural problem sight, future uncertainty respect employment wage dissolved, stable financial environment place. such think highlight importance structural reform, resource efficiently reallocate growth potential strengthened. a assume standard scenario, economy expect stop deteriorate lead mainly improve export production, still remain various structural adjustment pressures. in words, cyclical factor structural factor lock battle. i address issue. bi review 35/2002 3 business cycle structural problem cyclical recovery structural problem although economy follow daunt road since 1990s burst bubble, period economy expanded. accord government’s official business cycle turn point, two recovery phases: end 1993 also begin 1999. during former, experience temporary standstill due effect stem rapid appreciation yen spring 1995, economy realize 3% growth 1996. in retrospect, economy enter recovery phase trigger monetary ease fiscal expansion burst bubble, follow increase personal consumption capital investment partly support prevalence mobile phone personal computers. the economy rapidly deteriorate latter half 1997 backdrop slowdown overseas economy due asian crisis, increase uncertainty respect domestic financial system, downward pressure fiscal front. the next recovery phase, begin 1999 latter half 2000, still clear memories. against backdrop global boom information technology (it), export play lead role capital investment center it-related industry also increased. however, since adjustment pressure it-related area intensify worldwide domestic consumption, another engine economy, gain momentum, japan’s economy deteriorate enter 2001. what two recovery phase 1990s common although economy start recover autonomous sustainable expansion private demand whole. this principally economy directly hit cyclical slowdown overseas economy also vulnerable shock financial system instability. the fundamental reason vulnerability excess debt, facilities, employment, firm shoulder bubble period, thoroughly resolved, forward-looking business activity might lead increase productivity strengthen competitiveness, appear. this interpret npl problem bank sector completely solved. such problem become increasingly difficult solve economy enter downturn tend get catch vicious circle. our economy see third recovery phase since burst bubble. a i mention previously, recent development interpret cyclical movement trigger progress inventory adjustment worldwide it-related sectors. however, precious lesson derive experience 1990s autonomous sustainable growth domestic private demand never achieve without improvement growth potential. in words, structural reform economy strengthen financial system important anything else order see current cyclical recovery movement develop full-scale economic growth. monetary policy monetary policy past year let turn issue monetary policy management. one year two month pass since bank adopt new monetary policy framework aim ‘quantity’ - outstanding balance current deposit account (reserves) hold bank - main operate target. the past 14 month characterize period economic activity also financial market enormous stress stem factor deterioration economy, tragic event us, increase financial system uncertainty face partial end blanket guarantee respect deposits. amid economic financial developments, bank timely flexibly take monetary ease measure increase target reserve amount. such policy management play substantial role ensure financial system stability, thereby prevent economy deteriorating. 4 bi review 35/2002 condition exert monetary ease effect however, face reality even drastic monetary ease sufficiently effective ignite private demand. to understand point, perhaps useful review actual development financial market real economy. in financial markets, overnight call rate also short-term interest rate extremely low levels. for example, yield one-year short-term government bond le 0.01%, virtually zero interest rate, secondary market. the finance environment le favorable firms. credit spread, difference yield cp corporate bond issue major private firm government bonds, generally widen last autumn center firm low credit rat recently start gradually narrow. although severe finance environment continue small medium-sized firms, would seem deterioration near end. one note development late high growth monetary base show amount money directly provide bank. year-on-year growth monetary base exceed 10% september 2001 around 30% since enter 2002. such recent high growth match runaway inflation period immediately first oil shock. overall, financial condition japan extremely easy. but growth rate economy various price index negative. in words, despite extremely accommodative financial environment, real economic activity rejuvenated. various structural adjustment pressure lie background, summarize viewpoint firms, financial system, household follows. first, part firms, cannot activate business activity capital investment matter easy monetary condition since problem excess debt industrial structure yet solved. second, force lift economy financial side likely emerge since intermediary function financial institution erode backdrop npl problem. third, household cautious increase spend even easy monetary condition uncertainty respect future course public pension social security system. for bank’s monetary ease exert powerful effects, necessary solve problems. once fund demand relate economic expansion emerges, effect current monetary ease materialize eyes. base view, i repeatedly emphasize importance strengthen financial system promote structural reform economy. the bank conduct research branch network discover new approach take firm various regions. accord research, wake deregulation proactive effort firms, nationwide see increase new entry new business area include environment, nurse care, health care. for specific examples, please refer report i recently make council economic fiscal policy 2. to foster new development ensure bear fruit, important promote deregulation decisively, also private firm take advantage new business chance utilize management resource extent possible. now, let move another important issue, is, financial system problem. recent development challenge face financial system current assessment financial system the blanket guarantee time save deposit terminate april year totally terminate deposit april 2003. simply put, world shift perfect protection depositor public sector shoulder burden self-responsibility principle, and, sense, fiscal 2002 turn point japan’s financial system. it ten year since first bankruptcy financial institution resolve deposit insurance april 1992. six year pass since framework government guarantee introduce deposit insurance system, four year pass since framework cover loss establish government. in meantime, deposit fail financial institution fully protected. in addition, various arrangement devise sake financial system bi review 35/2002 5 stability injection public fund financial institution establishment safety net respect security insurance companies. the development arrangement has, course, closely relate various problem associate burst bubble many financial institution force fail. in fact, number financial institution - banks, shinkin banks, credit cooperative - decrease 30% 1,000 ten year ago le 700 present, partly reflect progress integration mergers. in estimation, amount npls dispose financial institutions, sum write-off loan-loss provisioning, reach 80 trillion yen past ten years. this figure suggest financial institution dispose substantial amount, 17% loan hold ten year ago. state differently, npl problem unresolved, japan’s financial system significantly contract term number player volume assets. however, despite painful experience past ten years, yet restore credibility financial system still receive harsh criticism home abroad. financial statement fiscal 2001 in fact, major bank go red show financial statement release last week. such result evidence major bank continue dramatically dispose npls amount operate profits, take positively. however, time, result also remind u severe situation japanese financial institution face. in addition, financial institution enough buff leave due past disposal npls decline stock prices. for them, source revenue use disposal future npls basically operate profit, and, regard, improvement profitability extremely important challenge financial institution urgently need tackle. challenge financial system bear situation mind, i would like summarize challenge system faces. there two challenges. one npl problem. the outstanding balance npls show mark decrease new npls continue emerge high rate. the relate profitability financial institution or, broadly, financial system infrastructure markets. these two challenge mutually relate need tackle simultaneously order restore financial system credibility home abroad regain strength. recent development non-performing loan problem i would like start npl problem. when discuss npl problem, also look borrower side, since claim financial institution debt firms. there various background factor npl problem depend environment surround corporate management. the main factor behind generation npls burst bubble excess debt firm price decline real estate purchased, factor stem structural change industry gradually become dominant recent years. the number firm force undergo drastic restructure expect increase structural reform progresses, concern banks’ loan asset deteriorate process. to make loan small medium-sized firm become important future challenge. in response ‘special inspections’ conduct financial service agency since last year, various measure draw management rehabilitation plan organization change merger take large firm carry large amount debt see noticeable weaken business performance. although careful follow-up necessary respect rehabilitation plans, arguably one step forward viewpoint disposal npls corporate rehabilitation. 6 bi review 35/2002 measure increasingly adopt small medium-sized firm rehabilitation civil rehabilitation law out-of-court procedure base activity newly establish section within individual bank exclusively support rehabilitation client firms. however, whole, small medium-sized firms, especially non-manufacturing sector, face harsh business condition cope situation become big challenge also sake restore credibility financial system. effective capital adequacy ratio take account unrealized gain loss land shares, and, look indicator see actual financial condition borrow firms, find current level firm 30% low bubble period, confirm decline management strength. and, look ratio size firm, effective capital adequacy ratio large firm bubble period, small medium-sized firm decline almost half. particularly noteworthy that, within category small medium-sized firms, non-manufacturing sector distribution, services, construction severe situation manufacture sector. give fact 80% japan’s labor force work small medium-sized firms, npls small medium-sized firm serious problem. thing consider deal small medium-sized firm since management small medium-sized firm varies, actual management condition individual firm carefully grasp consider different aspects. for example, one look indicator use assess large firms, capital adequacy ratio, also financial position owners, business areas, human resources, skills. therefore, financial institution thorough dialogue individual small medium-sized firm case large firm respect financial condition management prospects. in case japan, financial institution extend loan firm whole, know corporate lending, rather individual project us. consequently, viability firm become important factor assess adequacy loan conduct ex-post assessment. since small medium-sized firm limit access direct finance almost exclusively rely fund bank borrowing, careful follow-up individual case become important financial institutions. in regard, already start cases, might meaningful approach process dialogue firm financial institution financial institution disclose credit rat borrow firms, share point concern, together explore way solve them. such approach might contribute put place risk-based loan price financial institutions. at rate, bear mind economic outlook foreseeable future progress structural reform, anticipate that, least time come, risk new npls emerge exist npls deteriorate. in regard, critical financial institution well prepare risk review timely fashion classification borrower collateral conditions, make appropriate provisions. removal non-performing loan balance sheet a matter course, increase provision enough overcome npl problem. base dialogue borrow firms, financial institution need remove npls balance sheet borrow firm likely rehabilitated. the financial service agency release guideline regard disposal npls state newly generate npls dispose within three years, with, principle, 50% dispose within one year remove balance sheet within two years. at time, event financial institution cannot cope firm likely rehabilitated, function resolution collection corporation (rcc) strengthened, establishment investment fund. from now, financial institution request make effort utilize know-how well arrangements. in order rejuvenate economy whole, strong hope concern party make every effort realize rehabilitation firm viable face difficulty due pressure stem structural adjustment. bi review 35/2002 7 treatment insolvent/undercapitalized financial institution a result disposal npls removal balance sheets, insolvent financial institution choice exit market. in cases, non-viable financial institution dispose orderly manner. even case financial institution excess assets, become necessary expand business base improve profitability measure merger likely survive medium- long-term perspective. a previously mentioned, although number financial institution already decrease substantially, integration rule necessary. the government recently announce would consider merger promotion measure i hope implement expeditiously. thorough preparation also need avoid credibility financial system substantially erode system stability question process dispose npls. the idea appropriate measures, include injection public funds, might necessary case i repeatedly advocated. at time, bank, together government measure capital injection, ready discharge responsibility lender last resort provide liquidity deem necessary maintain financial system stability. introduction fix asset impairment account my bottom line think i explain far, i would like consider challenge financial institution management different viewpoint account system, financial system infrastructure, also strengthen profitability financial institutions. the precise amount npls always matter debate, thus various improvement make clarification definition npls also recognition process center introduction self-assessment. however, financial institution precisely grasp detail condition borrowers, imperative balance sheet correctly reflect financial conditions. the improvement account rule quite important task order pursue dialogue financial institution borrow firms. although japan’s account rule recently undergo substantial change of, example, introduction mark-to-market account financial products, still remain challenges, especially introduction fix asset impairment accounting. when profitability fix asset low anticipated, fix asset impairment account rule require firm recognize difference initial plan losses, thereby aim narrow divergence balance sheet actual business condition firms. the business account council release exposure draft april fix asset impairment account rule schedule introduce fiscal 2005. the introduction new account rule impact corporate management, view significance i hope early introduction follow thorough discussion. it go without say account principle also apply financial institutions. because balance sheet regulations, especially capital adequacy requirements, account rule extremely important mean financial institutions. in regard, basle committee bank supervision, international forum bank supervision, consider revise international capital adequacy requirement view implement revise requirement end-2006. the important point revision introduction mechanism recognize deterioration value loan asset early stage require proportional increase capital correspond deterioration risk adhere projects. under current basel capital accord, financial institution require hold 8% capital corporate loans, new accord try estimate probability default accord business condition borrow firm impose require capital base estimates. lead bank western country already adopt practice promptly recognize deterioration value loan asset within credit risk management framework. there still time implementation new basel capital accord, idea bank capital hold cushion risk correspond business condition 8 bi review 35/2002 borrower seem quite reasonable, i believe necessary japan’s financial institution should, regardless existence regulations, actively pursue sophistication risk management. strengthen profitability a far bank management goes, risk-based price important hold capital cover risks. state another way, important secure lend profit margins. in business world, seem quite reasonable financial institution receive interest borrow firm base negotiation risk involved. however, order so, quite important financial institution reach understand borrower pay interest. for example, us, many firm range large firm low credit rat medium-sized firms, widely issue corporate bond obtain funding, resale market loan asset place. yield corporate bond issue secondary market loan credit mutually arbitrage lend rates, thus form environment lender borrower easily agree respect interest rate conditions. improvement term direct access small medium-sized firm capital market expansion secondary market loan credit include npls also important task japan. once secondary market loan credit start function, removal npls balance sheet make efficiently, positive effect improve capital efficiency. and, it important continue improve secondary market loan credit exert steady effort reduce legal cost standardize contract format simplify procedure transfer legal rights. from viewpoint strengthen conviction respect interest rate setting, point credit assessment japanese financial institution put much emphasis judge whether default risk disregard viewpoint probability default interest rate would necessary make loan profitable. in order set interest rate base credit risks, i hope financial institution take forward-looking attitude dialogue customers. from viewpoint improve financial institutions’ profitability, important tasks. to begin with, cost reduction retreat unprofitable business sector fundamental way increase profits, thus financial institution constantly review business drastically pursue measure deem necessary. in addition, go far see entry business sectors, i believe chance develop various financial service substantially increase arrival full-fledged high-tech society. individual financial institution reward use ingenuity make unremitting effort toward improve quality financial services. the issue public finance of course problem cannot solve response financial institution alone existence public financing. the existence institution provide public finance extremely large japan compare country area compete private financial institutions. view aspect set appropriate loan rate cover risks, seem necessary review role government-affiliated financial institutions. structural reform proceed base idea business activity leave private sector full extent possible. conclude remark today, i talk recent economic development financial system problems. with respect economic developments, i explain economy finally start witness cyclical bright signs. on financial system front, i explain that, new environment blanket guarantee deposit schedule terminated, still remain many challenge financial institution tackle. what i want emphasize today’s speech that, economy realize autonomous sustainable growth, complacent cyclical improvement economy seriously tackle resolution npl problem structural reform economy. these important challenge japan’s economy could accomplish 1990s carry 21st century. bi review 35/2002 9 i believe that, government also financial institutions, private firms, every citizen make effort derive enhance growth potential japan’s economy, form foundation renew economic development. the bank japan continue make every effort monetary policy front achieve price stability sustainable economic growth, well discharge responsibility central bank viewpoint financial system stability. bi review 34/2002 1 mervyn

example early seventeenth century plasterwork, show set nine warriors. these know “nine worthies”, describe “high-relief figure niche separate scrolling”, pretty good description mpc. the nine worthy chivalry known, comprise three groups: three honest heathens, three old testament hero three champion christendom. it interest speculate group various member mpc fall, i leave you. but, wait moment, two additional figure frieze. one perseus - presumably minute taker. the describe “so-far unidentified figure, certainly late pastiche”. this must treasury representative. sadly, debate among nine worthies, presumably record minute report sir thomas holte commission frieze, lose posterity. in contrast, debate among mpc publish monthly minute subject much commentary press. i want, evening, pose four question role record mpc. first, give power decide interest rate committee rather individual? second, matter mpc frequently disagree decision? third, committee communicate clearly reason decisions? fourth, mpc require reform? let try answer question turn. 2 bi review 34/2002 1. why give power decide interest rate committee? the academic argument central bank independence well established, delegate monetary policy committee rather individual? in many situation expertise crucial, group expert often regard superior individuals. so one motive could committee make good decisions. the technical nature monthly interest rate decision give natural division responsibility democratically elect government choose target appoint group expert set rate meet target. one dissent voice come sir alec issigonis - inventor mini - said, ‘a camel horse design committee’. despite view, wide range evidence suggest many real-world scenarios, committee often prefer decision-making body. really important people treat team rather single doctor, legal decision reach high level appeal panel judge law lord supreme court, single individual, case referred. decision depend technical knowledge seem, reveal preference, give group rather individuals, set interest rate committee exception. a wide-ranging survey undertake centre central bank study bank england find 79 central bank sample 88 use form committee structure set monetary policy.1 but is, nature, rather little empirical evidence relative merit decision-making individual versus groups. and, even one accept decision delegate technical experts, best way weight together opinion experts? this problem motivate alan blind - former vice-chairman federal reserve board - colleague john morgan princeton adopt different approach: carry two ‘laboratory experiments’ use group princeton student test whether group indeed make decision differently.2 their first experiment purely statistical: subject ask identify one-off change proportion red blue ball electronic urn take place. the second ask participant play simple monetary policy game, set short-term interest rate order minimise loss function describe deviation unemployment inflation desire target levels. the data generate outcome hypothetical economy come two equation macroeconomic model fairly standard kind. again structural change - time “natural” real rate interest - would occur point game, and, observe data generate economy, player would need learn change structure order set appropriate interest rate. all student participate play individual group. in experiment success could measure quantitative scale, lead common conclusion: decision make committee superior individuals. how robust result? and explain it? last year, team bank england attempt exercise much like blind morgan’s monetary policy experiment use sample 200 economics student london school economics.3 use simple macroeconomic model broadly representative uk economy, experiment examine performance group differ individuals. and find strike evidence committee decision superior. in bank study, participant ask play simple, computer based, monetary policy game sixteen times: four round individual policy makers, follow eight round committee five players, finally four round individuals. the committee stage divide two parts: four round committee member allow discus decision - although could observe unattributed vote player - four round discussion permitted. a control learning, order ‘discussion’ ‘no discussion’ set game randomise across committees. 1 fry, m, julius, d, mahadeva, l, roger, s sterne, g (1999),“key issue choice monetary policy framework”, mahadeva, l sterne, g (eds.), monetary framework global context, routledge 2 blinder, a s morgan, j (2000), “are two head good one: experimental analysis group v individual decision making”, nber work paper, no. 7909, september 3 lombardelli, c, proudman, a j talbot, j i (2002), “committees v individuals: experimental analysis monetary policy decision-making”, bank england work paper (forthcoming) bi review 34/2002 3 each game consist ten period play individual committee decide interest rate set response data output inflation generate previous period. in committee stages, majority - precisely median - vote implement committee member enter vote respective computers. participant tell nothing start experiment structure economic model playing, disturbance subject to, structural change occur point play game. in short, operate - much like real-life monetary policy maker - uncertain conditions, best identify shock hit economy offset impact adjust short-term interest rate. to quantify performance, player score accord ability keep inflation close pre-specified target minimise output fluctuations, pay modest amount so. chart 1 show pattern average score different stage game. three feature striking: (i) the significant upward trend results. player clearly learn play game time go on. (ii) the large upward movement score player move committee decision-making. (iii) the large downward move score participant return play individuals. these result support idea committee decision represent significant improvement individual comprise them. what might account results? the blind morgan bank study suggest two main reasons. first, collective decision-making appear give weight good le weight bad committee members, judge score play game individuals, would imply take mean individual performance. the best player influence decision group member. and impact bad player offset majority voting. in words, median score player individual round significantly mean, imply average pull minority relatively bad players. second, also evidence experiment consistent hypothesis committee enable member improve performance share information learn other. and strike performance committee average somewhat good performance single best player committee play alone. so term group decisions, appear whole different - generally good - sum parts. produce perfect design committee structure would make best decision task simple answer. but mpc embody several feature seem desirable. first, clear objective give committee outside, case government. second, member choose technical ability. third, vote mpc transparent, hence member hold accountable. the merit individual accountability individual group genuine incentive reach good decision. this aspect lead u directly second question. 2. second, matter difference view among committee members? from outset, commentator unable resist label member committee either ‘hawks’ ‘doves’. i argue make sense use description member committee objective. member mpc cannot entertain closet view desire inflation rate hold personally accountable judgment level interest rate necessary meet mandate inflation target. a circumstance change, easy imagine ‘hawks’ shall ‘doves’ ‘doves’ shall ‘hawks’. but say difference opinion not, not, exist amongst committee members. if part reason improvement group individual pool knowledge, difference opinion discussion take place mpc meet central committee’s performance. a the economist put back 1998 (when eight serve members):4 4 economist, 18 april 1998, p. 28. 4 bi review 34/2002 ‘with economy turn, mpc sift mix evidence… it would remarkable eight intelligent, well-briefed economist could one mind.’ but point always readily understood, even astute commentators. in july 1998 financial time suggested: ‘…the mpc bear close resemblance post-graduate seminar forum strategic decision making… to put [several] economist room invite one commentator call paralysis analysis.’ and month, the time describe mpc ‘a committee burst brim individual opinions’ imply ‘periods badly coordinate erratic behaviour expected’. but precisely exploration alternative view happen british economy, discussion view committee spirit investigation advocacy, central pool knowledge committee reach decision superior take individuals. i think increasingly understand commentators, help explain split vote regard normal source great excitement. it is, nevertheless, important ideological difference among committee member would make rational debate difficult, and, respect, committee far fortunate. a famous 1970s laboratory experiment also show value frank exchange view within committee.5 it feature group senior manager work together solve complicate problem game call ‘lost moon’. subject ask rank list object order necessity survival spaceship inadvertently crash-landed moon. it find best-performing group - get close rank suggest expert nasa - least consensual early stage discussion, explore possible avenue ideas. group establish common consensus quickly often ineffective, suggest least disagreement beneficial committee performance stimulate discussion hard thinking. difference view committee honest reflection uncertainty data structure economy. to date 61 meet monetary policy committee. the vote cast meet summarise table 1. it include vote month’s meet publish morning. at 61 meetings, interest rate raise nine occasions, low 14 occasions, leave unchanged 38. at first seven meet 1997, decision reach unanimously. the number vote member vary five eight membership committee build up. the first dissent vote cast january 1998. since begin 1998, vote divide reasonably evenly among possible combination vote (remember nine vote member june 1998 follow passage bank england act.) of 54 meet since january 1998, four dissent vote cast six occasions, three seven occasions, two eleven occasion one 16 occasions. at 14 meet vote unanimous, one - sensibly - see fit abstain, past five year frequency unanimity among committee little one four. difference view become accept norm, appear do little damage credibility committee. nor much sign “blocs” votes, whether internal external. there 15 occasion member executive bank opposite side vote, 37 occasion external find divided. it true say dissent vote common among external executive members. of 83 dissent vote cast history mpc, 25 cast executive member 58 external members. but 58, few 44 account three eight external members, willem buiter, deanne julius sushil wadhwani. for remain five external members, propensity minority similar bank executive (excluding governor), dissent proportion total vote 12% 11% respectively. moreover difference vote small. on four occasion difference high low interest rate vote exceed 25 basis points, and, interestingly, four august 1998 april 1999, period great uncertainty whether would downturn world economy fact materialise. since difference view 5 hall (1971), “decisions, decisions, decisions”, psychology today, november. bi review 34/2002 5 never exceed 25 basis points. the average difference interest rate cast member vote high average level rate member vote low average level rate le 15 basis points! such small difference hardly correspond major difference view outlook inflation. 3. third, committee explain clearly reason decisions? transparency centre monetary policy framework since 1992 recognise clear explanation policy would help anchor inflation expectation target. the first major step enhance transparency bank’s inflation report, first appear february 1993, subsequently enhance publication minute meet chancellor governor. that transparency give boost creation monetary policy committee vote member publish along minute discussion mpc meetings. despite record transparency, question raise whether mpc could go further. do publish minute reveal enough individual views? should individual paragraph minute explain position member? why committee publish forecast correspond path interest rate feel likely necessary meet inflation target? why central projection forecast always seem end close target 2.5%? it helpful step back ask three fundamental questions. first, mpc try communicate? second, communicate? third, role inflation forecast? the basic message mpc try communicate that, medium term, inflation expect average 2.5%, committee respond event unfold order keep inflation track meet target. hence committee need explain view current state economy, react event already unfolded, belief risk lie ahead. all encapsulate “policy reaction function”. commentator others may form view likelihood various economic shock occurring, respect important committee explain policy reaction function attempt provide guidance likely future path interest rates. and bank canada try anticipate likely future path monetary conditions, find that, despite clear explanation future could easily anticipated, market take anticipation commitments, surprise unforeseen event result different policy outcomes. in contrast, mpc attempt anticipate decisions. in addition explain committee’s view economy, balance risk inflation, second important role communication. that explain view nine individual member committee hold accountable judgments. there is, therefore, inherent tension system nine individually accountable members, associate views, committee single decision emerge require clear explanation month. the former produces, i argued, good decisions; latter important predictability thus efficiency monetary policy. the communication strategy mpc must provide balance two objectives, point acknowledge report don kohn procedure mpc. the need achieve balance lead directly question committee communicate thoughts. the minute mpc meetings, release 13 day decision itself, provide detail explanation issue confront committee argument make meeting. they also contain vote individual members. the committee discussed, rejected, proposition minute contain individual paragraph summarise view member turn. the reason procedure would alter nature meet quite radically. at present, free-flowing discussion member discus proposition counter proposition spirit mutual enquiry rather exchange fix conflict views. discussion focus relative merit different possible explanation current state economy. if member face deadline produce polish paragraph summarise views, member would enter meet paragraph draft form spontaneity discussion would lost. 6 bi review 34/2002 for reason, clear publication transcript meet enhance transparency. the federal reserve provide useful case study. prior 1994, member fomc largely unaware monetary policy discussion transcribe verbatim audio record meetings. congress learn availability transcript shortly this, february 1995, insist publish five-year lag. once committee member become aware meet recorded, structure discussion appear change. before 1995 meet begin prepare speech follow free-flowing debate characterise frank exchange ideas. but 1995, appear much great tendency meet become exchange prepare statements, colour previous discussion may lost. explanation decision form press statement issue time announcement decision interest rate become le frequent. but principally few interest rate change recently. in first three years, committee move rate 16 time issue press statement 14 occasions. it also issue two statement move rates. over past two year committee change rate seven times, accompany six statements, statement rate leave unchanged. the purpose press statement explain decision reached, definition majority committee. because brief cannot justice richness discussion committee, balance view represented. hence committee come view that, large, good wait publication minute full view issue view provided. that say press statement appear future, stress purpose limit explain decision might unexpected, irrespective whether change change rates. on whole, minute successful create wide understand issue discuss mpc, devoted, small, following. the inflation report, pre-dates mpc, broad objective set comprehensive view current state economy, describe outlook inflation term forecast two-year horizon. the committee put great weight explain forecast term probabilities. hence adopt famous colour fan chart forecast growth inflation. but remain confusion role forecast. with advent mpc, tension explain nine individual view present coherent account committee’s view economy complicate production forecast. the inflation report contain explicit description difference view among committee respect central projection risk forecast, well “best collective judgment”, majority view, outlook. but main focus inflation report present collective view. to publish nine individual fan chart would hardly increase transparency, difference judgment date sufficiently small would difficult commentator observe significant difference among charts. this tension need explain diversity members’ views, need provide clear rationale single decision, suggest committee may need explore way put across collective view. it clear benefit cost group decision-making process. the transparency accountability individual view help make good decisions. but also complicate communication decision wide audience, whose expectation inflation matter economic behaviour. the avoidance confusion require forbearance individual member committee, clear understand form communication appropriate explain individual view form suitable explain reason collective decision. i sure committee learn best achieve balance time go by. 4. fourth, mpc require reform? despite youth, least central bank terms, mpc suffer lack advice improve itself. there six report treasury select committee, two report house lords’ committee mpc, report commission conservative party liberal democrats, report engineer employers’ federation, recommendation many economists, include former mpc members, and, last least, report commission bank england don kohn, senior staff member federal reserve board recently nominate president appointment board governors. overall, verdict committee broadly positive. for example, 2001 review operation bi review 34/2002 7 monetary policy new zealand, professor lars svensson describe bank england swedish riksbank example “best practice” monetary policy. suggestion improvement various group cover follow areas: definition inflation target; terms, appointment composition membership mpc; arrangement publication minutes; forecast produce mpc; and, finally, miscellaneous collection technical matters. the precise definition inflation target, numerical value, debate length. what important target inflation additional objective would lead confusion committee’s aims. on committee various suggestion made: extend term appointment member mpc, make long term non-renewable, appoint people diverse backgrounds. by far fundamental suggestion proposal appoint representative different industry region committee, oppose monetary policy experts. that would change nature debate undermine mutual confidence member committee felt represent specific interest group. with experience mpc, i think argument come accepted. the proposal minute mpc meet include description individual view i discuss earlier. the committee oppose change reason i gave. in early day committee sensitive view minutes, publish six week meeting, publish earlier, shorten lag 13 day october 1998. the forecast process attract much attention, discuss length kohn report. present forecast term fan chart, order highlight balance risk outlook, prove successful. but prove difficult explain role projection condition assumption constant official interest rates. so committee also publish forecast condition market interest rates, order provide guide forecast depend upon profile short-term interest rates. the committee problem try explain mechanical link central projection forecast inflation two year ahead policy decision. this several reasons. first, view inflation prior two-year horizon important too. the optimal horizon bring inflation back target depend shock move inflation target. second, risk inflation around central projection (defined mode distribution inflation future points) also relevant policy decision. third, may risk committee wish respond materialised. but committee continue explain outlook inflation relate policy decision, and, time, hope educational effort pay off. finally, several miscellaneous suggestion change mpc. first, mpc accuse meet frequently and, result, change rate often. the eef report suggest committee meet eight time year, federal reserve, “meeting month could lead central bank change interest rate often response potentially mislead monthly data”. in fact, since june 1997 mpc change interest rate 23 time fomc 20 times. change rate reflect economic developments, frequency meetings. in event, bank england act 1998 state must meet least month, shall continue do. second, suggestion formal vote procedure adopt mpc meetings. the current vote procedure mpc straightforward: discussion continue person’s view clear. the governor put proposition committee command majority support. some question whether procedure robust might bias outcome. for example, issue raise house lord select committee. but i think misunderstand way work. it important view know cast vote part process make mind. the complication current procedure would committee split equally three different course action. in theory, could lead “voting paradox”. the governor would need decide course eliminated, leave two policy choice committee choose between. that would normally straight forward provide that, economist’s jargon, preference interest rate “single-peaked”. when case vote paradox apply. for preference single-peaked member committee would prefer, example, change 8 bi review 34/2002 rise 50 basis point increase 25 basis points. it easy see circumstance would represent rational preferences. third, set, call suite, model use committee improved. they fact continuous improvement bank commission adrian pagan carry review technical aspect model bank. that review publish 2003. fourth, suggest mpc meet outside london. the court bank indeed meet year destination outside london, occasion prove invaluable expand contact bank mpc one hand, local community, other. but mpc meet themselves, highly market-sensitive occasion surround purdah period, quite unsuitable opportunity interact local business community. there would little point hold mpc meet outside london committee unable speak meet local people. all member mpc travel widely around uk outside purdah, make 50 visit past year, contact important part process mpc inform state economy. during short life-time mpc make change procedure remain open possibility improvements. but unnecessary tinker would distraction main purpose. one go far lord falkland, say 1641 “if necessary change something, necessary change it”, believe that, least time being, major change mpc unnecessary. and imitation sincere form flattery, government draw comfort michael howard’s speech march year argue “nor, give importance stability continuity, i think right propose major change either remit composition monetary policy committee”. the fact broad, cross-party consensus objective broad framework monetary policy one reason think stability experience first five year mpc continue future. 5. conclusion the idea behind mpc take day-to-day politics monetary policy. it widely accept desirable. macroeconomic policy britain much excite comfort post-war period. in 1970s, inflation average 13% year, reach peak 27% august 1975. during 1980s inflation average 7% year, since inflation target regime adopt late 1992 inflation return low stable levels. britain try type monetary regime: target monetary aggregate narrow broad; shadow exchange rate target, explicit exchange rate target membership exchange rate mechanism. none pursue long, none carry real credibility. it follow exit exchange rate mechanism 1992 opportunity arise put place new monetary framework base explicit target inflation float exchange rate. the aim mpc keep inflation inflation expectation target level 2½%. it small part central bank’s role create confidence credibility belief respond change economic circumstance order maintain broad degree economic stability. in economists’ jargon, public must believe central bank “policy reaction function” consistent stability, predictable, announcement interest rate come news. the economic data lead expectation likely course interest rate which, instance prove reasonable guide course policy. a clear sign success mpc long news. the mpc prove one rare “instantly invent precedents” seem worked. it may achieve cult status nine worthy who, middle ages, inspire poetry, sculpture stain glass windows. a one writer remarked, “if one review list virtue contemporary find valuable knight - courtesy, loyalty, prowess, hardiness, largesse, frankness - nine worthy seem meet standard”. if level achievement aspiration nine members, least mpc claim record reasonable competence first five years. a stephen bayley remark 1986, “civilisations remember artefacts, bank-rates”. bi review 34/2002 9 chart 1: average committee

carse, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, asia pacific loan market association documentation launch, hong kong, 24 may 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, i please able speak special luncheon launch aplma standard documentation. i tell unprecedented demand attend event. i would like think reflect attraction speaker. but i realistic enough recognise real star show documentation itself; attendance today reflect level interest outcome association’s hard work bring first phase project fruition. my purpose today stress importance good documentation place general context increase regulatory focus operational risk feature basel committee’s propose new capital accord. i also briefly describe late development new accord bring date revise timetable. the work association it three year since i speak inaugural luncheon association hong kong. i say occasion association promise become vital part market infrastructure hong kong. i note particularly association could play role three main areas: act industry representative interlocutor regulators; establish common standard documentation; promote market transparency efficiency. i glad say association deliver promise areas. it website is, example, running, important source information member non-members. if i could put plea, however, would market statistic make available part website open non-members - honorary member hkma. in representational role, association offer helpful comment last year draft guideline hkma prepare management risk associate syndicate lending. our initial draft generate certain amount heat. this i think largely due feel part industry overplay inherent risk syndicate lending. we therefore make clear final version guideline - issue non-statutory form - syndicate loan necessarily risky type lending. indeed, distribution lend among participant design reduce risk share it. however, fact share multiple party involve give rise risk - particularly legal nature - mean documentation syndicate loan need watertight possible. the benefit standardise documentation this association’s initiative produce suite standard loan document important, probably association’s major achievement date. good documentation glamorous generally fascinate reading, play vital role underpin growth liquidity market financial products. this theoretical proposition. the explosive growth derivative market large extent due role play international swap & derivative association (isda) development maintenance derivative documentation. the recent testimony emergence within space last year us$ 1 trillion credit derivative market, build platform provide standardise isda default swap documentation. why standardise documentation powerful driver market growth? the answer create predictability certainty characteristic financial contract question. 2 bi review 33/2002 people good able understand right obligation contract, give confidence enter market transact. i would therefore encourage many market participant possible begin use association’s new documentation. this help boost liquidity primary market syndicate loans, also serve increase turnover secondary market still relatively underdevelop hong kong. it easy trade product whose term condition homogeneous. the association’s intention move second phase project develop standardise documentation secondary loan trade give impetus market. this something hkma would particularly welcome since would give bank great flexibility manage loan portfolio adjust liquidity. apart impact market whole, standardise documentation clear benefit level individual firm. lend bank good protect risk contract turn unenforceable, leave credit exposure anticipate. moreover, whole process negotiate loan become streamlined. there need haggle standard “boilerplate” loan agreement, resource free concentrate issue unique particular transaction. the reduction number idiosyncratic term condition also mean loan easy safe administer loan agreement signed. operational risk therefore reduced. nor benefit one-sided. borrower benefit documentation easy understand write (relatively) plain english strike appropriate balance interest lender borrower. i understand association’s documentation embody concepts. it important borrower community buy new documentation. in connection, reassure know new document base substantially loan market association (lma) london. these already widely adopt european loan market develop association uk association corporate treasurers. i believe also intend seek input borrower community hong kong help develop documentation. standardise documentation therefore describe almost unreservedly good thing. this subject two provisos. the first basic document still need tailor suit individual transaction - document leave gap done. this mean bank lull false sense security. legal advice still require individual transactions, good news least people room. second, standard term need evolve revise take account change market circumstance particular issue arise. they may occasion need test courts. the recent experience credit derivative market show ambiguity arise even standardise documentation, sponsor user documentation need alert make change necessary. the link operational risk but bottom line standardisation reduce risk something go wrong documentation. this fee turn reduce legal risk, include within definition operational risk adopt basel committee. this define operational risk “the risk loss result inadequate fail internal processes, people system external events”. this definition focus cause operational risk - internal processes, people, system external events. operational risk loss classify various “event types” assign bank’s major business lines. by classify loss way, bank good place identify appropriate risk control ass impact these. in draft paper sound practice management supervision operational risk, basel committee identify seven main loss event type operational risk. these include loss relate “execution, delivery process management” within reside documentation risk. why basel committee decide focus operational risk? the answer lie grow diversity complexity bank operation arise well-known phenomenon globalisation, grow sophistication financial technology outsourcing. this show bi review 33/2002 3 concrete form severe operational loss suffer number international institutions. the committee therefore decide take lead promote great understand operational risk consistency way measured, manage controlled. this would relatively unobjectionable. however, committee decide put teeth recommendation propose explicit capital charge operational risk new capital accord. this controversial two reasons. first, firm consensus measure capital require support operational risk - committee currently propose three approach this, range basic quite sophisticated. second, amount capital charge committee originally mind consider much high. in response this, committee propose reduction propose target operational risk capital 20% 12% minimum capital. a reduction would potentially available bank use advance measurement approaches. this example capital requirement use incentive bank improve risk management practices. this, view, real value new accord lies. among things, increase focus new accord internal rat risk-adjusted price might encourage sensible approach set margin syndicate loans. i know many bank hong kong think margin low fully compensate expect loss, cost capital operational costs. however, rational price policy currently hind lack consistency among bank price risk allocate capital. the new accord go way correct this. under internal rat base (irb) approach, bank require use internal rat factor price credit risk. progress new accord a part process create incentive good risk management, basel committee engage general effort recalibrate new accord adjust amount capital charge main approaches. the aim revise set proposal that, average, total amount capital require standardise approach cover credit operational risk require current accord cover credit risk only. modest capital relief would available bank move foundation irb approach, still relief opt advance irb approach. these, revise proposal basel committee, seem get new accord back track. a know, project suffer significant delays, month ago chance go ahead seem 50-50. however, number logjam clear revise timetable announced. the intention release revise set consultation paper may next year. this would take account quantitative impact study hold late year test calibration revise proposals. if go well, final accord would release end 2003 implementation target 2006. i know number false alarm new accord, bank today may incline take wait-and-see attitude. to banks, i would say pendulum swing favour implementation. it would therefore sensible plan basis new accord go ahead revise schedule, include explicit capital charge operational risk. this leave much time bank might want use advance approach new accord measure credit operational risk get ready. i would advise bank start preparation already do so. i would particularly recommend bank begin collect default data credit risk loss data operational risk. a framework latter set basel committee’s sound practice paper form two-dimensional matrix i describe earlier, assign loss arise various loss event type major business line bank. conclusion operational risk many facets, event give rise cover huge range high-frequency low-impact one end low-frequency high-impact other. there correspondingly wide range control technique use prevent least mitigate losses. sound 4 bi review 33/2002 documentation lie bread butter end spectrum control techniques. but le vital that. the association therefore congratulate initiative put place essential build block form standardise documentation launch today. this help promote development syndicate loan market hong kong region generally, also serve objective enable bank good manage operational risk. bi review 33/2002 1 zeti akhtar aziz: the malaysian bank industry - gear excellence keynote address dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank

thank you. bi review 33/2002 1 guy quaden: the euro - milestone path european integration contribution world economy stability keynote address mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, oecd forum, paris, 14 may 2002. * * * it great honour pleasure address important forum ocde theme euro. on 1 january 2002, euro physically introduce form banknote coins. this event mark conclusion changeover single currency, initiate three year earlier, 1 january 1999, non cash euro successfully introduce money financial markets. with effect 1 march 2002, euro become sole legal tender 12 country euro area. the success euro cash changeover surpass expectations. that unparalleled logistical operation take place almost without hitch bear witness euroland’s operational capability. such massive complex project could fact successfully complete thank meticulous preparation all-out effort innumerable people, authorities, enterprise association work together constructive co-operative spirit, public private sector alike. european citizen accept new money rapidly enthusiastically choose actor merely spectator changeover. they help write decisive page history modern europe whose significance far transcend purely monetary field. in presentation today i first would like analyse implication introduction euro, completion single market creation new framework economic policy. thereafter, i would like explore three important challenge euro area: firstly increase growth potential growth performance europe’s economies, secondly reinforce policy co-ordination political cohesion country zone, thirdly prepare succeed enlargement accession new members. i would conclude comment international aspect euro. *** european monetary union pursue two, interrelate economic objectives: efficiency stability. let start efficiency. the euro is, first instance, completion single market. the introduction euro create one world’s major economic areas. the young euro area important economic power, population around 300 million people, considerable purchase power, exceed unite states. thus, member state euro area together represent 15% world gdp, le unite state - 20% - twice much japan. by way comparison, big country euro area estimate represent 4.5% world gdp. monetary union also imply exchange rate long exist, instance rate belgian franc german mark italian lira. in past, volatility exchange rate harmful closely interdependent national economy european common market. let’s think back instance erm-crises 1992 1993. the single currency completely remove exchange rate risk exporter importers, debtor creditor across 12 country euro area thus eliminate cost hedge exchange rate risk vis-à-vis euro area countries. i notice pass “internal exchange rate” stability often overshadow disproportional interest float u dollar-euro exchange rate. the dollar/euro exchange rate movement have, fact, comparable dollar’s historical fluctuation vis-à-vis european currency (in particular german mark) prior introduction euro. the euro lead increase transparency price great competition thorough integration process take place area. the integration money market 2 bi review 33/2002 disappearance exchange rate risk provide boost integration financial markets, bond market equity markets, less extent. the stability effect euro’s arrival bring improve growth potential zone, cover type stability: price stability fiscal stability. 1. there doubt deflation inflation harmful output welfare medium term: distort information contain price system, imperceptibly change real value contract save heighten uncertainty. they consequently disturb allocation resources, investment process income distribution. in case europe, consensus contribution price stability promote long-term growth explicitly enshrine treaty maastricht state unambiguously primary objective monetary policy maintain price stability. the eurosystem, associate european central bank national central bank 12 euro countries, convince fulfil mandate, monetary policy make effective contribution realisation strong output growth well sustainable employment prospects. a part monetary policy strategy, european central bank publish quantitative definition price stability. it aim create stable anchor point price expectations, make also easy public judge actions. price stability define annual rise harmonise index consumer price euro area le 2%. it must maintain medium term. central banker cannot avoid external shocks, rise commodity price international markets, lead temporary increase inflation. however prevent second-round effect must ensure internal value currency maintain medium term. that policy eurosystem convince respect see moderate inflation expectation evidenced, among things, level long-term interest rates. together present easy monetary conditions, continuance low risk premium euro long-term interest rate one factor economic recovery 2002 draw strength. 2. another stability-related aspect new european economic policy framework discipline fiscal policies. the convergence criterion lead last stage economic monetary union play important part ensure stable environment. in addition, institutional set-up different permanent procedure within european union aim promote stability-oriented policy further. the stability growth pact, multilateral surveillance peer pressure important tool end. monetary policy decision centralise fiscal policy still conduct level member states, accordance subsidiarity principle. this leaf room manoeuvre regard composition public spend revenues, line national preference possible difference cyclical positions. however decentralise fiscal policy had, within eurozone, take account potential spillover effects. the present framework design minimise risk negative spillover (across country across policies) inappropriate fiscal policies. crucially, treaty contain obligation avoid “excessive deficits”. this constraint, together procedure multilateral review national fiscal policies, specify stability growth pact. the pact stipulate quantifiable deficit rules, provide clear policy orientation budgetary authority member states. it correct describe pact fiscal straitjacket. in monetary union prominent role generally assign fiscal policy deal cyclical movements. if correctly applied, stability growth pact certainly offer necessary scope this. indeed, obligation eu member state aim budget “close balance surplus” “over medium term” make possible allow nominal budget balance fluctuate accord change cyclical circumstances. the so-called economic stabiliser operate freely period economic slowdown country structurally balance budget top cycle. bi review 33/2002 3 *** the changeover physical euro conclude chapter history european integration book. after introduction new currency, country euro-zone face three main challenges. 1. the economic outlook remain subject uncertainty disappoint year 2001 globally business confidence markedly improve euro area last month condition sustain upswing place, include favourable finance conditions. while recovery expect initially proceed gradual pace, real gdp growth rate gravitate towards potential growth late year. the growth problem however two dimensions: short term long term. potential growth euro-area estimate 2¼ 2½%, still noticeably le us. this growth potential need increased. yet solution necessarily, i think, duplicate american “model”. the experience country northern europe (scandinavia) indicate possible combine level social protection conform european preference high rate participation workforce, technological innovation economic growth comparable us. monetary unification major structural reform, already stimulate reforms. yet stride necessary order increase overall productivity include work life still unemployed. the euro area country must raise “speed limit” economy continue improve efficiency labour product markets, encourage entrepreneurship foster knowledge-based economy. 2. a question often ask whether appropriate introduce monetary union different european country political union. it true case u instance, political unification precede monetary unification. there however precedent pre-set scheme construction europe. the single currency desirable complement single market european leader take advantage exceptional political momentum late 1980s proceed monetary union. this monetary union operate - prove three year - current institutional framework monetary policy determine centrally govern council european central bank, high degree independence clear mandate, national fiscal policy which, though autonomous, bound rule stability growth pact. the soundness euro essentially base strength area’s economy (the large trade bloc world) price stability safeguard euro’s internal value, give external value inevitably fluctuate account differential growth interest rates, particularly vis-à-vis us. have say that, i add, speak personal capacity new progress economic policy co-ordination among member state euro-area political cohesion among inside outside europe would welcome consolidate monetary union deepen european integration. 3. the prospect enlargement another reason adapt eu’s institution procedures. the eu indeed face another major challenge: many country rest europe knock door. the accession criterion european union define european summit copenhagen 1993. the political criterion concern existence stable institution guarantee democracy, rule law, respect human right protection minorities. accord economic criterion country must viable market economies. in connection necessary verify whether price trade liberalise whether bind legal system, include property rights, place. these country must also competitive, i.e. capable withstand competitive pressure market force within union. finally, institutional criterion concern adoption “acquis communautaire”. 4 bi review 33/2002 moreover accession criterion monetary union well known: famous maastricht criterion relative moderation inflation, avoidance excessive public finance deficit stability exchange rate. in many accession country substantial progress already achieve different field one expect participation ten new member state european union come year late monetary union. however lot remain done. *** i shall move last topic speech: international role euro. in past, economic political reasons, country adopt active stance regard internationalisation currency, either foster hind external use. for part, eurosystem adopt neutral stance. this mean neither pursue internationalisation euro policy goal, attempt hamper use non residents. the international role euro determine choice market participant context increase market liberalisation integration. there place least two international currencies: field competition beneficial. give weight euro area world economy legacy former national currency area financial markets, euro already become second widely use international currency behind u dollar. a anchor currency, euro largely inherit role play legacy currency (e.g. german mark french franc). the euro play role peg 55 country outside euro area, mainly country rest europe, africa middle east close trade historical link euro area countries. arrangement adopt range close link euro loose form anchoring. with regard functions, euro’s international role remain limited. the u dollar remain main reserve currency dominant price quotation currency. the predominance dollar attributable mainly combine reinforce effect network externality economy scale use lead international currency. future development international use euro likely influence two main factor - size risk. with regard size factor, broad liquid euro area capital market may lead great use euro low transaction costs. this may, turn, facilitate development euro vehicle currency trade commodity pricing. in addition, international investor issuer consider euro stable currency, hold euro asset minimise risk internationally diversify portfolios. two process great significance world economic political order unfold last decades: economic globalisation european integration. they partially linked. yet different roots. one fruit technological process free force markets. the motivate political vision. regional integration international co-operation surely appropriate mean promote stability economic growth different part world contribute humanise process globalisation. *** the euro banknote show windows, gateway bridges. these symbol openness communication help promote feel share identity strengthen exchange among nation europe. at time, symbol reflection european attitude towards rest world. bi

group employ fully one-half private-sector worker provide lion’s share net new job economy. with small business primary commercial customers, regional community bank long been, continue be, element strength economy. consequently, safe sound operation regional community bank must ensured. at time, bank organization must encourage innovative meet need customers. the competitive advantage small

bank organization regard subject primarily credit risk, although interest, funding, operational risk also major area concern. increasingly, however, liquidity market risk grow significance regional community bank gain great access le traditional source funds. compete alternative core deposit 1990s lead many regional community banks, even small institutions, rely increasingly intermediary

management. most observers, example, unaware successful community regional banker directly raise uninsured deposit local market loan demand exceed core deposit growth. in latter half past decade, uninsured deposit bank grow rapidly large banks. to sure, large time deposit cost insure deposits, community bank maintain profit return equity. the creativity community bank show supplement core deposits--deposits grow le rapidly attractive substitute become available customers--has surprise believe small bank long compete modern financial markets. such ingenuity fund supplement creativity maintain increase loan base competition large rivals. this ingenuity also increase need close management fund time regional community banks’ investment portfolio become complex, hold instrument case longer-dated options, traditional bank investments. even term capital base, widespread use trust-preferred security introduce additional complexity regional community bank hold company balance sheets. the expand use acceptance asset-backed security also enable regional community bank take advantage we, year ago, considered, “large bank” opportunity originate sell large volume mortgage consumer

may le well know bank engage securitization activity need wary take action, provide post-sale support securitization excess contractual obligation, would suggest implicit recourse exposure loss beyond contractually state amount. bank organization deem provide implicit recourse required, general terms, treat entire outstanding amount asset sell though remain book risk-based capital purposes. finally, numerous third-party vendor service provider today offer regional community bank product financial services--delivered traditional channel well bi review 32/2002 3 internet--so banks, turn, meet increasingly sophisticate need demand customers. a consequence, many small bank organization face additional complexity business new heighten exposure attendant on- off-balance-sheet asset

a key advantage small bank organization manage credit risk--close knowledge customers’ prospect capacity service debt--is le relevant address many new risk face. many new risk market-driven entail complexity bank little experience. indeed, i urge community regional banker recognize market reality create need adopt new fund source activity also require bank invest appropriate new risk-management techniques. i realize often look like pure cost increases, i assure go hand hand new activity ensure continue ability community regional bank successfully adapt change markets. indeed, traditional characteristic many small even regional institutions--including local ownership control interest involve individuals, limit span relatively simple operations, effective management--still rely ensure new risk properly identify effectively managed. the need traditional prudential policy obviate new risk-management techniques. federal reserve examiner continue look four key component risk-management system evaluate management supervise institutions. these component are: • effective identification, monitoring, report risks, • sufficiency policy limit control risks, • adequacy internal control ensure adherence approve limits, • active oversight process director senior managers. these four elements, take together, provide widely applicable framework assess risk management, though detail component risk management vary considerably among institutions. for example, bank’s exposure credit, market, operation risk routine, 4 bi review 32/2002 well understood, limit dimensions, fairly simple risk-management process suffice. more complex assets, liabilities, business activities, however, demand elaborate process internal controls. and concentrate exposure kind, whether credit fund risks, need identify make subject well-considered reasonable limits. whatever complexity design processes, however, four core element interdependent. a consequence, four component must comprehensively address entire system effective. effective risk-management process also strong deterrent fraud. irrespective level risk inherent bank activities, must remember fact banks, particularly le robust risk-management internal controls, highly susceptible customer insider fraud mismanagement or, occasionally, insider abuse. more often not, failure absence basic internal control risk-management process permit losses, fail bring light serious damage results. a sound comprehensive internal control system base core principle separation duty naturally include fully effective audit program. but--importantly--it also encompass ongoing procedure independent reconcilement certification bank record ensure basic control function effectively. conclusion in closing, i emphasize need risk-management process community regional bank advance sufficiently meet risk-management challenge banks’ current environment. though often challenge might meet adapt sound practice long pursue organization, increase number banks, new system procedure may need keep pace more-complex risk associate evolve grow business. a bankers, bank supervisors, policymakers, strive work together ensure risk-management process sufficiently robust test ensure effectiveness. a final word may order much discussion need adopt more-sophisticated risk management community banks. you doubt hear change

thank north carolina bankers’ association opportunity speak today. bi review 32/2002 1 nout wellink: monetary union europe u - different they? speech mr nout wellink, president de nederlandsche bank president bank international settlements, institut international d’etudes bancaires, amsterdam, 17 may 2002. * * * introduction first all, thank invitation speak today. now monetary union, discussion role national central bank euro area, include question ongoing relevance. clearly regard u relevant would invite speak! it come surprise i also think national central bank relevant, continue so. today i would like briefly compare monetary policy euro area us. of course difference two areas, also important similarities. this comparison help u understand reason behind difference may provide useful insight institutional implication euro area monetary policy future. i structure remark around three themes: policy goal two monetary unions, organisation, monetary policy decision-making process system. goal philosophy let begin compare goal mandate eurosystem federal reserve system. here europe primary focus monetary policy maintain price stability. in contrast, feed multiple objective monetary policy. their goal achieve maximum employment, stable price moderate long-term interest rates. an important explanation different mandate find look economic histories. in europe, monetary union recent step ongoing process political economic integration. the hyperinflation experience first half last century european countries, particular germany, play important role ensure european monetary policy focus price stability. our experience europe contrast us. a key u event commentator frequently refer great depression. monetary policy often blame add severity great depression us. i think reason employment interest rate objective remain fed’s mandate, policy maker react quickly sign slow economic growth. under normal circumstances, policy maker side atlantic likely take similar decisions. however, around time economic cycle change growth slow rapidly, might see different decision take frankfurt washington - reflect different mandates. in addition influence history, eurosystem’s mandate reflect academic insight last 20 year so. this research tend support view monetary policy focus price stability. other central bank around world review mandate recent year tend move towards price stability sole objective. similar proposal also make regard fed. if fed’s mandate change future, i expect also direction explicit focus price stability. organisation two monetary union a second area different history play role way eurosystem feed organised. while feed create ‘from scratch’ federal government single country, eurosystem establish twelve sovereign state voluntarily give monetary autonomy. this reflect fact eurosystem way decentralise fed. great decentralisation consistent eu-wide principle subsidiarity, decision take country regional level possible. this great degree decentralisation apparent area monetary policy decision-making operation, bank supervision statistics. however, feed also consider decentralise areas. in 2 bi review 32/2002 fact, exclude staff work task unrelated monetary union, system roughly number employees. clearly, tell u much potential efficiency gains, except around systems. the european monetary union make sovereign countries. that mean politically publicly acceptable carry central bank task ecb. our preference subsidiarity also imply limit potential efficiency gain within system. the pace centralisation link speed political integration europe. a long federal european state, i expect provide independent view national euro area economic developments, within context area wide monetary policy, key task dutch central bank. task relate financial stability bank supervision also remain part core business. in order carry task effectively, remain closely connect formation monetary policy. we also important role explain policy decision citizens. give language, cultural historical difference countries, underestimate importance difficulty task role national central bank carry out. these factor help explain inclusion national central bank governor ecb govern council, bring third theme. decision-making two monetary union the final area comparison feed eurosystem i want make concern process monetary policy decision making. both area include representation region well centre. but, clear area u also centralise system euro area. washington-based board member form majority committee make u monetary policy decisions. in contrast, ecb executive board member form minority ecb govern council. in monetary unions, decision makers, whether regional not, expect make decision basis prospect whole monetary union. this area wide approach strengthen europe ensure council member prohibit take instruction decision making. at time, national european body allow put pressure council members. these provision reinforce fact ecb council personal basis, represent national interests. in years, size euro area probably increase significantly. a aware, european history also lie behind desire enlargement. most accession country announce want join euro area shortly entry eu. whether join euro area quickly point could debate another day. regardless view issue, fact remain prepare substantial enlargement eurosystem next five ten years. consistent provision nice treaty, ecb council prepare proposal change vote procedure accommodate enlargement. the reason consider change guard perception decision make could become inefficient, could potentially dominate governor small countries. in make changes, must find solution retain supranational character decision make renationalise monetary policy. this imply governor national central bank continue treat equally. at time, council must represent eurosystem whole, see - imply must become centralised. a solution meet criterion could involve form rotate membership governor national central banks, limit number vote governors. this could variation feed system, albeit decentralised. there, regional president participate discussions, vote point time. find solution meet criterion i set especially important, give change could set precedent area supranational european co-operation conclude remark let briefly conclude. in view, difference mandate feed eurosystem important understand respective decisions, often forgotten. in addition, compare two system shed light institution may head future. regard bi review 32/2002 3 mandates, seem change area likely direction feed move close central bank are, rather reverse. for organisation decision making, future difficult predict. any change need take account political reality monetary union sovereign countries. euro area monetary policy supranational, decision make base euro area whole, individual countries. at time, euro area consist independent countries. that imply limit far eurosystem centralise advance political union. this reality clearly reflect decision-making body. i wish success rest conference enjoyable stay amsterdam. bi review 31/2002 1 tony latter: who determine monetary policy hong kong? speech mr tony latter, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hong kong seminar financial service asia, organise lovell pacific rim advisory council, 13 may 2002. * * * you may think rather naive question, answer obvious, experience otherwise. who responsible? let's start "who" question. i encounter people variously believe answer beijing government; people's bank china; u federal reserve board; combination hsbc, standard charter bank bank china (which note-issuing bank hong kong); hong kong legislative council; hong kong government; hong kong monetary authority. article 110 basic law – often refer hong kong's constitution – include statement "the government hong kong shall, own, formulate monetary fiscal policies". this make clear neither mainland government pboc power relation monetary policy, policy responsibility lie firmly hong kong's government. since china resume sovereignty hong kong five year ago, absolutely erosion principle.1 a regard federal reserve, although true say present regime choose monetary policy – namely currency board u dollar anchor currency – fed's monetary policy major direct influence monetary condition hong kong, certainly feed determine hong kong operate monetary policy nature. it hong kong's choice, require permission washington new york continue discontinue it. with regard legislative council, member legco take keen interest monetary policy relate issues, although hkma maintain dialogue legco, particularly financial affair panel, matter common interest, legco locus exist law determine monetary policy. with regard three note-issuing banks, particular status confer ability affect monetary policy. the bank issue note response public's wish exchange deposit currency, require pay back exchange fund manner financial secretary specify - since 1983 equivalent value u dollar calculate fix rate 7.80. within framework volume note issuance neutral term monetary policy. there time back history could claim justification hsbc, known, serve clear bank bank system, wield considerable influence monetary conditions, capability dismantle progressively, requirement introduce 1988 hsbc hold countervail balance exchange fund, creation hong kong monetary authority 1993, hkma's subsequent assumption, 1996, via exchange fund, role settlement institution local payment system. government monetary authority so, dismiss possible involvement number players, leave clear conclusion essence hong kong government determine monetary policy. more specifically, authority rest first instance financial secretary, since exchange fund ordinance place control exchange fund, effect provide resource 1 for discussion, light vein, relationship hkma central banks, include pboc, see viewpoint article "central bank cooperation", 8 november 2001, www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/viewpt. 2 bi review 31/2002 conduct monetary policy. he is, however, oblige consult exchange fund advisory committee exercise control exchange fund. the exchange fund ordinance also provide financial secretary appoint person monetary authority, assist performance certain functions. moreover, financial secretary delegate various duty exchange fund ordinance monetary authority. in fact, monetary authority public officer therefore formally single person, ordinance provide person engage assist discharge duties. this give rise institution know hong kong monetary authority. the upshot financial secretary ultimately determine monetary policy, albeit take advice advisory committee. and monetary authority carry monetary policy day-to-day basis accordance delegation him. this mean, however, monetary authority divorce formulation policy – rather opposite practice, since monetary authority major influence determination policy close liaison financial secretary membership advisory committee. although hong kong arrangement, particular status monetary authority, unusual internationally may possibly unique compare typical set-up central bank establish distinct corporate entity, process monetary policy may practice greatly different jurisdiction – broad framework set government central bank execute policy transparent accountable fashion. however, precisely define framework autonomy central bank exist jurisdictions, sometimes regard necessary formal safeguard monetary stability. the distinction may le important firmly rule-based currency board system might circumstances. legal parameter let's turn "what" question. although, note already, basic law clearly state hong kong government shall determine monetary policy, also set important parameter within freedom exercised. thus:- "the hong kong dollar, legal tender hong kong special administrative region, shall continue circulate." (article 111) "no foreign exchange control policy shall apply hong kong special administrative region. the hong kong dollar shall freely convertible. …….the government hong kong special administrative region shall safeguard free flow capital within, region." (article 112) "the exchange fund hong kong special administrative region shall manage control government region, primarily regulate value hong kong dollar." (article 113) "the hong kong special administrative region shall follow principle keep expenditure within limit revenue draw budget, strive achieve fiscal balance, avoid deficit keep budget commensurate growth rate gross domestic product." (article 107) these stipulation confirm continuance hong kong dollar independent currency; confirm exchange fund available regulate exchange rate; rule use exchange controls; provide comfort deficit fiscal finance attain scale would pose serious threat monetary stability. choice regime but within parameter exact monetary arrangement prescribed. we choose operate currency board fix rate u dollar. i recently write speak bi review 31/2002 3 length rationale behind choice intend repeat today.2 but let reiterate one principal contention – namely monetary policy, include exchange rate policy, cannot determine economy's competitiveness outside relatively short term. competitiveness determine intrinsic efficiency economy, turn result investment, productivity, structural evolution, on; may turn amenable influence government policy various fields, role monetary policy provide stable monetary environment within longer-term force operate propitiously, attempt short-term fine-tuning. there one aspect debate i like address, since seem focus increase attention. it issue do hong kong dollar, renminbi move flexibly u dollar, and, particularly, whether consider peg hong kong dollar renminbi. adjustment competitiveness price hong kong observe flexible direction response market forces. one force influence compete price mainland; research indicate gradual process convergence work (which include rise price across border well fall hong kong), although may weak observer claim certainly mean price eventually equalise completely.3 moreover, price tradables hong kong find particularly adept adjust movement effective exchange rate. in words, price become misalign foreign price movement exchange rate (such u dollar move major currency pull hong kong dollar it), hong kong price quick adjust order restore competitive equilibrium. at time, appear price mainland are, international standards, also quite flexible. two conclusion draw observations. one price hong kong mainland well able adjust relative one another without assistance exchange rate. the that, exchange rate move around create disequilibria prices, domestic price would adjust offset disequilibrating tendency. in words, seem unlikely shift relative price competitiveness would greatly different condition exchange rate variability without – would simply different mix shift relative domestic price exchange rate effect. it evident anyway hong kong economy complement mainland's compete it. hong kong benefit buoyant mainland economy. if buoyancy judge best sustain increase flexibility renminbi exchange rate – i make judgement whether would would case – hong kong would likely benefit. what i suggest far exchange rate two currency probably something need worry greatly term economic impact via competitiveness trade. thus hong kong ought need take particular defensive offset action renminbi move widely u dollar. there is, however, important qualification conclusion. if financial market believe differently, react beliefs, may see disturbance market result actual rumour development mainland's exchange rate policy. we indeed already witness behaviour time time report circulate imminent adjustment renminbi. yet, occasions, future one i would expect market cope satisfactorily disturbance – essentially currency board's adjustment mechanism whether upward downward pressure hk dollar exchange rate – economic fundamental ultimately prevail. 2 see "why blame peg?", available hkma website (www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/speeches) forthcoming hkma quarterly bulletin, may 2002. 3 "price convergence hong kong mainland", jiming ha; available shortly hkma research memorandum series. 4 bi review 31/2002 fix renminbi? however, conclusion agitate hk dollar-renminbi exchange rate beg question. if, indeed, bilateral exchange rate arrangement matter much long-term determination price competitiveness, anyway tie currency way close neighbour major trade partner, matter convenience, expectation save transaction cost synergy would benefit sides, independently argument price competitiveness? there fairly compel argument favour arrangement. the elimination currency exposure transaction cost would doubtless welcomed. prima facie one would expect resultant gain generation mutually beneficial trade. one may recall one principal factor justify introduction euro. for hong kong, however, unite state mainland china major trade partners, would, context, offset effect merely switch peg one currency other. on hand, significant example economy retain currency independent main trade partner without obvious disadvantage. take canada mexico example. the unite state considerably important trade partner canada mexico china hong kong, financial linkage probably strong too, canadian dollar mexican peso remain separate u dollar, canadian mexican economy appear disadvantaged. other pertinent example might unite kingdom's dependence euro area, ireland's dependence unite kingdom, switzerland's link germany, on.4 moreover, many currency pair exhibit considerable fluctuation compare stability cross rate renminbi hong kong dollar recent years, indicate exchange rate variability may obstacle continue expansion mutually beneficial economic ties. on evidence would obvious advantage close link hong kong dollar renminbi. in particular case, crucial consideration: renminbi convertible. there would little logic try formally fix fully convertible currency non-convertible one. one might argue constancy hk dollar renminbi past several year amount de facto fixing, least allow variation time might justify – example, light major sudden structural shift wto entry eventual convertibility. it would anyway possible operate hong kong's currency board system reference non-convertible currency, since essence system, namely continuous convertibility hk dollar anchor currency, would denied. i conclude exchange cross rate hong kong mainland varies, potential vary, problem us, seem set remain case foreseeable future. the corollary would advantage attempt hitch hk dollar renminbi formal permanent fashion. other options? there course alternative might explored. for example, perfect world, set narrow objective sustain price competitiveness index particular level possess nicely calibrate model economy, apply suitable methodology, could derive formula optimal exchange rate, would doubtless different determine present regime, could devise operational strategy deliver exchange rate path. but sort desktop solution could nightmare reality. even empirical basis formula entirely reliable (a wholly unrealistic assumption), imagine possible consequence interest rate foreign reserves, practical problem term operability, comprehensibility, transparency, credibility, financial market confidence, on. such problem could particularly acute, risk strategy therefore correspondingly high, open economy open financial market-place hong kong. i deliberately exaggerate order make point. a monetary policy framework must view entirety, need clear enduring. it success judge 4 base average value trade good past five years, hong kong dependence mainland china 40% (including re-exports value-added basis only); canada usa 76%; mexico usa 81%; uk 12 country euro area 64%; ireland uk 27%; switzerland germany 28%. bi review 31/2002 5 long term, must accept deliver long-term stability may continuously deliver result everyone's like short term. in hkma pay attention whole spectrum possible alternatives. the fact support retention current framework u dollar peg represent conscious decision; mean deaf counter-arguments reluctant debate them. conclusion in summary, monetary policy hong kong set hong kong government within broad framework provide basic law, fundamental objective provide long-term monetary stability. in judgement unlikely aim would assist alter current arrangements, whether pin currency neighbour devices. bi review 55/2002 1 hermann remsperger: economic outlook economic policy challenge germany guest lecture professor hermann remsperger, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, norge bank (central bank norway), oslo, 23 september 2002. * * * lady gentleman yesterday, elect new parliament germany. a aware, economic matter play key role election campaign. i would like take matter today oslo. under head “economic outlook economic policy challenge germany”, i would like, first, talk reform need labour market well tax social policy. second, i shall also ask question whether need new policy mix. and, finally, i shall look eastward enlargement european union major economic policy challenge. my simple proposition germany’s economic outlook depend foremost cop exist economic policy challenges. i argue favour domestic reform germany, careful handle eu emu enlargement maintain fiscal policy rule policy mix european economic monetary union. not least, rule apply way “budgetary exuberance” avoid upswing. i therefore le concern short-term cyclical movement medium long-term economic trend germany. for reason, i shall start look back and, so, state germany’s economic development past decade often tend disappoint international standards. i. a look back in say that, indeed cause optimism start 1990s: german unification, opening-up east european markets, progress european integration and, later, introduction new currency provide wealth opportunity growth. however, least cases, thing quite work hoped. since reunification boom petered out, germany part group country weak growth. while gdp present emu country rise total 15% since 1995, correspond figure germany 10%. in line this, annual average rate growth germany, good 1½%, lag ¾ percentage point behind. compare germany euro area whole exclude germany, german shortfall growth increase 1 percentage point. in 2001, take own, figure much 1½ percentage points. now, commentator ascribe performance increase globalisation. however, argument hold close examination. follow period export weakness early 1990s, german economy achieve extremely good result foreign trade 1994 2001. give overall moderate growth gdp period mention 14½%, real export increase 79½% real import 67½%. one factor contribute positive development export since mid-1990s improve price competitiveness german business sector. this mean early adverse development largely reversed. in early 1990s, contrast, price competitiveness severely affect large wage increases, least result bring pay eastern germany closely line west german rate also due sharp appreciation d-mark. although german economy become dependent countries, say structural problem germany cannot blame development global economy. they mainly home-made. among things, cyclical influence special factor contribute germany’s relatively poor performance euro area. above all, remember that, already run-up stage three european monetary union, interest rate fall sharply number eu country previously fairly high short long-term rate interest. for example, interest rate 2 bi review 55/2002 long-term government bond italy spain, even 1995, 5 6 percentage point high rate german federal bonds. besides, improve fundamentals, market expectation early participation monetary union likely play important role interest rate convergence process. a home former anchor currency erm, germany benefit directly process interest rate convergence. another cause relatively weak growth germany mention is, course, crisis construction industry, especially eastern germany. in sector, capacity build immediately reunification exceed longer-term ability real estate market absorb capacity. reduce construction activity depress german economic growth. without decline investment construction since mid-1990s, shortfall german growth compare euro area whole would therefore substantial. by contrast, construction activity european country remain important pillar economic growth. finally, consideration also give fact live standard monetary union still disparate. since poor country suppose catch emu average, go grow strongly country already achieve high level income. a comparatively low level growth already advance country therefore much importance attach it. ii. labour market problem one important - important - reason inadequate pace economic growth germany continue heavy burden tax social security contribution well strict regulation part economy. however, reason cannot explain differential growth among core country european union, similarly serious deficiency term reform. rather, major cause shortfall growth vis-à-vis unite states. above all, little labour market flexibility germany. also, wage rate policy indeed characterise restraint second half 1990s, overall stance was, best, neutral. furthermore, differentiate pay term skills, sector region enough. wage policy make major contribution creation new jobs. in period cyclical downswing, rise unemployment germany far sharp fall period upturn. for instance, number people work western germany rise cyclical low point 1991 1997 1.3 million around 2.5 million. by 2001, number unemployed reduce half million. an additional factor contribute high level persistent unemployment that, firm see it, skill work evidently decrease long unemployment lasts. for non-working member labour force, incentive take employment limit high-level marginal burden impose tax public levies. most type household germany marginal burden tax levy 50% more. in words, every additional euro earned, around 50 cent deducted. moreover, social benefit high level international standard act reservation wage. in germany, difficult, especially low-skilled persons, find suitable job. the “wedge” gross net wage also lead emergence considerable black economy. furthermore, skill profile seek work often fail match job offer. unemployment would thus remain high even number vacancy correspond number people look work. the german labour market characterise high level mismatch unemployment. the proposal hartz commission, set previous federal government, embryonic reform labour exchanges, already way, attempt tackle situation increase efficiency job placement process. the press task labour market policy point view split three categories: first, measure increase supply labour; second, proposal strengthen demand labour and, third, change wage-formation process. one thing examine regard increase labour supply whether, say, period time draw unemployment benefit lead people remain unemployment long absolutely necessary. a i mentioned, empirical terms, evident perspective enterprise skill unemployed rapidly lose value long unemployment continues. for reason, purportedly generous arrangement may even become bi review 55/2002 3 “poverty traps” unemployed. combine social assistance unemployment assistance also considered. neither type state benefit insurance benefit. rather, grant accord specific need. they therefore merged. many expert agree demand labour germany also suffer complex legal arrangement relate work contracts. enterprise cautious recruit labour difficult make redundancies. if sustain decline unemployment, element wage-formation process subject scrutiny. collective pay agreement set general framework condition order take great account individual situation firm find themselves. we admittedly overlook fact initial cautious step already take towards make german labour market flexible. the strict principle regionally agree pay deal already relax somewhat opt-out opt-in arrangements. furthermore, labour market make adaptable extension part-time work. finally, help germany’s train system possible keep youth unemployment comparatively low level european standards. accord eurostat figures, unemployment rate among under-25-year-olds amount recently 9.3%, compare 16.4% euro area whole. iii. tax social policy all thing considered, underlie condition german economy also improve tax reform adopt two year ago. for incorporate enterprises, corporation tax low 40% retain profit (and 30% distribute profits) 25%. for non-corporations, previous burden impose trade tax largely removed. furthermore, situation also ease fact income tax scale low stage 2005. the tax reform make restructure corporate sector easy profit sale corporations’ participate interest long subject taxation. however, tax depreciation facility spend fix asset make worse. there progress germany field old-age pension provisions. the pension reform, adopt last year, pursue two objective simultaneously. first, payment state pay-as-you-go scheme cut back, and, second, private provision strengthened. pension increase come year remain level increase wage salaries. this mean that, long term, increase contribution rate around 1½ percentage point low would otherwise case. the pension reform mainly benefit young generations. they gain low burden contributions. they great scope make provision. for older, however, cutback payment weigh heavily. the promotion private old-age pension provision nevertheless entail considerable burden public sector budgets. furthermore, know “riester pension” constrict set fairly tight regulations. the stock capital save may pay out, example, regular life-long instalments. in contrast this, company level, flexible instrument create form pension fund. not allow largely free decision investment, also make define contribution possible first time. precisely associate fiscal strains, hardly likely significant increase national save result reform. however, germany location investment probably play great role future increasingly important market pension products. all thing considered, indeed economic policy progress germany. unfortunately, move forward snail’s pace. there still much leave done. further reform labour market social security system matter urgency view increasingly unfavourable age structure population germany. the ratio people age 60 group 15 59-year-olds 40% 2000, ratio might increase around 80% 2050. the high age ratio adverse impact social security system and, give exist entitlement benefits, call high contribution rates. 4 bi review 55/2002 it mean certain whether recent reform pension system sufficient cope challenges. an additional factor demographic development place strain part social security system, health insurance institution nurse care schemes. the welfare state system adapt cope challenge problem future economic growth avoided. a general guideline, may say close match social security contribution along strong personal contribution individual concern improve economic efficiency thus open opportunity growth. iv. eu enlargement one reason i believe reform inside germany important fact also face challenge outside. the plan enlargement european union certainly one mentioned. the negotiation currently conduct 12 countries, situate mainly central eastern europe, far enough advance first round enlargement take place early middle decade. especially germany’s point view, set right course integration new member state considerable importance. both germany’s geographical location close economic tie neighbour east mean germany affect eu enlargement country union. despite considerable progress term macroeconomic stabilisation implementation market economy reforms, erstwhile socialist country transition, particular, still display significant structural difference current eu member states. one difference accession candidate process catching-up economically. they generally inflation rate high mature slowly grow eu member states. this outcome, first, difference productivity gain across country sector - know balassa-samuelson effect - and, second, shift demand. the result real appreciation pose obstacle eu enlargement term progress liberalisation foreign trade ensue welfare gain eu whole. nevertheless, eu accession candidate participate monetary union exist structural disparity eliminated, single monetary policy euro area meet need member states. a hasty enlargement emu would therefore harbour stability risk euro area might generate tension among participate countries. accession eu, however, imply immediate full membership emu. instead, eu accession country participate initially “member state derogation” third stage economic monetary union. the precondition full emu membership accession country achieve high degree sustainable economic convergence. the convergence criterion lay maastricht treaty yardstick this. these criterion set unambiguously verifiable requirement term price stability, long-term interest rate levels, government fiscal position, participation exchange-rate mechanism european monetary system, erm ii. in addition, pursuant article 121 eu treaty, examination sustainability achieve convergence “should also take account ... result integration markets, situation development balance payment current account ... development unit labour cost price indices”. the convergence criterion design guard inflationary tendency within monetary union prevent tension arise structural divergence inflation. the task stabilisation make stringent demand monetary policy accession countries, price stability may regard sine qua non sustainable growth. for reason, accession country - least interest - enter emu process catch economically already make significant headway adjustment function exchange rate easily dispense with. such step-by-step enlargement process would also germany’s interest, since would enhance opportunity arise enlargement union limit associate risks, especially monetary policy risks. bi review 55/2002 5 v. policy mix after discuss domestic reform germany comment eu enlargement, i would like deal third economic policy issue: policy mix european monetary union. the present division task base insight area policy concentrate relative strengths. the monetary policy european central bank gear price stability, example. in line perspective, wage policy responsible achieve high level employment budgetary policy ensure efficient supply public good fairness income distribution but, so, impair incentive work, save invest. this - i see - generally try test allocation responsibility often subject criticism, however. call make allocate macroeconomic responsibility differently, accompany demand monetary, fiscal wage policymakers coordinate operation instead focus strengths. accord “new division labour”, wage policy would task keep inflation. this would conditional wage salary earner trade union forgo pay rise precisely period economy boom - time could easily push increases. it probable would wage-price spiral, also happen historical experience germany countries. there success early 1970s, example, restrict pay rises, even though trade union tie corporatist alliance call “concerted action”. frequently, call make monetary policy gear - primarily gear - price stability, attempt stimulate economic activity. that way see things, however, overrate monetary policy’s influence development real economy. change monetary policy stance act vary time-lags investor consumers. furthermore, often difficult diagnose cyclical situation properly. finally, monetary policy action would administer correct cyclical dosage. in age globalisation open border integrate capital markets, would difficult do. in short, little suggest monetary policymakers’ strength lie fine-tune business cycle. monetary policy far good suit long-term safeguard price stability. in consider appropriate policy mix monetary union, term stability growth pact mean role fiscal policy undoubtedly occupy centre stage. in field budgetary policy, several country considerable difficulty fulfil exist european commitments. these provide 3% limit general government deficit ratio and, time, budgetary position surplus close balance entire business cycle. since deficit germany, 2.8% gdp, already come quite close 3% ceiling last year - mainly account tax reform - risk might exceed limit current year become greater. furthermore, doubt whether german fiscal policy able deliver self-commitment - reaffirm spring - achieve budget position close balance 2004 unless cut public payments. give budgetary problem also exist emu country view weak cyclical situation, call increasingly make relaxation fiscal policy rule european monetary union. the main point criticism exist provision maastricht treaty stability growth pact allege inadequate cyclical flexibility. it claimed, example, rule force budgetary policy act procyclical manner counter requirement stabilise economy. such criticism not, however, take due account rule european stability growth pact. it is, fact, precisely task pact ensure government budget “breath” business cycle without breach deficit limit maastricht treaty. such flexibility achieve budgetary position least close balance medium term - words, see cycle whole. if condition met, automatic stabiliser develop full effect within 3% margin. the fact is, even so, narrow “safety margin” limit country blame fiscal policy rules. it rather case failure past year bring structurally balance budget. “softening” fiscal policy rule would undermine credibility maastricht treaty european stability growth pact. the associate capital market effect would also adverse implication economic growth. the exist fiscal

strengthen functional independence european central bank thus facilitate stability-oriented monetary policy single currency area. water rule might give rise conflict fiscal policy monetary policy. therefore, german fiscal policymakers, too, must shirk responsibility make consolidation effort achieve budgetary position close balance medium term. if one wish achieve balance budget business cycle - words, intend benchmark structural deficit zero - order ass fiscal position single year analytically necessary adjust budget balance cyclical effects. this require addition to, modification of, stability growth pact. it is, fact, matter implement rule stability programme consistent manner. and naturally also imply circumstance call question nominal maximum limit deficit 3%. a i see - i would

* mr. chairman, lady gentlemen. it pleasure participate ambitious conference nordic financial market investment opportunities. i remark today mainly focus aspect relate iceland. size separate iceland nordic countries, denmark, finland, norway sweden. other factor separate nordic country well. finland member european union economic monetary union, emu, well. denmark sweden member european union outside emu. norway iceland outside european union maintain close tie it, particularly european economic area agreement. that agreement make norway iceland part single market european union, entail among thing oblige maintain financial market legislation, fully conform european union. the nordic country different monetary regimes. finland member emu, denmark link emu erm ii agreement entail danish krona closely tie euro. sweden, norway iceland choose inflation-targeting regime monetary framework (iceland march 2001). thus, price stability main objective monetary policy country fact become recognize single target monetary policy numerous countries. the reason emphasis price stability create best condition balance growth increase welfare. the icelandic financial market develop rapidly last ten fifteen years. it small market definition, nevertheless institutional set-up large industrial countries. aside central bank, include commercial banks, save banks, security companies,

activity institution hand unify financial supervisory authority broadly legal power follow method standard supervisory agency european countries. important rationalisation take place icelandic financial system. until year ago, two main commercial bank fully government own host so-called investment credit funds. the fund unify single institution, subsequently privatised. the government also reduce stake commercial bank recent year intend largely fully privatise end current electoral term next year. the privatisation process create opportunity continue rationalisation financial system create ample opportunity period ahead, include close tie foreign financial institutions. it tempt put recent economic development iceland context development nordic country decade ago. liberalisation icelandic financial market le complete mid 1990´s last restriction movement capital iceland country removed. our liberalisation come year late nordic countries. you recall nordic countries, liberalisation follow boom period economy, partly largely fuel rapid growth credit case large fiscal deficits. at time, country pursue fix exchange rate policy vis-a-vis ecu. development domestic economy fix exchange rate policy gradually undermined, rapid credit growth bank result weaken loan portfolio asset price fell, exchange rate fixety give way floating, currency depreciate inflation rose. the current account balance payment also deteriorated. 2 bi review 55/2002 development iceland latter half 1990´s present time resemble many way experience nordic country decade early differ also important respects. soon liberalisation, domestic demand pick up, fuel rapidly rise credit wake intensify competition financial sector sharp increase credit availability. at time, iceland pursue fix exchange rate policy rigidly fix nordic country do decade earlier. the expansion economy end last decade lead rapid rise current account deficit, climax year 2000. through effect tighten monetary policy, exchange rate króna gradually appreciated. in spring year 2000, expectation market shift variety reasons, one concern current account deficit. subsequently króna begin depreciate continue le uninterrupted whole orderly fashion period year half end november last year. by time, fall third currencies. this large depreciation without precedent countries. in respect, i might mention, since stockholm since i draw parallel nordic countries, swedish krona fell broadly similar proportion period time exchange rate float late 1992. the depreciation icelandic króna feed domestic price inflation pick significantly. late last year, exchange rate clearly overshoot sharply downside. then expectation turn around again. it clear, among things, economy cool current account deficit shrink fast. optimism also arise prospect improve inflation spike, follow exchange rate depreciation, would subside quickly again. the króna begin appreciate regain important part early value. inflation subside sharply year expectation inflation target 2½ percent achieve end year. the large current account deficit record year 2000 also begin shrink rapidly, fell half year 2001 outlook approximate balance year. these development demonstrate resilience adaptability icelandic economy; move large current account deficit virtual balance course two year reduce inflation border two-digit rate 2½ percent within one year. although development iceland show many characteristic nordic country post-liberalisation rapid expansion, credit expansion, current account deficit, exchange rate depreciation on, iceland escape difficulty suffer bank system countries. icelandic bank credit grow rapidly late 1990’s year 2000 sizable portion credit expansion finance credit abroad. the capital adequacy ratio bank fell nevertheless remain comfortably minimum require internationally recognise levels. the year 2001 also turn quite favourable banks, development continue large current year. consequently, capital position bank improve major bank institution relatively strong capital adequacy ratio present. loan loss increased, expect wake credit expansion, nowhere scale experience nordic country decade ago much le downturn icelandic economy around 1990. the conclusion draw is, therefore, icelandic bank system weather relatively turbulent post-liberalization boom period 2000 2001 pretty well well

1 roger w ferguson, jr: the propose check clear 21st century act speech mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice-chairman board governor u federal reserve system, subcommittee financial institution consumer credit committee financial services, u.s. house representatives, 25 september 2002. * * * i would like thank subcommittee invite discus h.r. 5414, propose check clear 21st century act. this bill, similar proposal board send congress late last year, remove exist legal barrier use new technology check process hold promise efficient check collection system. the board commend representative ferguson ford introduce bill. technological advance check process check process far efficient was. le fifty year ago, clerk hand sort million check day. in 1960s, bank industry begin use mechanical high-speed check process equipment read sort checks, redesign automate processing. today, banks, thrifts, credit unions, i collectively refer banks, process 40 billion check consumers, businesses, government write year. legal impediments, however, prevent bank industry fully use new electronic technologies, digital imaging, improve check process efficiency provide improve service customers. this exist law require original paper check present payment unless bank involve agree otherwise. we see requirement constrain technological adoption follow check collection process. after bank's customer deposit check bank, bank typically transport check branch atm deposit central operation center. the check usually send one intermediary -- federal reserve bank correspondent bank -- clearinghouse collection ultimately deliver bank draw payment. during step process, check must physically ship destination air grind transportation. of course, bank agree accept check electronically, large number bank unite state make infeasible one bank obtain agreement bank even large proportion them. therefore, legal change need facilitate use technology could improve check process efficiency, lead substantial reduction transportation check process costs. h.r. 5414 make changes. propose check clear 21st century act the propose check clear 21st century act solve longstanding dilemma -- foster check truncation early check collection return process without mandate bank accept check electronic form. the term check truncation refer number arrangement original paper check remove collection return process. currently, typical check truncation arrangements, electronic information truncate check present bank draw rather original paper check. the act facilitate check truncation create new negotiable instrument call substitute check, would permit bank truncate original checks, process check information electronically, deliver substitute check bank want continue receive paper checks. a substitute check, would legal equivalent original check, would include information contain original check -- is, image front back original check well machine-readable number appear bottom check. under act, bank could long demand receive original check, could still demand receive paper check. bank would likely receive mix original check substitute checks. because substitute check could process like original checks, bank would need invest new technology otherwise change current check process operations. 2 bi review 54/2002 bank could use new authority provide legislation number different ways. for example, bank would long need send courier every afternoon branch atm pick check customer deposited. instead, digital image check could transmit electronically location bank's operation center processing. not would quick efficient, could permit bank establish branch atm remote location provide late deposit cut-off hour customers. moreover, act would give bank flexibility transmit check electronically long distances, create substitute check location near ultimate destination, example bank check drawn, substantially reduce time cost associate physical transportation. by enable bank industry reduce reliance physical transportation, propose act would also reduce risk check may lose delay transit. today, bad weather routinely delay check shipment occasion check destroy plane crashes. the bank industry's extensive reliance air transportation underscore aftermath september 11 tragedy, air transportation come standstill flow check slow dramatically. during week attacks, federal reserve banks' daily check float, normally hundred million dollars, balloon $47 billion. have propose legislation effect time bank use robust electronic infrastructure check collection, bank would able collect many check transmit electronic check information across country present substitute check pay banks. finally, many bank hope use authority provide legislation streamline process check must return unpaid. today, bank process incoming check determine check return, reprocess incoming check pull le one percent check return unpaid. many bank indicate u would find cost effective use image system generate substitute check return rather outsort return check check presented. the act might also good position bank provide new improve service customers. for example, bank might allow corporate customer transmit deposit electronically. because act likely encourage great investment image technology, bank might also able expand customers' access enhance account information check image internet. in addition, bank might able resolve customer inquiry easily quickly today access check images. the act design provide bank additional flexibility process check require bank accept substitute check place original checks. the act not, however, require bank accept check electronic form require bank use new authority grant act create substitute checks. this market-based approach permit bank decide whether make use new authority. this decision base bank's internal business case analysis, ass cost benefit use new authority. we believe market change arise revision check law result substantial cost savings. clearly, substitute check process manner original checks, recipient substitute check incur little additional process costs. recipients, however, incur additional cost relate act's customer protection disclosure requirements. it difficult, however, estimate overall cost savings. different bank take different approach toward use new authority grant act. each bank's use new authority depend technology infrastructure strategy, physical infrastructure, customer business profiles. thus, magnitude cost savings, depend rate bank begin use new authority, difficult determine. we recognize challenge policy issue propose law, aspect legislation generate spirit discussion, relate customer protections. current check law protect customer unauthorized debit accounts. a customer already claim bank unauthorized charge, bank may liable interest amount unauthorized charge consequential damage wrongful dishonor subsequently present checks.1 the propose legislation apply exist protection substitute checks. there are, however, differ view whether additional customer protection necessary substitute check and, so, extensive protection be. we believe 1 u.c.c. §4-401(a) §4-402 bi review 54/2002 3 that, determine form protection take, associate benefit cost need carefully balanced. federal reserve board authority regulate payment system we understand debate regard whether federal reserve board already sufficient statutory authority adopt regulation concept embody propose legislation. although congress give board authority regulate check system aspect payment system, believe authority sufficiently broad enable u adopt regulation accomplish purpose act. in 1987 expedite fund availability act (efaa), congress give board broad authority regulate "any aspect payment system, include receipt, payment, collection, clear checks; relate function payment system respect checks" order carry efaa.2 the efaa also provide board's regulation supersede inconsistent provision state law, include uniform commercial code.3 in efaa, congress direct board consider requiring, regulation, number measure improve check system.4 many measure focus improve process unpaid check return bank first deposit. other suggest measure relate check truncation. the board use authority efaa make several important improvement check system.5 the board's ability adopt rule improve check system hampered, however, efaa's limitation board's ability impose allocate risk loss liability relate payment transactions.6 the efaa authorize board impose allocate among depository institution risk loss liability, amount check give rise loss liability, except bad faith. these limitation prevent board adopt regulation important innovation could substantially improve efficiency check system. for example, board cannot adopt regulation change call propose check clear 21st century act, bill affect right end user check (including business consumers), particular right receive original checks, allocate liability amount check also interest, litigation costs, case consequential damages. conclusion in conclusion, although increase number payment make electronically, clear check continue play important role nation's payment system foreseeable future. we believe that, long run, concept embody propose check clear 21st century act spur use new technology improve efficiency nation's check collection system provide good service bank customers. because act result substantial cost savings, would also desirable begin obtain save near future, ideally bill's propose 2006 effective date. there technical matter current version bill could improve clarified, look forward work committee consider legislation. thank time i would happy answer questions. 2 12 u.s.c. §4008(c) 3 12 u.s.c. §4007(b) 4 12 u.s.c. §4008(b) 5 the board adopt rule substantially revise process bank return unpaid checks, expedite receipt check depositary bank ensure prompt notice large-dollar return checks. in addition, board adopt rule enhance legal ability private-sector bank obtain same-day final settlement check present specify time, spur competition provision check clear services, improve efficiency, speed collection many checks. 6 section 611(f) efaa state "the board authorize impose allocate among depository institution risk loss liability connection aspect payment system, include receipt, payment, collection, clear checks, relate function payment system respect checks. liability subsection shall exceed amount check give rise loss liability, and, bad faith, damages, any, suffer proximate consequence act omission give rise loss liability."

no, i think so. disintermediation unbroken trend, may see corporate bond issuance, hold fairly well. furthermore, financial market prove fit serve investors’ needs. to disappoint investors, may seem cynical. but think context account cheats. once true figure become know investors, equity valuation align correct fundamentals. once transparency, market work magic. the market cannot blame wrongdoing dishonest market participants. but definitely need adjust incentive good transparency. balance sheet fraud criminal offence, trivial one. tough sentence might help make clear. strange may sound, market turbulence wake faulty account indication effective financial market are. 2 bi review 54/2002 iii. turmoil financial market confine equity market advance economies. emerge market suffer host financial crisis past decade. the recent crisis occur turkey, argentina, uruguay brazil. in contrast early financial crises, today’s investor discriminate good individual borrowers. emerge market economy protect certain extent contagion pursue sound policies. when argentina default last december, vast majority emerge market country pursue good macroeconomic policy escape unscathed. the stability – instability – international financial market owe much framework crisis prevention crisis resolution. monetary policymakers make major contribution international financial community’s thoroughgoing approach crisis prevention. with regard crisis prevention, exist broad consensus. all necessary step take get incentive right — mean incentive creditor debtors. what measure country take strengthen resilience? the basic recommendation pursue sound consistent policies. liberalise capital flow beneficial emerge markets. but sequence right. they start stable long-term capital flows, fdi, deregulate volatile short-term capital flow last. a capital-account liberalisation progresses, financial supervision need keep pace. supervision need become ever effective order reduce vulnerability domestic financial sector. the asian country crisis, example, grossly neglect link capital-account liberalisation independent bank supervision. prudent public debt management another key measure crisis prevention. government need contain short-term external debt, particularly denominate foreign currency. over long term, stable capital inflow emerging-market country secure pursue sustainable policies. but quite enough. transparency counts. financial market player want base decision-making hard facts. country seek access financial market must provide reliable economic financial data timely basis – like company do. the financial stability forum summarise good practice list 12 key standard codes. implement standard code effective tool make country le prone crisis. focus solely emerge market prevention international financial crisis give incomplete picture, however. it would obviously helpful advance country grant liberal access product markets. the current round trade negotiation set motion doha late last year therefore bear stability international financial markets, too. during 1990s, rapid increase lend emerge markets. moreover, composition lend community changed. in 1990s, private sector account average almost 80 per cent net capital flow emerge markets, compare 35 per cent 1980s. a bond issue supplement – case replace – international bank lending, number creditor increased. therefore, day handful creditor could negotiate debt workout know "london club" definitely belong past. finally, since mid 1990s private capital flow emerge market dominate foreign direct investment flows, stable external finance source comparison volatile portfolio investment bank lending. since mid-1990s, crisis usually resolve provision – sometimes extremely large – financial assistance package imf. this practice, however, set wrong incentive participants. international financial market proper function private creditor investor reap benefit decision also bear loss cause unfavourable developments. violate principle imf inject massive financial aid time crisis inevitably encourage excessive risk-taking investors. such behaviour – also term moral hazard – contribute emerge market economy overwhelm debt undermine willingness reform borrow countries. therefore, need rearrange incentive improve framework crisis resolution. this framework must provide orderly debt workout event financial crisis comprise balance burden-sharing private public sector line respective roles. bi review 54/2002 3 limit access official lend core future framework crisis resolution. great ex ante clarity scale official finance help guard debtor creditor moral hazard. exceptional finance reserve truly exceptional case require substantial justification ex ante ex post. strict credible limit access imf finance call private sector involvement regular basis. this key improve function international financial markets. investor cannot reasonably expect bail-out great reason practise effective risk management. in way, debtor great reason undertake necessary adjustment reform order secure access financial markets. if framework put place, moral hazard distort investment decisions. private sector involvement crisis resolution take variety forms. priority give approach foster cooperation debtor creditors. that would include voluntary approach “collective action clauses” private debt contracts. such clause substantially reduce risk litigation asset attachment, majority creditor agree debt restructuring. the imf propose sovereign debt restructure mechanism similar national bankruptcy code enterprises. however, many question practical legal nature remain open, statutory approach available years. any reshape international financial architecture therefore concentrate adjust incentive revamp imf lend policy way i set out. this would automatically entail enhance role private sector crisis resolution. iv. financial market turmoil also raise concern stability national financial systems. prudent financial regulation supervision foundation financial system stability. why central bank involve require constant clarification. there good reason advocate central bank involvement financial regulation supervision. let’s start financial supervision. financial system stability prerequisite efficient conduct monetary policy. consequently, ec treaty call european system central bank contribute stability financial system (art. 105(5)ec). macro-prudential supervision best interest central banks. in conduct monetary policy operate payment systems, central bank gain valuable information stability market participants. "the marry micro- macro-prudential analysis", bi general manager andrew crockett put it, allow u exploit synergy monetary policy financial supervision. in field financial regulation, eu currently deliberate whether introduce “lamfalussy model”, apply security regulation bank insurance sector well. the ecofin council european parliament would thus make decision framework envisage legislation – know “level 1” – regulatory committee would decide technical detail new law – “level 2”. in “lamfalussy model”, regulatory committee comprise representative ministry finance. however, “level 2” need draw expertise central banks. why so? for bank industry, one main task european regulator consist translate internationally agree standard european law: basle ii, new minimum capital requirements, next. central bank expert basle ii, since substantially involve negotiate new capital accord basle committee bank supervision. they truly familiar detail new framework knowledge indispensable eu legislative process. but detail count. the regulation bank industry even large bear real economy regulation security industry does. bank regulation may affect competitiveness overall economy various way owe national specific financial systems. central bank expert national financial systems. exploit specific knowledge central bank offer regulatory process – currently case well-established bank advisory committee – something i regard crucial. attempt rid either financial regulation financial supervision central bankers’ influence backfire point future. prudent risk management would prevent risk materialising. 4 bi review 54/2002 v. besides raise issue systemic stability, financial disturbance also affect real economy, irrespective generate turbulence first place. transmission real economy work via three main channels. the channel receive attention late market downturn also least effective one euro area: wealth effect. a portfolio shrink line stock valuations, consumer tend cut expenditure, theory goes. european consumer hold small portion portfolio stocks. for example, ecb estimate 10 per cent permanent decline stock price euro area would reduce consumption maximum 0.19 per cent. this compare significantly high estimate us. a investors’ habit change euro area, wealth effect expect gain slowly importance. the second channel – probably important one euro – direct indirect impact fickle stock market business finance costs. equity finance become expensive, investor le eager buy new share demand high risk premia. bank credit hard come by, potential collateral shrink value. and, investor become risk-averse, rise spread corporate bond may make capital market finance expensive. give surge capital costs, marginal investment project become unprofitable. the third channel adverse financial development may impinge real economy describe “negative sentiment”. a certain sense crisis tend weaken confidence. however, current situation entirely clear whether financial market disturbance predominantly cause effect downward revision high-flying expectations. the impact, i suppose, work directions. both financial market real economy suffer post-bubble blues. business consumer short confidence long worries. financial, economic political uncertainty rise parallel. after “golden nineties” pendulum swing back. it may even swing back far overshoot like exchange rate tend do. unfortunately, prozac alleviate post-bubble blues. an in-depth analysis data may help clarify picture. the situation good sombre mood suggests, although admittedly good hop for. economic growth euro area economy subdue year. expectation run far ahead economic recovery. the downward revision early upbeat expectation narrow unusually large gap high-flying expectation assessment current situation. the business consumer climate suggest slow start le vigorous recovery. lead indicator not, however, point another economic downturn. recent price development bolster consumption. the euro area inflation rate 2.1 % (august) almost back range ecb council regard price stability. both short-term long-term real interest rate average hamper investment. liquidity ample, monetary condition favourable. monetary policy expansionary. what, then, stand way decisive economic recovery? we need honest: euro area able produce self-sustained economic recovery without u first pull u economic trough. this time, overseas business partner still struggle unwind economic financial imbalance build “golden nineties” late bubble economy. the unwind process take long expect rather optimistic assessment early year. home-grown structural weakness felt keenly euro area. there shortage analysis. there “to do” list lie desk everyone concerned. there backlog term concrete action, especially field labour market flexibility. adjust incentives, reduce regulation eliminate rigidity help unleash force economic growth. the euro area must put position kick self-sustained economic upswing. tackle reform decisively important least term bolster confidence, appropriate – and, incidentally, effective long-term – antidote post-bubble blue “prozac” might be. bi review 54/2002 5 vi. in time uncertainty abounds, monetary policy need stabilise factor. euro area monetary policy gear maintain price stability. give financial market turbulence, monetary policymakers broaden focus include share price definition price stability? well, opinion, good idea. the objection target asset price weigh heavily. to begin with, issue define appropriate asset price level. there way central bank make “diagnosis” superior market. then, even matter diagnosis issue could solve satisfaction, stabilise consumer price stabilise asset price might call diverge policy paths. central bank could well find face dilemma decide goal give priority. the fact bubble tend occur period low inflation accentuate potential conflict. and, last least, question “moral hazard”. central bank would need respond perfect symmetry overshoot undershoot stock prices. financial market would become severely distort market participant come conclusion central bank would let enjoy return market bail market go downhill. instead, stick try test approach stabilise general price level product service markets. nonetheless, monetary policy contribute sound development asset prices. the eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy emphasis money supply first pillar strategy. an adequate money supply – is, money supply line potential output growth – necessary condition prevent emergence speculative bubbles. also, low inflation rate foster long-term investment help stabilise asset prices. this summer, euro area monetary policy confront conflict signals: monetary growth continue strong. it high growth rate owe much low opportunity cost ongoing portfolio reallocation. give weak final demand, risk ample liquidity channel inflationary pressure regard quite low. a serious risk price stability price crude oil, begin climb upwards wake increase political tension middle east. further non-negligible risk price stability stem potential weaken stability growth pact. some european countries, among own, need make intensify effort balance budgets. the pact symmetrical low limit: balance budget economic cycle require government run surplus economy well. in trough economic cycle, government allow automatic stabiliser develop full effect budget deficit ceiling 3 per cent gdp. not least, demographic development require budget balance economic cycle whole. despite uncertainties, market eurosystem expect recovery continue. the euro area cycle unlikely experience double dip. in actual fact, moderate pace economic expansion euro area set continue, least macroeconomic policy supportive: 1. monetary condition favourable growth: liquidity ample. real interest rates, long- short-term, historical averages. 2. the euro area display fundamental imbalance – labour market notable exception. the balance current account reflect sustainable save rate. 3. the world economy set stay – admittedly, steep – path growth. 4. both investor consumer soon make investment consumption spend put downturn. bear fact mind, govern council ecb belief risk price stability balanced. therefore, decide stay hold last assess monetary policy stance two week ago. 6 bi review 54/2002 vii. financial turbulence leave monetary policy maker cold. a undoubtedly know already, central banker cautious lot. we easily buy market euphoria buy gloomy scenarios. in order contain financial market disturbances, need improve international financial architecture, conduct financial regulation supervision prudent manner, adhere stability-oriented monetary policy. bi review 54/2002 1 alan greenspan: policy coordination speech

malakul na ayudhya, deputy governor bank thailand, occasion the inauguration monetary policy committee, bank ghana, accra, 10 september 2002. * * * mr. chairman, governors, member mpc, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i consider great honour invite bank ghana take part important event, inauguration mpc. i would also like thank governor paul acquah bank ghana warm hospitality extend staffs. it certainly make first visit ghana memorable one. before i begin talk assign topic central bank independence: what doe it mean? the bank thailand's experience, i would like offer congratulations. the first one governor paul acquah bank ghana successful launch mpc. the ceremony take place yesterday impressive. the message come across clearly government place great importance upon bank ghana's independence much reliance place mpc successful conduct monetary policy price stability consequently sustainable growth achieved. the exact word use finance minister essential pillar macroeconomic stability. my second congratulation also governor paul acquah achieve central bank independence. i note bank ghana establish 1957. the bank thailand establish 1942 manage gain independence legal mean yet. so, one us. lady gentlemen, issue “central bank independence monetary policy” much close heart central bankers, i happy able share think it. in thailand's case issue much discuss among concern throughout 60 year period since bank thailand's establishment 1942. one famous governor bank thailand certainly long serve governor (more 10 years) say central bank independence i quote “…if policy question profound might undermine principle lead catastrophe, central bank governor may voice disapproval it, also ultimate prerogative resign governorship”. dr. puey ungphakorn outstanding governor give great importance bank thailand carry function independent institution free political governmental domination, undaunted influential powers-that-be. for sake country-and use delicate art central banker, dr. puey protest government whenever act righteously. dr. puey believe government must faith central bank provide benefit country whole. the governor senior management enough courage voice critical, even dissent opinion action necessary. his view governor senior management cannot saints, must carry work adhere principle honesty integrity. neither act indifferently, necessary reprimand government, must so. dr. puey determine protect official political interference. he issue regulation prohibit bank thailand official stand political office write article politics, still force today. i totally agree dr. puey thus say practice without fail. however, since governor puey leave office concentrate another job love dearly, is, rector thammasart university, nine governor period almost 30 years. out nine, two retire office, seven either fire pressure leave post government reason another case cause removal nothing performance conduct monetary policy. 2 bi review 53/2002 how could happened? the answer lie current bank thailand act spell lay mechanism central bank achieve independence. governor deputy governor political appointees. they appoint his majesty king upon recommendation minister finance approve cabinet. there definite term office. there protective clause act clearly spell cause removal. the popular reason give government fire governor one “suitability”. none nine governor chance resign office protest government policy advocate dr. puey. in past 7 years, 5 governor include present one office 1 year. however, important note well sometimes relationship minister finance governor central bank turn sour policy conflict personality mismatch lead eventual conflict. for instance, current minister finance present governor work well together great respect other. what solution? i think best solution legalize central bank independence spell clearly central bank legislation power, duties, responsibility accountability central bank. accord draft amendment bank thailand act consider parliament near future, important feature are: 1. selection committee, comprise outstanding thai senior statesmen, nominate appropriate candidate governorship. 2. definite term office governorship (4-5 year norm extend another term). 3. clause spell clearly cause removal governor. 4. court director comprise governor deputy governor least five member oversee/manage/entrust overall affair bank thailand. question remain whether governor chairman ceo well. there pro con issue. 5. monetary policy board chair governor consist internal external directors. external director appoint government. responsibility accountability board spell clearly. it important qualify external director provide wide perspective perhaps counter balance views. since draft amendment bank thailand act take time enact long legal parliamentary process (we expect enact middle next year), decide go ahead establishment monetary policy committee (mpc). the mpc consist seven member governor chair committee. there two external advisor serve committee, provide independent think perspectives. the committee meet every six week pre-announced schedule. the main responsibility mpc comprise of: • set direction monetary policy objective maintain price stability, • examine approve monetary condition policy stance report, and, • oversee quarterly inflation report. why adopt implement inflation target new policy anchor? a fix exchange rate abandon crisis, necessary new nominal anchor. at first bank thailand use monetary aggregate policy target imf program. the bank target domestic money supply order ensure macroeconomic consistency order obtain price stability. however, many country recent years, use money supply target work well thai economy relationship monetary aggregate output become increasingly unstable. this due change people's spend behavior popularity new money-related innovations, credit card electronic cash cards. after study experimental implementation, bank thailand formally adopt inflation-targeting regime start may 2000. the new nominal anchor allow bank thailand set explicit target core inflation order stabilize price condition. since adoption, target core inflation set range 0-3.5 percent remain so. in addition, bi review 53/2002 3 adopt 14-day repurchase rate policy instrument well employ macro econometric model conduct forecast. permit elaborate mention issue regard implementation inflation target framework. the appropriate price index use consumer price index (cpi) exclude item cannot influence monetary policy still able retain sufficient price information. hence use core inflation exclude volatile item raw food oil prices. this core inflation le variation historical data, average, close headline inflation long run. we say target core inflation effectively control long-run inflation monetary policy accommodate supply shocks. in light this, target range 0-3.5 percent set base thailand major trade partners' history inflation. a choice policy rate, 14-day repurchase rate select key instrument. with instrument, bank thailand able manage appropriate level liquidity market. the advantage 14-day repurchase rate rate long maturity trade volume much high thus provide effective policy signal market. it also advantage rate short maturities, 1-day 7-day, impose much burden bank thailand take care liquidity maintain policy rate. therefore, repurchase rate 1-day 7-day freely determine market forces. in sum, 14-day rp rate leave room short-term rate flexibility adjust move line money market liquidity conditions. the policy rate initially set 1.5 percent per annum raise 2.5 percent june 2001 realign money market interest rates. follow global economic slowdown, policy rate cut twice december 2001 january 2002 help stimulate economy. the rate stand 2 percent per annum. have policy rate clearly announced, bank thailand able provide transparent monetary policy signal market. this help provide framework effective transmission mechanism. after adjustment policy rate, rate repurchase market adjust line policy rate. bank thereafter adjust portfolio change rate loan deposits. the transmission mechanism work eventually lead desirable result real sector. the policy impact usually take 8 quarter transmission process. nevertheless, case thailand crisis, bank system yet fully function this, certain extent, undermine effectiveness monetary policy. the macro-model give range core inflation probability distribution describe fanchart. this fanchart take account relate uncertainty give flexibility range forecasts. base likely outcome, mpc announce expect rate inflation year next year. accord recent assessment, core inflation 0.5-1 percent 2002 0.5-1.5 percent 2003, provide growth 3-4 percent 2002 2003. finally enhance transparency process, inflation report publish quarterly basis provide forecast inflation economic growth next eight quarter along quarterly press release. for final part talk, i would like dwell issue central bank independence. the first issue whether central bank much independence sense harmful. to this, i incline say yes, rare circumstance. bad decision relate monetary financial institution operation damage wide impact. to prevent happening, mechanism instal monetary policy committee financial institution policy committee comprise qualify external director important policy measure make group decisions. the second issue independence central bank be? i believe central bank independent within government minister finance accountable parliament issue relate macro economic, fiscal, monetary financial system matters. i agree absolutely governor paul acquah monetary fiscal policy must harmonize order achieve macro stability, mean minister finance governor central bank must work hand hand achieve proper policy mix fiscal monetary policy sustainable growth achieved. 4 bi review 53/2002 lady gentlemen, i feel i take enough time already. therefore, i would like conclude central bank consider independence perform duty achieve maintain price stability without political governmental interference, honesty integrity work hand hand ministry finance achieve balance fiscal monetary policy mix lead macro stability sustainable growth. inflation target approach effective mean achieve central bank independence encompass 4 important ingredients: operational independence, responsibility, transparency accountability. other mean effective 4 require ingredients. i hope i share topic central bank independence experience adopt inflation target nominal anchor us food thoughts. finally, i truly wish congratulate bank ghana successful launch monetary policy committee. thank you. bi review 53/2002 1 t t mboweni: recent financial economic development south africa speech mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, eighty-second ordinary general meet shareholders, 27 august 2002. * * * introduction the south african reserve bank confront many challenge past year. i am, however, glad say that, previous occasions, bank cop well. although grind lose contain inflation owe exogenous shock affect economy, remedial action take bring inflation rate towards target levels. a period consolidation bank sector handle effective manner ensure continue domestic financial stability. attention give regulatory structure bank sector continue protect fund depositor ensure intermediation save run smoothly. the efficiency effectiveness internal administrative procedure improve considerable progress make transform composition bank’s staff good reflect demographic country. recent economic development the south african economy also well rapidly change political economic world. a comprehensive review recent economic development south africa contain reserve bank’s annual economic report, release morning. in address i therefore wish highlight follow developments: south africa, like emerging-market economies, affect considerably attack unite state america september 2001, uncertainty create politically well business world, continue relatively high level oil price strong downturn world economic activity. the result decline volume export second half 2001 affect domestic economic growth. in addition, great risk aversion investment develop country mark impact capital flow south africa. in response weakness world economic activity, monetary policy country become accommodative interest rate bring significantly. in countries, fiscal measure also take stimulate activity. these measure seem bear fruit world economic recovery significant benefit south africa. the important effect world political economic development south africa contribute materially volatility external value rand past year. after value rand relatively stable first six month 2001, depreciate steeply second half year. a result, nominal effective exchange rate rand decrease 34 per cent second half year. towards end 2001 external value rand begin recover weight exchange rate recoup 20 per cent loss end may 2002. in follow two month rand fluctuate around new level but, balance, decline 7 per cent. this bring nominal effective exchange rate rand back 27 per cent level begin 2001. a number factor contribute depreciation value rand 2001. these include weak export performance strong increase import dividend payment non-residents. the resultant deficit current account balance payment accompany net outflow portfolio capital. this outflow stem perceive high risk invest emerging-market economies, problem experience argentina late brazil, instability zimbabwe, unfounded expectation imminent exchange-control relaxation south africa. eventually, international investor begin regard external value rand one-way bet, exporter delay repatriate foreign-earned currency importer switch finance foreign domestic sources. in words, typical speculative bandwagon effect. after authority remind market sound economic fundamental south africa statement 20 december 2001, become clear exchange rate rand 2 bi review 53/2002 over-reacted, whole process reversed. exporter stop delay transfer proceeds, importer shift back foreign finance purchase international investor will invest large sum domestic share bonds. international condition calm somewhat world economy begin recover. at time current account south africa’s balance payment move surplus, mainly owe decline dividend payment rest world rise exports. the depreciate external value rand undoubtedly strengthen price competitiveness domestic producer could lead strong export performance. substitute domestically produce good import good promote economic growth. the south african economy also prove quite resilient world economic slowdown period review. despite synchronise decline growth major trade partners, growth rate real gross domestic product decline moderately 3,4 per cent 2000 2,2 per cent 2001 2,3 per cent first half 2002. the positive production growth generally depress world economic condition could attribute continue strong domestic demand good services. final consumption expenditure household general government contribute pick-up spending, large contribution come investment, especially fix investment private sector. after decline second half 2001, volume export also begin rise first half 2002. a could expect strong domestic final demand good services, save performance south african economy remain low level. in past five years, gross save ratio gross domestic product continue fluctuate 15 16 per cent, low finance growth performance country need create enough employment opportunities. the consistently low save ratio persist despite substantial improvement government saving. after large dissaver year ago, government make positive contribution save since 2001. corporate saving, still represent mainstay domestic save effort, weaken considerably past five years, household save remain low levels. the steady growth performance south africa accompany substantially high labour productivity. the real output per worker non-agricultural sector increase 1 per cent per year period 1985 1995, rise average annual rate nearly 41/2 per cent 1995 first half 2002. high labour productivity combine result increase output reduction formal-sector employment. producer prefer employ capital rather labour. economise utilisation labour resource part result decline user cost capital. but also bring factor decline gold price open economy international competition, make use cost-saving production method urgent. concert effort government reduce public-sector deficit contribute decline formal non-agricultural employment. more one million employment opportunity therefore lose since peak employment cycle 1989. employment growth occur largely informal sector economy form self-employment. unemployment south africa nevertheless remain major problem, nearly 30 per cent economically active population work. on monetary front, broadly define money supply grow vigorously 2001 first half 2002, reach year-on-year level 18,1 per cent june 2002. most growth form increase short medium-term deposit corporates. this could imply company uncertain outlook economy investor restructure portfolios. it may, however, also indication depositor position future spending. the risk monetary policy long run, close correlation rate increase money supply general level prices. the growth total bank credit extension measure twelve month move double-digit range towards end 2001, slow 9,6 per cent june 2002, compare 6,9 per cent june 2001. this increase occur mainly demand private sector fund arise largely increase trade finance, mortgage borrow households, instalment sale credit lease financing. in financial market private corporate bond market expand significantly past year government finance borrow requirement international capital markets. from bi review 53/2002 3 begin 2002, part companies’ need capital finance primary share market price share improve considerably. new record turnover level secondary bond share market attain year end june 2002. the decline discernible bond yield second half 1998 relate dwindle supply public-sector fixed-interest security low inflation expectation come abrupt end last quarter 2001. the depreciation rand result inflation fear drive bond yield sharply higher, mood bond market seem turn positive begin april 2002. monetary policy continue support fiscal policy secure financial stability. in fiscal year 2001/02 public-sector borrow requirement amount 0,6 per cent gross domestic product. in fiscal 1996/97 still high 5,6 per cent. this substantial improvement finance fiscus achieve efficient tax collection method discipline expenditure programmes. a result, rise public debt relative gross domestic product stop interest burden government ease considerably. this afford government opportunity grant significant tax relief expand infrastructural development. monetary policy after pursue relatively neutral monetary policy stance 2000 first half 2001, reserve bank relax monetary policy middle 2001. the neutral monetary policy stance maintain period low expect future rate inflation slowdown economic activity. however, twelve-month growth rate consumer price index exclude mortgage interest cost (cpix) continue rise steadily 6,5 per cent october 1999 8,1 per cent september 2000. this rise consumer price largely relate international developments, rise oil prices, general upward pressure international commodity price depreciation external value rand. although exogenous factor become threat monetary stability, domestic factor remain positive containment inflation. great stability domestic interest rate also seem warrant counter heighten volatility many financial markets. this policy stance highly effective sign secondary effect weak currency. in fact, inflationary expectation declined, nominal unit labour cost increase moderately growth money supply slow down. internationally oil price declined, world economic activity begin slow interest rate reduce aggressively. the twelve-month growth rate cpix turn around decline 6,5 per cent may 2001 5,8 per cent september. take development consideration, monetary policy committee decide relax monetary policy. the repurchase rate first reduce 100 basis point 15 june 2001 50 basis point 20 september 2001. this bring repurchase rate level 9,5 per cent, compare peak 21,85 per cent early october 1998. however, towards end 2001 become clear favourable environment inflation changed. subsequently, two important develop-ments lead reserve bank reconsider monetary policy stance. firstly, inflation target three year 2002 announce minister finance. the target 2003 keep unchanged annual average rate increase cpix 3 6 per cent, range low average 3 5 per cent next two years. this clearly reflect government’s commitment adjustment policy bring inflation rate low levels. secondly, external value rand begin depreciate sharply september. the pass-through depreciate exchange rate inflation surprisingly mute 2000, sharp downward movement rand last quarter 2001 inevitably significant impact inflation. before change challenge monetary policy deal external shock put undue pressure domestic inflation. the new challenge deal external shock begin significant impact current expect inflation, avoid inflation spiral. inflationary pressure begin pick last quarter 2001. food price initially main factor contribute acceleration inflation. these food price increase partly relate depreciate value rand domestic price approximate determine internationally since deregulation agriculture. in particular, maize price significantly affect 4 bi review 53/2002 depreciation value rand. the maize price wide economic significance south africa. white maize staple food many south african 90 per cent yellow maize use fee meat, dairy, poultry egg industries. apart depreciation value rand, supply demand factor also contribute double spot price white yellow maize june 2001 january 2002. late increase consumer price become broadly based, line sharp depreciation currency. rise expectation price increase become important factor inflationary process, clearly reflect pre-emptive buy durable good household fourth quarter 2001. a depreciate rand push price higher, twelve-month rate increase cpix start move upwards psychologically important level 6 per cent september 2001 9,9 per cent july 2002. the quarter-to-quarter rate increase cpix inflation even pronounced, rise seasonally adjust annualised level 6,8 per cent fourth quarter 2001 11,6 per cent first quarter 2002 12,1 per cent second quarter. the twelve-month rate increase all-goods production price index accelerate 7,8 per cent september 2001 even alarm level 14,4 per cent june 2002. these development soon indicate inflation target 2002 could jeopardy. moreover, give lag implementation monetary policy impact inflation, estimate 12 24 months, little monetary policy could rectify this. however, bank remain commit objective price stability policy become focus target 2003 2004. the first response bank rise inflationary pressure convene unscheduled meet monetary policy committee early january 2002. although exact feed-through depreciate value rand inflation still unclear stage, number development indicate might prudent adopt restrictive monetary policy stance. these development include reversal downward trend oil prices, indication high inflation expectation become entrenched, high wage demands, rapid rate increase unit labour cost large increase money supply bank credit extension. in view development monetary policy committee decide raise repurchase rate 100 basis point order prevent inflation spiral. monetary policy tighten march june meet monetary policy committee. in case repurchase rate increase 100 basis points, bring rate 12,5 per cent 14 june 2002. by march clear inflation expectation adversely affect depreciation rand. in addition concern continue high rate growth money-supply aggregate bank credit extension, state balance payment rise trend unit labour cost. it argue tight monetary policy stage could avoid drastic interest rate increase future strict stance successful dampen inflationary pressures. by june, apparent upward trend inflation inflation expectation maintain momentum, growth unit labour cost money supply development remain unfavourable. the monetary policy committee, however, also identify positive development could reduce pressure inflation. these development include partial recovery rand, appearance surplus current financial account balance payments, continue low level capacity utilisation maintenance fiscal discipline. the late forecast bank show that, give tighten stance monetary policy bar unforeseen negative shocks, inflation target 2003 could met. however, average annual rate increase cpix probably close upper end target range risk forecast upside. a such, seem unlikely monetary policy relax foreseeable future. although current stance monetary policy may perceive negative short-term growth employment creation, view must compare alternative even high future interest rate levels, inflation bring control. furthermore, tax concession grant last budget benefit consumption, significant depreciation external value rand promote production, particularly export goods. bi review 53/2002 5 exchange rate policy a outline earlier, external value rand come severe pressure second half 2001. the currency stabilise early 2002 strengthen slowly consistently end may. since begin june exchange rate rand fluctuate widely around newly establish levels. the rand continue negatively affect development emerge markets, event 2002 argentina brazil, example, could hamper short-term outlook rand. for reason reserve bank strongly support government’s policy remain exchange control regulation gradually relaxed. despite relatively volatile movement exchange rate rand even become apparent depreciation rand towards end 2001 base largely speculative transaction unrelated underlie conditions, thrust exchange rate policy remain unchanged. the exchange rate rand therefore essentially determine supply demand condition market foreign exchange. at time, remain state objective bank gradually close net oversold open foreign reserve position. the existence net oversold open position perceive source weakness rand, contribute negative sentiment towards currency. however, also recognise net open foreign reserve position reduce quickly, could contribute rand weakness. the bank therefore announce statement 14 october 2001 would future intervene purchase foreign exchange directly market reduce position. the net open foreign reserve position would instead expunge cash flow derive proceed privatisation government’s off-shore borrowing. this imply proceed source always use achieve objective. for example, part proceed sale transnet’s interest m-cell use reduce bank’s open position. in accordance objective, bank reduce net open foreign reserve position us$23,2 billion end september 1998 us$11,5 billion end january 2000, i.e. period overall strength balance payments. when overall balance payment begin deteriorate, open position bring far slowly us$9,0 billion end april 2001. the net open position reduce us$4,8 billion end july 2001 proceed obtain restructure anglo american corporation de beer mine company, foreign borrow government. the net open foreign reserve position reduce us$1,8 billion end july 2002 follow state approach bank adopt october 2001. this reduction basically result three major sources, namely transfer syndicate loan liability us$1,5 billion reserve bank national treasury; reopen exist dollar bond south african government raise us$274 million delivery oversold forward book; issue new us$1 billion bond national treasury delivery forward book. while bank remain commit eliminate net open foreign reserve position, current level us$1,8 billion position long perceive source vulnerability. financial stability international development also affect domestic financial stability past year. the attack unite state america 11 september 2001 illustrate enormous systemic risk financial system worldwide well key role central bank must play circumstances. the increase international linkage among financial institution add risk events. the weaken position japanese bank also continue source vulnerability inter-national financial markets. furthermore, corporate governance standard structures, well credibility account profession, question revelation corruption resultant failure number large well-known corporation unite state america. the corporate failure unite state impact significantly market worldwide, many stock exchange shed considerable value. this demonstrate importance restructure financial architecture. close home, trade financial link expose south africa contagion effect recent adverse development zimbabwe, closely monitored. 6 bi review 53/2002 domestically south african bank sector characterise process consolidation trigger difficulty small banks. this trend intensify announcement saambou bank limited, seventh-largest bank south africa, would place curatorship 9 february 2002. a result, significant withdrawal deposit small bank general boe bank limit particular. this spur reserve bank take proactive lead role coordinate action key player bank sector, lead agreement private public sector management liquidity recycle cash flow handle orderly exit saambou bank bank sector. the withdrawal deposit bank prompt joint action bank national treasury restore confidence depositors, guarantee deposit boe bank limited. boe also accelerate plan sale mortgage book firstrand bank manage liquidity position. the activity saambou bank boe merge big four bank south africa. the liquidity problem small bank induce cancel bank registration carry niche operations. other small bank redesign ownership structure case downsize balance sheets. despite development past year, south africa’s bank system remain sound. domestic bank well-managed sophisticate risk management well corporate governance structure place. bank well-capitalised, average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio 12,1 per cent end june 2002. this compare new high require capital adequacy ratio 10 per cent introduce october 2001. total bank fund grow 22,4 per cent year end

per cent 30 june 2001 70,5 per cent 30 june 2002. at latter date foreign bank operate south africa hold 8,4 per cent total bank assets, compare 6 per cent previous year. despite difficulty encounter past year, liquidity bank sector generally adequate. the average daily amount liquid asset hold june 2002 exceed prescribe prudential minimum 9 per cent. however, report profitability bank sector continue decline margin earn decrease operate expense increased. non-performing loan amount r26 billion june 2002. this represent 3 per cent total loan advances, compare well international standards. the provision make bank non-performing loan adequate, even term international best practice standards. the debt-servicing capacity household also show sign fragility. the ratio household debt disposable income household debt financial asset decrease past year. the single regulator the problem encounter bank sector early year illustrate definite manner important bank supervision south africa remain part function reserve bank. the blur boundary financial service provide banks, insurer security trader prompt certain develop country around world consolidate different supervisory agency one roof. it commonly recognise potential benefit assess risk management function financial conglomerate holistic basis attractive develop country integrate financial market ample regulatory resources. in south africa bank supervision function transfer central bank 1987 regard institution suit carry function. since then, even face many abnormal circumstances, bank supervision carry high international best practice. over period, experience show bank supervision closely align function reserve bank. with recent liquidity problem small banks, evident least-cost resolution bank crisis would always depend special collegial interaction registrar bank least four department bank. the policy formulation, decision making, co-ordination rapid execution many intervention bi review 53/2002 7 necessary would almost inconceivable situation supervision bank part bank. stability bank sector integral monetary policy transmission mechanism, central bank must always involve bank supervision. unlike financial institutions, bank potentially pose systemic risk nature contracts. their asset typically long term uncertain value, whereas liability generally short term certain value. the bank sector therefore prone contagion soon confidence bank undermined. these characteristic give rise commonly accept approach regulate bank discretionary manner. a rules-based approach bank regulation would inappropriate every case distress system unique. supervision consequently risk-based proactive. the bank supervision function reserve bank cause many problem frustrations, temptation pas responsibility another agency great. however, capacity perform effective bank supervision crucial price financial stability. after careful consideration issue, i therefore convince best interest south african economy bank supervision remain bank. at time, i also realise close co-operation exist different regulatory authority address need consolidate supervision. co-operative work arrangement regulator essential address ever-increasing demand sound regulation, hallmark consist decisiveness, timely action proactive intervention required. regulate bank sector the different approach adopt handle liquidity problem bank past year create considerable uncertainty principle apply regulate bank sector. this emphasis execution function make transparent business-like possible. the objective bank supervision ensure stability, efficiency depositor protection banking. a stable financial environment essential work economy attainment price stability. a sound bank system contribute effectiveness intermediation, maturity transformation, payment facilitation, credit allocation financial discipline. moreover, bank play important role collect savings, allocate resource provide liquidity. the registration bank first step achieve stability bank system. stability promote prevent applicant potentially destabilise weaknesses, unqualified unscrupulous manage-ment insufficient

adopt 25 principle contain core principle effective bank supervision basel committee bank supervision, construct effective supervisory structure country. in decide whether bank licence grant applicant, assessment make institution’s business plan, shareholding structure, capital base, director senior management, internal control project financial conditions. this evaluation application mechanical process, sense abstract subjective. every application regard unique. once bank establish must monitor continuously ensure remain fundamentally healthy. this monitor process involve quantitative qualitative assessment bank’s soundness. the quantitative assessment entail analysis evaluation define risk-based data receive bank monthly basis, determine whether within prescribe prudential limit whether financial position fall within acceptable norms. the qualitative assessment consist examination evaluation whether risk manage properly. this assessment do within framework corporate governance structures. despite every effort supervisor ensure healthy bank system, cannot guarantee safety soundness individual bank times. where bank encounter difficulties, special contingency measure applied. the general approach follow provide financial assistance 8 bi review 53/2002 bank distress experience temporary liquidity problems. by contrast, insolvent bank one ongoing liquidity problem require exit bank system orderly, efficient manner minimum loss depositor least harm public’s confidence bank system whole. special action take case temporary liquidity problem identified. a every case different, action may vary one case another. a broad framework contingency procedure nevertheless developed. a plan remedial action normally draw up, close co-operation bank concerned. possible solution may range new capital injection shareholder measure design attract retain large deposits. in addition, relevant bank may allow obtain liquidity discount liquid asset utilise minimum cash reserve cover cash outflows. if none measure solve liquidity problem bank distress, reserve bank may, lender last resort, approach special assistance certain circumstances. this

confront continue challenge keep ahead competition exist industry need able respond change demand embrace new activity replace present comparative advantage become impossible sustain - unfortunately bind happen cases. so first point market economy u stay, implies. we've also learn one condition necessary market economy function effectively framework macro-economic stability. for much post-war period macro-economic policy - country, include country - focus heavily short-term management aggregate demand economy. it pay little attention underlying, supply-side, capacity economy meet demand. face slow growth rise unemployment fiscal monetary policy used, combination, stimulate demand accelerate inflation worsen balance payment threaten run hand, brake slam everything go reverse. the go-stop policy cycle word produce familiar boom-bust business cycle. over time experience induce pervasive short-termism economic decision-making part business consumers. that increase short-termism turn lead increase amplitude business cycle, inflation rise progressively high economic peak peak unemployment rise progressively high economic trough trough. i convince that, others, really take board lesson experience. the requirement public debt gdp keep stable prudent level, borrow economic cycle limit finance investment spending, constrain use fiscal policy short-term instrument. and monetary policy give distinct role primary instrument short-term aggregate demand management, target retail price inflation, simply end itself, people still seem imagine, measure extent growth demand hold consistently broadly line underlie - sustainable - growth supply-side capacity. the past ten year fact period unusual stability broad sense uk economy whole. inflation consistently low throughout time - close to, recently modestly below, present 2½% target. but achieve expense consistently high interest rates, weak growth high unemployment, many people initially fear would. in fact nominal interest rate low u ever remember; overall economy grow consistently 40 successive quarter without interruption average annual rate 2¾%, comfortably long-term trend; number people employment rise fairly steadily close all-time high, rate unemployment fall 25-year low. the overall picture much west midland region. i regional data real economic growth, use deflator uk economy, region grow 1992 1999, annual average rate 2.7% - close rate uk whole. the number people employment region also increased, employment rate close 10 year high line - fact marginally - average uk 74.6%. and rate unemployment - claimant count basis - 3.5% close 25 year low. that's still bite uk average rate, 3.1% much good 10% rate decade ago. now i know felt like everyone - particularly internationally expose business employee region business heavily concentrate - include west midland relatively high concentration manufacture businesses. i well aware many - perhaps many - rough time past years. bi review 53/2002 3 although uk economy whole manage avoid recession, uk manufacture output fell peak nearly two year ago around 7% employment uk manufacture fell 225,000 people, 6%. to put perspective, manufacture output fell peak trough much period 16% japan, 7½% u 6½% germany; manufacture employment fell 7¼% japan, 9½% u nearly 3% germany. so pressure manufacture confine to, originate country. there two main reason pressure internationally-exposed sector economy. the first weakness much global economy result asia crisis aftermath late 1990's, then, recently, result sharp, synchronised, slowdown major industrial country - reflect figure i've give you. the second reason strength sterling exchange rate, particularly weakness euro time since introduction 3½ year ago. the frustrate thing u little either bank uk government could directly address problem source. that's fairly obvious talk weaken domestic demand major countries. it's perhaps le obvious do affect exchange rate. it's care - sometimes suggested. in fact we've repeatedly make clear we'd welcome strong euro could help restore good balance uk economy. the problem know bring about, certainly without destabilise overall economy. many people think simply question reduce interest rate ecb reduce theirs. but really simple make sound. we indeed precisely last year sterling continue strengthen - though fact fall back somewhat euro since euro stag moderate recovery. what able - give inflation somewhat target - try compensate external weakness stimulate domestic demand uk. in situation business confidence - therefore investment - weak, essentially mean stimulate consumer demand. it without risk - term build-up household debt possible house price bubble - without we, too, would face recession. look forward, reasonable prospect global demand pick gradually, may see sustainable pattern exchange rate begin emerge albeit hesitant strengthen euro. there fact already sign manufacture output start recover. but downside risk prospect associate renew volatility international financial market summer, monitor closely. but abstract recent global largely cyclical, effects, fundamentally important point, look ahead, likelihood - alongside country - continue operate within framework overall macro-economic stability - necessary condition effective function market economy. those presumption may well mean manufacture continue gradual, long-term, relative decline - share total output, term number people employ - develop industrial countries, include uk. but mean manufacture output whole contract absolute sense; contrary, past experience suggest continue increase, though composition output technique production continue evolve. in sense i much share view, course, 49% survey ica/iod disagree manufacture industry irreversible decline. it entirely consistent view, course, sectors, particularly service sectors, grow rapidly continue increase share total output. the precise form macro-economic stability framework may well continue evolve, would particular affect degree decision whether join euro. be so, nominal exchange rate certainty european partners, represent roughly half international trade, would - depend partly appropriate entry rate, whatever might - considerable longer-term benefit many internationally-exposed businesses, whatever sectors, suffer volatility, particularly weakness, euro past years. and great transparency price cost vi à vi eurozone member would enhance competition effective function single european market. there would also benefit

macro-economic policy need individual member states. the essential purpose chancellor's assessment famous five test course weigh balance potential benefit possible risks, government ultimately people country decide. the outcome could bear macro-economic context uk whole west midlands, difficult predict effect might be. whatever outcome euro debate, operate market economy within stability-oriented macro-economic framework. the crucial point overall rate growth hope sustain - key future prosperity - depend upon vigour flexibility supply-side economy. and improve supply-side capacity major challenge confront u - national level also grind west midlands. that's something monetary policy - operate - i say - demand side economy much - least directly. government form - european, national,

twelfth international conference bank supervisors. i would like thank hosts, governor mboweni staff south african reserve bank, well colleague, andrew crockett, bank international settlements, organize gather cape town. i’m sure you’ll agree they’ve do excellent job. it appear me, probably many you, south african discover wonderful niche host auspicious international gatherings, conclude world summit sustainable development johannesburg week ago. so you’re visit beautiful country first time, i feel may back south africa someday future. participant unite nation summit johannesburg seek way improve life people everywhere focus on, among goals, alleviate poverty promote economic growth. bank supervisor central banker certainly share goals. through duty ensure safety soundness financial system, aim preserve depositors’ savings, promote circulation credit, ultimately protect health growth economies. indeed, cannot alleviate poverty, cannot promote economic growth unless bank well managed, financial system stable, market transparent open. that health economy depend great degree whether bank financially sound well manage certainly coincidental. bank charge critical public

likewise, cannot job prevent every bank failure, failure remove poorly manage bank market encourage bank improve management well. motivate bank improve management risk, thereby strengthen stability bank system, one principal objective basel committee set undertake major revision international standard regulatory capital. the three year since tremendous journey u seek fundamental reform capital adequacy framework. meet cape town, seem fit portray work date unfinished journey. this historic port traditionally serve way station respite weary seafarer weather many storms, yet reach destination. so today we’ll chance rest near cape good hope, reflect far we’ve come, chart rest way successful implementation new accord. i’d like share late news new accord stand offer insight expect see future. i’ll begin view milestone we’ve achieved. then, i’d like bring date resolve outstanding issues. it’s wise conclude speech think future, i’ll close remark we’ll need finish journey – perspective committee supervisors, include may adopt 1988 accord recently. 2 bi review 52/2002 milestone achieve let begin important milestone we’ve achieve undertaking. a know, embark voyage late 1990s realize original 1988 basel accord become outdated. it design uncomplicated could apply bank various size risk profile many market jurisdictions. it subsequent adoption 100 country represent important first step development international standard. but since become clear 1988 accord overtake advance financial sector – broad economy. new technology, globalization financial markets, innovative financial product service change way bank monitor manage credit, market, operational risk manner 1988 accord could anticipate address. consequently, internationally active bank original accord intend quickly "outgrowing" limitations. today it’s quite clear 1988 accord provide class bank le meaningful measure risk face capital hold risks. to ensure new accord remain flexible, forward-looking, fit service internationally active bank twenty-first century, basel committee establish several goal work, goal industry embraced. • first, intend develop framework encompass "three pillars" necessary support effective system regulatory capital: appropriate measurement minimum requirements, supervisory review, market discipline. • second, want align minimum requirement closely actual underlie economic risk bank exposed, help allocate capital resource effectively. • a third goal encourage bank refine measurement management risk time. by create incentive new accord bank re-evaluate enhance tool constantly, expect bank adopt forward-looking perspective risk. i’m please say that, committee’s effort cooperation support supervisor industry, appear propose framework attain goal. we count among milestone we've achieved. 1. encompass "three pillars" capital adequacy with regard first goal, new framework recognize important role supervisor market play motivate prudent management risk capital. indeed, committee’s view would insufficient country simply adopt new minimum capital requirement ignore remain two pillars. both involvement supervisor assess bank’s risk management capability discipline great transparency active market bring bear management reinforce bank’s desire remain adequately capitalize control exposure risks. 2. improve risk-sensitivity capital framework the new accord likewise achieve second parallel goal align regulatory capital requirement closely underlie economic risk bank face. it depart 1988 accord’s "one-size-fits-all" methodology ass credit risk base type borrower, offer instead selection method evaluate credit risk base potential loss. under new standardize approach, example, bank small loan portfolio le advance risk management system good able incorporate borrower’s creditworthiness capital management rely external assessment credit quality. large sophisticate institutions, turn, able rely increasingly assessment internal ratings-based approach. similarly, industry develop refine sense operational risk – risk loss cause failure process – new accord "unbundle" risk allow bank differentiate between, manage separately, exposure credit, market, operational risks. bi review 52/2002 3 3. encourage bank improve management risk we’ve also attain third goal: go beyond rules-based structure instead encourage bank improve ability identify, measure, manage risk appropriately. a know, sophisticate approach credit operational risk new accord permit bank rely increasingly internal assessment risk determine much capital hold. at time, new accord flexible enough bank build risk management function best practice available industry, even practice evolve future. by promote improvement management risk across industry, i believe lay foundation stable markets. the milestone achieve square banks’ supervisors’ long-standing effort all u take great pride meet goal committee set embrace: three pillar capital adequacy, enhance risk-sensitivity capital framework, create incentive bank improve management risk. and recognize propose revision square well effort bank supervisor undertaken, independent committee’s work. the bank industry do much year adopt forward-looking approach risk management – one emphasize flexibility in, improvement to, measurement management risk time. for part, supervisor come focus much le point-in-time assessment financial condition much evaluate quality internal process control structure protect future losses. by embrace philosophy supervision center evaluation risk management capabilities, gain deep insight banks’ likely resilience downturns, good position focus management’s attention find way better. certainly new accord’s inclusion extensive economic incentive adopt sophisticate risk management process add encouragement enhancement. moreover, new accord’s requirement strong process control predicate use advance approach strongly support effort make evaluation internal process heart forward look supervisory approach. the status new accord so would seem we’ve cover quite bite territory past three years. yet chinese proverb remind u that, "on journey one hundred miles, ninety halfway." i suppose last mile marathon tough finish. the wisdom proverb bear task ahead u complete, implement, new capital framework. so i’d like turn status new accord issue resolving. a know, since second consultative document’s release 21 month ago, member basel committee work collaboratively publicly supervisors, banks, others revise proposal best serve need modern banking. we’ve publish discuss thousand page proposal study industry public. the size – depth detail – volume demonstrate hard we’ve work great challenge is. challenge committee resolve indeed, consultation year reflect fine – occasionally highly esoteric – point contemporary banking, committee encounter central concern express industry – sometimes supervisor well. some overarch issue include complexity proposal potential "procyclical." other respondent weigh propose charge operational risk particular exposures. i’d like share late news resolve challenges. 4 bi review 52/2002 complexity new accord first, issue complexity. anyone who’s dare download proposal entirety bi website may surprise find much paper require print out. the new accord truly weighty, mean adjective. naturally, prudent supervisors, member committee know easy enforce simple rule complicate one. wherever possible, committee seek provide simple alternative apply many market settings. consultation help u simplify remove good number rule think unnecessarily complicated. however, it’s important recognize intend apply new accord especially large, internationally active banks, highly develop complex institutions. one blanket won’t cover mountain range. in fact, new accord’s complexity stem partly option provide address wide range risk profiles, strategies, system bank maintain. many option create precisely bank felt disadvantage propose blanket rule. yet new option alter balance simplicity complexity. i think best example find balance lie treatment we’ve propose exposure small medium-sized enterprises. equate loan small medium-sized business loan large corporation ignore critical aspect risk associate type lending; also could lead result seem unfair bank lend primarily small businesses. so committee develop special capital treatment exposure small medium-sized enterprise recognize unique characteristic form lending, admittedly make rule complicated, perhaps page two longer. nonetheless, believe treatment help align regulatory capital closely underlie risks. procyclicality another general concern express new accord’s increase sensitivity risk reinforce behavioral pattern bank organization may increase cost credit precisely time supply falling, namely downturn business cycle. while work address concern procyclicality, reason shy away create good risk management tools. here, supervisor must articulate need bank ass risk horizon. if bank fail develop manage reasonable expectation risk profile may change time, may take excess exposure today cannot administer responsibly tomorrow. at time, remember new accord set minimum amount capital necessary comply bank regulations. all supervisor expect bank operate level regulatory minima, nearly bank manage economic capital needs, regulatory capital requirements. so although deteriorate credit quality might drive minimum capital requirement, bank already operate level, dampen effect sudden downturn business condition asset quality. along lines, committee recently agree bank adopt "internal rat based" approach credit risk require pillar 2 conduct meaningfully conservative credit risk stress testing. stress test help bank maintain adequate capital buff advance potential downturn economy. the treatment operational risk beyond two broad concern express potential complexity procyclicality, respondent call change specific capital charge proposals. one interest discussion center whether – – new accord treat bank’s exposure potential loss result inadequate fail internal process systems, external events. the endeavor manage operational risk, group risk become known, spark significant research industry beyond. supervisors, like banks, adopt view operational risk management comprehensive practice comparable management market credit risk. while operational risk cannot quantify degree precision market credit risk, committee belief introduce separate charge exposure bi review 52/2002 5 operational risk bolster effort find good way address it. fail include operational risk charge new minimum requirement could inadvertently derail ongoing work identify manage exposure. although we’ve see encourage progress measure operational risk – within individual firm industry work group – committee recognize industry settle particular methodology principles. accordingly, new accord permit unprecedented amount flexibility accommodate spectrum approach operational risk. for sophisticate institutions, "advanced measurement approach" – "ama" – really ultimate expression goal draw internal measures. in response concern propose "floor" ama stifle innovation, committee decide recently eliminate it. consequently, bank free experiment great variety methodologies, without undue constraint value firm. the ama mean catalyst innovation. calibration particular charge overall level capital of course, good portion consultation address rule formula use determine capital charge category exposure transactions. the committee work group listen carefully view market participants, academics, regulator ensure result capital requirement make good economic sense avoid burden disadvantage bank unfairly. base change making, expect committee achieve goal raise aggregate capitalization require bank industry, though clearly appropriately bank engage high risk business may see requirement rise, vice-versa. qi 3 to ensure we’ve get right, basel committee launch third quantitative impact study – "qis 3" – october 1, 2002, conjunction supervisor around world. the industry demonstrate tremendous support survey devote substantial resource completion. to date, 265 bank nearly 50 country agree perform concrete comprehensive assessment committee's proposal affect submit find december 20, 2002. the inclusion bank many country help ensure new accord’s principle apply well institution many countries. with public release qi 3 instruction october 1, committee provide full picture propose framework quantitative requirements. assessment qi 3 result allow u ascertain need adjustment prior release update proposal public comment second quarter 2003. the committee intend finalize new capital accord fourth quarter 2003 implement country year-end 2006. during three-year period, bank supervisor expect adapt develop system process necessary conform standard new accord. what supervisor prepare just supervisor three years? let conclude remark today think committee supervisor complete journey new accord. there three area focus us. 1. evaluate banks’ readiness first, member country basel committee begin survey banks’ preparation new accord. some gather information bank plan benefit new framework, others already evaluate select banks’ internal rat system database understand close bank may meet stringent requirement associate advance approaches. in cases, work understand challenge bank face seek way smooth transition new framework. 6 bi review 52/2002 2. train prepare supervisory staff likewise, supervisor basel committee’s member country labor make sure they, too, ready new rules, second area focus. from supervisor’s perspective, new basel accord require heighten sense internal process use identify quantify risk. this, mind, focus energy exactly right place – is, encourage improvement risk management critically evaluate current practices. our supervisory assessment encompass several relatively new element – importantly, validate integrity, accuracy consistency bank’s process assign internal credit ratings. since rat fee directly model use manage credit risk, scrutinize ever accuracy integrity. if initial input wrong, whole capital allocation system become faulty. additionally, cultivate staff’s ability evaluate advance risk measurement management methodology operational risk, especially much work center advance statistical analysis. externally, committee anticipate provide assistance, formally informally, supervisory agency prepare add responsibility assume new accord come force. moreover, i please note financial stability institute continue collaboration basel committee, especially assist supervisor globally understand implement aspect revise accord. the "fsi" anticipate half 40 seminar program 2003 concentrate component new accord. in fact, shortly release third consultative document next year, fsi intend offer three special seminar around world introduce supervisor important feature new framework. 3. work toward consistent implementation: accord implementation group the third area activity deepen level communication cooperation among supervisor implement new rule consistently across jurisdictions. a "level play field" demand international competition drive bank’s strengths, rather country’s rules. within basel committee itself, we’ve establish "accord implementation group" forum share information way ass risk management process new accord. the group make senior line supervisor – is, people actually ass banks’ risk profile – lead nick lepan, canadian superintendent financial institutions. apply basel accord non-g-10 country many country similarly prepare final leg journey, i applaud persistence dedication endeavor. at time, committee recognize country recently adopt original 1988 accord may still work ensure basic level capital adequacy. i would like take moment address supervisor country emphasize basel committee’s effort revise accord focus international bank compete global capital market great potential create systemic risk. the need common approach capital adequacy regulation bank drive committee create 1988 basel accord. a i noted, however, original basel accord sense become victim success, adopt number country apply entire bank systems, include bank large small. now, basel committee clearly move away single approach capital, important committee supervisor worldwide reflect choice available regulate capital bank neither highly complex internationally active. i believe difference domestic bank system make impossible conceive single capital accord would appropriate bank countries. rather, supervisor may need consider different approaches. for some, retention current accord, supplement bi review 52/2002 7 second third pillars, may best way forward. other country may elect revise standardize approach new accord. still others may seek hybrid two possibilities. we recognize might perfectly valid choice treatment non-complex domestic banks, depend national circumstances. attempt force uniform approach bank typically compete across national border unnecessary possibly counter-productive. instead, energy would good spend share idea develop common understand challenge supervisor face deal noncomplex domestic bank organizations. accordingly, meet yesterday, basel committee agree launch initiative jointly supervisor many country consider issue develop practical guidance supervisor issue associate capital regulation smaller, non-complex banks. let clear. the purpose initiative develop one even several specific "basel-approved" approach regulation. rather, wish provide practical assistance supervisor confront challenge ahead develop appropriate regulatory framework suitable national circumstance domestic bank systems. we wish support effort enhance adequacy capital manner conform institutions’ risk profiles, strengthen management risk, fortify stability financial systems. conclude think new accord clearly, u come long way since 1988, regardless whether first simply recent supervisor adopt original accord. a develop new approach capital adequacy, none milestone we’ve achieved, none success resolve open issues, would possible without dedication you, member global supervisory community, demonstrated. you enormously supportive work undertake considerable pain share view ideas. the member committee i particularly grateful friend colleague rest supervisory community advice counsel. we know none u able claim individually success new accord own. instead, dependent u work hard promote virtue benefit new accord countries. press release encourage word supervisor suffice. success demand mutual dog determination encourage banks, prepare staff, cooperate other. a complete final mile marathon journey, i confident new accord worthy efforts. thank you. bi review 51/2002 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, frankfurt, 12 september 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today’s meet govern council ecb, also attend president eurogroup, mr. christodoulakis, commissioner solbes. at today’s meeting, govern council continue comprehensive examination monetary, financial economic development assess new evidence become available past weeks. our conclusion risk price stability appear rather balanced. against background, current level key ecb interest rate appropriate. a regard analysis first pillar monetary policy strategy, three-month average annual growth rate m3 7.3% period may july 2002, compare 7.4% period april june 2002. hence, indication significant reduction monetary growth last months. the recent strength m3 growth partly reflect low opportunity cost hold money renew portfolio shift m3 environment financial market uncertainty. in context, monetary trend need assess caution. from longer-term perspective, concern liquidity available euro area would need finance sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. however, juncture, le risk excess liquidity translate inflationary pressure, give environment subdue demand. the trend growth loan private sector also seem point direction. concern second pillar, late data confirm modest recovery real gdp growth euro area first half year. in second quarter year real gdp growth estimate grow 0.3% quarter quarter, follow upwardly revise growth 0.4% first quarter. in contrast first quarter, development demand appear broadly based, activity support private consumption, export growth inventories. however, overall domestic demand growth remain subdue result protract weakness investment. look ahead, likely scenario ongoing, albeit modest, growth real gdp second half year, growth rate line potential growth 2003. this delay acceleration economic activity euro area broadly correspond world economic outlook, give expect pace recovery scale recent months. sharp decline stock price negative effect consumer investor confidence. consequently, strength upturn economic activity become uncertain, inside outside euro area. at time, however, condition strong economic recovery euro area remain place. on domestic side, private consumption particularly benefit low inflation improve real disposable income, investment support low nominal real market interest rates. finally, gradual recovery global economy also expect continue. nevertheless, risk economic outlook, inside outside euro area, need monitor closely. turn price developments, july annual hicp inflation 1.9%, inflation rate exclude unprocessed food energy fell slightly 2.5%, first decline 2002. eurostat’s flash estimate august, indicate annual hicp inflation increase 2.1%, fully line previous expectation inflation rate likely fluctuate around 2% remainder year. however, short-term trend also dependent oil price developments, increase significantly recent months. look ahead, recent appreciation euro exchange rate, well overall economic environment, contribute reduction consumer price inflation. moreover, service price inflation expect moderate somewhat, follow particularly strong increase 2002. however, inflation rate come level 2% 2003, currently project forecasts, crucial oil price escalate wage moderation prevails. with respect nominal wage growth, already note upward trend recent years, continue even economy start slow down. while information late wage 2 bi review 51/2002 indicator signal acceleration, wage development remain cause concern, despite weak cyclical situation. with regard devastate flood hit three member country particular, deeply regret substantial loss life. the overall macroeconomic impact flood limit last effects. certain food price could temporarily rise result, also due bad weather condition euro area countries, real gdp growth could initially dampen slightly may subsequently stimulate reconstruction. overall, subdue aggregate demand strengthen euro contribute low inflationary pressure. at time, factor - particular monetary developments, also wage trend oil price development - might pose risk price stability medium term therefore need monitor closely. regard fiscal policy euro area, flood-related cost lead review priority reallocation expenditure. in addition, background recent developments, seem warrant ever call member country remain commit stability growth pact. country sound fiscal position safeguard achievements, country remain imbalance must avoid deficit excess 3% gdp implement determine policy order progress towards budget close balance surplus. this essential maintain strengthen confidence policy framework euro area establish fiscal position country allow automatic stabiliser work efficiently without endanger sound fiscal position long term. in field structural reform continue urge government implement, determine way, agenda set broad economic policy guidelines. structural reform contribute expand euro area’s potential non-inflationary growth reduce high level unemployment. at time, help foster confidence among consumer investor long-term growth employment opportunity euro area, thereby positive effect spend investment decision short medium term. such confidence foster determine broadly base implementation reform agenda, focusing, particular, labour product markets. we disposal questions. bi review 51/2002 1 vahur kraft: challenge face estonian economy european union speech mr vahur kraft, governor bank estonia, roundtable “has social market economy future?”, organise konrad adenauer foundation, tallinn, 19 august 2002. * * * a. introduction, review early 1990s comparison present day first all, allow thank konrad adenauer foundation organisation interest roundtable honourable invitation speak “challenges estonian economy european union”. today’s event show yet serious respect organisers’ interest towards eu applicant countries. i personally appreciate highly support reform convergence society economy. from outside may seem transformation convergence process estonia easy smooth, background still exist numerous hide problems. one forget two generation half europe deprive civil society, private ownership, market economy. this truth reckon with. it also clear reflection “shadows past” still observed. they different kind. if people want state ensure well-being reluctant take responsibility future, effect shadow past. if people reluctant pay tax demand social security good roads, shadow past. in brief, people understand election hold state’s role, shadow past. but, course, ten year lot achieved. we build democratic institutions. market economy functions. private ownership solid foundation. bank provide credit people new house developments. but current success take granted. and also bear mind much need do yet. the public understand role possibility state government market economy. everybody feel responsible welfare well family’s state’s well-being. our new generation able cope complicate process modern society much good did. in effort achieve goal impossible underestimate support provide partners. the estonian society politician need partner exchange experience still learn fundamental function civil society. at that, i would like thank konrad adenauer foundation work do estonia elsewhere promotion political co-operation, preservation support free democracy throughout world, development consolidation social market economy respective values. allow express address also full recognition prime minister mart laar leader estonian government several critical periods. mart laar head estonian government one difficult period - autumn 1992 november 1994. this turbulent period initial reform economy entire society, immediately monetary reform adoption constitution. but, kind consent, i shall hereby focus economic issues. these time estonia’s foreign reserves, current denomination, could express hundred million euros, average monthly wage slightly one thousand kroon and, end 1992, three big bank collapsed. these year monetary reform question “for long kroon go last” often ask estonia, even frequently abroad. the central bank always stress essential back provide stability kroon’s exchange rate financial system economic reform large stable, predictable budget particular. we repeatedly stress foundation relative economic success lay 1992 1993. our bank would strong date without solid customer - private enterprises, individuals. the quick resolute privatisation former state-owned company begin 1990s decisive factor establishment sound strong customer base. due estonian bank able extend credit strong private 2 bi review 51/2002 sector, particular. thus manage avoid situation many former socialist economy force experience - float problem loan directly indirectly state-controlled, often corrupt industry. in course reorganisation financial sector early 1990s hesitate liquidate badly-managed, insolvent bank first half 1990s. neither government hesitate necessary liquidate badly-managed, insolvent enterprise manufacture stock. privatisation state-owned company real money core investors, and, necessary, liquidation state enterprise operate red, create good basis emergence strong free competition-driven business sector. without real wage estonia would increase almost one-third second half 1990s, without would approach finish line eu accession process. step take ten year ago demolition old, impotent perspective-lacking system build new, viable future-oriented economy bear fruit. the basis economic reform undertake government early 1990s strong fiscal policy. let’s honest, time none u know exactly national budget really mean amount state-collected tax public expenditure practice affect economy. one thing clear - public expenditure exceed public income value estonian kroon would immediately put stake. the 1992-1993 strictly balance-oriented strategy help create social foundation would even date suitable develop fiscal policy capable even good support balance economy. i touch upon economic policy key issue past decade issue topical today’s tomorrow’s agendas. how achieve good economic efficiency improve competitiveness? how avoid deterrent impact local lobby-groups economic policy ensure truly effective free market? how develop truly balance forward-looking fiscal policy? these issue focus estonia also european union. naturally, today’s problem - like society - completely different look 10 year ago. it estonia changed, entire world. however, key question - likewise optimum solution - are, essence, same. i would like offer example illustration above-said. in begin 1990s create estonia condition truly free competition financial sector entire economy. estonia abandon possible barrier import export good services, create equal opportunity investor privatise state-owned banks. these step lay foundation current success. to date, 10 year later, estonia like european union discus widely create truly free market infrastructure service either directly indirectly protect state. and principal solution problem shall differ decision make first half 1990s. it true that, example, open electricity market free competition definitely time-consuming privatisation many industrial enterprises. but, surely, restructure electricity sector differ principle reform bank sector. in case state must ensure availability critical infrastructure estonia communication external market - one case, mean payment systems, case interconnection european scandinavian grids. in case government ensure supervision market actors’ behaviour establish clear rules. in case government must action plan guideline crisis management. and guideline relevant national policy place, impediment complete open market. the task government delay open market rather speed up. i positive that, like bank sector, society benefit this. it result efficient production, low prices, good service quality curb power monopolistic producers. to date, early 1990s, face question right fiscal policy. of course, today problem raise slightly different way. but, essence, question - fiscal policy shall ensure stable development estonian economy within fix exchange rate regime part euro area. i shall return question towards end presentation. thus economic policy key issue face begin 21st century resemble many aspect problem try resolve begin 1990s. we achieve progress find solution problems, others remain unresolved. one thing clear - undue postponement tough issue good anybody. if want treat equal partner european union, want sustain rapid growth rate bi review 51/2002 3 grow income level, must tackle problem similar resolution energy 10 year ago. b. challenge face estonian economy way european union - internal policy so - today’s tomorrow’s challenge face estonian economy? fill pride economic development country past decade, must concentrate future. estonia’s goal sustainable economic growth target 5.5-6 per cent per annum also preparedness join european union make maximum use open opportunities. what focus especially? b.1 challenge face estonian economy way european union - overall economic policy stance estonian economy already strongly integrate european economic area. from perspective central bank i would like refer clear convergence interest rate fluctuation inflation cycle estonia european union. the share current future eu member state estonia’s export 81%. in 1994-2001 estonia’s export european union increase average 25% per annum. our export european union steadily grow quick import european union. it mean steadily increase market share european union - although small. the export structure also characterise competitiveness - export good reflect change take place economy. our traditional export item timber, textile foodstuffs, also, example, part component electric motors, cables, mobile phones, antenna like. we export good also service - primarily transport travel service - also computer it service volume service increase rapidly last three years. the fdi inflow reach 9 billion kroon level recent year prof competitive position baltic sea region well broad region. equal distribution investment main sector economy indication balance economic development (in 2001, example, manufacture industry - 20%, transport communication - 23%, wholesale retail trade - 14%). it also important note fdi inflow contingent privatisation former soes. and finally, competitiveness demonstrate yield investment make estonia reinvesting substantial part annual profit 2001 amount 3,8 billion kroons. this also show competitiveness. the readiness estonian economy integration european economic system demonstrate especially well key sector economy financial telecommunication sectors. here talk complete open market domestic foreign competition, strong state supervision integration estonian enterprise big multinational corporations. what focus future? estonia long catching-up candidate country three-four year ago. however, still cannot say restructure economy completed. on contrary, forthcoming member status eu mean many responsibilities. our goal simply ready eu accession ensure maximum use opportunity concurrent membership. what focus on? first, clear vision state’s role organisation economic system. the task state produce good service - specific area energy rail transport. the task state ensure function market wherever reason require support. secondly, unemployment become problem estonia. without dwell concrete statistics, i would like emphasise labour market subject set rule markets. if labour expensive, entrepreneur recruit new workers. i stress fact recent 4 bi review 51/2002 year political measure mitigation unemployment have, rule, drive so-called active labour market strategy - focus mainly retrain education. although active labour market policy necessary increase mobility labour force, reduce unemployment legislative regulatory framework overall structure labour market foster creation new jobs. i think estonia seriously comprehensively analyse factor influence employment, include absolute relative taxation workforce cost relate hire layoffs. thirdly, balance growth. reform objective per se, undertake assumption lead high economic growth rate, high income improve live standard. leave aside turbulent year economic reform immediately 1992 monetary reform last 1995, average annual economic growth rate estonia 5%. between 1995 2001 average salary increase 2086 kroon 5721 kroons. during time period real wage increase one-third. we believe mean economic growth rate continue 6% per annum. the quality economic growth estonia consolidate grow productivity - 1995-2001 gdp per caput (in fix prices) increase almost 40%. it also demonstrate remarkable interest private sector readiness invest. structural change economy also regard quality indicator - change distribution industrial, agricultural service sectors. still, forthcoming year must keep watchful eye external equilibrium economy, current account deficit financing, change productivity competitiveness. it obvious country, even estonia, plan economic policy assume, example, 8-8% current account deficit span several years. even latter initial year finance foreign direct investments, adaptation economy inevitable. the slow economic growth adaptation period, painful society. the goal economic policy prevention internal demand-driven boom immediately prior eu accession follow significantly slow growth phase. pre-accession economic programme macroeconomic risk all important issue are, certain extent, reflect estonia’s pre-accession economic programme recently approve government republic. i stress projection form basis national pre-accession programme premise estonian economy real total output go increase rate 6% per year attainable current economic policy continues. keep macrobalance critical importance sustain economic growth credibility monetary policy. the kroon’s fix exchange rate forthcoming entry euro zone mean “free lunches”. b.2 challenge face estonian economy way european union - internal policy - join emu estonia’s entry euro zone contingent fulfilment economic criterion applicable single currency country - hand, one say economy meet requirement benefit transition single currency. and estonia’s monetary exchange rate policy pre-accession period immediately eu accession consider background. first, fix exchange rate estonian kroon euro currency board system remain unchanged accession european union. the adoption euro take place three stage accordance acquis - join european union, join erm2 exchange rate mechanism and, maastricht criterion met, join euro area. the condition estonian economy financial system well integration eu market i comment upon early view fully support principle. also european commission european central bank affirm u euro-based fix exchange rate currency board regime, principle, harmony acquis conform requirement set monetary policy non-euro zone economies. bi review 51/2002 5 secondly, erm2 provide new member state necessary useful interim stage eu accession adoption euro. the choice monetary exchange rate policy new member state diverse. erm2 suitable flexible mean harmonisation vary monetary policy apply tools. the post-accession period likely serious test phase member state - definitely estonia - elaboration economic fiscal policy relevant co-operation eu institutions. participation development economic policy guideline set relatively high demand actual policy formulation institutional co-operation. naturally process two party - present applicant country join eu process whereas “old” member state study key problem new member state face economic development. the post-accession erm2 phase appropriate time establishment comprehensive co-operation economic policy area national well european union level. the “testing” economies’ competitive ability also crucial - mean exchange rate interest rates. maastricht criterion for estonia like new member state possible way join euro system full compliance letter spirit eu treaty. a well know, key issue fulfilment maastricht criteria. most new member states, estonia included, obviously great difficulty meet sovereign debt budget deficit criteria. the remain two criterion - low inflation exchange rate stability - connect specific problems. the fulfilment inflation criterion might reality difficult fear - achievable distant future. however, context rapid accession, meet inflation criterion become main issue. this due interaction so-called real nominal convergence. together rapid growth productivity earnings, price go rise quick new member states. consider great price gap applicant country v?s v?s present member states, one assume price equalisation take time. thus conclude inflation rate new member state several year stay high mean rate three low inflation economy european union plus 1.5 per cent. we estimate estonia “optimum” pace streamline price would ca 2 3 per cent point per year. in opinion difference reflect quick productivity increase trend estonia. in conclusion, comment main economic policy issue european union faces. after introduction euro issue potentially new co-operation mode raise repeatedly, this also discuss convention future europe. figuratively speaking, question mean policy measure foster best utilisation possibility offer single currency. c. challenge face estonian economy way european union - eu perspective the first priority issue naturally improvement eu internal market. the on-going convergence improve operational efficiency internal market make price flexible allow good use resources. it extremely important develop common market good services, include telecommunication service utility - also financial service order ensure free competition price formation base demand supply pan-european market. a well-functioning common market help reduce transaction costs, offer service via internet, example. a common innovation policy, system business support measure dissemination experience different businesses, availability start-up capital - deem promote productivity convergence. 6 bi review 51/2002 flexibility mobility production factor another set critical issue relate flexibility mobility production factors. here i must stress importance capital labour market flexibility. both need possible support order increase efficient use resource common market economies. in addition unify money market euro zone, aspire towards full integration capital markets. simplify procedure adoption secondary legislation regulate financial service area important step forward. the convergence financial market call extensive harmonisation legal environment various countries. but also require close co-operation various national supervisory authority and/or good co-ordination supervision function eu level. in addition, take account capital transfer member state would easy business law regulation different country harmonised. here i could mention rule govern companies’ merger takeovers, bankruptcy procedures, state aid distribution term conditions. a flexible labour market extremely important effective common monetary policy purposes. however, unlikely near future europe see notable crossborder migration labour force - expect happen eu enlargement. therefore, limit flexibility labour market offset efficient internal market, high capital mobility great flexibility domestic labour market. fiscal policy - fiscal federalism in addition above-mentioned supply-related issues, eu member states’ fiscal policy principle context common monetary policy special scrutiny. it state enhance co-operation within fiscal policy area allow mitigate potential economic difficulty various countries. in principle, question whether extent automatic balance mechanism invoke eu general fiscal stance level target smooth regional disparity automatic income transfer wealthy less-wealthy region - thus, fact, compensate lack exchange rate mechanism within single currency regime. also recent month question raise whether requirement stability growth pact rigid. by way general comment, i say sufficiently many example great disparity different region federal state. regional policy crucial also state high labour mobility. ultimately, success regional economy depend primarily efficient resource management extensive income transfer even slow adjustment process. in view obvious long european union remain alliance independent member states, neither need possibility additional communitisation. exception could include precisely define circumstance intervention eu level would justify order ensure uninterrupted function internal market. harmonisation fiscal policy macro level would automatically accompany tax rate equalisation. at that, taxation policy give member state reflect principal choice internal policy preference entire society. stability growth pact with regard stability growth pact, assume automatic stabilisation mechanism shall function smoothly within 3% gdp scale. this threshold could exceed case abrupt unexpected shock situation. additionally, stability growth pact aim balance budget economic cycle. thus presume one look structural reason member state experience long-term budget deficit surplus. in opinion, stability growth pact perform function well recent years. this prove fact eu member state much strong fiscal position previous years. any major change stability growth pact likely cause additional insecurity significantly affect credibility entire framework. therefore i believe stability growth pact remain cornerstone eu economic policy also year come. further convergence market various national economy prop framework stability growth pact. in addition potential approximation business cycles, bi review 51/2002 7 common market create precondition enable country invest save effectively within union. and even importantly, harmonise flexible commodity market help reduce adjustment cost - thus minimise need use budget stabilisation mechanism short-term adjustment period. d. conclude remark to date european union face several complicate well-known economic policy problem recent past. estonia future eu member state must take account. it enough able overcome challenge way european union. we must become equal partner european states, able will participate discussion monetary fiscal policy issues, perceive estonia europe europe estonia. today european economic monetary union within 12 state adopt single currency, offer historic chance create truly strong, flexible efficient economic area. i believe potential single currency exploit best possible way. it would serve interest current well future member state whole europe. bi review 51/2002 1 svein gjedrem: economic policy challenge address mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), executive board confederation norwegian business industry, 19 september 2002. chart speech find norge bank’s website. * * * a year half ago, government storting adopt new guideline economic policy, call annual use petroleum revenue equivalent expect real return government petroleum fund. at time, government issue new operational mandate monetary policy. norge bank shall set key rate view maintain low stable inflation. the first sentence monetary policy mandate refer value krone. stability national value krone imply inflation must low stable. this best contribution monetary policy make economic growth prosperity necessary precondition stability financial property markets. the regulation also state monetary policy shall aim stability international value krone. the krone exchange rate fluctuate day day, week week, month month. we instrument fine-tune exchange rate. the first paragraph mandate set forth objective. the last paragraph specify norge bank shall do. the inflation target set 2½ per cent. monetary policy orient towards low stable inflation contribute stable krone exchange rate time. if take step counteract appreciation krone pressure economy, reduce possibility curb inflation increase risk fluctuation economy. maintain stability internal value krone must thus take precedence. the implementation monetary policy delegate norge bank. norge bank set interest rate basis understand regulation. our interpretation place emphasis government’s rationale behind regulation, objective formulate first paragraph knowledge relationship interest rate, krone exchange rate, output, employment inflation. the interest rate influence price inflation indirectly via domestic demand via effect exchange rate. when interest rate rise, profitable save costly borrow. this dampen impact consumption investment. low demand turn curb rise price wages. high interest rate make attractive take krone position borrow foreign currency. a result, high interest rate normally lead appreciation krone. this reduce price import goods. in addition, strong krone curb activity, profitability capacity cover labour cost internationally expose sector. it important aware relationship employment, output inflation. if shortage labour economic resources, tight monetary policy stance reduce inflation effect price import good aggregate demand good service labour. when monetary policy aim stabilise inflation, also contribute stabilise aggregate output employment. if appear inflation, unchanged interest rates, high 2½ per cent, interest rate increased. if appear inflation, unchanged interest rates, low 2½ per cent, interest rate reduced. monetary policy function considerable variable lags. therefore, current level inflation provide adequate basis determine level interest rate set today. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. two year therefore reasonable time horizon attain inflation target. it nevertheless conceivable situation high rate inflation sluggish economic growth, norge bank may decide apply somewhat long time horizon two year reach inflation target 2½ per cent. by influence inflation time, monetary policy cause unnecessary disturbance economy. 2 bi review 51/2002 norge bank one instrument: interest rate. change interest rate broad impact. monetary policy therefore orient towards stabilise development internationally expose sector, advocated. this could easily create considerable imbalance norwegian economy. the low interest rate policy devaluation 1970s 1980s example policy fail. monetary policy gear towards prevent deterioration competitiveness manufacturing. the krone devalue several occasions. but wage growth accelerate compensate high inflation. the result wage price spiral hit entire economy. at time, sharp rise demand loans, create tension financial system 1970s 1980s. monetary policy effective mean influence aggregate demand economy. however, little monetary policy counter disturbance output side economy. change wage formation, decline productivity growth sharp rise price important factor input must instead counter measure improve way economy functions. fiscal policy place emphasis smooth fluctuation economy view ensure appropriate capacity utilisation low unemployment. there overlap task monetary policy fiscal policy intend perform. this make natural raise issue whether need coordinate fiscal monetary policy decisions. several reason may lead interplay monetary fiscal policy fail function. interplay function well decision-making body conscious one body’s decision influence decision others. unless fact recognised, decision produce result planned. the economy may move undesirable direction, high interest rates, sluggish economic growth deterioration state’s financial position. without coordination, good result may still achieve fiscal policy act “leader” monetary policy “follower”, use expression take game theory. the fiscal policy authority internalise monetary policy response pattern. the central bank’s response pattern must course know fiscal authority take account. the social partner similarly take monetary policy response account wage determined. the “leader” interplay - social partner - take “follower’s” - norge bank’s - response account. this view relevant centralise wage formation. in decentralise wage formation, monetary policy instead affect wage growth via market mechanism stabilise aggregate demand. a precondition interplay function well monetary policy know remain firm. the outcome year’s wage settlement indicate social partner internalise monetary policy response pattern. perhaps one stumble block choice wage settlement industry level large wage increase employee outside two large employer/employee organisation (nho lo). the high wage growth award group whose wage determine individual agreement indicate labour market tight. the rise salary white-collar worker manager may also reflect weak cost control enterprise organisation follow long period expansion. for long time, stable exchange rate labour cost among trade partner form anchor wage determination. since 1998, however, rise labour cost norway around 2 percentage point high trade partners. high wage growth, combine global downturn strong krone, severe impact

simply cannot everything want. 2a. how monetary policy influence economy? monetary policy affect economy several channels, together refer transmission mechanism monetary policy. in close economy, monetary policy mainly work influence demand change real interest rate. in open economy, monetary policy also work change exchange rate. let u make stylise review happen central bank raise key interest rate. in short medium term, price relatively rigid. a result, short long real rate interest also tend increase nominal interest rate raised. in addition, nominal real appreciation exchange rate. 1 the presentation largely base svensson, lars e.o. (2002): (cid:145)monetary policy real stabilization(cid:146), mimeo. princeton university 2 bi review 49/2002 • the direct exchange rate channel inflation an appreciation reduce price import good measure krone terms. how quickly reduction fee consumer price depend among thing competitive condition margin setting. a change real interest rate also influence demand economy. • the real interest rate channel aggregate demand • an increase real interest rate reduce demand, consumer investment goods. it become relatively attractive save, lead reduction current consumption. investor turn face high investment cost result reduce investment demand. • the exchange rate channel aggregate demand strengthen exchange rate mean domestically produce good service become relatively expensive compete foreign products. demand domestically produce good thus reduced. it common assume effect channel mention far come within one year change interest rate. the direct exchange rate channel inflation probably one act quickest. • the demand channel inflation the reduction aggregate demand result rise interest rate turn slow rise prices. this mainly due two factors. first, output reduced. the decline output result low demand labour. this reduce wage growth. second, firm set low price result low demand. the impact inflation often assume come one two year effect aggregate demand. in addition relatively direct effects, price level also influence change price import domestically produce intermediate goods. • the expectation channel inflation both price wage inflation affect change expect inflation. one reason firm often set price several periods. the apply wage formation. expect price change figure prominently calculation expect future real wages. we see increase nominal rate interest reduce inflation various channel vary lags. a result, inflation expectation also expect redused. the expectation channel therefore amplify effect monetary policy. the time take change interest rate impact inflation demand vary. it must also stress course period change interest rate affect output inflation - often monetary policy take effect - economy influence number direct indirect disturbances. thus, central bank(cid:146)s control inflation production far perfect. 2b. what reasonable objective monetary policy? the goal economic policy tend desire maximum welfare country(cid:146)s inhabitants. this goal often express number separate goals, (sustainable) economic growth, efficient utilisation resources, equitable income distribution, price stability, viable regions, etc. monetary policy little ability influence separate goal long term. it therefore sensible specify monetary policy(cid:146)s long-term goal term factor monetary policy affect. introduce money economy establish credible monetary policy ensure low stable inflation positive effect real economy. similarly, monetary policy cease function could result dramatic deterioration welfare, see numerous occasions. however, apart this, monetary policy last effect growth potential level welfare economy. it supply economic resource - labour bi review 49/2002 3 capital ability utilize efficiently production - decisive. we cannot use monetary policy pull bootstraps. it also seem intuitively unreasonable possible influence output potential average growth economy monetary policy. i think fairly obvious imagine effect monetary policy (cid:147)robinson friday(cid:148) economy. i) the long-term objective monetary policy in long term, monetary policy determine average level inflation. output determine supply labour, capital technology productivity changes. it important stress essential difference target high level economic growth (output target) inflation target. a long output independent monetary policy long term, authority cannot choose output target monetary policy. attempt boost production natural level long term result rise inflation. however, inflation target choose authorities. ii) the short-term objective monetary policy under certain conditions, monetary policy may nevertheless contribute smooth cyclical fluctuations, i.e. swing output demand. some channel monetary policy influence inflation go way demand side economy. monetary policy use aggressively bring inflation control quickly, considerable fluctuation real economy consequence; may use gradually le impact real economy, inflation allow deviate target slightly long period. in short term, thus trade-off output employment development variation inflation around inflation target. in theoretical literature trade-off often describe loss function output inflation variability included. the idea central bank shall minimise weight average two. the loss function depict stylise form chart output variability (deviation (cid:147)natural(cid:148) potential output) inflation variability along axes. it assume central bank want - possible - output price stability. the welfare loss thus small chart are. the line chart (indifference curves) thus show different combination inflation variability output variability result welfare loss. 4 bi review 49/2002 lars svensson, prominent contributor theoretical research area monetary policy, recommend central bank explicitly define loss function. he propose expression square deviation inflation inflation target square deviation actual potential output weight together provide measure loss period. the total loss find discount future losses. up now, central bank go far svensson recommends. however, horizon choose monetary policy implicitly provide indication central bank(cid:146)s loss function. if horizon short, inflation quickly bring back target, great fluctuation output result. this indicate central bank put considerable weight avoid variation inflation little weight stabilise real economy. similarly, horizon long, indicate central bank also put great weight avoid variation output employment. bi review 49/2002 5 the chart illustrate optimal combination inflation output variability. the three point chart reflect different type inflation targeting.2 strict inflation target mean variation inflation include loss function. no weight give output changes, thereby result relatively high output variability. monetary policy swift effect exchange rate channel. if inflation high inflation target, central bank raise key rate sharply reduce inflation quickly. this may lead initially relatively strong appreciation currency, reduce import inflation. a cpi inflation quickly approach target due change import inflation, demand also reduce result high real interest rate strong exchange rate. the change demand influence inflation. in order avoid reduction inflation rate, central bank low interest rate. the result policy considerable variation nominal real interest rates, accompany substantial variation nominal real exchange rate output. flexible inflation target imply central bank also put weight output employment variability. output therefore also include loss function. this mean central bank attempt avoid sizeable variation output result strict inflation targeting. the way take account output employment flexible inflation target choose relatively long time horizon. in way central bank gradually bring inflation back target. in practice, inflation allow vary short term order prevent unnecessary variation real economy. one final possibility would put sole weight minimise output variability. one variant would minimise unemployment variability. note policy improve growth potential economy, fluctuations. moreover, would result substantial inflation variability since economy nominal anchor. this policy would sustainable practice provide answer monetary policy respond unemployment drive wage costs. we would forget experience 1970s 1980s. monetary policy credibility also influence output inflation variability. current inflation pressure depend expect future price changes. if economic agent feel confident central bank stabilise inflation around target, behaviour reflect this, inflation move back target quickly. hence, central bank must react le time want bring inflation back target. this also imply output employment must reduce le order achieve 2 see, example, svensson, lars e. o. (2000): (cid:147)open-economy inflation targeting(cid:148), journal international economics, vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 6 bi review 49/2002 give decline inflation.3 the line chart therefore move leave credible monetary policy. 3. norwegian monetary policy cyclical fluctuation in long term, cannot influence growth potential prosperity mean monetary policy - even norway. but influence fluctuation economy, short-term cyclical movements. norge bank also take account monetary policy cause unreasonably sharp fluctuation output set relatively long-term horizon attainment inflation target, allow deviation intervene period. it would probably possible aggressive use instrument force inflation back target within time frame 3-4 quarter - perhaps even le foreign exchange channel strong. this would cause pronounce fluctuation real economy, however. in sense, variation output enter (cid:147)loss function(cid:148). the think follow theoretical research large degree present actual set interest rates. for practical purposes, we, central bank inflation targeting, make estimate future price inflation. our instrument orient way prospect attain inflation target two year ahead. the theoretical literature give u useful knowledge far forward time horizon set. the result use short horizon considerable instability output nominal real interest rates. from point view, positive substantial resource invest theoretical empirical research area. norge bank seek contribute work public debate. we must also will consider adjust manner carry analysis communicate monetary policy new knowledge become available. let u look concrete objective norwegian monetary policy. a year half ago, storting government adopt new guideline economic policy. accord mandate, norge bank shall orient monetary policy towards maintain low stable inflation. the first paragraph present objective. the last paragraph state specifically norge bank do. 3 see, example, clarida, richard, jordi gali mark gertler (2000): (cid:147)the science monetary policy: a new keynesian perspective(cid:148), journal economic literature, vol. 44, no. 2, 195-222. bi review 49/2002 7 the first sentence mandate refer value krone. stability internal value krone imply inflation must low stable. it also necessary precondition stability financial property markets. the regulation also state monetary policy shall aim stability international value krone. the krone exchange rate fluctuate day day, week week, month month. we free international trade free capital movements. we instrument fine-tune exchange rate. in norge bank(cid:146)s submission 27 march 2001 ministry finance new guideline economic policy, indicate monetary policy aim low stable inflation, best contribution monetary policy make stability krone exchange rate time. the interest rate affect price inflation number channels, include krone exchange rate. a strong krone curb inflation. if take step counteract appreciation krone pressure economy, reduce possibility keep inflation bay great risk pronounce fluctuation economy. maintain stability internal value krone must thus take precedence. a long country pursue policy low stable 8 bi review 49/2002 inflation, stability international value krone dependent low stable inflation norway the implementation monetary policy delegate norge bank. this imply norge bank set interest rate basis understand regulation, indicate bank(cid:146)s submission ministry finance march last year. our interpretation place emphasis government(cid:146)s rationale behind regulation, objective formulate first paragraph knowledge relationship interest rate, krone exchange rate, output, employment inflation. the operational objective monetary policy low stable inflation. the inflation target set 2‰ per cent. a monetary stance result high vary inflation would lead wide swing output employment. it would also recipe turbulence foreign exchange markets. there therefore close link third paragraph regulation - inflation target - first paragraph concern stabilise economic development exchange rate expectations. monetary policy affect economy considerable variable lags. the current level inflation provide adequate basis determine level interest rate set today. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. two year thus reasonable time horizon attain inflation target, also make possible avoid unnecessary output employment variability. see also formulation regulation contribute stable development output employment. if attempt attain inflation target short term, low key rate thereby contribute depreciation krone high price inflation, would probably compel raise interest rate even year order attain inflation target last time raise interest rates. such short-term policy would contribute great demand output instability. with relatively long time horizon chosen, monetary policy contribute stable development output employment. however, situation may arise two year le two year require attain inflation target. this depend disturbance economy expose to. norge bank communicate change time horizon. 4. monetary policy competitiveness monetary policy cannot use influence size internationally expose sector time. this primarily determine wage income formation, fiscal policy, include use petroleum revenue government budget adaptability efficiency economy. bi review 49/2002 9 the new monetary policy mandate link new fiscal policy guideline. when new guideline adopt march 2001, norge bank point that, isolation,

nominal appreciation krone. in isolation, expansionary fiscal policy must lead tighten monetary policy inflation target attained. without tightening, labour market would tighter, competitiveness would deteriorate result rise wage price inflation. 10 bi review 49/2002 in debate, stress scale back manufacture come fast great intensity expected. but wage growth expect take turn did. not year, last year, year that. wage growth 15 per cent high country (from 1998 2003) bind repercussions. the krone exchange rate also appreciated. but reaction foreign exchange market cannot call overreaction wage increase much. the force drive krone, could bring reversed. competitiveness ability pay high wage basis high productivity. for number years, norway high wage growth match equally high productivity growth. over time, growth real wage must consistent growth labour productivity. an inflation target 2‰ per cent trend productivity growth around 2 per cent, accord update national account figures, imply annual nominal wage growth 4‰ per cent. under (cid:147)solidarity alternative(cid:148) 1990s, stable exchange rate rate wage growth among trade partner function anchor social partners. up 1997, anchor remain effective. however, growth labour cost jump 1998 since around 2 percentage point high among trade partners. wage growth high relation earn many enterprises. it demand improve efficiency pace require keep rise labour costs. bi review 49/2002 11 the sharp rise labour cost recent year carry potential high unemployment. the interest rate effective instrument counter low demand grow unemployment measure stimulate demand translate high wage growth unstable financial markets. however, little monetary policy prevent increase unemployment drive high cost inflation. development wage settlement drive force behind appreciation krone. the foreign exchange market respond expected. when confidence inflation target attained, high wage growth create expectation tight monetary policy relatively high interest rates. high return make attractive take krone positions. increase demand currency boost international value norwegian krone. if wage growth slow , confident remain low next years, interest rate differential country narrowed. this normally lead krone depreciating. over last thirty years, manufacture scale back waves, particularly sharply period 1977 1987. in year lead period contraction, profitability weaken manufacture sector. it take time deterioration translate low output 12 bi review 49/2002 employment. but turnaround hits, tend hit fast hard. it appear new period downscaling way. several factor point this: first, trend analysis indicate manufacture employment reduce period ahead, partly petroleum investment expect decline productivity growth manufacture somewhat high industries. second, manufacture cost increase sharply since 1998 consequence high wage growth. up summer 2000, cost increase extent offset weak krone. the appreciation krone reveal exacerbate deterioration cost competitiveness. third, result fiscal guideline internationally expose sector subject additional pressure. over time, phase petroleum revenue lead restructure transfer resource expose shelter sector. fourth, response pattern stabilisation policy function different way previously. in past, generally understand high wage growth overheat economy must tighten government budgets. today, fiscal guideline inflation targeting, monetary policy tighten great extent situation. the burden stabilisation policy thus time transfer internationally expose sector. against background, decline manufacture employment 300 000 240 000 ten-year period, norge bank previously indicated, seem unreasonable. norge bank one instrument: interest rate. it broad impact. monetary policy therefore orient towards stabilise development internationally expose sector. this would create considerable imbalance norwegian economy. the low interest rate policy devaluation 1970s 1980s example policy fail. monetary policy gear towards prevent weaken competitiveness manufacturing. the krone devalue several occasions. but wage growth accelerate compensate high inflation. the result yuppy period, unsound investment wage price spiral hit entire economy. the norwegian economy go extensive turnaround operation late 1980s. confidence monetary policy norwegian krone restore order avoid persistently high inflation. it take long time, high interest rate required, confidence nominal anchor restored. 5. conclusion through sound, credible orientation monetary policy, possible attain inflation rate average equal target figure. by practise flexible inflation targeting, i.e. medium-term horizon inflation target, also achieve reasonable trade-off inflation variability output variability short term. but monetary policy last effect output employment. these determine supply economic resource - capital labour. technological developments, ability use technology, also play decisive part. in long run, monetary policy cannot influence output, employment competitiveness beyond benefit follow low stable inflation. the economy require nominal anchor. the government lay guideline monetary policy imply flexible inflation targeting. this regime also broad international support. this bi review available bi website www.bis.org. bi review 49/2002 1 ernst welteke: the

financial system closely connected. the impact may also work way around: financial crisis cause major friction real economy, whether via depression sentiment, credit crunch negative wealth effects. therefore, monetary policy monitor financial market development closely. moreover, stable well function financial market interest central banks. the need proper monetary transmission process, sound payment system stable bank sector provide ample reason central banker care financial architecture. the surveillance structure europe currently review. proposal make finance minister germany uk envisage new institution committee could see potential nucleus european financial supervision authority. however, favour call (cid:147)lamfalussy model(cid:148), originally intend reform supervision security trading. this model easy apply bank sector least two reasons. firstly, surveillance issue different bank sector. and secondly, harmonisation rule conduct bank sector already reach high level. this due fact current cooperation field bank supervision europe already cover different country various sector financial system. so far, cooperation prove worthwhile efficient. any future form

on hand, rise cost intensify pressure increase government allocations. most likely, central government expect pick bill labour cost rise sharply. in business sector – profitability requirement – high

review 48/2002 1 david dodge: macroeconomic stabilization policy canada remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, 31 august 2002. the reference speech find bank canada’s website. * * * what i propose panel today talk stabilization policy policy co-operation viewpoint industrial country float exchange rate explicit inflation target monetary policy clear objective fiscal policy. while perspective particularly influence time deputy minister finance governor canada’s central bank, broad outline conclusion widely shared, two institutions, canadian academic public policy circle well. moreover, i believe experience lesson draw applicable open economy flexible exchange rates. in 1990s, bank canada government canada reach series joint agreement inflation-control targets. a well, government establish framework greatly reduce probability run fiscal deficit thus put debt-to-gdp ratio clear downward track. initially, credibility policy high; essential demonstrate clearly resolve achieve great fiscal prudence low inflation credibility gained. thus, sometimes necessary override automatic stabilizer fiscal policy order establish credibility. and monetary policy mean could always implement ease warrant inflation targets. but target achieved, public’s trust authority go say would increased. that trust tremendously important. now credibility monetary fiscal policy firmly established, stabilizer able job. i would like begin consider stabilization policy, say word policy co-operation.1 stabilization policy monetary policy stabilization in aim achieve 2 per cent inflation target 18- 24-month horizon, canadian monetary policy play important role stabilize economy response demand supply shocks. when shift demand, direction change policy interest rate quite clear. suppose economy operate production potential inflation 2 per cent target. a downward shift demand would create excess supply economy, put downward pressure inflation. to bring inflation back 2 per cent period 18 24 months, bank canada would low target overnight interest rate. through effect market interest rate exchange rate, action would increase level output economy, move back towards production potential. inflation would, therefore, return target shortly excess supply disappear economy. an upward shift demand would, course, generate symmetric responses. while theory clear appropriate response demand shocks, magnitude persistence shocks—and hence size time interest rate adjustments—are always difficult judge. this art monetary policy-making come play. it even difficult, course, gauge appropriate monetary policy response supply shocks—which take form high (or lower) inflation expect give level demand. 1 the interaction fiscal monetary policy cover fully dodge (2002) 2 bi review 48/2002 the bank’s framework inflation target allow temporary supply shock largely ignored, long fee inflation expectations. the credibility establish mean typically long so. consider price surprise come volatile component consumer price index—components fruit vegetable fuel oil natural gas. a operate guide, use measure core inflation exclude components. this give us, economic observers, confidence look something close underlie trend inflation. thus, interest rate response price shock perceive temporary minimal. a result, little effect output. in words, monetary policy turn temporary supply shock something destabilize aggregate output. a difficult situation occur persistent increase decrease price come volatile component consumer price index threaten keep total index away target significant period time. credibility help too, bank must particularly cautious movement inflation fee inflation expectations. supply shock take form change level, growth rate, potential output often hard recognize. here, however, key central bank return trend inflation target move away. since trend inflation relative target best indicator demand relative potential output, consistent move demand back line new path potential output medium term. fiscal policy automatic stabilization in canada, main automatic fiscal stabilizer various type tax revenues, well employment insurance payouts. some fiscal stabilizer work almost immediately—for example, personal income tax deduct employer. others, employment insurance payments, work fairly short lag. compare contrast automatic fiscal monetary stabilizer automatic fiscal stabilizer effective dampen output cycle. but offset part change output. in contrast, monetary policy fully offset change output, take time work, full impact output normally felt 12 18 months. discretionary stabilization policy while automatic quasi-automatic stabilization provide monetary fiscal policy desirable, question remain whether role something further—a discretionary stabilization policy. in case monetary policy, nature response le automatic one describe earlier. a i imply then, judgment key process. that particularly true time great uncertainty, last autumn. but clear inflation target mean that, principle, discretionary choice monetary policy-makers limit relative fiscal authorities.2 the argument discretionary fiscal policy important element macroeconomic stabilization open economy tend revolve primarily around lag around effectiveness short-run fiscal policy relative monetary policy. if time close perfect, fiscal policy measure last two three quarter could, principle, ideal circumstances, shorten time take move output back desire level. thus, principle, discretionary fiscal policy useful tool. but, practitioner, i tell 2 some commentator describe inflation target "constrained discretion," sense clear objective medium-term framework precise rule vary policy interest rate (bernanke et al. 1999). that is, many possible path back equilibrium. at bank canada, decide best way implement inflation target acceptable trade-off variance inflation around target variance output around production potential. thus, choose 18- 24-month horizon achieve inflation target. we take account relevant information, simple rule set interest rates. bi review 48/2002 3 great problem temporary measure difficult initiate quickly need arise extraordinarily difficult stop need past. thus, practical matter, philosophical one, severe limitation use discretionary fiscal policy stabilizer.3,4 my view reinforce way business cycle canada develop last 18 month so. in early 2001, expect slowdown u.s. canadian economy would modest. in canada, early announce tax cut fortuitously come effect. it middle last summer become evident canadian economy undergo pronounce slowdown expected. between january august 2001, low policy interest rate 175 basis points. even ardent supporter discretionary fiscal policy would think anything major august. with horrific event 11 september, economic forecaster mark forecast 2001 2002 significantly. we, like major central banks, accelerate pace cut interest rates—from september january 2002, low policy interest rate 200 basis points. fortunately, canadian government add small amount spend budget announcement late 2001—and consist mainly necessary spend security border issues. i say "fortunately" because, base national account publish end may 2002, growth canadian economy actually rebound fourth quarter 2001 accelerate 6 per cent first quarter year. thus, benefit hindsight, evident underlie strength economy expected. combine large amount monetary stimulus applied, mean economy could recover rapidly. therefore, add fiscal stimulus necessary get economy going. and monetary stimulus provide prove much easy turn around. since mid-april, raise policy rate 75 basis points. to sure, uncertainty arise continue arise future. our best judgment uncertain factor continue take account. but, overall, episode clearly show monetary policy action use flexibly fiscal policy actions. i would stress discretionary fiscal policy also get government trouble lead neglect long-run fiscal anchor—particularly since discretionary action likely associate ease policy tightening. this neglect would risk erode fiscal credibility—the trust public fiscal target met. policy co-operation stabilization now let turn issue policy co-operation policy coordination. our inflation target joint targets. they bank’s targets—they target government canada well. our view that, essentially, "coordination" come joint agreement inflation targets. with clear agreement medium-term policy objective share understand policy framework, need coordination set interest rate fiscal policy instruments. the economic literature policy coordination tend situation fiscal monetary authority one following: different view economic welfare,5 3 this also view cecchetti (2002) taylor (2000). for oppose view, see seidman (2001). much earlier, boulding (1969) summarize academic session recent experience use fiscal policy poem include follow lines, ". . . policy may follow fillip’s law—too little late, much soon . . . ." 4 for canadian federal government, limitation discretionary fiscal policy stabilizer compound fact canadian provincial government take together represent large share economy federal government does, spend structure (which include spend capital federal government) good lend discretionary spend stabilization purposes. 5 that is, "loss functions" different. 4 bi review 48/2002 inconsistent policy objectives, policy totally discretionary, tendency get involve game-like behaviour one another. none apply canada—and none apply anywhere. give policy framework, government change fiscal policy, need think change affect inflation and, consequently, interest rates. similarly, bank canada need

corporate governance speech m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, pennsylvania association community bankers, memphis, tennessee, 28 september 2002. * * * good morning. thank invitation speak member pennsylvania association community banker return home twenty-four years, memphis, tennessee. some ask i surprise new role governor federal reserve board. i must say big surprise amount require reading. i haven’t read much many different topic since i graduate school! not i get discus economics monetary policy, also--as chair board’s bank supervision committee--i deeply involve bank regulation operation issues. even though i bring twenty-seven year bank experience, include early stint federal reserve, i find current responsibility make consider issue new ways. consequently, i look forward meet group like i good understand emerge issue diverse perspectives. in comment today, i first address recent financial performance u.s. banks, community bank particular. i turn improvement bank large small make measure manage risk, responsibility director senior manager corporate governance, finally, importance sound account practices. in view, topic inextricably link light continue question confidence america’s corporations, quite timely. financial condition u.s. bank last year exceptional many respects, unite state slip recession, september terrorist attacks, stock market declines, relate events. in response, federal reserve reduce interest rate every meet federal open market committee 2001 additional three time meetings, total eleven rate cut accumulate 475 basis points. since then, federal reserve shift bias one concern weakness, one risk inflation weakness balanced, back again--most recently--to concern economic growth. the direct effect past year’s stressful event painful enough. in addition, abusive account corporate-governance practice make condition worse, large corporate bankruptcy impose substantial loss investors, lenders, employees. these domestic event increase uncertainty earn report firm dampen financial market already weak. abroad, argentina’s economic political difficulty remind us, yet again, exposure emerge economy also present substantial risk. throughout period, u.s. bank system remain strong, report continue record earn profitability, despite slip asset quality. during first half year, u.s. insure commercial bank earn $44.5 billion annualized return asset 1.37 percent. both figure represent industry’s best six-month performance ever reflect impressive growth top already impressive results. net interest income primary driver increase revenue, despite notable decline commercial loan volume. loan loss provision remain relatively high standard past decade dip notably second half 2001. net charge-offs, concentrate among commercial loan large bank credit card specialty lenders, also dropped. while improvement since year-end may signal problem asset peaked, large institution yet fully recognize result year’s supervisory assessment share national credits. consequently, may see deterioration asset quality period ahead. moreover, general economy need strengthen much comfortable we’re woods. a noted, current weakness appear largely within commercial loan portfolio large regional money center bank rather small institutions. even problem large 2 bi review 55/2002 bank could view mild, however, give shock felt many customer base. in respects, bank performance may reflect improvement risk-management practice also great diversification revenue exposure occur past decade. bank performance also reflects, i believe, great awareness institution throughout bank system promptly address problem emerge. during recession recovery, bank industry regulatory agency appear respond well, act timely manner without unnecessarily constrain bank credit. that positive outcome make easier, course, bank system strong challenge begin build. because industry earn capital absorb increase losses, time opportunity deal calmly emerge weakness. if small banks, generally, see commercial loan weakness large institution facing, area may present heighten risks? a couple possibility come mind. first, past decade, community banks--particularly asset range $100 million $1 billion--have actively expand commercial real estate lending. since early 1990s, large community bank expand portfolio 13 percent 22 percent aggregate assets. most reserve bank report generally weak commercial real estate markets, fail company vacate office retail space renter move single family homes. commercial real estate credit still perform relatively well stage cycle, comment intend suggest material concern. nevertheless, account increase nonperforming asset past year large community banks. give checker history commercial real estate lend increase relevance many banks, portfolio must monitor manage carefully. we see cyclical nature commercial real estate link general level economic activity. the loss anchor firm k-mart, example, may reduce market value certain shop center consumer traffic financial strength nearby business well. the second area potential risk relate interest rates. for industry overall, federal reserve’s interest rate cut last year certainly appear help bank earnings, present management new challenges, too. low rate undoubtedly ease payment pressure many borrower prevent deterioration quality bank loan portfolios. nearly 60 percent bank also saw wide net interest margin first six month 2002 comparable period 2001. at point, however, low interest rate may begin compress net interest margin institution deposit rate reach effective floors. those hold low-yielding, long-term asset could get hurt. indeed, many bank respond low rate sharply reduce investment treasury shift fund mortgage-backed security search high yields. give historically low interest rate recent mortgage originate refinanced, one might expect loan prepay much slowly typically past. a result, effective maturity, duration, bank security portfolios--and many loan portfolio well--has extended. clearly, i forecast interest rates--something i’ve already learn central banker never do. my point bank organizations, investor generally, recognize domestic interest rate historically low possibility rise rate environment overlooked. even stable rate could present increase risks, save money market deposit account flow bank quickly come equity market declined. we ask long depositor would content earn currently low rate market stabilize improve interest rate rise again. at point, even loyal customers--those fix incomes, particular--may blink take step improve yields. manage risk the health financial institution today also result improvement risk-management process ongoing bank years. increasingly, entire risk management process become quantitative, reflect enhance ability collect process data low cost, also improve technique measure manage risk. bi review 55/2002 3 a aware, bank regulator work develop modern international approach bank capital--called basel ii. although standards, first instance, design address change practice large, internationally active banks, expect lesson learn risk management much broad effects. we anticipate, example, large number bank organization unite state would formally adopt data analytically intensive sophisticate process determine regulatory capital development today. the cost resource develop system framework beyond resource limit number large banks. we would expect, though, effort would eventually strengthen risk management provide best practice example industry wide. in quantify credit risk, large bank organization take lead, measure borrower’s probability default, bank’s loss give default likely exposure borrower time default, take consideration future draw downs. the great use credit score retail transaction provide strong framework ass risk ensure loan price reflect credit quality. such tool perform even good effect recent economic slowdown incorporate bank statistics. most consumer credit model develop 1990-91 recession, reliability predict default rate loss severe economic slowdown yet fully tested. we already observing, example, significant increase delinquency subprime lending. since many borrower significant access credit previous recessions, ultimate default rate help validate strength new statistical models. the measurement management interest rate risk also improve greatly recent years, perhaps particularly community banks. asset/liability committee bank throughout country routinely consider result model develop either internally vendor identify market sensitivity loans, investments, deposits. a result, manager good anticipate change net interest income develop response specific circumstances. the industry also develop new revenue stream diversify earn sources. such effort help increase cross-sell ratio key customers, turn improve customer loyalty stabilize bank’s revenue base. provide personal touch long serve community bank well, personalize service alone may become le sufficient year ahead. conduct sound market research price reflect competition, customer value, underlie risk become important success. recent abuse corporate account practice matter provide good lesson risk management banker try increase earn cross-selling products. we seen, example, conflict interest lack strong quality-assurance function destroy reputation viability major account firm. similarly, bank compensate line officer basis sale cross-selling must guard adverse incentive compensation structure provide. there, too, strong quality-assurance function essential. give dominant role credit risk banks, chief credit officer ensure pressure increase fee income lead unacceptable level credit risk. corporate governance sound corporate governance essential element strong risk-management process. a banker bank directors, specific responsibility manage risk financial institution effectively oversee system internal controls. not activity bank central credit intermediation, but, country, bank fund activity part federally insure deposits. those deposit lowest-cost source fund bank have, specifically government’s guarantee. bank director expect understand every nuance bank oversee transaction. they look management that. they do, however, responsibility set tone regard institution’s risk-taking oversee internal-control process reasonably expect directive followed. they also responsibility hire individual believe integrity exercise high level judgment competence. in light recent events, i might add director responsibility periodically consider whether initial assessment management’s integrity remain correct. 4 bi review 55/2002 interagency policy hold board director responsible ensure organization effective audit process internal control adequate nature scope businesses. the report line internal audit function information director receive impartial unduly influence management. internal audit key element management’s responsibility validate strength bank’s internal controls. in limit case function must outsourced, best practice avoid use firm external audit well. internal control responsibility line management. line manager must determine level risk need accept run business must assure combination earnings, capital, internal control sufficient compensate risk exposures. support function accounting, internal audit, risk management, credit review, compliance, legal, independently monitor control process ensure effective risk measure appropriately. the result independent review routinely report executive management board directors. both executive management director sufficiently engage process determine whether review fact independent operate area review whether officer conduct review can, indeed, speak freely. the level independence executive management board demonstrate has, course, become far visible important factor evaluate corporate governance. recent audit failure highlight value sound practices, audit committee member regularly meet privately institution’s outside auditor discus matter without management present. the recent conference board new york stock exchange recommendations, prior report blue ribbon committee treadway commission 1980s describe best practice audit committee worthy review. this summer, sarbanes-oxley act take matter independence step further, case publicly trade firms, incorporate specific requirement independence law. for example, member company’s audit committee must outside directors. moreover, least one committee member so-called financial expert. if not, firm must disclose not. the legislation also assign audit committee sole direct responsibility appointing, compensating, oversee company’s auditors. other provision act set forth potentially broad range standard affect way public company compensate executive director disclose operate results. to strengthen role outside auditors, act also limit non-audit work firm may perform audit customer create oversight board regulate oversee audit work. precisely legislative provision affect firm yet decide security exchange commission. other provisions, though, effect become effective soon warrant immediate attention. although act apply institution register share security exchange commission, element consider virtually commercial bank company material size. they could well highlight weakness procedures. indeed, beyond legal requirements, board director manager firm periodically test stand ethical business practices. they ask, example, “are get technicalities, adhere letter spirit law? be compensate others basis contribution, take advantage positions?” ultimately, course, market correct excesses, context “markets” include public private sectors. obviously, past year we’ve see reaction investor creditors, also lawmaker regulators, observe failure within corporate boardrooms. all action affect market practice. my intent today remind business community leaders, recognize value exercise self-discipline within institutions. that include maintain sound ethical practice protect reputation banks. a see recent events, market’s response harsh. bi review 55/2002 5 quality account practice uncertainty regard quality corporate account standard strike heart capitalist system threaten efficiency markets. investor lender must confident understand risk accept counterparties play fair. for six year i member emerge issue task force financial account standard board, provide account industry guidance area financial report practice diverging. during time, i develop good appreciation challenge standard-setters face deal topic become increasingly complex. inform objective professional legitimately disagree best account standard apply new type transactions. that part challenge keep account standard current. the rapid pace business innovation make impractical rule place anticipate every business transaction. rather, complex dynamic business world becomes, important account base strong principle sufficiently robust provide framework proper account new type transactions. at core account principle professional standard every corporate accountant every outside auditor must follow. in part, auditor require ask whether particular account method adequately represent economics transaction whether provide reader sufficient information evaluate risks. if not, likely procedure best account method apply. rule alone, however, ensure good financial reporting. at enron companies, weak corporate governance practice apparently permit sham transaction mislead financial reporting. outside auditor err try hard please important client. they forget professional role assure user financial report statement fairly represent condition corporation communicate, conceal, level risk. some observer assert new account standard needed. in minor way may true. but judge publicly available information, i believe need restore integrity corporate accountant quality audit process, rather impose extensive new rules. one reason account unite state become rule-based tend add new account standard abuse occur even abuse result account audit failures. rather create new rules, form new public company oversight board establish sarbanes-oxley may provide good approach help refocus public accountant core principle away aggressive mislead practices. give human nature complexity many account issues, must expect rule sometimes break misapplied. but new, authoritative oversight board--combined more-rigorous review corporate boards--should able discourage address severe abuses. for part, federal reserve also will challenge account interpretation see aggressive. by mean intend supplant account authority make rules, intend provide discipline, necessary, interpretations--particularly context regulatory report light weakness quality-assurance process public account firms. for example, federal reserve require loan pool one large bank re-consolidated financial statement determine risk control remove organization creation special purpose vehicles. in another example, bank regulator jointly issue comment new guidance relate credit cards. this guidance deal unacceptable practices, also clarify revenue recognition fee bill customer reflect expect ability collect fees. in addition recognition measurement aspect financial reporting, need continually evaluate effectiveness disclosures. public disclosure banks, well firms, need follow standard framework exactly all. rather, insist entity disclose information belief stakeholder need evaluate risk profile. each business line complex organization unique, and--to effective--the specific disclosure risk different, too. even small organizations, disclosure tailor reflect activity organization. a summary information important executive management board director monitor health bank excellent place start tailor information would useful investor customers. that approach take develop basel ii capital accord. disclosure rule rigid may 6 bi review 55/2002 be, become, incompatible risk-management process continually evolve. in area many others, best result likely come banker regulator work together. conclusion in closing, i congratulate industry, generally, successfully deal challenge past year. the industry remain fundamentally sound consistently demonstrate deal stress. nevertheless, business afford remain static, bank size continually pursue good way manage risk. follow sound accounting, auditing, disclosure practice consistently also crucial maintain confidence capital financial markets. we learn experience past year ensure account control system practice sound. we also take opportunity strengthen area corporate governance may weak. a banker bank regulators, responsible conduct affair competence integrity. a so, bank system grow strong still. bi review 55/2002 1 niklaus blattner: value, vulnerability resilience financial market infrastructure speech professor niklaus blattner, member govern board swiss national bank, sibos conference, open plenary, geneva, 30 september 2002. * * * lady gentleman a central banker share responsibility oversee payment settlement systems, i course closely follow development financial market infrastructure. there doubt development greatly contribute enhance efficiency financial sector. they also highlight fact payment settlement system also provider standardize service field, least s.w.i.f.t., become important time. the development show safety resilience clearly gain weight system operators, system participant well regulatory authorities. in first part address i would like consider economic value add payment settlement infrastructure briefly discus drive force underlie development. in second part i shall focus role central bank agency oversight. in third part i shall describe factor shape vulnerability financial market infrastructure examine factor change time. the fourth part devote implication identify vulnerability resilience. in fifth part i shall address cost-benefit issue sooner late inevitably turn whenever measure improve resilience discussed. i shall conclude summing-up main points. value: significance drive force the main function bank intermediation. in basic form intermediation take place borrower lenders. additional intermediation function - among many others - make payment buy sell security behalf clients. over past decade see huge decrease cost intermediation. this drastically change structure bank sector and, general level, structure whole financial sector. two factor trigger change. first, competition market increase consequence reduce trade barrier deregulation. trade barrier good also service include financial service financial asset progressively lifted. this lead rapidly grow interaction among economies, least area bank financial services. country participate process see domestic financial market become deeply integrate market abroad. distance location, increasingly become le obstacle, long give protection competition. this globalization. second, technological progress, especially information technology (it) telecommunications, exert all-pervasive pressure innovate level process product greatly affect way financial sector organize itself. innovation sharply reduce cost telecommunication well cost it equipment. a consequence, cost trade financial service financial asset decrease enormously. additionally, innovation bring costs, also increase scale scope well quality services. innovation make market expand hitherto unknown degree. indeed, value trade financial service asset go almost explosively. these development require construction adequate trading, clear settlement infrastructure. a good example market foreign exchange (fx). today, fx one truly global markets. it open 24 hour day participant globe connect electronic networks. here, birth continuous link settlement (cls) utmost importance. since september 9 year settlement fx transaction large seven currency take place payment versus payment basis. cl possible thank technological progress, decrease communication costs, large trade volumes. the benefit high efficiency also reduce risk. 2 bi review 55/2002 let sum first section value follows: there doubt market integration technological progress drive forces. they lead sizeable reduction transaction costs. this permit creation today’s globalize financial industry make possible impressive growth value. the role central bank oversight now, let turn role central bank oversight: every transaction - commodity service - eventually lead transfer money. from trade settlement least one system financial market infrastructure usually involved. give this, surprise regulator keep keen eye market developments. central banks, core mandate monetary policy, especially close relationship payment systems. to overseer payment system main objective safety. the definition standard safety evolve years. for long time main interest central bank payment system come computer experts. payment system use view merely ‘computers’ clear settle payment obligations. in late 1980s focus start shift towards financial risks, i.e. credit liquidity risk inherent payment systems. slowly become common knowledge payment system could source systemic risk provide channel failure one participant meet payment obligation could pass participants. in best interest influence overseer operator start protect system financial risk - case build real-time gross settlement system (rtgs). today almost every country operate rtgs system. there widespread consensus within private sector central bank community kind operational requirement financial risk control necessary make payment system safe. a main contributor area committee payment settlement system (cpss) bank international settlement (bis). a standard-setting body cps has, instance, draft core principle systemically important payment systems. the core principle testimony consensus standard safety efficiency payment systems. the cps also play lead role raise awareness risk involve settlement foreign exchange transactions. it also follow extent promote cl project since beginning. the safety clear settlement infrastructure long-standing concern overseers. together financial industry might even enjoy pride look achieve term efficiency well safety soundness operation industry. but clearly, since september 11, 2001, new awareness vulnerability grow u all. those tragic event make u rethink approach vis-à-vis safety operational risk. i think suddenly realize reassess vulnerability institution system and, necessary, improve resilience. vulnerability - quick survey ensure companies, consumer investor confidence ability effect transaction access funds, securities, financial asset high importance time crisis. therefore clearly private public interest ensure that, event large-scale disruption, systemic consequence minimized. however, minimize systemic consequence require know major vulnerability financial system. with knowledge responsible party private sector well central bank government principle take adequate precaution remedies. three source vulnerability identified. a first source vulnerability economic concentration among large complex financial institutions. this may strike odd. but size potential source vulnerability industrial consolidation usually increase size. the financial industry experience numerous merger acquisitions. this result financial service offer increasingly small number large dominant players. even one player stop function well financial system whole might suffer. the second source vulnerability geographical clustering. financial institution heavily cluster limit number important international financial centers. economic concentration bi review 55/2002 3 geographical cluster tend add up. a huge number firms, among industry’s giants, may affect one location one disruptive event. a third source vulnerability large degree connectivity interdependency financial sector. y2k terrorist attack september 11, 2001, highlight type vulnerability. one key lesson learn vulnerability extend beyond system since crucially rely utility electricity telecommunication service provider like s.w.i.f.t. let sum again. there three major source financial system’s vulnerability: economic concentration, geographic clustering, connectivity interdependency. the latter obvious characteristic financial networks. network contribute increase efficiency facilitate risk management. at time also act channel well origin systemic crisis. from vulnerability resilience hand hand new awareness vulnerability financial system, responsible safety stability private firms, financial market infrastructure well regulatory agency recently take new hard look financial system’s capacity resilience. in retrospect y2k problem first mild nevertheless rather valuable test. the y2k test mild sense everybody enough time prepare it. what help y2k clear deadline. all contingency communication network could set event. many u gather today know exactly december 31, 1999, call problems. still, y2k valuable financial community far open mind increase sensitivity problem nobody encounter envisage before. today, however, situation different considerably complex. the event september 11, 2001, clearly increase awareness further. look back time attack seem tend underestimate probability consequence disruption. so need do make sure continue underestimate threats? how resilience financial system improved? what responsibility us? at level single financial institution objective measure - term back solutions, staff safety training, test procedures, contingency plan general - may newly defined. a specific issue probably yet receive enough attention everywhere internal crisis management process. establish crisis management committee, coordinate decision communication time crisis, vital, especially large complex financial institution act globally. on top this, crisis management need test general. one simple scenario could be: happen bank - whatever reason - able release s.w.i.f.t. messages? in addition, crisis management single institution must involve customers, business partner peers, service provider utility providers. crisis management therefore demand activity. what apply single financial institution obviously also apply institution financial market infrastructure, central bank institution supervision oversight general. the insight apply everyone: be aware new dimension systemic risk within globalize financial market refrain early satisfaction appear achieved. at point, i would like stress overall resilience financial sector also depend financial strength institution. in retrospect might say benign coincidence september 11, 2001 attack happen period comparatively favorable economic condition financial industry. under le favorable circumstance capacity absorb shock could considerably smaller. this another reason rapid implementation new basel accord capital adequacy important financial system whole. in addition obvious new task arise regulatory agency central bank national well international level. address issue disaster recovery become part routine supervisory process. supervisory guideline examination procedure adjust light helpful tool increase resilience. also, oversee payment system resilience business continuity scrutinize anew. 4 bi review 55/2002 finally, central bank must always keep mind carry big responsibility resilience stability role liquidity providers. time time again, free easy access liquidity prove essential large-scale crises. since central bank liquidity usually grant collateral, linkage payment security settlement system especially robust. the market participant know understand condition access lend last resort facility provide central bank shape contingency plan collateral portfolio accordingly. simultaneously central bank take necessary precaution increase resilience end. cost benefit resilience let add remark cost benefit improve resilience. my conviction come surprise you: investment resilience indeed pay financial sector whole society large, also pay financial market infrastructure every financial firm. in words, i doubt still need do level single institutions, and, top that, level financial industry whole. however, voice raise concern that, light ever-increasing cost safety background significant cost pressure due deteriorate market conditions, investment resilience might fact increasingly limited. but, i say before, high requirement operational reliability, contingency plan crisis management stem mainly financial industry’s development. clearly, increase concentration, geographic clustering, connectivity interdependency highly beneficial, also price come reduction risk. we cannot enjoy benefit without pay price. the point careful invest resilience. and make sure resource wasted. for sure, regulatory community keep mind best impose unnecessary burden private sector. summary conclusion finally, let sum main points. • today’s globalize financial industry show impressive long-term value growth. this growth due market integration technological progress. together lead sizable reduction transaction cost expand markets. • every transaction eventually lead transfer money. from trade settlement usually least one system financial market infrastructure involved. overseer care safety systems. this responsibility. • the event september 11, 2001, make industry, regulator overseer rethink approach safety. consequently vulnerability financial system resilience currently reevaluated. • three major source vulnerability identified: economic concentration, geographic cluster connectivity interdependency. network nature act channel well origin systemic crisis. • the awareness vulnerability lead new substantial demand investment resilience. for instance, crisis management demand activity. it involve private firms, financial market infrastructures, public supervisor oversight institutions. without cooperation crisis management cannot succeed. • investment resilience, however, costly. the benefit financial sector’s value growth cannot enjoy without pay price. should price pay value growth would turn unsustainable. there stable financial system time highly resilient crisis conditions. allow expand last point: representative central bank i assure central bank likely close eye issue. resilience financial service provider general financial market infrastructure particular place top regulatory authorities’ agendas. indeed, stay there. a much public body contribute bi review 55/2002 5 resilience financial system whole, make demand private sector. a much public body will step coordinator time crisis eventually lender last resort, also want see private sector entity involve actively participate shape resilience resolve crises. the responsibility financial stability share responsibility. i fully aware none u precisely estimate today economic consequence yet order increase resilience financial systems. since resilience bind test harshly sooner later, alternative rapid, serious, adequate necessary costly preparation us. let end express gratitude. i enjoy contribute exchange information, evaluation views. this essence sibos conference. i particularly grateful since i know u room well financial sector professional unable attend conference, private sector well public sector, willingly share noble responsibility efficiency stability today’s tomorrow’s financial systems. thank much attention. bi review 54/2002 1 willem f duisenberg: the first nine month euro cash era speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, occasion international image

photographic image sector", website says. let start draw parallel photokina central banking, which, i must admit, easy task. both activity – important point – future-oriented. in fact, key objective photokina exhibitor present "the future" now, shape new product new technologies. also central bankers, future-oriented decision-making crucial; fact, important element successful monetary policy. a forward-looking approach also take creator euro. the single currency use non-cash payment instrument unit account since start 1999 physical payment instrument since begin year. the introduction

in speech today, i shall look future, shall also look back little, first nine month euro cash era. put eight billion banknote close 39 billion coin circulation logistical operation truly gigantic

shall consider use euro outside euro area. in fact, evidence considerable demand euro banknote also outside euro area particularly country neighbour eu. finally, i'll talk major concern people euro area, namely perceive impact euro banknote coin inflation, "teuro" phenomenon popularly call germany. while true sectors, especially services, price increase make various reasons, across-the-board impact overall consumer price development small. i come back late well. currency circulation banknote development before, cash changeover let first consider happen currency circulation euro banknote month before, cash changeover. the period euro cash changeover saw significant decline currency circulation; currency circulation define value banknote coin hold non-banks – turn mean currency hold resident euro area belong euro area bank sector non-residents. from december 2000 december 2001, volume national "legacy" currency circulate euro area country decrease around 30%. in first two month

first half year, term cash deposits. i point that, anonymity cash, central banker usually able determine exactly banknote issue circulating. some indication provide cross-border transfer banknote via banks, banknote carry across border individual registered. of legacy currency circulate outside "home" territory, deutsche mark banknote account large proportion. moreover, people live outside euro area also use certain extent legacy currencies, french franc, italian lira, austrian schilling spanish peseta. a large share legacy currency believe circulate central south-east europe well turkey. therefore, introduction euro cash begin 2002 major event euro area also number neighbour country legacy banknote euro area circulating. the euro cash changeover aftermath offer unique opportunity european central bank collect first-hand information foreign circulation euro. such information derive data frontloading euro banknote destination abroad, data cross-border shipment euro banknote banks, probably comprise main outflow first month euro cash era, well evidence provide number central bank country neighbour eu. all all, although available data estimate characterise various degree uncertainty, evidence euro use neighbour country significant extent, either cash deposit form. let's consider cash first. the cash changeover outside euro area start early 1 december 2001, order facilitate conversion euro legacy currency banknote hold non-euro area resident 1 january onwards. non-euro area central bank international bank abroad receive euro banknote enable meet initial cash need public business. banknote worth almost eur 5 billion ship outside euro area december 2001, half destine eastern central europe, turkey. since january, bank bi review 54/2002 3 continue ship euro banknote outside euro area order replace legacy currency banknote meet new demand. between december 2001 june 2002, accumulate net amount around eur 23 billion euro banknote ship abroad via bank system. in mid-1990s, bundesbank estimate deutsche mark banknote circulate outside germany worth eur 32 45 billion. if take rough approximation amount legacy currency banknote hold outside euro area, available evidence suggest considerable part already convert euro banknotes. let's consider euro-denominated bank deposits. they also play important part cash changeover outside euro area. indeed, cash changeover, several non-euro area country encourage household deposit legacy currency cash hold euro-denominated accounts, rather exchange directly euro banknotes. credit institutions, particularly foreign-owned banks, widely advertise euro-denominated account attractive conditions. this strategy intend reduce logistical transaction cost relate changeover operations. in cases, especially south-east europe, another objective boost confidence bank systems. in co-operation number central bank country neighbour euro area, ecb gather data scale developments. overall, around 30 countries, euro-denominated deposit increase total eur 13 billion 2001. information first month 2002 suggest may last phenomenon euro-denominated deposit decrease slightly. in nutshell, available evidence tend indicate legacy currency banknote convert euro, either cash deposit form. this suggest euro successfully replace legacy currency region neighbour eu. let add – despite considerable amount euro banknote transfer abroad – foreign circulation euro banknote constitute limit proportion total currency circulation. the estimate amount euro banknote circulate outside euro area end june account 8% total currency circulation 0.4% monetary aggregate m3. therefore, ecb monitor development closely, currently play significant role assessment monetary development euro area regard price developments. demand euro banknote long term let also take somewhat longer-term perspective regard demand euro euro area outside. a already mentioned, preliminary interpretation base development first month euro cash era suggest negative trend currency circulation observe cash changeover reverse relatively quickly. it would seem currency hold transaction purposes, also hoarding, build fairly quickly people outside euro area. but demand cash yet take full shape, early ass whether cash changeover long-term impact use cash general public and, so, direction. certainly, number domestic well foreign factor play role longer-term demand euro banknotes: first, regard domestic demand, introduction single currency facilitate use cash across euro area countries. at time, however, introduction euro make possible general economise cash hold cross-border uses, might lead low cash holdings. second, euro area countries, euro banknote denomination high national legacy currencies. this might lead change cash hold habits. third, integration financial sector euro area tend work favour low cross-border transaction cost electronic payment instrument credit cards. this might encourage great use electronic payment instrument euro area. at time, however, factor also tend result low fee cross-border cash withdrawals. finally, regard foreign demand euro banknote coins, close financial, economic institutional link euro area neighbour suggest ongoing perhaps increase foreign demand euro banknotes, particular, although probably exclusively, eu's neighbour countries. 4 bi review 54/2002 consequently, factor work different directions, difficult foresee longer-term trend banknote developments. impact cash changeover price development let turn issue attract much publicity recent months. there controversy many euro area country whether introduction euro banknote coin lead increase prices. accord recent survey european commission, 60% euro area inhabitant believe price sector increase since january. another 15% think price rise sector economy. let first say difficult separate impact cash changeover price degree precision. any price change could due either changeover itself, of, example, round new eye-catching price pass-through cash changeover costs, might reflect change cost factors, like wage import prices. this imply estimation cash changeover effect price surround uncertainty. in order get evidence price change might relate cash changeover, informative look sector level. indeed, specific service items, price increase usual, could relate introduction euro. for example, eat out, haircut clothe dry-cleaned become significantly expensive first month 2002, many people euro area notice this, include myself. in general, price increase mainly take place sector low level competition product rather differentiated. at time, however, important realise also price increase due factor unrelated euro. for example, early month year, extreme winter weather euro area, particularly mediterranean countries, lead severe supply shortage thus high vegetable prices. likewise, rise petrol price first quarter 2002 cannot attribute cash changeover, result high oil price world market and, countries, high taxes. the apply cigarette price several euro area countries. moreover, take account harmonise index consumer prices, use measure consumer price euro area, broad index cover comprehensive basket good purchase households. while cannot suppose reflect cost live single household, reflect average cost live representative household euro area. therefore, item good basket may go price partly cash changeover, many item basket show significant price increases. in fact, good actually become le expensive recent months. one example might particular interest you, lady gentlemen, price level photographic cinematographic equipment: july year price good almost 3½ percent low july 2001 across euro area. telephone call also become cheap period. in area competition strong also price reduction associate euro. overall, appear cash changeover major factor overall development euro area consumer prices. eurostat, official statistical agency eu, estimate cash changeover effect euro area hicp inflation first half 2002 0 0.2 percentage points. study country level also point limit overall effects, possible euro-induced price increase certain sectors. for example, germany's federal statistical office, jointly work deutsche bundesbank, state recently, "the euro introduction considerable impact cost live whole"(1) germany. while effect may vary across euro area country sectors, overall impact cash changeover overall price level euro area contained. this evidence, however, contrast sharply concern discussion many euro area country impact euro cash consumer prices. one reason gap empirical find public opinion might fact general perception price change strongly influence price small-ticket good service purchase almost 1 "six month introduction euro cash - intermediate stock-take official price statistics", destatis press release, 2 july 2002. bi review 54/2002 5 daily basis. coincidentally, price frequently purchase items, like tomatoes, petrol tobacco products, go up, various reason i mention (such winter weather, oil price taxes), time introduction euro banknote coins. although price increase unrelated cash changeover, many people unfortunately associate changeover. but important realise complete picture obtain look comprehensive measure prices, include price le frequent purchases. in fact, overall consumer price inflation around 2% recent months, level similar december 2001, introduction euro banknote coins. in addition, price prospect come month point rate around 2% euro area. over long period time, great transparency result introduction euro move exclusive euro price strengthen competition retail sector contain price pressure euro area. these permanent benefit efficiency gain introduce euro far outweigh generally small changeover effect inflation. conclude remark let sum up. the introduction euro banknote coin major success make possible thorough preparation party involve good reception public. the euro banknote make visible monetary union close financial integration twelve euro area countries. we satisfy banknote immediately accept public euro area. and foreign demand euro banknote shows, euro much seek outside euro area well. finally, even though effect certain good service prices, permanent benefit single currency efficiency gain introduce euro far exceed short-term effect inflation. lady gentlemen, i would like thank attention. bi review 54/2002 1 alan greenspan: regulation, innovation wealth creation remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, society

lancaster house late evening, i discuss new tool risk management principle guide containment systemic risk allocation private public sectors. here i would like focus narrower, nonetheless increasingly important, issue: nexus risk-taking, regulation, innovation, wealth creation. owe persistent advance information compute technologies, structure financial institution continuously changing, i trust better. but evolution financial structure also mean supervision regulation must continually change order respond adequately developments. in today's markets, example, increase reliance private counterparty surveillance primary mean financial control. government supplement private surveillance judge market imperfection could lead sub-optimal economic performance. but let u consider another aspect market regulation efforts: transparency. there much dispute market function best participant fully informed. yet, paradoxically, full disclosure participant know undermine incentive take risk, precondition economic growth. no one deny fully inform market participant generate efficient price resource efficient allocation capital. moreover, could argue that, information hold individual buyer seller become available participants, price structure would closely reflect underlie balance supply demand. thus full information would appear unambiguous objective. but be? 2 bi review 54/2002 take, example, real estate developer conceive innovative project significantly raise value land situated--provided site posse suitable characteristics. suppose costly developer determine whether give site suitable. if discover suitable site able quietly purchase land current owner without reveal value project, developer make substantial profit, community overall presumably benefit improve land use. but if, purchase land, developer require disclose purchase intention and, particular, value enhancement create project? the seller see big picture would elevate offer sufficiently high extract full value innovation developer. under circumstances, would project go forward? clearly not, developer would unwilling bear cost evaluate potential site know would reap none benefit discover suitable ones. a requirement full disclosure potential, heretofore undiscovered value land would engender neither disclosure improve land use. an example immediate current regulatory concern issue regulation disclosure over-the-counter derivative market. by design, market, presume involve deal among sophisticate professionals, largely exempt government regulation. in part, exemption reflect view professional require investor protection commonly afford market retail investor participate. but regulation unnecessary markets, potentially damaging, regulation presuppose disclosure force disclosure proprietary information undercut innovation financial market would real estate markets. all participant competitive market seek innovation yield above-normal returns. in generally efficient markets, find profits. but exploit discovery earn abnormal return so. in process, improve market efficiency provide service previously available. most financial innovation over-the-counter derivative involve new way disperse risk. moreover, constantly change financial environment supply steady stream new opportunity innovation address market imperfections. innovative product temporarily earn quasi-monopoly rent. but eventually arbitrage remove market imperfection yield above-normal return. in end, innovative product become "commodity" make available modest, fully competitive profit. to require disclosure structure innovative product either introduction would immediately eliminate quasi-monopoly return discourage future endeavor innovate area. the result market imperfection would remain unaddressed allocation capital most-productive us would thwarted. even require disclosure confidential basis solely regulatory authority may well inhibit risk-taking. innovator never fully confident, justly otherwise, security information. regulator may always able differentiate easily secrecy protect intellectual property secrecy deceive commit outright fraud. yet supervisory system must make distinction best can. there nothing unusual make difficult tradeoff regulation. in fact, rule rather exception regulatory regimes--whether financial nonfinancial sector economies. indeed, tradeoffs, wide sense, determine differ regulatory regime see around world. those difference regime reflect largely attitude toward competition. competition facilitator innovation. and creative destruction, process less-productive capital displace innovative cutting-edge technologies, drive force wealth creation. thus, perspective aggregate wealth creation, competition better. but unfettered competitive capitalism mean fully accept optimal economic paradigm, least yet. some involve public policy often see competition frenetic. this different perspective capture clearly soliloquy attribute prominent european leader several year ago. he asked, "what market? it law jungle, law nature. and civilization? it struggle nature." a major determinant regulatory regime rule law apply strike

austrian national bank, cepr/esi annual conference: “regulatory challenge european financial markets”, host austrian national bank, vienna, 21 september 2002. the reference speech find austrian national bank’s website. * * * introduction supervisor early post war period use fairly quiet life. the regulatory regime time characterize largely repress nationally close financial system shield competition. the bretton wood system make currency risk insignificant, interest rate fluctuation moderate, price competition play role interest rate regulation place. there also little competition non-banks international competition restrict capital controls. this situation result high intermediation margin relatively low risk. a consequence risk bear capacity financial institution high financial system stable. this situation radically change since mid seventies. after fall bretton wood system accompany process wide spread financial deregulation interest rate currency risk increase substantially financial system become much competitive world. intermediation margin come pressure risk bear capacity financial system decreased. supervisor suddenly confront bank crisis problem financial instability. the sometimes sizeable cost crisis increasingly refocus regulatory debate issue depositor protection competition policy issue financial stability. today supervisor regulator world see strengthen safeguard financial instability one core tasks. but instrument place today appropriate achieve goal? be recent regulatory initiative able improve current practice? i think fair claim many remarkable improvement make recently past two decades. the effort improve capital- risk management standard bank result substantial advance adapt financial environment characterize reduce margin high volatility. the level debate risk within outside financial institution rise substantially awareness potential problem assessment method regulatory instrument nowadays much high ten twenty year ago. all improvement notwithstanding, i want argue today still need critical debate think financial instability, cause economic consequences. in debate question perceive viewpoint sometimes perhaps go back basics. there course many open issue i possibly address talk. so let confine mainly particular - though important- aspect debate: the common perspective financial regulation financial instability moment mainly concern single institutions. the discussion financial crisis systemic risk however require shift perspective individual institution financial system whole. this shift perspective already way. the popularity notion “macro-prudential” versus “micro-prudential” approach regulation supervision reflect fact (borio (2002)). a andrew crockett, general manager bi explain widely cite speech international conference bank supervisor basel september 2000, macro- micro prudential approach supervision regulation differ mainly term objective supervisory task conception mechanism influence economic outcomes. whereas macro-prudential objective define limit cost financial distress economy whole reduce likelihood large scale breakdown financial intermediation, micro-prudential approach concern limit failure individual institutions. whereas micro-prudential approach base assumption financial stability ensure every institution financial system sound, macro-prudential approach necessarily endorse view. 2 bi review 53/2002 in follow i want contribute discussion argue shift perspective institution-based regulatory policy system perspective indeed necessary important actively discus issues. the endogenous nature financial risk the recent history financial regulation - particular framework put forward basle committee - concern large extent upgrade capital standard banks. one basic feature regulation idea capital charge require regulator reflect appropriately risk take banks: risk weighted. bank take high risk require hold capital. the major part discussion capital adequacy regulation far center appropriate choice risk weights. in fact core part proposal new basle accord deal correct past shortcoming choice weights. in process regulator rely heavily individual risk management model operate bank audit supervisors. capital charge determine base result risk management models. the recent development increase scope model-based calculation capital charge much wide class risks. a common feature model financial risk take exogenous behavior institutions. conceptually many modern internal risk model look financial risk bear bank much way risk weather. manage risk financial institution thus see analogy game nature (see morris shin (1999)). this point view perfectly sensible perspective individual bank. a individual institution big international market may make sense view financial risk reflect volatility financial market asset price largely exogenous. for system whole risk face different agent financial system however endogenous. from system viewpoint important see price volatility determine endogenously aggregate depend joint behavior agents. fail recognize endogenous nature financial risk indeed lead poor risk assessments. in particular time crisis weather paradigm financial risk seriously misleading. while normal time action many heterogeneous agent cancel aggregate time crisis behavior usually become extremely uniform individual action become mutually reinforce thereby amplify crises. this remind u basic insight area economics: what true micro level may necessarily hold aggregate. in recent academic literature various contribution morris shin (see morris shin (1999)) model basic insight analysis bank crisis currency attacks. their main point financial market - contrary weather forecast - agent play game nature agent simultaneously. in situation action individual agent typically mutually reinforcing. equilibrium behavior characterize simultaneous sudden switch collective actions. discrepancy individually aggregate rational behavior arise individual agent take account effect behavior payoff distribution agents. if - example- everybody sell fall market price plummet crisis reinforced. morris shin (1999) discus episode crash u dollar yen october 1998 example logic describe above. the dollar continuously appreciate year crash. in summer 1998 expect dollar would rise even end year. in combination large interest rate differential japan us, many trader take advantage situation borrow yen, buy dollar asset make profit appreciation dollar well interest rate differential. this kind trade strategy pursue banks, hedge fund even big corporations. when russian default set august 1998 agent participate call yen-carry strategy month simultaneously eager unwind dollar position reinforce fall dollar thereby deepen crises. individually strategy might rational. what individual institution weather paradigm financial risk fail take account fact behavior individual change payoff distribution individuals. since externality take account current bi review 53/2002 3 risk management technology reason believe model work poorly exactly need most: time crises. what conclusion draw insight? i think argument put forward support point make beginning. if want design regulatory framework able act safeguard financial instability shift perspective individual institution system level essential. the current strong reliance individual backward look risk model question think supplement approach form aggregate assessment take endogenous nature risk account far possible. summarize point i want conclude ask whether moment perhaps rely much use internal risk model determine capital charges. a i argued, model root risk concept particularly mislead shortly crisis endogenous nature risk. at onset crisis process drive data risk assessment base undergo structural break change nature. if fail take effect account lead flaw mislead risk assessments. the problem hide aggregate risk exposure another tension micro- macro-perspective exist field bank supervision. current practice mostly base individual institution approach. it hop supervisory assessment “soundness” single institution bank bank regulatory monitor risk model sufficient safeguard stability bank system whole. this point view however doubted. a problem discuss substantial difference single institution system perspective. one major reason individual institution approach insufficient fact modern bank system characterize fairly complex network mutual credit exposures. these credit exposure result liquidity management one hand otc derivative trade hand. they substantially increase importance post bretton wood area huge growth international capital markets. they also become important bank industry's reaction situation tight margin increase volatility. bank increasingly use new risk management technique try take risk balance sheet sell third party via derivative contracts, mainly interest rate swaps. in system mutual exposure actual risk bear bank system whole institution embed may easily hide level individual bank. thus major problem individual institution perspective potentially mislead risk assessment financial system whole. the problem hide risk exposure perhaps easily see case counterparty risk. judge level individual institution might look rather unspectacular. by individual institution perspective however remain unnoticed bank part chain mutual obligation credit risk highly correlated. it actual risk exposure thus might indeed quite substantial uncover assessment make system level. another example hide exposure point literature previous speaker, professor hellwig. he give example network mutual credit obligation make substantial exposure system interest rate risk invisible level individual bank individual maturity transformation look short, whereas maturity transformation system whole rather extreme (see hellwig 1997). to uncover hide exposure appropriately ass risk bank system, rather look individual institutions, risk assessment therefore make attempt judge risk exposure system whole. how change system orient supervisory risk assessment could work practice seem moment still open issue. even feel uneasy current practice clear system perspective would look like practice. this however imply face challenge. to contrary: if take task strengthen safeguard financial instability seriously, find answer question indeed crucial. let point stage oesterreichische nationalbank research activity try actively contribute process. the result effort publish regular financial stability report work paper series bank. 4 bi review 53/2002 to summarize remark let conclude rethink current practice supervise bank systems. i argue problem current approach base individual institution may fail notice important risk exposure remain hide attempt achieve risk assessment system level. spot build financial instability bank system case extremely difficult task. but quality risk assessment greatly improve manage learn risk assessment system level done. to sure let make clear i argue current supervisory practice value big task safeguard financial stability. however, need complementary approach bring macro-perspective overall risk assessment bank system whole. the problem procyclical effect capital adequacy regulation another classical conflict micro- macro-perspective financial stability extensively discuss case capital adequacy regulation. while individual institution may make sense take defensive stance situation crises, bank could end bad off. from early day basel accord concern procyclical effect capital adequacy regulation raise issue widely discussed. (see blum hellwig (1995)). if i discus procyclicality issue i therefore tell hardly anything new. however seem necessary point stage close debate yet. the mechanism capital standard act cyclical amplifier relatively easy understand. capital adequacy regulation bring bank situation cut back credit recession fulfil capital requirement adverse shock. especially situation bank hit time, might amplify economic recession increase bank insolvency rather prevent them. of course analysis base assumption bank easily issue new equity firm simply substitute bank credit source finance. the effect capital scarcity lead ''credit crunch'' observe investigate literature bernake lown (1991) calomiris wilson (1998) among others. if substantial cost connect issue new equity bad time firm easily substitute bank finance sources, one automatically procyclical effect bank lend matter whether capital requirement place not. however capital requirement may act amplifier. refine risk weight make capital charge dependent internal external rat may even exacerbate effect rat also vary business cycle. preliminary evidence suggest procyclicality likely increase new proposal particular crisis situation (see segoviano lowe (2002)). have say this, conclusion shall draw analysis? i definite answer i think concern raise discussion take seriously challenge think approach could strengthen countercyclical regulatory instrument encourage build cushion boom act buff time deteriorate. make progress direction require able improve measurement risk time assessment profile macroeconomic risks; extremely difficult task (see borio 2002). there effort proceed direction particular work bi institution still much done. some author argue procyclicality concern largely exaggerate reason believe number factor alleviate even offset effects. (see borio 2002). i think know definite answer yet. theoretical argument preliminary evidence combine alert u make progress issue. the role central bank i argue need strengthen system perspective financial regulation financial stability regulatory instrument objective complement new bi review 53/2002 5 approach risk assessment supervision. at policy level endeavour necessarily involve many institution raise difficult policy coordination issues. let say word role central bank process. modern central bank always intimately connect bank supervision. this intimate link historic root establishment banknote mean payment spread commercial bank money bank deposit convenient substitute banknote coins. while public function monetary policy ensure confidence paper currency, ensure stability relationship central bank commercial bank money ultimate function prudential supervision regulation bank system. thus central bank keen interest issue financial stability. a far shift perspective individual institution approach system base approach regulation supervision concerned, central bank natural institution contribute attempt. central bank role liquidity provider bank system function prudential supervision rich data set relevant issue raise above. these data set provide potentially extremely valuable information use exploit development new tool method support system approach bank regulation supervision. a i indicate begin issue financial stability raise top agenda economic policy discussion world financial environment substantially change since mid seventies. both financial institution regulator last decade already learn lot live new world increase volatility tight margins. a central bank need time learn effectively fight inflation, need time learn best deal volatile competitive financial environment. in learn process policy maker benefit lot input academic research economic analysis. in way academic research provide valuable insight help policy maker conquest inflation, attempt provide safeguard financial instability equally benefit active dialogue policy research. initiative conference therefore valuable indeed i want emphasize good policy solution big challenge safeguard financial stability depend much fruitful dialogue academic research economic policy. conclusion the discussion financial stability financial crisis bring u long way since begin seventies. we learn lot process despite many shortcoming regulatory environment well active management risk bank financial institution substantially improve since then. however many question still addressed. i hope i convince one big step ahead u development meaningful effective way complement exist approach safeguard financial stability systemically orient viewpoint. i discuss three issue -

assessment reliance fix exchange rate occasional discretionary fiscal policy measure exacerbate inherent problem. quite contrary, fixed-exchange-rate policy instrumental significant improvement danish economic policy take place last 10-15 years. the danish government, support large majority danish parliament, commit use fiscal policy inflationary development line exchange-rate policy. it publicly announce fiscal policy adjust inflation deviate ecb’s definition price stability (0-2 pct. increase harmonise index consumer price - hicp). fiscal measure take due regard development government debt

bring structural reform tax benefit system labour market policy forefront necessary tool ensure low unemployment growth real income. asymmetric shocks, home-made shock exchange-rate policy denmark a float exchange rate often consider useful order insulate economy certain shock world nominal wage rigidity and/or limit labour mobility. a fixed-exchange-rate policy lead excessive protract unemployment world, adjustment asymmetric shock – least theory – important argument fixed-exchange-rate policy. however, importance argument require answer follow two questions: 1) what cause large positive large negative output gaps? 2) be float exchange rate efficient shock absorber? the danish economy severe slump 1981, reach peak 1986, go back period slow growth, bottom 1993, grow strongly since exhaust negative output gap, cf. chart 3. the business cycle also line germany well entire euro area. the business cycle deviation german business cycle cannot explain exogenous external factors. firstly, demand danish export deviate trend extent explain cyclical swing period observation. secondly, term trade move le line term trade eu member states, rule bi review 53/2002 5 external

accompany correspond immediate reduction inflation expectations. this lead decline expect ex-ante after-tax real interest rate trigger boom house price private consumption, lead peak 1986. the highly preferential tax treatment interest-rate expenditure reduce 1987. a decline actual inflation combination tax change lead sharp increase ex-post after-tax real interest rate trigger proceed depression house market strong increase private save ratio. the danish experience last twenty year thus “home made” domestic shock stem economic policy important exogenous external shocks. swedish krona danish

away reasonable estimate purchase power parity thus act shock creator rather shock absorber, cf. buiter (2000). the strength dollar mid-1980s present weakness euro well-known examples. the importance

oesterreichische nationalbank. i particularly grateful centre economic policy research (cepr) professor eijffinger, dr. hochreiter professor koedijk organize academic conference highly interest selection paper important topic. the financial system fulfil several essential function performance real economy. it play crucial role allocation resource channel fund household enterprises, provide risk-sharing opportunity household firm help agent economise transaction information costs. an economic environment function fulfil smoothly efficiently therefore essential welfare economy. the accelerate process european integration abolish various obstacle previously place national boundary different legislations. and development single financial market europe lead situation financial system fulfil core function much good could fulfil two decade ago. this integration process accelerate reinforce introduction single currency. it success support process financial market integration structural change. there good reason believe begin process. but financial market integration enough guarantee financial system fulfil function efficiently. it clear economist policy maker long time financial market work smoothly efficiently, rely complementary legal regulatory infrastructure. thus economic integration european financial market accompany necessary adoption regulatory framework regimes. the topic conference therefore important one. the problem arise process big challenge supervisor regulators. they also challenge central banker central bank traditionally among institution closely involve supervision financial system. the regulatory challenge european financial market arise combination necessary adaptation general technological development as, instance, electronic money - issue address lecture conference - specific problem arise integration regulatory regime previously separate national boundary different legislation framework work efficiently newly integrate financial market single currency. the debate regulatory issue attract much attention recently intensive discussion national european level. at national level focus debate future role central bank process prudential supervision bank system. the issue intensively discuss european level question centralize versus decentralize model supervision. these debate reflect active response policy maker general public development financial market bring about, inter alia, process european integration. let address issue turn: at national level observe various proposal reorganise restructure financial market supervision. some country already take step major institutional reforms. in course debate active involvement key role central bank supervise bank system repeatedly challenged. model new national institution charge 2 bi review 53/2002 supervise banks, financial market insurance industry one roof general financial service authority gain popularity among politicians. the merger various supervisory fields, technically quite different tasks, highly ambitious rather difficult organisational problem. in way merger industry advantage disadvantage organisational form assess light practical experience. whatever reorganisation design debate, however, case crucial importance take clear position role central bank. it's historically intimate involvement supervise bank system prove useful many country around world strong case keep close involvement model supervisory reorganisation. the close involvement central bank supervisory process various advantages. it give central bank much clear picture economic reality behind number visible book banks. this information facilitate role safeguard financial stability create special advantage spot early warn indicator financial crisis potential situation economy wide financial distress. moreover, part eurosystem central bank integrate already function network national supranational institutions. such network decisive importance light structural change european financial market already take place likely come near future. let next turn debate european regulatory framework. the economic financial committee (efc) recently provide assessment exist arrangement brower report. a central result assessment current framework strongly rely national responsibility appropriate. the report find time need enhance arrangement cross-border cross-sectional co-operation, improve alignment supervisory practice reinforce collaboration supervisory central bank functions. i want point development already start implement recommendations. let mention activity bank supervision committee (bsc) european system central bank (escb). these activity strongly rely close cooperation central bank bank supervision authorities. not area bank supervision, also recent attempt implement lamfalussy recommendation field security market regulation considerable progress made. consistent efficient implementation regulatory rule promote new institutional arrangement delegate rule-making power committee regulator whereas implementation national level undertake committee supervisors. these two examples, i briefly touch here, illustrate initiative way debate ongoing. however, recommendation brower report implement many issue still need investigation debate. but development show head right direction. i argue policy maker central bank well aware regulatory challenge european financial markets. they already try find practical answer challenges. these answer base principle national responsibility, transnational co-operation close involvement central bank supervision bank system. clearly, many issue process still open need discussion. but i sure conference make important contribution towards deep understand issue point directions, activity needed. cepr/esi price best central bank research paper lady gentlemen, it great pleasure announce winner newly establish cepr/esi prize best central bank research

19 september 2002. * * * the bank’s view2 japan’s economy, despite persistent weakness domestic demand large uncertainty regard global economy, almost stabilize whole export production continue increase. with regard final demand, decline business fix investment become moderate, private consumption remain weak. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment declining. meanwhile, net export (real export minus real imports) continue increase due recovery overseas economies. industrial production remain upward trend response rise export adequate reduction excess inventory stocks. against background, corporate profit start recover. in addition, rebound production effect labor markets, albeit marginally, increase overtime hour work new job offer mainly part-time workers. however, firm still maintain stance reduce personnel expenses, household income continue decrease noticeably plunge summer bonuses. thus, employment income situation household overall remain severe. turn economic outlook, growth export expect slow temporarily impetus overseas restock come halt, uptrend export maintain background moderate recovery overseas economies. thus, industrial production also expect follow moderate uptrend despite temporary slowdown. with respect domestic demand, public investment project follow decline trend private consumption likely remain weak time due severe employment income situation. lead indicator suggest business fix investment stop declining, distinct recovery immediate future unlikely partly due large uncertainty regard overseas economies. nevertheless, uptrend export production continues, corporate profit stay track recovery, gradually positive impact domestic private demand. overall, envisage stabilization japan’s economy gradually become definite overseas economy continue moderate recovery. however, take economy show clear sign recovery, pace increase export production expect slow temporarily restrain force excessive labor input debt persist. furthermore, large uncertainty regard export development stock price unite state worldwide, outlook it-related goods, geopolitical factor oil prices. in circumstances, recent weakness domestic stock price potential adverse effect financial system economy monitor carefully. on price front, import price decline mainly due u.s. dollar’s depreciation yen spring toward summer, international commodity price include crude oil recently risen. domestic wholesale price weakened, reflect decrease import price date. moreover, consumer price remain gradual downtrend corporate service price continue decline. a condition surround price developments, balance supply demand expect keep exert downward pressure price amid persistently weak domestic demand, although completion inventory adjustment rise capacity utilization rate support price degree. moreover, factor ongoing technological innovation machinery, deregulation, streamline distribution channel continue restrain prices. 1 this report base data information available time bank japan monetary policy meet hold september 17 18, 2002. 2 the bank’s view recent economic financial developments, determine policy board monetary policy meet hold september 17 18 basis monetary policy decisions. 2 bi review 52/2002 under circumstances, domestic wholesale price project continue weak while. consumer price expect stay decline trend time current gradual pace. while slow growth import consumer good expect alleviate downward pressure price extent, fast pace decline wage may possibly reinforce ongoing decline prices, especially service prices. a financial market, outstanding balance current account bank japan move around 15 trillion yen bank continue provide ample liquidity. under circumstances, short-term money markets, market participant come feel excess liquidity market overnight call rate continue move close zero percent. also, longer-term interest rate declining. yield long-term government bond follow downtrend line decline yield overseas long-term government bond domestic overseas stock prices, addition widespread perception among market participant excess liquidity. yield spread private bond (bank bond corporate bonds) government bond virtually level. meanwhile, stock price decline since start september line decline u.s. european stock prices, investor prefer hold buy stocks. stock price mainly move around 9,000-9,500 yen recently. in foreign exchange market, yen, fluctuate without trend early september, drop mid-september. it currently trade range 122-123 yen u.s. dollar. with regard corporate finance, private bank remain cautious extend loan firm high credit risk continue active extend loan blue-chip companies. the lend attitude financial institution perceive firm continue severe. in corporate bond cp markets, issue environment firm low credit rat still severe, environment firm high credit rat accommodative. credit demand private sector continue follow downtrend mainly firm decrease business fix investment continuously reduce debts. amid developments, private banks’ lend continue decline 2-3 percent year-on-year basis. the amount outstanding corporate bond cp issue recently move near previous year’s level. the monetary base increase substantially—by around 20-30 percent—from previous year’s level. the year-on-year growth rate money stock remain around 3.5

require close monitoring. bi review 52/2002 1 thirachai phuvanat naranubala: how create stable financial environment emerge market economy remark mr thirachai phuvanat naranubala, deputy governor bank thailand, international conference bank supervisors, cape town, 19 september 2002. * * * the title “ how create stable financial environment emerge market economy ” almost contradiction. the event past decade bear out. it difficult emerge market economy maintain stable financial environment long period time. crisis disturbance erupt every then, result loss output, employment livelihood. the problem -- emerge market economy stable financial environment always go hand hand. some reason obvious. emerge market economy country process integrate new environment globalization. they invariably point journey enhance free trade, attract foreign direct investment capital inflows, adopt rule base supervision control, introduce market discipline. the risk stability occur learn put place framework machinery regulate, supervise monitor financial market tight time span year develop country take decade do. for emerge markets, globalization like sail inland waterway environment safe calm international ocean choppy water. the risk multiply. what one this? you can, course, opt easy approach. you continue maintain tight control resist liberalization. but hind development domestic financial markets, also skill people involved, regulator commercial bank themselves. in opinion, right approach emerge market create, improve maintain right fundamentals. in way, instead try extend breakwater further, good change le stable row boat sturdy seaworthy ship, one handle rough ocean better. in respect, three thing i wish highlight. the first need ensure country conduct proper macroeconomic policy. i mention even though directly job supervisor overwhelm everything. to take example thailand, use fix exchange regime long, without domestic flexibility adjust wage price correct lack competitiveness. we therefore could maintain parity long. it also lead distortion risk perception lead excessive foreign exchange risk mismatch, investment non-traded sector damage speculation, especially real estate. when change flexible exchange regime, exchange rate depreciate low point le 50% pre-crisis value back 60. the exchange loss occur was, among things, one major factor cause level non-performing loan go peak 45%. this almost one every two dollar lend out. what stress test really prepare u event? the second right infrastructure domestic financial markets. this topic include many thing like (a) proper market rules, (b) legal framework facilitate enforcement creditors’ rights, (c) law procedure deal bankruptcy, (d) proper account audit standard well reliable system credit information individual borrowers. 2 bi review 52/2002 i still recall 1997 crisis, inter bank market thailand cease fear counter party failure. but problem also extend system commercial trade credit ordinary companies, seller buyer goods. today, five year event, system trade credit still regain full recovery. this problem mitigate function credit bureau report regularly payment behavior commercial firms. third ensure exist proper supervision financial institutions. the country ensure agency entrust task sufficient power act. i still remember thailand long ago, government succession often come election military actions, common commercial bank army general sit boards. bank supervision environment challenge. but big challenge bank suffer loss unable continue. this happen thailand go crisis 1997. we close two-thirds finance companies. a commercial banks, 15 local bank then. six bank take authority. the private shareholder force take full losses, new capital provide authority. management totally revamped. we merge four bank others, carve non-performing loan national asset management company. two government-owned bank ready privatize general public. the bank remain force recapitalize. three unable find domestic capital, decide invite foreign strategic partners. we allow foreign bank majority share control management. now bad news! despite effort try strengthen ship, may always smooth sailing. i wish point two danger may crop up. the first danger shark lurk water-- form highly leverage institution hedge funds. no matter well try manage economy, matter good intentions, often thing synchronization. this cause currency stock market temporarily balance, even wrongly perceive so. this exactly need time work problems. but attack shark rob precious time. i ask -- shark create much trouble emerge markets? the problem shark often able command oversize resource finance large international banks. i strongly believe finance curbed. leverage beyond certain threshold particularly risky. i propose international bank give credit institution require weigh risks, capital requirement calculations, much high rate 150 per cent currently consider new basle accord. the second danger good weather tend get assistance many international banks. they give tow line hitch catamaran help increase speed. however, ship start leak, tend cut line need most. on issue, therefore, i strongly support idea private sector involvement imf proposing. there way country cope bank run international scale. there opportunity country renegotiate debt foreign creditors, without impose insurmountable handicap prevent return market future. in case thailand, mechanism exist asian crisis, non-performing loan ratio would less. actually pay back foreign debt owe government bank full, interests. we never need hair cut, need time. but many foreign bank roll debt fell due, despite fact authority guarantee foreign debt banks. the continuous repayment cause currency weaken should. the exchange loss therefore great been, hence non-performing loan ratio. at time, weak currency also create pressure exchange rate neighbors, cause interest rate keep high long necessary, turn also feed non-performing loan ratio. bi review 52/2002 3 i therefore attach lot hope sovereign debt restructure mechanism deliberate imf members. i hope offer good solution kind problem future. i close say this. globalization two way street. relationship international financial market benefit ways. fund flow emerge economy able generate good return saver develop economies. on one hand, emerge market homework preparation. but hand, thing get temporarily balance, shouldn’t tool safeguard help deal situation better? the good news could, country want to! bi review 52/2002 1 t t mboweni: icbs

on behalf south african reserve bank, welcome sunny south africa. it indeed privilege u host twelfth international conference bank supervisor (icbs). this gather world's bank supervisor take place every two year since 1979, attractive venue world. and i sure agree cape town exception. the icbs become essential forum promote cooperation among national bank supervisory authority arduous task supervise international banking. this year enable 280 representative 130 country exchange view range current issue common concern. one glance programme advance documentation realise icbs 2002 among important demand delegate ever held. the steady build-up inter-linkages complexity global financial systems, event 11 september 2001, protract tardy growth key economy world, systemic financial crisis number emerge market country contribute acute awareness inherent fragility global financial system. bank regulation supervision right first line defence financial instability, i see, international best practice set authority dally respond challenges. extensive work bank international settlement (bis), basel committee bank supervision (bcbs), financial stability forum (fsf), well many international organisation national supervisory authorities, form solid base discussion next two days. the discussion deal weak bank international bank insolvency clearly important time turmoil. since capital effective, yet costly, buff protect depositor effect bank problems, schedule discussion draft basel ii capital accord opportune. the draft accord hold promise ensure bank capital relevant real

risk management model formally rat credit risks, also emerge market economy bank portfolio retail small/medium enterprise (sme) loans. i particularly please note intend discussion transition emerge country basel ii. we await anticipation result forthcoming quantitative impact study (qis), south africa participate fully. in fact, multinational team responsible drive study hold important meet cape

important light build-up terrorist threat financial stability. i tell many country represent work hard test readiness financial system endure sudden crisis events, well ensure financial system abuse terrorist organisation help fund activities. and course, recent spate corporate failure around world make discussion corporate governance imperative. so, indeed remarkably relevant extremely demand programme anyone's book. i impressed, i wish well. south africa regard dual economy. on one hand emerge market fair share challenge regard economic growth, wealth distribution, inflation. in particular, face challenge high unemployment, low save level, high hiv/aids infection rate, volatile currency. we also severely affect commodity prices, especially oil gold. on hand, south africa bless sophisticated, privately owned, financial system comparable many respect best develop economies. the financial sector well regulated, confirm imf world bank's joint financial sector assessment programme (fsap). the bank sector adequately capitalised, risk well managed. 2 bi review 52/2002 unfortunately, financial sector highly concentrated, natural legacy shameful apartheid past. there also underlie problem lack broad access basic financial service majority population, i note interest topic microfinance emerge market economy tomorrow's programme. in regard may interest note review entire regulatory architecture south africa currently underway ensure remain appropriate need go forward. these challenge are, however, tackle enthusiastically consultative manner, remain highly optimistic stability financial system, growth prospect economy, future country. be integrally part africa, sure enthusiasm also extend impact new partnership africa's development (nepad) process future continent. i view fact icbs 2002 hold south africa, first time outside develop countries, symbolic indication emerge market country recognise will able throw weight behind achievement robust global

annual meet eastern southern african group bank supervisor (esaf) yesterday venue surely advance cause further. we proudly confident southern african development community (sadc) country find lack quest ensure weak link global financial system disturbance propagated. i wish great success deliberations. my final hope you, accompany partners, enjoy beauty cape town many interest aspect diverse

it financial sector speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, unisys, executive business conference, 16 september 2002. * * * to begin with, i would like thank opportunity come today discus information technology affect financial sector. this large subject, many possible approach aim merely illustrate these. i also give chance select i wish discuss, i especially appreciate. it stock market probably first thing one think one hear word it financial sector “bubble” stock market, increasingly unrealistic assessment profit would generate new technology “new economy” end 1990s painful sober process stock market take downturn winter 2000. although feel unease regard stock market fall read old age pension forecasts, perhaps long term least interest aspect it financial sector. i therefore intend limit two reflection regard “bubble issue”. the first happen probably happen again. let remind first “it bubble”, begin previous century new technology wireless telegraphy. no le 150 company connection information technology introduce onto new york stock exchange 1901 early 1902. in 1907 one company leave make profit pay dividends, even company’s stock market value halve since introduction. a far i know, one speak “new economy” would follow technical developments, may due insufficient research part. otherwise, similarity strike depressing. a know, cannot learn history, doom repeat it. my point burst bubble certainly make one stock market’s main task difficult, namely convey risk capital saver company - easy task present acquire risk capital new share issues. however, mean financial system whole threat. on stock market, bank act intermediary directly affect downturn, limit extent mortgage stock market shares. of course, income portfolio management share trade declining, many operator outside bank may experience problems, comprise threat system. it completely different situation bubble property market bursts, case sweden early 1990s. then value banks’ collateral decline lead acute crisis, price fall sufficiently severe. we see effect practice, i hope remember. yet another issue effect downturn stock market may real economy thereby economic activity. of course, deep recession could comprise threat stability bank system, seem unlikely prospect present i intend take issue today. be financial sector good thing have? it easy express irritation sweep statement financial sector general bank particular; especially value mutual fund fall feel bank want u carry bank service internet without aid knowledgeable banker office. i shall return latter issue later, let first remind financial system actually essential part economic infrastructure every modern society. it possible manage without steel industry shipyards, society function one must infrastructure, transport sector, energy sector also financial sector. the obvious task financial sector ensure payment system functions. we must able pay bill secure manner, preferably also simple speedy manner, i.e. must know 2 bi review 51/2002 party send money actually receive it. there many country world function much obstacle development road railway function. the bank institution handle major part payments. it important financial sector subject comprehensive legislation company closely monitor finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority). we may view bank set charges, handle customer on, without life would certainly complicated. in context worth note much it broad sense help bank develop simply mean payment. it long ago one receive weekly wage form brown envelope contain banknotes, hand friday afternoon. nowadays wage pay directly bank account receive notice bank statement. nor go far pay bills; sit desk fill giro form - even easy - pay computer. the time use spend queue bank use fun productive manner, hopefully both. i one enjoy stand queue post office saturday morning pay bills. the save resource attain improvement efficiency payment system since day brown envelope actually estimate around five per cent gdp. this productivity gain benefit. in many emerge economy potential productivity gain function payment system would course even greater. sweden - it country sweden nordic country currently, alongside usa, world leader use it. if one look percentage household access internet, 2000 sweden estimate 61 per cent hold second place eu. only netherlands high percentage. if instead look expenditure it relation gdp, sweden come top among eu country 2001. sweden it country. why development move quickly sweden? there many answer question, allow mention couple i believe important. one concern deregulation telecommunication market. the swedish telecommunication administration’s monopoly begin break early 1980s, real turn point come 1993, administration privatise telia. the market open expose competition; new challenger could gradually take quarter total market significantly great part mobile telephony internet telephony segment. at time, technical development rapid. fiberoptics enable low cost long distance call increase speed transfer large amount data, benefit development internet. together, increase competition rapid technological development lead fall price regard telephony internet connection. the low price user probably contribute widespread use internet sweden. the new technology perhaps available essential develop countries, view deregulation varied. only eight 25 member countries, today 30, oecd allow competition telecommunication market, remain country retain monopoly. there also clear connection use internet competition. competition allow telecommunication market six nine country high internet usage. these country also experience increase access internet six time fast country monopoly market. another reason rapid development internet usage sweden could connect structure swedish bank system. the bank sector sweden dominate small number large operators, list stock market strong incentive rationalise operations. they also resource rapidly implement new technology. the apply netherlands, similar bank structure. the internet service bank offer customers, good are, customer use internet bank cheap administration cost bank. if compare usa, bank market consist large number small operators, development anything like rapid. only u bank offer advance internet services. the range service also much small sweden. bi review 51/2002 3 there lot gain make payment via internet, bank customers. sweden, like nordic countries, giro-based payment system. giro payment correspond 95 per cent total value payment make 2000 70 per cent number transactions. giro instrument traditionally paper-based. however, internet enable paper-based giro system speed make paperless. preliminary figure indicate approximately 130 million giro payment make internet 2001. between 1998 2000 number giro payment initiate internet increase good 890 per cent. today swedish bank offer internet bank rapidly grow range services. study also indicate sweden way ahead regard utilisation internet services. at end 2001 3 million bank customer subscribe internet banks. for bank electronic payment entail considerable opportunity rationalisation, probably much great extent could foresee year ago. some time ago i meet manager bank office stockholm tell number employee five year ago, turnover almost 50 per cent higher. this largely due fact company (including small medium-sized companies) early service bank could carry many transaction via internet bank, simplify work facilitate cash management. the company could, instance, one click (as say nowadays) pay wage paperless transfer company’s account employees’ account time bookkeeping pay slips, without long paper strip need manually checked. already today, internet bank contain much merely opportunity make payment check one’s account balance. one function internet probably lead increase competition within finance sector existence company offer price comparisons. there are, instance, several independent company internet today enable simple comparison mortgage cost provide assistance find beneficial insurance policies. competition increase regard share trading, mutual funds, insurance mortgages, even abroad. one reason internet cause reduction entry barriers, i.e. cost connect start business achieve critical mass regard customer high before. new company today need establish far-reaching office networks, prove company skandiabanken company know internet stockbrokers. finally, perhaps worth point it financial sector merely consist internet. many instrument currently trade markets, particularly derivative instrument option swaps, completely dependent modern information technology price trade all. a derivative instrument mainly use buy sell financial risk cost-efficient manner, possible say it comprise base modern financial risk management, put practice dealers’ table around world. it also necessary condition method use calculate financial risk portfolio security credits. the new basel committee rule capital adequacy banks, take example, entirely dependent calculations. network effect payment system the bank sector sweden is, know, strongly concentrated. this raise question certain context well competition functions. however, concentration also enabled, i point earlier, rapid exploitation network effect economy scale connect it developments. let go depth, hopefully without become abstract. the development payment service governed, markets, supply demand. supply affect cost technology, demand affect factor price, acceptance, comfort accessibility. advantage scale within production payment service arise service often connect high fix cost relatively low flexible costs. build new computer system expensive, every transaction pass system cost less. the economy scale effect provide incentive various type co-operation joint solutions, producer join force utilise economy scale spread cost great volumes. there also advantage scale demand side, form positive network effects. positive network effect mean quite simply particular system become usable people use it. 4 bi review 51/2002 the classical example telephone - want one one else one? with regard payments, positive network effect mean benefit consumer use particular payment system grow relation size system. this mean willingness pay also increases. network effect also influence introduction new technology consumers’ expectation future scope system play decisive role. consumer continue use certain payment instrument system, even superior alternative available, old system/instrument establish accept large market share. to continue telephone analogy, imagine one new gsm telephone, use would everyone else still use nmt? the fact gsm consider superior system hardly comfort. the producer therefore great opportunity reach critical mass new system introduce co-operate one another. the atm co-operation, customer withdraw money atm regardless whether account particular bank, good example this. it also show co-operation, even essentially benefit customers, may come conflict competition act. the swedish banks’ approach launch e-money cash system another example, i return shortly. one example bank co-operate payment market service digital invoice systems. up spring 2002 bank offer two different, non-compatible systems, “e-giro” “e-faktura”. the existence two digital invoice system obstacle regard get company household utilise new technology. today bank invest make system compatible one another goal invoicers invoice able reach one another regardless bank use. if succeeds, lead increase acceptance customer enable critical mass achieve easily. will cash disappear? the use cash sweden halve since mid-1950s, course result technological development card payment late internet payment offer good substitute payment banknotes. however, decline use cash slow recent year m0 money supply currently around sek 90 billion, 4 per cent gdp. cash suitable certain type transaction, including, unfortunately, people don’t want registered, perhaps low limit demand banknotes. in addition, alternative cost cash low recent years, result low inflation low interest rates. however, use cash sweden high nordic countries. the important alternative cash charge card (or credit cards) cash cards. charge card credit card currently account one quarter transactions, low figure nordic countries. with regard purely electronic money, currently national issue sweden, cash card. this project involve every bank issue e-money download chip respective bank’s charge card credit card. the cash system yet attain sufficient critical mass become accepted, also apply correspond system countries. perhaps old cash new charge card offer good substitutes. in context may interest note one aspect cash distributed. the dominant quantity withdrawal atms, atm network sweden differ considerably network countries. in sweden approximately 300 atm per million inhabitants; europe greece turkey fewer. on hand, far large number transaction per atm. we thus few atms, use more. this atm structure probably due primarily fact bank place atm bank office there. in many countries, cash dispenser locate shop centre place people active, regardless location bank offices. this development also begin appear sweden, least large cities. abroad atm often independent owners, charge small sum (sek 10-15) customer want use atms. the customer happy pay benefit able withdraw cash spot rather go several block find bank stand line there. one may wonder use distribution cash show different pattern sweden countries. evidently, like cash, even difficult get hold of. so although development bi review 51/2002 5 clearly move towards increase use card paperless payment instruments, cashless society still lie way future. it reduce risk it make payment system efficient number different ways, i already indicated, technology also contribute reduce risks. trade shares, bond currency accompany derivative product entails, instance, large credit risk arise bank manage payments, know settlement risks. the necessity reduce risk become increasingly clear. let take foreign exchange trade example. the foreign exchange market huge daily turnover. on two occasion credit risk foreign exchange trade become uncomfortably evident; bankhaus herstatt declare bankrupt 1974 bar bank fell 1997. these risk easily pass global financial system, different time zones, bring serious disturbances. there therefore global collaboration project call cls, continuous link settlement, year now. all dominant foreign exchange bank world take part project, aim joint system settle members’ foreign exchange transactions. this enable payment one currency make directly payment another, entail credit risk arise early disappearing. it broad sense has, course, also necessary security system large payment central bank around world develop oversee, trend recent year towards real time gross settlement. our rix system rtgs system, target system use ecb. i would happy discus this, would involve deviation subject here. conclusion in conclusion, i would like make two reflections. firstly, course case it, increase efficiency security financial system general payment system particular, also increase risk purely operational nature. operational risk strongly focus prior new millennium, particularly financial sector, extensive preparation make guard them. with hindsight, easy talk make mountain molehill, lack problem course largely due fact foresee due precaution taken. one positive consequence fuss around new millennium openness regard security it increase attention draw need routine manage crises. at time, also conclude it system prove fairly robust. the consequence terrorist attack usa 11 september last year could actually handle large extent security arrangement central financial systems. however, event emphasise importance take account potential threat terrorism physical threat financial system establish security routines. my second reflection human nature. after give whole speech it financial sector easy give impression bank institution operate financial market consist merely technology money. that case. fundamentally technology money, people relation people. all successful manager financial companies, particularly bank managers, aware this. technology useful aid, customer receive respectful, personal competent reception one bank choose another next time. that way thing probably remain glad it. thank you. bi review 51/2002 1 birgir ísleifur gunnarsson: iceland global set keynote speech mr birgir ísleifur gunnarsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, euromoney conference nordic financial market investment opportunities, stockholm, 13 september 2002. * * * mr. chairman, lady gentlemen. it pleasure participate ambitious conference nordic financial market investment opportunities. i remark today mainly focus aspect relate iceland. size separate iceland nordic countries, denmark, finland, norway sweden. other factor separate nordic country well. finland member european union economic monetary union, emu, well. denmark sweden member european union outside emu. norway iceland outside european union maintain close tie it, particularly european economic area agreement. that agreement make norway iceland part single market european union, entail among thing oblige maintain financial market legislation, fully conform european union. the nordic country different monetary regimes. finland member emu, denmark link emu erm ii agreement entail danish krona closely tie euro. sweden, norway iceland choose inflation-targeting regime monetary framework (iceland march 2001). thus, price stability main objective monetary policy country fact become recognize single target monetary policy numerous countries. the reason emphasis price stability create best condition balance growth increase welfare. the icelandic financial market develop rapidly last ten fifteen years. it small market definition, nevertheless institutional set-up large industrial countries. aside central bank, include commercial banks, save banks, security companies, various investment funds, insurance companies, large important pension fund last least stock exchange - link nordic exchange - share 60 70 icelandic company list trade regular basis. supervision activity institution hand unify financial supervisory authority broadly legal power follow method standard supervisory agency european countries. important rationalisation take place icelandic financial system. until year ago, two main commercial bank fully government own host so-called investment credit funds. the fund unify single institution, subsequently privatised. the government also reduce stake commercial bank recent year intend largely fully privatise end current electoral term next year. the privatisation process create opportunity continue rationalisation financial system create ample opportunity period ahead, include close tie foreign financial institutions. it tempt put recent economic development iceland context development nordic country decade ago. liberalisation icelandic financial market le complete mid-1990s last restriction movement capital iceland country removed. our liberalisation come year late nordic countries. you recall nordic countries, liberalisation follow boom period economy, partly largely fuel rapid growth credit case large fiscal deficits. at time, country pursue fix exchange rate policy vis-a-vis ecu. development domestic economy fix exchange rate policy gradually undermined, rapid credit growth bank result weaken loan portfolio asset price fell, exchange rate fixety give way floating, currency depreciate inflation rose. the current account balance payment also deteriorated. 2 bi review 51/2002 development iceland latter half 1990s present time resemble many way experience nordic country decade early differ also important respects. soon liberalisation, domestic demand pick up, fuel rapidly rise credit wake intensify competition financial sector sharp increase credit availability. at time, iceland pursue fix exchange rate policy rigidly fix nordic country do decade earlier. the expansion economy end last decade lead rapid rise current account deficit, climax year 2000. through effect tighten monetary policy, exchange rate króna gradually appreciated. in spring year 2000, expectation market shift variety reasons, one concern current account deficit. subsequently króna begin depreciate continue le uninterrupted whole orderly fashion period year half end november last year. by time, fall third currencies. this large depreciation without precedent countries. in respect, i might mention, since stockholm since i draw parallel nordic countries, swedish krona fell broadly similar proportion period time exchange rate float late 1992. the depreciation icelandic króna feed domestic price inflation pick significantly. late last year, exchange rate clearly overshoot sharply downside. then expectation turn around again. it clear, among things, economy cool current account deficit shrink fast. optimism also arise prospect improve inflation spike, follow exchange rate depreciation, would subside quickly again. the króna begin appreciate regain important part early value. inflation subside sharply year expectation inflation target 2½ percent achieve end year. the large current account deficit record year 2000 also begin shrink rapidly, fell half year 2001 outlook approximate balance year. these development demonstrate resilience adaptability icelandic economy; move large current account deficit virtual balance course two year reduce inflation border two-digit rate 2½ percent within one year. although development iceland show many characteristic nordic country post-liberalisation rapid expansion, credit expansion, current account deficit, exchange rate depreciation on, iceland escape difficulty suffer bank system countries. icelandic bank credit grow rapidly late 1990’s year 2000 sizable portion credit expansion finance credit abroad. the capital adequacy ratio bank fell nevertheless remain comfortably minimum require internationally recognise levels. the year 2001 also turn quite favourable banks, development continue large current year. consequently, capital position bank improve major bank institution relatively strong capital adequacy ratio present. loan loss increased, expect wake credit expansion, nowhere scale experience nordic country decade ago much le downturn icelandic economy around 1990. the conclusion draw is, therefore, icelandic bank system weather relatively turbulent post-liberalization boom period 2000 2001 pretty well well poise meet new challenges, include continue rationalisation intensify competition foreign bank institutions. in recent decades, icelandic economy also see structural shifts. the importance fishery generator foreign exchange revenue diminish relative term - le half total - importance sector risen, manufacture industry, information technology tourism. in developments, iceland among thing draw benefit globalisation strengthen foundation economy. foreign direct investment regulation liberal exception investment permit fish sector. foreign direct investment noticeable power intensive industry, production aluminium, base iceland’s abundance untapped renewable energy resources. recent change corporate taxation iceland, low corporate tax among low found, serve attract foreign business iceland encourage icelandic company international operation favour iceland base operations. bi review

benefit icelandic economy long run integrate iceland global economy, allow iceland draw easily experience others bring dividends. reflective development fact icelandic bank begin grant credit borrower country measurable scale, particularly area competitive advantage analyse soundness prospective borrowers. the title presentation iceland global setting. what i briefly describe country follow path many countries, include nordic countries, liberalise economy, internally externally. this expose economy market force competition abroad monetary regime bend secure low rate inflation chosen. iceland is, mentioned, member european union membership agenda present government. iceland operate small currency margin u dollar euro. these fact place firm requirement economic policy time offer iceland reap important benefit globalisation. this indeed bear development last year year rapid growth gdp year test ability economic policy maker steer economy environment liberalise market capital

university british columbia, vancouver, 18 september 2002 * * * good afternoon. i delight accept invitation speak today. i’d like spend time reflect evolution canadian economy canadian achieve past years. then i talk bite outlook uncertainty face global economy, canada’s success fiscal monetary front help u weather uncertainties. but first, i’d like say much i appreciate chance return university british columbia campus. five year ago, i senior fellow commerce faculty. while current job different, one common thread unite institution and, indeed, canadian universities, bank canada—a commitment excellence research. the bank canada fellowship program indeed, strong research environment long hallmark bank. we also want encourage research relevant business, especially respect monetary policy financial system stability, university across canada. that i please announce today bank canada launch fellowship program foster high-calibre research crucial economic areas. the program open professor canadian university record high-quality research. the bank fellowship pay salary stipend provide fund graduate research assistant expenses. we plan award two fellowship first year, one year that, total six fellowship 2007. we hope program expand pool leading-edge research conduct across country strengthen canadian expertise area critical mandate, macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, economics financial market institutions. expand research broad knowledge base benefit bank canada, university work build strong economics department and, indeed, canadians. and i particularly please launch fellowship program here, university commit produce type ground-breaking analysis hope encourage. improve policy framework when i first arrive ubc fall 1997, canada complete decade struggle get economic policy right. during period 1988 1997, take important step towards improve monetary fiscal policies. the bank canada, respond high unpredictable inflation rate 1970s early 1980s, adopt end 1980s monetary policy aim achieve price stability. to make commitment concrete, bank government canada agree 1991 series inflation-control target aim bring 12-month cpi inflation rate 2 per cent - plus minus 1 per cent - december 1995. the decline inflation achieve fairly short order - january 1992, inflation close 2 per cent. the agreement subsequently extend three times, retain 2 per cent target midpoint. for almost ten year now, inflation well control, household business believe continue achieve inflation targets. inflation expectation well anchored, near term, well future. almost decade low inflation make easy forget difficult achieve inflation targets, economic price pay achieve tremendous benefit low stable inflation. 2 bi review 51/2002 back i teach here, federal provincial government midst painful necessary process fiscal consolidation. the federal government work curb rise debt-to-gdp ratio, really wasn’t 1995 government do enough tip scale decisively toward deficit reduction. and 1997 cumulative effect deficit-reduction measure put federal fiscal policy back sustainable track. the debt-to-gdp ratio federal level since fall le 50 per cent, peak 71 per cent 1995. and province still struggle maintain budget surpluses, take important step put fiscal house order. government bank canada work get public policy - fiscal monetary framework - right. the private sector also restructure take advantage opportunity provide canada-u.s. free trade agreement increase productivity competitiveness. it surprise year adjustment slow growth unite states. but late 1990s, economy begin reap benefit restructure efforts. the end result effort - adoption inflation targets, fiscal improvement private sector restructure - canada’s economy become good able weather major shock asian crisis, last year’s global slowdown. indeed, period 1997 2001, canada average annual economic growth 4 per cent, u.s. average 3.5 per cent. and u.s. economy fell recession last year, not. although productivity growth canadian company strong firm unite states, see encourage sign investment technology train lead great productivity gain here. indeed, business sector labour productivity canada grow annualized rate 2.0 per cent 1997 2001, much high 1.2 per cent average 1990-96 period, bite revise 2.3 per cent rate productivity growth record unite states. a look forward, see positive sign future productivity growth canada, thank effort canadian firm adjust new technology incorporate business processes. the shock 2000-2001 indeed, economy hold remarkably well consider hit four major shock past couple years. first, meltdown technology telecommunication industries, begin late 2000 effect still felt today. the second broad economic slowdown 2001 affected, various degrees, economy countries. third, overshadow every event last year, 11 september terrorist attacks. with first anniversary passed, seem like appropriate time reflect extraordinary event buffet north american economy since terrible day, review bank canada respond events. our immediate responsibility keep canada’s financial system functioning. our next responsibility promote consumer investor confidence. therefore, bank canada take extraordinary monetary policy action. on 17 september last year, reduce key policy interest rate outside schedule announcement dates. between september 2001 january 2002, low interest rate total 200 basis point help mitigate impact 11 september already-weakening economy. it turn consumer confidence canada badly shake feared. a immediate geopolitical economic uncertainty diminished, consumer respond strongly quickly monetary stimulus. interest rate-sensitive sectors, house automobiles, show remarkable strength. indeed, fourth quarter last year saw annualized gdp growth almost 3 per cent, analyst expect canadian economy shrink. however, recover 2001 slowdown 11 september, u.s. economy hit fourth shock - loss confidence integrity financial report analysis result enron, worldcom, account corporate governance scandals. unfortunately, uncertainty cause problem unite state spill financial bi review 51/2002 3 markets, include ours. this create additional caution business appear delay expect recovery investment worldwide. in spite four economic shocks, canada’s economic performance been, comparison countries, rather good. clearly, difficult year mine forestry industry british columbia, grain oilseed producer prairies, telecom industry across country. but overall, economy consistently exceed average growth rate g-7 country since 1997. and imf oecd predict canada post strong growth rate g-7 2002 2003. i want emphasize canada’s recent strong performance isn’t good luck. it result solid policy framework, term inflation fiscal control. the benefit framework well understood, government bank canada, canadian general. we stick framework recent economic turmoil, see clear payback tremendous investment canadian make open country free trade, get macroeconomic framework right 1990s. that framework hold continue serve u well. if anyone still need convince that, canada’s recent economic performance provide compel evidence. canada’s economic prospect canada’s economic growth far year exceed expectations. real gdp jump 6.2 per cent annual rate first quarter 2002 rise 4.3 per cent second quarter. the bank canada belief keep inflation low, stable, predictable best contribution monetary policy make strong sustain growth canada. we run monetary policy symmetrical way. that say, pay equal attention persistent pressure could move u away 2 per cent target - whether below. when strong demand push economy limit capacity threaten raise future inflation target, bank raise interest rate cool economy mitigate inflation pressures. when demand weak, saw 2001, future inflation likely ease. so bank low interest rate stimulate economy, absorb economic slack, consistent keep inflation target. the significant ease monetary policy 2001 key factor behind strong growth household demand first half year. let turn outlook. in april monetary policy report, say recovery canadian economy begin sooner, considerably stronger, anticipated. consumer spend residential construction reflect stimulus monetary fiscal policy. canada’s export volume begin grow again, u.s. economy begin recover. by time monetary policy report update july, also see rebuild inventory increase spend machinery equipment. these suggest broaden recovery across economic sectors. the july update still reflect view economy. a say two week ago, domestic demand canada remain strong expected, bolster substantial amount monetary stimulus still economy. canada’s record job creation nothing short remarkable, almost 400,000 new job since begin year. this strong job growth reinforce confidence canadian consumers. in addition, medium small business continue invest. all pave way high output ongoing strong domestic demand. but time, downside risk uncertainties, mostly originate outside canada. near-term prospect growth unite state major overseas economy appear weakened. private public sector economist revise near-term growth forecast unite states, europe, japan. this could imply canada’s exports, already slightly weak anticipate second quarter, could continue affect slow growth global demand. the geopolitical situation remain quite unsettled. finally, unite state canada, still work corporate governance issue contribute year’s financial market volatility. history teach u period uncertainty, business consumer tend sit hand outlook clearer. 4 bi review 51/2002 let conclude. it remain bank’s view canadian economy continue expand approach capacity, timely measure reduction amount monetary stimulus necessary. let remind i mean “timely measured.” “timely” relate fact always lag policy action effect economy. “measured” relate judgment make fix announcement date pace economy approach full capacity, take account new information data become available. our current view fundamental underlie strength canadian economy change since july monetary policy report update. domestic demand may well stronger; time, external uncertainty bear outlook appear great early july. we provide detail view outlook canadian economy next monetary policy report, 23 october. ******************** this past year certainly full challenges. over last decade, canada put place right macroeconomic policy framework weather major shock take advantage opportunities. we confident framework stand u good stead future. bi review 50/2002 1 jean-pierre roth: the long path restore faith financial market speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, ceo luncheon swiss-american chamber commerce, zurich, 4 september 2002. * * * at outset i would like acknowledge long-standing tie swiss-american chamber commerce swiss national bank. in past, member govern board invite speak select audience. it great pleasure honor continue tradition. my remark today focus present challenge face global economy: crisis confidence push equity price unexpected low economic recovery seem take desire path. nevertheless, i convince fundamental place return sustain growth. inflation low almost industrial countries, monetary policy support recovery, household consumption still play stabilize role public finance - despite short-term difficulty - far equilibrium. while numerous factor responsible present economic uncertainty, prolong volatility witness equity market hit investor particularly hard. in hindsight stock market correction fit partially classic story fundamentals; one drive bubble collapse dotcom company anticipate slowdown economic activity. however, increase volatility equity market also pronounce peculiar events: integrity financial analysts’ recommendation increase spread fraudulent account practices. it latter strike financial market particularly hard recent months. u.s. firms, enron, worldcom, global cross xerox, become household name service product allege account abuses. investor firm undertake investment decision base apparently false information. the fear top iceberg reveal unpleasant news expect fill front page daily newspapers. the fallout financial scandal unearth several dormant issue twitch

stable predictable. this allow financial market business operate efficiently. a national bank, conduct monetary policy easily expectation strongly anchored. a key feature trust must underpin transparency. we learn past experience swiss monetary policy gain increase transparency. early central banks, embrace notion good conduct monetary policy people understand central bank thinking, why. transparency also eliminate doubt central bank work informational advantage. information asymmetry breed mistrust skepticism. it much easy instill trust institution open goal strategies. all enhance national bank’s accountability reinforce trust fostered. what step national bank take improve transparency monetary policy? we long tradition set monetary targets, since announcement new monetary strategy two year ago, discussion monetary policy even clearly define norms, rule procedure before. the explicit definition price stability give swiss citizen yardstick measure central bank performed. change target range policy instrument - 3-month libor - comment press release. they also discuss quarterly board meeting, fix advance. at biannual press conferences, provide assessment economic

discipline. corporate board re-examine role take close look do companies. investor demand great reconciliation pro forma financial statement generally accept account principles. but enough. the apparent breakdown check balance serve u reasonably well past prompt debate need tough financial market rules. potentially new rule need written. and unscrupulous market participant practice revealed, authority must come full force. to otherwise market disservice. only strict reprobation restore maintain confidence rule enforced. regulatory supervisory body around globe begin deal high-profile bankruptcies. in unite states, financial account standard board look proposal determine so-called special purpose entity consolidate company balance sheets. the security exchange commission propose new rule detail timely corporate disclosure. major firms, response demands, change corporate report methods. there clear recognition need eliminate potential conflict interest - auditor able offer additional services. this raise issue rotation auditor prevent cozy relationship undermine integrity audit. a periodic change firm might lead serious question accounts. further, u firm announce plan include, expense, cost executive stock options. the change aim accurately describe revenue cost associate companies’ primary business. and standard poor’s introduce new benchmark report corporate earnings. these positive example participant work together enforce spirit rule financial market operate. what do recently switzerland improve transparency swiss financial markets? some effort already start time ago. most notably, swiss exchange swiss business federation “economiesuisse” coordinate effort develop two set rule become effective july 1, 2002: the “swiss code best practice” “directive concern information corporate governance”. this hopefully lift standard corporate governance improve level transparency publicly trade firm switzerland. we also see political initiative aim transparency remunerations. business uncertainty it would shortsighted believe recent stock market reaction result misconduct lack corporate governance. the world economy still digest consequence deep retrenchment capital spending, start 2000 high-tech telecommunication sectors. the investment climate mute terrorist attack last september, hit hard sector air travel, tourism, insurance. in short, considerable uncertainty surround adjustment investment spend dim prospect corporate earnings. while worldwide weakness business investment lie heart present problems, time recent signal abroad reveal new potential risk emerged. the recent economic indicator unite state show domestic demand grow le strongly anticipated. the confidence index register decline month june july. the labor market recently show increase sign weakness; term employment hour worked. these recent development weigh heavily household spending, consider lifeline u.s. economy. the fear many household stretched, add fear strength household consumption resilience u.s. economy withstand shocks. u.s. household average low level save begin dip house wealth maintain consumption habits. while save imbalance support crisis 4 bi review 50/2002 investment, recent signal labor market, deepen, bring new risk consumption robustness u.s. economy. here europe, although economic picture slightly different, economic prospect brighter. economic hope pin export consumption, appear resilient across europe. the potential stimulus fiscal monetary front appear limited. on one hand, stability pact allow fiscal stimulus. on hand, european central bank unwilling provide amount monetary stimulus u.s. counterpart. the reason simple. inflationary pressure eurozone continue stumble block low interest rates. the recent deterioration international business sentiment prolong uncertainty witness financial market also influence negatively growth prospect switzerland. our view begin 2002 economic growth current year would moderate. our gdp forecast 1% growth 2002. other institution optimistic. all all, however, considerable agreement among forecaster swiss household consumption would register moderate stable growth economy would experience recovery second half year. the recovery underpin strong growth exports. the economic information stem first quarter year consistent scenario described. first quarter real gdp come slightly strong expected. although real gdp growth 0.6% first quarter, important consideration upward dynamic gloom set second half 2002. a anticipated, real growth support private consumption. confidence index lead indicator point up, reinforce view economy track. a case abroad, recent economic figure question whether recovery scenario 2002 remain valid. information various economic indicator paint consensus picture weak growth. the negative number cover broad contour swiss economy. these sector include construction, investment, tourism, financial services,

september 2002. * * * thank invitation discus interest topic. the circumstance connect worldcom enron unquestionably raise burn question role owners, board auditors, well construction rule system. there risk, however, drive quick solution result hasty conclusions. experience shows, opinion, deal complex problems, often much say reflection close consideration. in many case time passed, enable u gain good understand happened, position take step truly important crucial. my start point event worldcom enron part broad context. in first place are, course, directly connect recent years’ stock-market bubble. but deep level i believe stem two major process that, often happen thing go quickly, current institution - wide sense - quite keep course events. • one major process leave mark 1990s breakthrough technology, computer telecommunications. this way number decade begin flourish many part world become increasingly clear microchip offer. it liken development steam engine late 18th century combustion engine electric motor century later. a know, early technical breakthrough far-reaching consequence development transformation society. the process - either today - simple progression. but setback manageable pave way new advances. many setback originate faulty expectation new technology’s impact. • the major process financial system’s deregulation recent decades. a result, world capital market capital flow free outbreak world war one. with great depression world war two, idea return le restrict financial system fail catch on. it 1980s deregulation reach sweden, start somewhat early many industrialise countries, include unite states. a free financial system need order promote development new technology genuine social transformation. but also entail number risks. it new technology provide drive force behind company worldcom enron, supply capital deregulate financial system enable grow did. but enterprise exploit new technology benefit free capital market. it euphoria even hysteria many company lead formation stock-market bubble. accord measurements, average level share price reach relation fundamental value late 1990s high ever before. so hardly surprise fall trend recent year involve large loss around world. share price tend return sooner late value good reflection fundamental factors. a close look recent stock-market bubble reveal number specific feature call special reflection. it look though share price it technology orient company drive primarily new rather inexperienced investors, cheer management need capital cover current spend well analyst bank investment company handle share issues. medium around world also seem lend voice tendency. see wide perspective, event recent year raise number question i want consider briefly. how view financial bubbles, cause them? what drive late bubble, learn need generally make stock market function efficient? 2 bi review 50/2002 nothing new period undue optimism one important lesson deregulate world, wave excessive due optimism arise result pronounce financial cycles. in 1990s several period financial turbulence. one sweden’s bank currency crisis decade ago. at time problem country turbulence european exchange rate mechanism (erm). that follow crisis asia mexico, problem major hedge fund long term capital management, russia’s suspension payments, it bubble and, recently, difficulty latin america. further back, likewise period excessive optimism financial crises. here, briefly, spectacular item sweden’s economic history. • the first real financial crisis sweden occur back 1857. it mainly involve real estate market oblige government support bank system second time history. the first occasion 1668, palmstruch bank take parliament ultimately become call riksbank. • not long after, 1870s, next wave excessive optimism rapid industrial development, least construction railways. stockholm enskilda bank, example, difficulty height crisis 1878. • another serious setback “new economy” occur 1907. the potential profit hydroelectric power electrification, forest industry iron ore exaggerated. • then undue optimism end world war one, major investment boom speculation real estate share peak 1921. it may worth mention measure constant prices, 1980s turnover stockholm stock exchange reach level 1918. that say something strength speculation time. • after that, know, 1929 early 1930s, fall stock market, bank problem kreuger crash prominent event sweden. • more fifty year pass sweden experience another period genuine financial turbulence late 1980s. the world, include sweden, hit stock market collapse october 1987. a bubble develop sweden’s real estate market subsequently burst, severely damage financial system. resolute action political system early 1990s did, however, prevent financial meltdown might plunge country even deep crisis. this brief review shows, i believe, period heavily regulate financial system, world economy somewhat le prone generate pronounce financial cycles. it bear mind, however, regulation also create problem impede long-term growth. innovation new enterprise hardly stimulate bank market closely regulated. so symptomatic high growth 1950s ‘60s come mainly rationalisation exist firm rather new enterprises. when deregulation trade market good service get way decade world war two, attention naturally draw financial barrier tight regulation set future growth. an awareness need new, expand company emergence new market make natural promote free financial system. while financial deregulation probably natural necessary, also mean world economy become vulnerable kind exaggerate optimism, attendant risk pronounce financial cycles, characterise late 19th early 20th centuries. meanwhile, institution connect financial system lag behind. by “institutions” i mean everything around financial system affect development. example set rules, bank system such, general public, political system, authority media. the shortcoming take various forms. important rule wrongly formulate non-existent. the bank system lack necessary know-how risk management, institution clients. people become use credit ration suddenly able borrow large amounts. the political system, authority professional economist stress advantage deregulate financial system le clear risks. in struggle readers, listener viewers, medium sometimes forget question scrutinise important bi review 50/2002 3 element happening. think much advice share transaction pass airily recent year without careful scrutiny. in early 20th century financial cycle risk major crisis give lot think economists, least austrian school. they point existence transitory risk process adjust high rate productivity growth connection technological breakthroughs. at first good circle: rise productivity tend pull share price up, make easy finance new investments. new investment grow capital stock lead capital deepen even high productivity growth. when productivity go rising, however, expectation may become excessive push share price still more. in certain cases, moreover, expectation increase profit may lead high lending. all generate vicious circle increase asset price result continue expansion credit. with excessive euphoria, expansion capital stock may go far. sizeable investment make sector never yield expect return. the subsequent adjustment accordingly involve mark fall-off investment activity thus weak development demand. both excessive investment early inevitable correction asset price contribute this. the setback also lead problem financial system general. much austrian school do forget half-century regulation crisis 1930s 1970s. political economy dominate instead keynesianism. it may also case efficient market hypothesis interpret freely. this theory largely amount warn market basically best judge share’s real value. under normal condition probably true. when bubble get way, however, market’s normal information process tend disrupt price drive instead impenetrable force psychological nature. in many respect financial turbulence 1980s ‘90s rude awaken many economists, decision maker economic policy, authorities, representative business bank community people general. i find important underscore broad lack insight financial problem arise. one cannot single person group solely responsible thing take turn worse. perhaps society undergo learn process broad front early mistake yield new insights. economic policy decision-makers like are, course, exception here. but financial turbulence inevitably lead serious crisis real economy, need ask certain case output employment suffer severe setback attendant deflation. much gain learn tell whether extensive share price fall, example, besides troublesome enough many people, likely result situation general deflation, rapidly fall output rise unemployment. an answer question suggest summer 1999 federal reserve chairman, alan greenspan: while bubble burst scarcely benign, consequence need catastrophic economy. the burst japanese bubble decade ago lead immediately sharp contraction output significant rise unemployment. arguably, subsequent failure address damage financial system timely manner cause japan’s current economic problems. likewise, stock market crash 1929 destabilising, analyst attribute great depression ensue failure policy. most thing indicate bank run trouble account financial turbulence, supply credit may dry payment system cease function. it circumstance output employment tend suffer severely, lead actual deflation. that, course, prompt swedish political system’s resolute intervention time bank crisis decade ago. it matter, protect bank owner losses, safeguard banks’ central function economy. maintain modern market economy would virtually impossible/ without efficient credit supply payment system. in present context positive bank sector function well even though stock market around world fall steeply recent years. there also many sign bank sector learn good deal financial problem last decades. a regard general economic policy, know focus low stable inflation create good secure environment economic policy decision whole. a credible long-term commitment low inflation away uncertainty future income streams, 4 bi review 50/2002 ultimately determine fundamental value various kind asset. such commitment also provide good condition financial decisions. but that. a representative austrian school point out, business cycle exactly alike. a result exaggerate euphoria, basis risk may lead future instability create even threat inflation become visible. in event rapidly rise asset prices, associate risk financial instability, central bank therefore keep watchful eye credit expansion economy. under circumstance central bank may need intervene interest financial stability. in opinion, interest rate adjustment certainly rule judge effective. in context i mention desirability “flexible inflation target policy” believe support action type find current legislation. the recent share price bubble accompany undue expansion credit. this doubt partly swedish bank crisis still fresh people’s mind bank make process provide credit much rigorous. the it telecom bubble 1990s so much financial bubble general general economic policy do. there is, however, learn worldcom, enron whole it telecom bubble. american study suggest new technology enable people share trade internet attract many people unfamiliar save shares. these new le experience player concentrate particular share quote technology orient nasdaq exchange, greatly influence price similar share around world. while professional institutional investor account 90 per cent trade new york exchange, stock market boom around half nasdaq’s turnover come private individuals. study also indicate companies, analyst bank incentive use somewhat questionable mean attract inexperienced investor buy share new enterprises. lack adequate cash flow, many new technology company dependent raise money new share issue pay employee procure equipment. that turn call high share valuation. this give management inducement “doctor” report statement company’s future performance. the disclosure worldcom enron clearly show environment develop management also stand gain stretch account regulation order meet market expectations. it also look though environment leave mark large corporations’ auditors, likewise need modify extent direction service order generate income profit survive new economy. in certain respect amount break law. in instance law sufficiently clear extensive. analyst investment bank earn money arrange share issue evidently lack incentive make critical appraisal corporate report statements. this deprive inexperienced investor necessary help support. a look at, example, advice provide stock market begin fall tell tale: recommendation sell make le one per cent advice. the medium latch onto stock market boom report rapidly rise share prices. instead take critical look happening, notion new economy offer chance earn quick profit become conventional wisdom. the part play human psychology herd behaviour financial market fact give rise new school financial knowledge, know behavioural finance. two key concept analysis conventional wisdom wishful thinking. there’s nothing odd that. when people make investment decision function much way contexts. a familiar example reluctance enter restaurant empty - generally prefer one already many guests, particularly long queue outside. we simply rely good judgement others assume inside make right choice. by arrive good understand people behave, certainly good deal prevent unduly large mistake market price perhaps ultimately reduce occurrence financial bubbles. bi review 50/2002 5 functional institution crucial economic development today well earlier, financial turbulence additional inducement create good condition many part economy institution involve financial system corporate management. it would wrong suppose, however, regulation measure capable eliminate financial turbulence altogether. like business cycle real economy, cyclical movement financial world cannot exclude long market orient distribution save investment consider desirable. the learn process involve least help u understand mistake make teach us. the focus present much role action owners, board management list companies. self-preservation alone doubt lead much do restore investor confidence corporations. auditor around world presumably also devote good deal think various functions. account issue much agenda. many bank also consider way provide client good analytical advice share investment. a one-sided producer orient approach, emphasis get client buy bank’s products, unlikely work long run. bank management tend look instead make approach consumer oriented. what good client presumably good bank well. the structure internal incentive also need adapt encourage long-term relationship. it seem reasonable suppose newspaper management likewise think readers’ interest best served. without way claim exhaustive, example illustrate major force work many part society view make thing function good recent stock market boom. in addition course deliberation economic policy decision-makers, authority international institutions. the message i want put across today primarily simple solution would prevent repetition through. we must also realise spontaneous heal mechanism market economy take time work. they probably need support good institutional rule systems, example account practice. at time, i would cautious intervene much, instance complicate matter rule system unduly detail supervision authorities. it question strike balance sound force economy free act tendency may develop crisis hold check. how achieve something market player competent authority continuously consider try light experience. bi review 49/2002 1

organise jointly deutsche bundesbank american council germany, frankfurt, 6 september 2002. * * * dear colleague friends, lady gentlemen, allow first join previous speaker extend warm welcome you. i glad see many manager first-rate expert financial community well academic others find time attend conference. our subject today international financial architecture, include state global economy interaction exchange rate development among key currencies. we thus opportunity discus current major problem confront world economy. when initiate conference begin year, friend american council germany i anticipate that, meantime, economic financial problem globally would become even pronounce time. in addition disappoint economic growth industrial countries, face series financial crisis emerge market economies. uruguay brazil add list ongoing debt problems. in disturb setting, revival strong growth industrial country improvement function international financial system critical relevance enhance live standard population around globe. i trust conference make u see exist challenge little clearly shed light best resolve press issues. in keynote address, i would first like discus recent development world economy touch upon matter crisis prevention crisis management. i look forward interest debate panellists, among audience, many issue i shall try identify. i. the state world economy even though recent news world economy exactly cheerful, let start positive note. judge data available, world economy remain road recovery. growth usa, euro area, accession country emerge east asia positive present, good prospect upswing become stronger. we remember fundamental country supportive. the combination low inflation low interest rates, particular, beneficial. also, japan recession seem bottom out. a recovery world economy recession mean forego conclusion. nevertheless, remarkable stabilisation point strong underlie resilience, foster increasingly flexible market timely policy responses. however, mild recession manage purge excess accumulate previous expansion. the recovery currently accompany several ongoing adjustment processes, disequilibria build throughout 1990s still corrected. most visible much comment mark decline stock markets, lose grind worldwide past couple days. moreover, u dollar depreciate major currencies, thus facilitate necessary adjustment large u current account deficit. equally, reduce inflow capital emerge market economy see part correction unsustainable trends. this apply also fdi. particularly latin america, early high fdi inflow large measure attributable privatisation utilities, financial institution 2 bi review 49/2002 enterprises, greenfield investments. with supply investment opportunity declining, fdi inflow bind decline well. of course, would good today imbalance could prevented. the correction imbalance contribute economic slack. this raise question extent build-up bubble stock market and, countries, house market due overly expansionary policies. whether central bank try prick bubble open debate. a good part current slack world economy reflect return normal underlie conditions. inflate expectation process corrected. it also true move recovery period risk tend downside upside. let mention four potential downside factors. first, risk aversion soared, credibility profit forecast dent misreported earn uncertainty impact stock options. in jittery environment, news might impair investor confidence negative impact stock markets. the u congress quick take legislative action attempt restore confidence u corporate system, problem emerge first severe. but, since trust easily lose yet difficult regain, current atmosphere still characterise nervousness fear scandals. second, owe weakness bank system industrial countries, risk deterioration finance conditions. those bank which, time now, exhibit low profitability midst restructure seem especially susceptible credit restraint. if world economic situation remain subdued, increase non-performing loan might put balance sheet position risk require limit exposure further. third, u current account deficit remain high level re-emergence fiscal deficit, hop adjustment process gradual one. finally, heighten tension middle east, particular threat invasion iraq, make price oil rise substantially last weeks. high oil price imply loss real income oil import countries, impact investment consumption. persistent tension middle east could thus seriously dampen economic recovery. allow also briefly highlight recent development major country regions, thereby identify number uncertainties. the u economy grow brisk pace early year expand much slowly second quarter. in particular, investment consumption perform strongly one might wish. while late figure indicate decline investment bottom out, capacity utilisation still remain low levels. this point sizeable supply overhang, caution idea investment soon act significant stimulus growth again. in addition uncertainty investment heading, consumption - main support force growth u recently - appear loose much steam owe slow employment growth thus low increase real income. on hand, negative wealth effect decline stock market offset low mortgage rate far, enable household enter beneficial debt profiles. however, mortgage rate cannot keep decline ever, wealth effect decline stock market increasingly come felt drain consumer spending. incidentally, correction take place world stock market financial statement company shed new light (cid:147)new economy(cid:148), originate u mid-1990s. if recall, new paradigm growth strongly drive large steady increase productivity, world rapid technological progress relation realise profit share price business cycle dead. the late data indicate productivity per hour u - (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) mean take place - average growth rate 2 % period 1996 2001. this still significantly average 1.2 % precede period 1982 certainly le figure 3 % circulate long ago. to me, downward revision seem powerful indication wonderland (cid:147)new economy(cid:148), classical economic rule bi review 49/2002 3 cease relevant, still way off. yet, also concede innovation ict sector feed economy whole, enable many people work efficiently. and, end, last impact ict revolution. all all, i conclude signal worlds(cid:146) large economy mix juncture. however, negative news gain prominence recent weeks, view likely outlook continue expansion, although one moderate previously thought. current cyclical development euro area display high degree synchronicity us. follow negative growth end 2001, euro area enter moderate economic recovery. both monetary fiscal policy give stimuli. owe extensive social safety nets, automatic stabiliser main channel fiscal expansion. however, strength recovery disappointing. at heart matter lie continue weak domestic demand. the euro area seem lack ability initiate strong sustainable expansion own. this, course, intrinsically link rigidity still present labour markets. in environment slow growth, deteriorate fiscal position european country prompt debate future european stability growth pact. any attempt weaken pact counterproductive resisted. fiscal discipline sine qua non satisfactory function monetary union long run. the exist rule simple transparent give country sound policy sufficient leeway let automatic stabiliser work downturn. instead try weaken rules, attention pay prevent fudge creative accounting. if look germany, account one-third euro area(cid:146)s gdp, expansion has, far, even fall short member state euro area. since emerge mild recession around begin year, german economy progress beyond initial stage recovery linger state resemble lethargy. the fact that, half year expansion, dynamic factor manage take root crucial way attribute continue weak domestic demand, ongoing contraction construction sector repercussion strike metal electronic industries. the confidence consumer investor least suffer ongoing stock market decline, pronounce loss us. this stock market effect also important factor third consecutive monthly drop late ifo business climate indicator, release last week. however, even cyclical recovery resume quickly, germany would witness notably high growth rate sustainable basis unless policymakers forceful tackle exist structural rigidities, particularly labour market. while situation u europe characterise subdue optimism, hoped-for return growth japan still uncertain. the deflationary situation persists. moreover, economy remain vulnerable owe high amount non-performing loans. this burden hamper activity bank corporate clients. nevertheless, recent economic data seem indicate begin recovery, mainly drive pick-up external demand - notably ict products. a one-third export destine us, strength recovery depend substantially continue propensity american firm household spend. the situation emerge market quite mixed. in rest east asia picture look fairly bright. partly due rise intra-asian trade strong domestic consumption, several economy east asia able achieve impressive growth rate first half year 2002. similarly, transition country perform quite well whole. most country grow year similar brisk pace 2001 may even grow bite strongly next year. the generally positive development asian european emerge market stand stark contrast recent event latin america. in argentina economy contract 10% year social situation still deteriorate dramatically. the situation brazil remain particular concern, even announcement new imf package. equally worrisome situation uruguay number latin american countries. only chile mexico appear relatively unscathed turmoil region. 4 bi review 49/2002 ii. strengthen crisis prevention recent development emerge market country make clear financial contagion emanate crisis emerge market much le issue today year ago. neither turkish crisis argentine default send shock wave comparable mexican crisis 1995 russian crisis 1998. the spread country east asia central europe scarcely affect current events. creditor investor apparently learn discriminate good individual borrowers. this change reflects, one hand, good information country condition and, hand, good risk assessment. it also reflect good macroeconomic policy implementation internationally agree standard codes. however, reason complacency. even sell-offs emerge market debt asset class long appear institutional investors(cid:146) prefer response crisis, impact form contagion underrated. this still observe latin america. of course, sharp contraction argentine economy real spill-overs important trade partner region. an additional transmission channel argentine crisis run argentine citizen - well resident uruguay - dollar account bank uruguay bank account argentina frozen. in process, uruguay quickly end dollar shortage thus face risk bank system break down. permit dollarisation bank system without ensure commensurate amount dollar liquidity would remain available financial system make uruguay, least, victim regulatory supervisory weaknesses. when argentine currency-board regime abandoned, contagion effect also result government(cid:146)s decision banks(cid:146) dollar liability convert peso much high exchange rate assets. the bank could anticipate unfair treatment imply huge losses. accord market participants, unusual measure noticeably increase risk aversion vis-(cid:224)-vis country region. here, example call political contagion: investor afraid country might feel encourage adopt similar disruptive measures. i conclude recent financial crisis emerge market economy contagion still problem country weak fundamentals. current turbulence latin america therefore large extend reflection country-specific factors. in order ensure stable development emerge market economy contain risk contagion much possible, international community launch comprehensive approach crisis prevention. the strategy, develop join force many international group organisations, involve number institutional procedure design help identify major weakness individual country remedy soon possible. first foremost, reform aim achieve sound monetary fiscal policy always crucial avoid type balance payment crisis. experience also teach u impact currency crisis exacerbate dramatically external vulnerability allow take hold bank system. moreover, emerge market need develop effective liability management approaches, aim reduce role short-term debt denominate foreign currency well limit concentration amortisation within short period time. in vein reduce foreign-currency risk, emphasis need place strengthen domestic market long-term debt. it obvious emerge markets, sustainability macroeconomic policy adjustment remain issue, (cid:147)because sensitivity economy policy weakness political support(cid:148) (b. eichengreen). for reason emerge country need reinforce legal institutional framework. in respect, protect property right mean transparent enforceable regulation key. the rule law help strengthen fundamental economy, reliable legal framework encourage domestic foreign investor undertake project long-term perspective mind. moreover, build strong public institution help reduce uncertainty regard future policies. in democracy government change. however, change government undermine proper function institutional framework. for example, institution remain commit ensure transparency policy pursued. institution also design achieve solid macroeconomic financial environment. in particular, establish central bank independence may consider best practice. in country central bi review 49/2002 5 bank comprehensive supervisory functions, establish independent regulatory agency could equally helpful ensure effective regulation supervision financial institution markets. while list useful policy reform extend substantially, i shall confine one aspect, namely underscore important is, interest crisis prevention, choose appropriate exchange rate regime. the recent wave international debt crisis begin mid-1990s. most country involve previously maintain fix exchange rate subsequently switch floating-rate regime pressure balance payment problems. exchange rate fix have, fact, inevitable shortcoming time increase international capital flows. under (cid:147)fair weather(cid:148) conditions, fix inadequately adjust exchange rate helpful attract foreign capital finance current account imbalance high interest rate borrow country apparently offset correspond exchange rate risk. a experience shown, however, fix exchange rate cannot maintain long term foreign creditor lose confidence economic policy debtor country. dramatic exchange rate depreciation proves, first foremost, powerful mean accentuate crises, whereas regime flexible exchange rate might help prevent crisis first place. the fact brazil hit capital account crisis spite float exchange rate mean weaken argument float regimes. brazil index substantial share domestically issue public debt exchange rate dollar. when current political uncertainty (relating presidential election october) trigger depreciation real, fiscal position deteriorate accordingly, thus raise suspicion among holder brazil(cid:146)s international debt whether fundamental strong believe whether authority would able service external obligation scheduled. the advantage float therefore partly thwart exchange rate indexation public debt. i deny fix exchange rate may continue function satisfactorily special circumstances. also, country le integrate international financial market may able continue operate traditional exchange rate peg quite successfully. in interest crisis prevention, however, latter country miss right moment change regime integration world financial system advances. iii. improve crisis management direct crisis prevention measure kind i mention first line defence ensure smooth longer-term development world economy. nevertheless, spite efforts, financial crisis probably occur emerge market economies. how best resolve future crisis therefore remain issue utmost importance. here, need find appropriate balance role official financial support role private sector involvement (psi). in long run, proper function international financial market ensure private creditor investor reap benefit decision good luck also bear potential cost development turn badly. the effective application principle one fundamental precondition place market economy function satisfactory manner. this principle similar importance need price stability. central bank mandate de jure de facto contribute maintain stability financial system therefore always among proponent adequate psi crisis management. official large-scale finance package sharply reduce even eliminate need psi would inevitably involve moral hazard part lender borrowers. however, bailouts would weaken market discipline heighten crisis risk. since imf ultimately get pay back investor might escape without take severe hit, general public particularly poor debtor country shoulder full economic cost excessive debt burdens. reliance bailouts therefore also questionable equity grounds. although need psi resolution capital account crisis increasingly acknowledged, practical progress implement principle far modest. the lack progress owe something fact exist official framework psi, adopt international monetary financial committee imf (imfc) meet prague 6 bi review 49/2002 september 2000, give much leeway discretionary decision favour extraordinary official financing. accord imfc(cid:146)s prague communiquø, official response capital account crisis distinguish case debt restructure appear unavoidable case debtor country seem undergo relatively short-term crisis confidence. regard restructure cases, consensus exist within international community systematic application psi. this consensus implies, particular, private creditor treat manner comparable bilateral official creditor (paris club) that, among group private creditor investors, category lender consider inherently privileged. furthermore, framework rightly insist psi rely much possible voluntary solutions. in respect, helpful prague communiquø recognise possibility temporary payment suspension event private creditors(cid:146) unwillingness cooperate fairly debtor country. consequently, imf continue support default member country within exist access limits, provide debtor seek work cooperatively good faith private creditor meet programme requirements. in contrast strict psi rule restructure cases, prague framework admit exceptional access imf financing, combine policy adjustment, would justify event capital account problem fund belief confidence among market participant restore quickly. in addition, imf may encourage private creditor help contain crisis voluntarily. however, fund would coercive role voluntary psi form debt rollover remain unsatisfactory. while prague approach apply successfully number recent financial crisis small insolvent country (pakistan, ukraine, ecuador), underlie distinction solvency problem liquidity problem quickly display inherently political dimension argentina, second important borrower among emerge market economies, hit confidence crisis end 2000. early 2001, imf - push major shareholder - provide exceptionally large financial support almost automatically, despite serious doubt fund staff must outset regard argentina(cid:146)s longer-term solvency. in september 2001, imf(cid:146)s exceptional financial support even enhanced. in november 2001, acknowledge indirectly approach take case argentina actually line prague communiquø. anne krueger, fund(cid:146)s first deputy manage director, publicly make point that, opinion, remain gap hole international financial architecture long lack incentive help country unsustainable debt restructure maturity promptly orderly way. give gap, anne krueger justify bailout operation available mechanism deal solvency problem country complex internationally significant debt burdens. in order avoid future, propose establishment sovereign debt restructure mechanism (sdrm) would copy important feature national insolvency regimes. a proposed, sdrm would four pillars. first, follow suspension payments, debtor country would temporarily protect possible litigation private creditors. second, mechanism would provide creditor guarantee debtor country would act responsibly stay. third, provider fresh money would receive kind prefer creditor status. finally, mechanism would enable requisite majority creditor make restructure agreement bind private creditors. if sdrm existed, creditor would incentive reach agreement debtor accord, mechanism would rarely need used. at present, similar le effective incentive rely risk creditor face unilateral standstill, acknowledge prague communiquø. however, optimism sdrm could implement soon would warranted. many judicial practical problems, include role imf sdrm scope debt submit mechanism, require analysis. also, international agreement require legal basis would time-consuming. at events, imf(cid:146)s initiative give fresh impetus international debate improve crisis management procedures. g-7 minister governor join discussion quickly. in april 2002, submit action plan support work imf propose sdrm also envisage develop market-based approach sovereign debt restructure priority. their idea bi review 49/2002 7 objective sdrm might achievable contractual basis. the practical work perform legal expert g-10 authority cooperation group private sector lawyers. the contractual approach aim design model template collective action clause could suitable standard language use international debt documentation, similar clause already apply market practice international bond issue english japanese law. a potential restructure international bank loan handle satisfactorily london club, focus contractual approach sovereign bond documentation, consideration also give provision might design use syndicate sovereign loans. it g-7(cid:146)s intention finish work, include consultation emerge market borrowers, soon - hopefully annual meet imf end month. in end, effort enlarge strengthen tool kit crisis management help much enhance role psi long succeed limit access imf finance effectively. the action plan g-7 minister governor rightly state that, give plan development market-oriented approach sovereign debt restructuring, prepare limit official sector lend normal access level except circumstance justify exception. in respect, crucial question whether feasible make precondition exceptional access imf finance much constrain present. the official community agree debt sustainability, include liability vis-(cid:224)-vis fund, must precondition finance decision imf - whether take within normal lend limit whether address current capital account problems. this requirement reflect need safeguard fund(cid:146)s resources, must remain available member country revolve basis. in capital account crisis country(cid:146)s government relevant borrower international market assessment debt sustainability address least two aspects. in final analysis, imf need form judgement whether realistic adjustment programme would enable borrower meet external obligation medium term full time. in context, attention also pay debtor(cid:146)s ability internally generate budgetary fund require debt-service payments. however, debt sustainability assessment highly conditional prone wide range risks. unanticipated international domestic shock could change dynamic previously consider sustainable scenario. meaningful sustainability assessment therefore incorporate relatively unfavourable assumption development key economic factors, gdp growth, interest rates, exchange rate commodity prices. nevertheless, spite much room improve analysis, sustainability assessment always remain matter judgement. positive debt sustainability assessment, together strong adjustment programme, key exceptional access imf resource capital account crisis. however, owe inherent difficulty distinguish reliably sustainable unsustainable debt burdens, imf use exceptional access rule rather exception recent past. not surprisingly, many instance objective help restore market access achieve and, more, approach become root cause moral hazard volatile capital flows. in order roll back part play exceptional access necessary introduce additional safeguards. in addition positive assessment debt sustainability, exceptional access could make dependent convince argument failure provide support might threaten global financial system. if systemic criterion applied, would also demonstrate temporary standstill (like bank holiday national bank crisis) would suitable alternative whether expect contagion effect would good mitigate lend crisis-stricken country rather potentially affect countries. it remain see whether g-7 able conclude current discussion exceptional access policy parallel work contractual approach sovereign debt restructuring. the new extraordinary finance package favour brazil, discuss imf board today, foreshadow change policy part fund thus make le optimistic satisfactory agreement reform access policy among g-7 achievable soon. so, new brazilian package raise lot serious question regard fund policies. i sure play major role discussion today. bi

therefore, framework conduct monetary policy result low predictable inflation, help curb volatility yield curve support development bond markets. change monetary policy stance also directly affect interest rate hence bond market. thus, pay understand monetary policy. monetary policy thailand in order that, i start tell monetary policy framework evolve thailand. since end second world war, thailand employ regime fix exchange rate one way another. at begin currency fix british pound, late u dollar - first directly, late via basket heavy u dollar content. the regime serve u well. it provide certainty international trade, help attract foreign investment. we able maintain parity u dollar 18 year 1981 first devaluation. the pressure parity early day slight. thailand’s export time rice, rubber, tin teak. our production cost item among low world. however, begin 1980’s, begin industrialize. our industrial export 33 % total export end 1970’s quickly rise 76 % 1990 even 86% today. with industrialization, begin find productivity keep major trade partners, particularly us, pressure parity begin build up. our domestic cost production never flexible downward. to ask wage salary reduction unthinkable - today. our choice devalue. the devaluation occur always smooth. more once, bring political tension, government believe opposition, even military, think otherwise. in one incident, even cause change central bank governor. finally, float currency 1997. since then, adopt inflation target monetary policy framework. a core inflation target announce 0 3.5 % per annum. the central bank regularly monitor economic change make forecasts. if see rate inflation tendency exceed range, adopt tight monetary policy stance increase policy interest rate, vice versa see go range. the policy rate use 14 day repurchase rate. 2 bi review 48/2002 this completely different, course, compare day fix currency regime interest rate thailand would move mostly tandem u rates. the change monetary policy framework therefore affect financial environment business great deal. development bond market what change also happened? one important change occur thailand rapid development bond market, take 1997 crisis. the bond market important tool safety soundness financial institution system. it allow intermediation process proceed uninterrupted bank temporarily difficulty. but importantly, help liquidity management. in case thailand, government throughout 1980’s discipline fiscal policy. they maintain balance budget years. a result, new government bond issued, old one retired. without deep liquid government bond market, growth corporate bond also slow. when crisis erupted, financial institution could seek liquidity inter bank market stick without liquid instrument hand. some might survive bond market active. after crisis, government issue massive amount bond cover loss financial system. today, thai bond market therefore much larger, 38 % gdp. we much active market. what active bond market mean monetary policy? i highlight three points. first implication transmission mechanism. when central bank want change stance monetary policy, change interest rate down. but directly change interest rate along whole spectrum yield curve. it affect key policy rate, case thailand short-term 14 day rate repurchase market. however, impact real economy, must way transmit signal way financial activity determine economic transactions, business capital formation, household consumption savings. the traditional channel commercial banks. and another channel corporate bond market. this channel poise grow rapidly future. the second aspect central bank also operate government bond market conduct monetary policy. it sell buy bond pump money system, open market operations. an efficient, deep liquid bond market therefore help make intermediation process competitive active - also allow central bank transact market effectively. the third aspect function bond market manage capital flows. emerge market economy successful tend attract capital inflow quickly, large quantity. unfortunately, thing turn bad, outflow capital also equally quick large quantity. how one good manage volatile capital flow? to extent, i think risk mitigate well function bond market. if make function temporary reservoir store incoming water, slowly release various user fund within country, right pace absorption - market selection process make project really viable, economic prospect grant fund - and, foreign owner fund persuade hold instrument denominate borrowers’ currency, thereby shift position foreign bi review 48/2002 3 exchange risk borrower investors, bond market safe channel capital flow commercial banks. at point may disagree foreign investor bond want out, still sell bonds, cause price sharply low anyway. this true. but price volatility bond market still good run banks. therefore efficient bond market help lessen adverse impact volatile capital flow may financial institutions. a sound financial system course necessary condition conduct monetary policy. the role non-bank financial institution let turn non-bank financial institutions. what role relation monetary policy? i offer four suggestions. number one, make efficient player market. the efficient competitors, good market is. but order compete well, well capitalized, well organize good governance risk management processes. number two, help establish market code practice conform world standards. the market need rule ensure smooth trade dispute resolutions, guard manipulation. the industry important role play set rule code conduct. number three, help ensure market wide variety products. we aim market offer many kind contract, serve need unbundled rearrange kind risk competitive prices. and lastly, build good analytical capability. it prevent herd behavior, help stabilize market. but importantly, proper project analysis ensure capital channel good projects. it help prevent expansion businesses, diversification enthusiasm inevitably wind non-performing loan end. lady gentleman the task central bank monetary policy ensure set right policy, policy transmit overall economy. the financial system policy transmit must also safe sound. non-bank financial institution indeed vital role play here. bi review 48/2002 1 otmar issing: monetary policy change economic environment speech professor otmar issing,1 member executive board european central bank, symposium “rethinking stabilisation policy”, jackson hole, 30 august 2002. * * * i intend focus remark challenge face monetary policy rapidly change world. i shall start examine nature economic change confront monetary policy daily execution. in absence unambiguous mandate maintain price stability clear strategy sustain it, ongoing task identify late economic shock may easily distract central bank need maintain firm sense direction long run. next, i advance interpretation transition european monetary union – involving, standards, state acute uncertainty – could accomplish smooth manner proceeded. in context, i highlight role two complementary policy perspectives. these two principle good policy conducive flexible timely response unfold event and, time, insure policy myopia short-termism keep solidly anchor medium-term objective. cyclical structural change economic change – uncertainty bring – three dimensions. at grind level, cyclical, transitory and/or non-structural, economic shock come along continuously. the theory economic policy normally assume shock ‘additive’ nature, pose controllability problem policy. nevertheless, properly identify real time. econometric theory spend decade devise sophisticate identify restriction isolate different type shock tangle appear data. the purpose exercise trace propagation profile exogenous impulse economic system. but nothing close consensus view emerged. in fact, inference often non-robust across various identification schemes.2 a consequence, central banker give little guidance nature stochastic disturbance drive business cycle average. of course, model-selection stake here, compete model paradigm put test – discriminate – match quantitative implication dynamic shock response one see data. if latter generate basis controversial identification restrictions, empirical benchmark become elusive. for reasons, central banker must exercise judgement encounter perturbations, cannot rely single approach reason implication shocks. at high level, low frequency, structural change. this induce parameter – i.e. multiplicative – uncertainty, innovation tend persist, become embed coefficient key variable respond exogenous forces. monetary policy-makers, again, find crossroads. for one thing, extremely difficult decompose real time due structural change stem normal cyclical source fluctuation, event tend come together. but, fundamentally, central banker perceive uncertainty surround structural variation high order magnitude – different nature – compare way parametric risk treat much literature. i believe type measure uncertainty closer, case, knightian concept wherein probability distribution model coefficient cannot articulated. a source uncertainty, strategic sort, stem endogenous – time unpredictable – process whereby agent form expectations. this process strategic, game- 1 i would like thank massimo rostagno valuable contribution. 2 various alternative method identify monetary policy shock generally produce comparable qualitative results, sense inference reasonably robust across large subset identification schemes. however, appear case exercise aim identify shock technology. furthermore, disagreement extent different shock responsible output variation past. 2 bi review 48/2002 theoretic flavour central bank way respond event much part picture, way drive formation view future. incidentally, identification disturbance stem cyclical, structural expectational disturbance complicate ex-post statistical revision may time overturn empirical platform central banker make decision real time. and superfluous remind audience paramount measurement problem cloud state variable output gap, nairu, steady-state real interest rate key importance mainstream macroeconomic discussions. institutional change complexity reach climax presence large-scale institutional change, however. this source change sufficiently rare history escape econometric testing, sufficiently severe impart profound discontinuity data-generating process. time institutional change time signal extraction problem central bank acute. structural change may associate widely disperse range expectations. these, turn, may behave erratically fail coordinate focal point. the ecb example tell regard. when european central bank start conduct policy 1999, area-wide back data scantly available, many statistical indicator still construction. more importantly, presumption creation euro area would imply major regime shift. therefore, statistical pattern emerge past data – make available aggregation national figure – might informative structure new economic entity, might even misleading. under circumstances, could take grant private agent could immediately form expectation consistent new regime, thus instability behaviour could rule out. in sense, study evolution move object, change reason observed, famous heisenberg paradox. real time misperception, false inference, knightian uncertainty, usual professional hazard central banking, plus something else seem compound – let’s conservative – factor three. indeed, ecb preside monumental transition. the money market, one, undergo historical transformation eve launch euro january 1999. eleven national markets, diverse term participants, operate conventions, settlement structures, credit facilities, merge unify trade area almost overnight. new payment system large-value transaction implemented. capital market traditionally protect currency fragmentation national regulation open arbitrage straight competition. yet, transition smooth abrupt switch structural relations, many observer see offing, materialise all. market immediately recognise new rule game. they adjust swiftly new monetary policy environment. since 1999, overnight rate limit fluctuation date monetary policy announcement le five basis point

possible? how could uncertainty high degree fail leave mark records? in view ecb’s success anchor expectation right start fall sky entirely “inherited” past. instead, i would argue, success attribute good measure ecb’s monetary policy strategy general principle underlie policy making. not least, reflection philosophy market powerful, sometimes overwhelmingly so, nevertheless need guide central bank, meddle with. first, way commit override mandate guardian price stability euro area – receive international treaty – anchor expectation time accelerate change. the ecb’s announcement quantitative

medium-term orientation monetary policy strategy aversion fine-tune short-term development price real variable help provide firm compass economy sail uncharted turbulent water 1999 subsequent years. it deflect risk that, amidst exceptional uncertainties, central bank may become additional source noise. ultimately, provide degree leverage expectation eve transition new currency could pin solidly intend objective policy.4 the mandate independence ensure endow new institution stock credibility facilitate operation interaction market first day monetary union. secondly, strategy help sort wealth conflict statistic provide reliable roadmap sense direction.5 we build strategy two complementary perspective work economy, one money credit attribute key role formation prices. and one real variable receive pre-eminent attention determinant price pressure short term, monetary factor treat implicitly. under call first pillar, thoroughly monitor monetary credit indicator basis analytical framework sensibly incorporate development money. under pillar, announce reference value m3 growth which, realise average medium term, normal circumstance indicate policy consistent achievement price stability. i shall return principle shortly, constitute focal point remain observations. under second pillar review broad set non-monetary indicator ass implication price set short medium-term horizon. these two mutually-reinforcing perspective provide robust indication policy aim price stability, survive cross-check compete model rise-and-fall cycle fashion economic thinking. keep firm sense direction but monetary policy framework induce prompt action face ever change circumstances, time maintain firm sense direction? here clearly potential destabilise mechanism set in. constantly bombard economic news, central bank risk become hypnotise late indicator, markets’ likely reaction late indicator, markets’ anticipation central bank’s response late indicator, infinity. this mechanism lead monetary policy gradually astray foremost role provide firm medium-term anchor economy. 4 on connection central bank’s predominant focus price stability, aversion real fine-tune credibility assets, see v. gaspar f. smets (2002), ‘monetary policy, price stability output gap stabilisation,’ paper present conference ‘government economy: the pro con counter-cyclical macro policy’ (new york, 11 july). 5 for precise description ecb monetary policy strategy, see ecb (1999), ‘the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy eurosystem,’ monthly bulletin, january; ecb (2000), ‘the two pillar ecb’s monetary policy strategy,’ monthly bulletin, november; o. issing et al (2001), ‘monetary policy euro area,’ cambridge: cambridge university press. 4 bi review 48/2002 so, risk oversimplifying, let turn consider two general principle prudent monetary governance may help central bank reconcile need prompt action firm medium-term orientation. first, central bank always need tailor action upon origin, magnitude nature shock hit economy time time. a i try argue above, highly demand exercise, shock come labels: identify first, real time. but shortcut excuses: simple rule link policy one two privilege indicator substitute accurate examination shock careful analysis potential transmission price sufficiently extend span time ahead. a corollary principle horizon policy action cannot set advance, i shall argue extensively below. second, central bank benefit keep eye fix single long-term compatibility condition monetary economics offer practitioners, free model-specificities restrictive assumptions. namely, sufficiently extend period time money grow rate consistent trend growth real output central bank’s definition price stability. in general terms, principle embody ancient wisdom quantity theoretic law growth money ultimately anchor development prices. each one two principle – take individually – entail guidance monetary policy-maker, which, however, partial. a monetary policy strategy – one adopt ecb – see provide robust framework monetary policy decision-making, heed two general principle way reinforce complement other. the lesson suggest first principle disturbance evaluated, come about, accord potential propagation, infect expectations, degenerate price spirals. and preventive action delayed, become clear shock – whatever origin – may take hold economy evolve inflationary deflationary pressure medium term. the time dimension possible development vary type shock, initial macroeconomic conditions, prevail financial sentiment, international environment many variables. therefore, horizon monetary policy cannot set advance. sometimes pay look far ahead, beyond average lag monetary transmission. sometimes, economy expect return price stability within much short horizon. in events, central bank ensure expectation quickly revert declare objective policy. the policy recommendation implicit second principle simple: ignore information monetary development contain medium-term price development even relationship money price may come strongly short horizons. this principle also provide antidote pitfall exceedingly forward-looking rules.6 look future vigilant eye, first principle suggests, fundamental element good policy. but, constantly look ahead, one lose sight intend trajectory policy need act consistently time. one always constantly aware possible, inadvertent slippage intend long-term direction. in end, monetary policy need ensure path money supply consistent maintain price stability medium term. trend money velocity incorporate longer-term benchmark, account evolve structure monetary exchange. but, end, sustain inflation without systematic accommodation monetary aggregates. the key point i want bring neither two principle stand alone. both need mutual cross-checking. the first principle suggest central bank move interest rate policy instrument reaction disturbance consider implication price stability medium term. but action – take successive point time – may prove consistent time could thus, cumulatively, result systematic divergence desire objective. thus, course policy follow attempt counter perturbation via shock-specific response need ascertain straight line provide quantity theoretic reference second principle. if line turn depart extend period time, policy, sooner later, bring back onto right course. 6 a discussion problem excessive forward-lookingness monetary policy provide m. woodford (2000), ‘pitfalls forward-looking monetary policy,’ american economic review, vol. 90(2), 100-104.. bi review 48/2002 5 incidentally, worth note historical episode asset price ‘bubbles’ tend accompany strong persistent deviation reference line. thus, monetary policy strategy monitor closely monetary development measure medium term reference growth rate may – important side effect – also contribute limit emergence unsustainable development asset valuations. asset prices, themselves, suitable goal monetary policy. in long run relative price asset mainly drive underlie real factor – e.g. technological development preference – cannot control monetary policy. but monetary aggregate credit development situation financial instability signal extent consumption, investment, labour price set decision affect condition financial disorder, excessive euphoria disillusion. conversely, second principle too, follow isolation, subject potential difficulties. a first point william poole thirty year ago, many short-term shock amount money demand unit nominal income, monetary authority would good ignore accommodating. these unexplained innovation may simply relate seasonal noise money creation system, transitory force drive around transaction habits. they may reflect reversible movement preference liquidity, in- out-flows foreign exchange transit checkable accounts, else. in case europe, cannot rule process financial integration may affect income velocity monetary aggregates. in circumstances, hit constant rate-of-growth target for, say, base money near-term horizon would result ample fluctuation short-term interest rates. and instability would likely transmit price output cause unnecessary fluctuation variables. in context, first principle good policy, prescribe careful filter disturbances, provide important safeguard policy-induced instabilities. in fact, underlie ecb’s decision adopt reference value monetary growth, monetary target. and also support need look monetary development medium-term perspective. nevertheless, long money demand relationship reasonably stable – case europe contrast u – information monetary development provide robust indication medium-term price pressures. paraphrase expression paul samuelson, give two eyes: one watch money credit aggregate one watch everything else. ultimately, two policy perspective combine single strategy subsume unify – albeit complex – robust framework action. this strategy lend policy-makers accurate perspective economy respond expeditiously events, time insure systematic slippage. conclude remark i shall conclude number observation recurrent remark above. first: simple escape central bank serious analysis economic change, come form shock noise. these change often opaque present disguise, may contain information cannot discard priori grounds. there escape serious analysis economic perturbations. certainly, follow deceptively simple policy rule one sort another viable cure complexity. second: change money demand one difficult decipher. look ahead, shock may even augment number magnitude – case u elsewhere past – would make filter read signal come money difficult undertaking. but central bank deny opportunity take advantage information carry themselves. the conviction money matter contain invaluable information policy share across central banker wed different monetary policy strategies.7 third: look conjunctural signals, central bank never fall prey myopia short-termism. monetary theory provide compass measure course policy deviate past likely deviate future straight line consistent price stability 7 see example m. king (2002), ‘no money, no inflation – the role money economy,’ bank england quarterly bulletin, summer; l. meyer (2001), ‘does money matter?’ homer jones memorial lecture (st. louis, 28 march), bank international settlement review no. 25 (30 march). 6 bi review 48/2002 sustainable growth path. this quantity theoretic reference consult regularly take seriously. monetary policy cannot react mechanistically monetary variables, weight central bank attache consideration various headline measure money supply state-dependent: cannot set advance. thus, may extend period time observer detect reaction monetary indicators. in strategy, example, weight conditional analysis monetary shocks, conduct first pillar. this analysis aim purge development monetary aggregate noise usually observed. this analysis yield reliable measure use policy orientation. but deviation measure money long-run trajectory consistent price stability ample persistent, central bank intervene, anchor property money reinstate make operative. bi review 48/2002 1 alan greenspan: economic volatility remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, 30 august 2002. * * * over past two

volatility expectations. security analysts' expectation long-term earn growth, assume proxy investors' expectations, revise significantly second half 1990s 2000.1 over period, risk spread corporate bond rise markedly net, imply rise probability default. default, course, generally associate negative earnings. hence, high average expect earn growth couple rise probability default imply great

congressional testimony july 1999,2 "... productivity acceleration ensure equity price overextended. there little doubt nation's productivity growth step up, level profit future potential would elevated. that prospect support high stock prices. the danger circumstances, unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension recent development drive equity price level unsupportable even risk future become relatively small. such stray fundamental could create problem economy inevitable adjustment occurs." look back years, evident increase productivity growth impart significant upward momentum expectation earn growth and, accordingly, price-earnings ratios. between 1995 2000, price-earnings ratio s&p 500 rise 15 nearly 30. however, attribute increase entirely revise earn expectation would require upward revision growth real earn 2 full percentage point perpetuity.3 because real riskless rate return apparently change much five-year period, anything short extraordinary permanent increase growth structural productivity, thus earnings,4 imply significant fall real equity premium years. if drop equity premium result permanent reduction cyclical volatility, stock price arguably could stabilize level summer 2000. that clearly happen, indicate stock prices, fact, rise level excess economically supportable base. toward end year, expectation long-term earn growth begin turn down. at time, equity premium apparently begin rise. the consequent reversal stock price occur past couple year particularly pronounce high-tech sector economy. the investment boom late 1990s, initially spur significant advance information technology, ultimately produce overhang instal capacity. even though demand number high-tech product double triple annually, many case new supply come even faster. overall, capacity high-tech manufacture industry rise 40 percent 2000, well excess rapid rate increase previous two years. in light burgeon supply, pace increase demand new technologies, though rapid, fell short need sustain elevate real rate return whole high-tech capital stock. return security high-tech firm ultimately collapsed, capital investment. similar, though le severe, adjustment occur many industry across economy. some decline equity premium latter part 1990s almost surely would anticipate continue absence business correction reinforce notion increase secular stability. in environment, relatively mild recession experience 2001 might still expect leave equity premium long-term averages. that apparently case, tendency toward low equity premium create stable economy may offset extent recently concern quality corporate governance. * * * the struggle understand development economy financial market since mid-1990s particularly challenge monetary policymakers. we confront force none u personally experienced. aside recent experience japan, history book musty archive give u clue appropriate stance policy. we federal reserve consider number issue relate asset bubbles--that is, surge price asset unsustainable levels. a event evolved, recognize that, despite suspicions, 2 committee bank financial services, u.s. house representatives, july 22, 1999. 3 for

bubbles, even identify early, could preempt short central bank induce substantial contraction economic activity--the outcome would seek avoid. prolong period expansion promote great rational willingness take risks, pattern difficult avert modest tighten monetary policy. in fact, experience past fifteen year suggest monetary tighten deflate stock price without depress economic activity often associate subsequent increase level stock prices. for example, stock price rise follow completion 300-basis-point rise federal fund rate twelve month end february 1989. and year begin february 1994, federal reserve raise federal fund target 300 basis points. stock price initially flattened, soon round tighten completed, resume mark upward advance. from mid-1999 may 2000, federal fund rate raise 150 basis points. however, equity price increase largely undeterred period despite now, retrospect, exhaust tail bull market.5 such data suggest nothing short sharp increase short-term rate engender significant economic retrenchment sufficient check nascent bubble. the notion well-timed incremental tighten could calibrate prevent late 1990s bubble almost surely illusion. instead, note previously cite mid-1999 congressional testimony need focus policy "to mitigate fallout occur and, hopefully, ease transition next expansion." * * * it seem reasonable generalize recent experience low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tighten exist reliably deflate bubble. but policy least limit size bubble and, hence, destructive fallout? from evidence date, answer appear no.6 but need know behavior equity premium bubble impact economic activity.7 the equity premium, compute total expect return common stock le riskless debt, price risk take investor purchase equity rather risk-free debt. it measure largely risk aversion investors, corporate managers. an increase appetite risk investors, example, manifest shift willingness hold equity place psychologically less-stressful, lower-yielding, debt. 5 stock price peak march 2000, market basically move sideways september year. 6 some assert federal reserve deflate stock-price bubble--rather painlessly--by boost margin requirements. the evidence suggest otherwise. first, amount margin debt small, never amount 1-3/4 percent market value equity; moreover, even figure overstate amount margin debt use purchase stock, debt also finance short-sales equity transaction non-equity securities. second, investor need rely margin debt take leverage position equities. they borrow source buy stock. or, purchase options, affect stock price give linkage across markets. thus, surprisingly, preponderance research suggest change margin effective tool reduce stock market volatility. it possible margin requirement inhibit small investor whose access form credit limited. if so, effect raise margin requirement price small investor without address broad issue stock price bubbles. if change margin requirement take investor signal central bank would soon tighten monetary policy enough burst bubble, might appearance causal effect. but prospect monetary policy action, margin increase, view trigger. in similar manner, history tell u "jawboning" asset market ineffective unless back action. 7 the sharp stock market contraction october 19, 1987 one-fifth require especial study. equity price rise sharply spring summer, despite rise short-term rate late summer year. the price collapse clearly characteristic prolong far large bubbles, stock price quickly stabilize without significant effect economic activity. and, line late episodes, failure collapse economic impact seem contribute subsequent high stock prices. 4 bi review 48/2002 in case, cost equity confront corporate manager fall relative cost debt. with great access lower-cost equity, manager able finance high proportion risky real asset lessen call cash flow fear default. thus, generally change risk preference investors, corporate managers, govern mix risk investment economy. manager presumably employ market price debt equity couple calculate rate return particular real investment project determine level corporate investment. to sure, managers' personal sense risk aversion sometimes influence capital investment process, probably secondary effect relative vagary investor psychology. bubble thus appear primarily reflect exuberance part investor price financial assets. if manager investor perceive degree risk, correctly judge sustainable rise profit stem new technology, example, none rise stock price would reflect bubble. bubble appear emerge investor either overestimate sustainable rise profit unrealistically low rate discount apply expect profit dividends. the distinction cannot readily ascertain market prices. but equity premium le expect growth dividends, presume earnings, estimate dividend yield le real long-term interest rate u.s. treasuries.8 if equity premium redefine include unrealistic part profit projection unsustainably low segment discount factors, associate measure concepts, could employ measure infer emerge bubbles. that is, could substitute realistic projection earn dividend growth, perhaps base structural productivity growth behavior payout ratio, residual equity premium might afford evidence develop bubble. of course, central bank access information, would private agents, render development bubble highly unlikely. bubble often precipitate perception real improvement productivity underlie profitability corporate economy. but history attests, investor often exaggerate extent improvement economic fundamentals. human psychology is, bubble tend fee themselves, boom late stage often support implausible projection potential demand. stock price equity premium drive unsustainable levels. certainly, bubble cannot persist indefinitely. eventually, unrealistic expectation future earn prove wrong. a happens, asset price gravitate back level line sustainable path earnings. the continual press reality perception inevitably discipline view investor managers. a i note earlier, key policy question is: if low-cost, incremental policy tighten appear incapable deflate bubbles, option exist least effectively limit size bubble without substantial damage process? to date, able identify policies, though perhaps others may future. it mean evident u currently have--or able find--a measure equity premium relate indicator convincingly presage emerge bubble. short measure, i find difficult conceive adequate degree central bank certainty justify scale preemptive tighten would likely necessary neutralize bubble. a delve deep question raise development recent years, interplay structural productivity growth equity premiums, evident past business cycle, bind play prominent role. we need particularly determine whether periodic emergence market bubbles, occur often past, inevitable go forward. a financial wealth become ever-more-important determinant activity, need also understand far good change equity premium affect reflect real financial investment decisions. if equity premium demonstrable influence economy appear have, value investigation topic evident. * * * 8 from

release industry late year. this help hkma conserve resource direct needed. but also serve remind ai primary responsibility make sure house order. the hkma guideline check standard observe obviously important. but necessary ensure standard remain effective deal risks. that currently engage review anti-money launder guideline. in so, make particular reference two main sources. the first paper customer due diligence bank issue basel committee october 2001. the consultation paper release fatf may year review fatf forty recommendation set international standard anti-money laundering. i would strongly recommend ai familiarise documents. comment fatf consultation paper due end month. the process revise fatf recommendation probably complete time next year. final revision guideline probably wait then. in meantime, however, reluctant simply leave exist guideline unchanged. there may number area possible update reflect current international consensus draw together piece guidance particular issue appear circular last years. we consider best way this. one option issue supplement exist guideline, pending final revisions. whatever will, always, subject consultation industry. in place revise standard may tight permit few exception present. but try wherever possible sympathetic ais’ concern compliance costs. terrorist finance the obvious thing need incorporate guideline specific recommendation relate terrorist financing. in particular, need make ai aware responsibility unite nation (anti-terrorism measures) ordinance enact july year begin come operation near future. the new ordinance intend meet hong kong’s commitment fatf’s eight special recommendation terrorist financing. to end, criminalise finance terrorism associate money launder provide freeze terrorist-related funds. it also impose obligation ai person report knowledge suspicion fund link terrorism. we already ask ai report jfiu suspicious transaction may relate terrorism. but legal obligation clear unambiguous, criminal offence deal terrorist funds. ai therefore need ensure necessary measure place comply law. this easy task. it accept terrorist finance difficult detect even ai provide list terrorist suspects. the fatf publish april year document call guidance financial institution detect terrorist finance i would recommend look at. among things, provide advice characteristic financial transaction may arouse suspicion, particularly one party know suspect terrorist terrorist organisation. even evidence direct terrorist connection, transaction still report jfiu look suspicious reasons. this obviously apply remittance well open account. it may subsequently emerge terrorist link. thus, success fight terrorist finance depend large measure overall quality ais’ control money launder - particular, ability detect suspicious transactions. bi review 47/2002 3 the customer due diligence process this turn depend institution’s knowledge customer normal pattern account activity particular customer. it crucial therefore ais’ effective system customer due diligence. the main essential already hkma’s guideline, require ai make reasonable effort determine customer’s true identity. but process may need articulate clearly ai doubt doing. the fatf’s consultation paper useful spell main element due diligence process, namely: • identify direct customer; • verify customer’s identity; • identify person beneficial ownership control, may different direct customer; • verify identity beneficial owner and/or person whose behalf transaction conducted; • conduct ongoing due diligence scrutiny. a number feature stand this. first, process know customer two-stage process - identification verification. second, clear obligation institution look behind corporate veil, nominee trustee ultimate beneficial owner. if necessary, mean follow chain ownership control natural person end chain. there obvious practical difficulty this, discus industry. but basic issue whether safe institution establish bank relationship really know dealing. the third point note due diligence process apply simply time relationship customer enter into. it must ongoing process use detection report mechanism pick large unusual transactions. the compliance officer appoint take overall charge institution’s anti-money launder effort play active role monitor process simply passive recipient ad hoc report front-line staff. it also follow ai must know customer also know customer’s business source fund flow account sufficient detail establish benchmark judge unusual transactions. this information need updated, appropriate, life account. high risk customer there certain basic amount check must do customers. but may pose high average risk money launder institution thus require enhance due diligence. ai therefore adopt risk-based approach, policy procedure identify high risk customers. we shall try offer ai guidance type risk factor look for. but basically factor sum term of: customer is; does; come business; account operated. judge benchmarks, possible example high-risk customer ai look-out for, include following: • politically expose person - individual hold important public position relate them. bank deal corrupt pep expose risk bad publicity, legal action possible financial loss; • type private bank customer - particularly jurisdiction risk money launder severe whose business make susceptible money laundering; • correspondent bank - particularly nccts high-risk jurisdiction doubt compliance fatf standards. specifically, ai beware 4 bi review 47/2002 so-called “shell banks”, operate without physical presence place incorporation; • corporate vehicle various type - include offshore company trust objective may disguise beneficial ownership. business introduce intermediary even risk-based approach, process identification verification onerous one. it natural therefore ai may wish rely due diligence procedure undertake intermediary introduce business them. however, experience show expose institution risk intermediary job properly. in particular, hong kong, number case secretarial company company formation agent open bank account behalf shell company without conduct proper verification underlie principals. there case company use vehicle bogus investment schemes. we write industry last year, basic message bear repeating. while permissible ai rely intermediary carry check identity potential customer source funds, ultimate responsibility still rest ai know customer customers’ business. intermediary therefore use ai satisfy apply due diligence standard procedure rigorous ai “fit proper”. it help respect intermediary regulate member reputable professional body. the ai monitor track record intermediary performance account introduces. all relevant identification data use intermediary verify customer’s identity submit review ai. this latter requirement currently mandate intermediary current guideline; need consider whether exception still appropriate. a issue relate treatment client account open solicitor accountants. at present, allow intermediary rely professional secrecy code reason disclose identity underlie principals. non-disclosure may acceptable case pool account fund hold intermediary co-mingled bank. but account open behalf single client, justification much le clear. again, area change may required. exist customer a i already mentioned, likely ai upgrade due diligence procedure respect comply change international standards. obviously, enhance procedure would apply new bank relationships. but beg question do relation exist customers. to extent institution go back undertake renew verification identity exist customers? our current view impose across board requirement respect, would certainly sensible review exist customer fall high risk categories. the six major bank uk announce undertake risk-based initiative type. i would encourage ai large customer base same. other trigger review exist record may arise customer undertake significant transaction material change account operation customer documentation standards. the way forward these some, mean all, current issue consider context revise guideline. we hope something ready consultation industry late year. while may impose new obligation ais, try ensure nature well-managed institution would adopt accord. after all, essence, amount sure really know customer. bi review 73/2002 1 bank japan’s december report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 18 december 2002 * * * the bank’s view2 japan’s economy stabilize

blattner: review swiss economy introductory remark prof dr niklaus blattner, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 13 december 2002. * * * in conduct monetary policy, swiss national bank (snb) must able rely healthy bank system. we consider efficient solvent bank counterparties. monetary policy implement effectively system make banks. furthermore, efficient solvent bank (including non-bank postfinance infrastructure settlement payment securities) maintain efficient secure payment transactions. the current bill comprehensive revision national bank law take realisation account. oversee payment security settlement system one central bank function spell law. what new, particular, explicit requirement national bank shall contribute stability financial system. by take organisational measures, already create good precondition fulfil expand mandate 2001. the law organisation move direction take central bank worldwide ever since increasingly identify stability financial system necessary precondition pursue effective monetary policy. in accordance revise law, close cooperation swiss federal bank commission (sfbc) expanded. the responsibility remain clearly delineated, however. the sfbc mainly responsible supervision bank institutions, national bank entrust oversee payment security settlement system promote stability financial system. our activity area focus analyse structures, behaviour result swiss bank system. up now, national bank know primarily bank statistics. furthermore, frequently conduct publish bank surveys. we increasingly turn attention analysis topical issues, include periodic analysis situation financial system. in doing, concentrate aspect relevant assess system stability. for reason, bank main focus. development insurance world jeopardise system stability indirectly most, e.g. case financial conglomerate. the situation swiss bank sector the swiss bank sector find hostile environment past months. there slowdown economic development. hope prompt recovery dampened. the number corporate bankruptcy increase substantially compare previous year. uncertainty surround company profit hit stock market full force. a elsewhere, swiss stock price drop significantly amid high volatility. while swiss market whole (spi) lose 22% begin year, spi bank index weaken 30% share index insurance company plummet much 47% (as 9 december 2002). what repercussion bank expose to? the weak economy result deterioration quality loan portfolios, collapse stock price adverse effect profits. bank suffer loss security portfolios. the stock market slump also impact earn commission services. lucrative service investment banking, connection ipo mergers, le le demand, reluctance part many investor – resultant low turnover – cut income commission business. in wake fall stock prices, profit asset management decline well. this part fee commission levy asset management value- performance-based. this year, big bank record profit setback area compare year-earlier quarters, case even considerable losses. this especially due poor result trade account decrease investment bank business (new issues, merger acquisitions). particularly insurance business account losses. in traditional bank business, notably retail banking, big bank record satisfactory results, however. the bi equity ratio disclose big bank clearly exceed require minimum. 2 bi review 73/2002 bank concentrate asset management struggle especially repercussion poor performance capital market costs, rise sharply last years. for bank primarily active interest-earning business, economic development play pivotal role. a already mentioned, due slowdown economic activity, deterioration loan quality resultant need high provision something business segment must reckon with. of 250 bank publish half-yearly results, two-thirds saw profit decline vis-à-vis first six month previous year. thirteen bank even post loss; remain banks, however, record rise profits. the aggregate profit 21% compare year-earlier period. despite regrettable case banque cantonale vaudoise, overall situation favourable far equity ratio concerned: bank continue meet capital adequacy requirements. the average capital ratio bank (excluding big banks, september) exceed regulatory minimum 79%. 98% bank report least 20% capital surplus. the overall picture characterise follows: swiss bank sector suffer uncertain economic prospect tense situation financial markets. many financial institution force take corrective action. measure take range cost cuts, streamline product line, decrease risk exposure, continue tighten risk liquidity management capital increase mergers. for part, measure implement without delay. plan cooperation logistical level connection raise capital become attractive well. it hoped, however, reluctance give often presume autonomy overcome sooner rather later. the idea bank «real bank» involve entire value chain much possible thing past. moreover, development depend heavily economic trend stabilisation financial markets. two thing merit particular mention: firstly, capital ratio swiss bank comfortable level overall, allow act position strength. secondly, bank switzerland mostly use prosperous year since end ninety bring lend business line risk reform liquidity risk management. under current difficult circumstances, effort pay off. in words, problem face swiss bank system solved. the bank switzerland necessary strength. structural change take place fast pace likely progress even quickly. the bank system may undergo radical changes, nevertheless stable. the role euro payment transaction a little le year ago, euro introduce european monetary union physical form. in summer 2001, run-up launch euro cash, national bank hold talk 100 swiss company association query expectation connection euro coin banknote well experience far euro deposit money. last summer, i.e. well half year introduction euro cash, national bank conduct another similar survey. the purpose second survey gather information first experience make new euro cash switzerland. the question focus euro mean payment tourism retail trade. in addition, export company question handle euro deposit money. in connection, national bank particularly interest prevalence euro bill currency well treatment foreign exchange risk. a expected, introduction euro cash lead sharp increase payment make foreign currencies. in majority business visit tourism sector retail trade, payment currently make euro approximately par one formerly make original european currencies. guest stay short period (overnight) pay euro frequently. the apply tourist unite state asia make short visit switzerland tour europe. the traditional european holidaymakers, however, continue change money swiss francs. bi review 73/2002 3 in practice, business apply current rate plus margin 2%-3% payment make euros. the majority business accept euro banknote return change swiss francs; minority also accept euro coins, give change euros. the management coin make difficult bank buy sell coins. all business query feel simplification bring replacement former european currency single currency positive. with regard euro deposit money, many export company switch bill euro relatively soon introduction single currency. consequently, practice become significantly prevalent recent past. invoice euro export destine euro zone widespread. producer niche luxury product exception. they continue bill swiss francs. euro-denominated receipt hedge exceptional case only; company still consider hedge financial market expensive. what widely practised, however, so-called “natural hedging”, mean receipt euro use settle suppliers' invoices: primary product raw material euro zone pay euros. swiss supplier increasingly request provide euro-denominated invoicing. it unclear extent inter-company payment switzerland effect euros. there agreement, however, payment increase compare last year's survey trend likely continue future. wage salary payment euro still issue. employee would accept wage salary payment euros. furthermore, practice would result substantial administrative complication (social security deduction tax swiss francs). the selective use euro place swiss franc create difficulty regard monetary policy. on one hand, bulk payment switzerland probably continue effect swiss franc also future. on hand, current monetary policy strategy, possible euro-induced decline demand money lead problem either. contrary previous policy target money supply, steer interest rate national bank pursue today dependent stable demand money. the national bank realises, however, that, invoice euro become widespread, export industry must bear high exchange rate risks. bi review 73/2002 1 jean-pierre roth: review swiss economy introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 13 december 2002. * * * the national bank decide leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.25%–1.25%. for time being, three-month libor keep middle target range. owe low level inflation, able ease monetary policy substantially since march 2001, since low target range three-month libor total 2.75 percentage points. we take decisive step response decline economic growth upward trend swiss franc. interest rate last low 26 july year. the imponderable respect development global economy remain considerable, sustain economic upswing switzerland likely time second half 2003. we therefore maintain expansionary monetary policy shall keep attractiveness swiss franc investment low. this jeopardise price stability. assume three-month libor rate remain stable 0.75%, average annual inflation expect lie 0.7% 1.6% next three years. for 2003, anticipate economic growth 1%, zero growth expect current year. economic activity in switzerland, economic activity stabilise somewhat last two quarter despite delay global economic upswing. after decline four quarters, gdp slightly exceed previous period's level second third quarter 2002. positive stimulus emanate development export consumption. nevertheless, economic situation switzerland remain tight. the deterioration labour market fall stock market price depress consumer sentiment available income. incoming order order backlog export sector remain unsatisfactory level, sign recovery export still uncertain. capacity utilisation manufacture construction continue fall short desire level, corporate investment activity currently low ebb. the present growth slump switzerland overcome export equipment investment increase consistently. we expect export grow markedly line international economic upswing second half 2003. equipment investment follow slight time lag. until middle next year, however, swiss economy likely grow moderately. until then, unemployment could therefore continue rise. private consumption, long mainstay economic activity, pick slowly next year. real economic activity increase 1% 2003, year expect zero growth. inflation forecast i shall turn course inflation new inflation forecast. our inflation forecast june 2002 (the green dash-dotted curve graph) show time assumed, base stable three-month libor rate 1.25%, inflation would gradually rise 1.9% first quarter 2005. year-on-year inflation, measure national consumer price index, drop 0.3% third quarter 2002 0.7% second quarter. in october november rise approximately 1%. these fluctuation due mainly change exact point time data clearance sale price collected. this also main reason forecast june 2002 over-estimated development inflation third quarter 2002. our new inflation forecast (red dash curve) base assumption growth u pick second quarter 2003 onward. the u economy likely achieve growth potential stepwise begin 2004. in eu, upswing take little longer. we expect significant acceleration growth end 2003. we assume 2 bi review 73/2002 dollar/euro rate remain current level oil price around $25 per barrel. on assumption three-month libor rate remain stable 0.75% next three years, inflation average 0.7% 2003, move 0.9% 2004 reach 1.6% 2005. forecast inflation remain 1% end 2004 except fourth quarter 2002. in course 2005, however, mark acceleration set in, forecast inflation reach 2% mark fourth quarter 2005. the new forecast consistently june 2002. it reflect delay economic upswing. in new forecast, inflation rise markedly end forecast horizon due even expansionary monetary policy since june. expansionary monetary policy continue at last medium conference, i point national bank must prepare react quickly change economic situation. when delay economic recovery become discernible summer, act immediately low interest rates. since then, nothing basic significance change assessment situation. we shall adhere expansionary monetary policy foreseeable future. we thus contribute economic rebound continue keep swiss franc investment unattractive. the low interest rate level relatively strong growth monetary aggregate currently represent threat price stability. once sustain economic recovery become discernible, shall review monetary policy adjust new circumstances. there still sign, however, time approaching. on contrary, risk still point downward. should recovery u europe delay swiss franc appreciate markedly, expect upswing switzerland would threatened. in case, national bank ready react appropriate means. under present conditions, however, monetary policy sufficiently expansionary. currently, risk deflation widely discussed. a see forecast, risk likely negligible switzerland medium term. certainly, short term always possible special effects, e.g. mark reduction oil price, lead negative inflation rate individual quarters. nevertheless, consider continuously fall price level conjunction strong decline demand good production improbable present circumstances. our expansionary monetary policy flexibility swiss economy would prevent development. in present situation, however, effort need besides expansionary monetary policy order maintain enhance attractiveness switzerland industrial business centre. the effort aim liberalisation domestic economy may abandoned. sector suffer structural problem must improve competitiveness mean consistent adjustments. our experience monetary policy concept let briefly describe experience gain monetary policy concept. we introduce concept exactly three year ago. you acquaint main elements:

start think price financial stability paper friedrich a. lutz “the basic problem monetary constitution”, first publish early 1936. it start point observation money credit essentially two side coin money result bank lending. on credit side, competition bank ensure optimal allocation resources. on money side, however, competition could lead excessive creation money hence inflation instability financial system. a consequence, money best control monopolist, credit best grant compete banks. the key idea lutz paper still interest today, explicitly recognize link price stability financial stability. a lutz emphasized, two different principle order side balance sheet bank system appear problem normal times. in period crisis, however, problem appears. to quote lutz more: state guarantee deposit bailouts nationalize bank liabilities, keep asset side competition. to put today’s words: the result considerable moral hazard. lutz‘s insight may surprise give write aftermath severe bank crisis germany u early 1930s. it perhaps surprise discussion seem somewhat forget afterwards. a recently early 1990s, conventional wisdom appear “keep price stable minimize danger financial crisis”. after several financial crises, particular japanese experience mind, would subscribe view. we learn movement general price level matter, also movement specific class prices, namely asset prices. the example japan show price stability late 1980s sufficient ensure financial stability decade followed. conversely, financial instability lead price instability, particular deflation. financial stability therefore essential condition successful monetary policy. any central bank want take price stability mandate seriously also need direct interest financial stability. we therefore interest develop tool help u ensure stability financial market financial institutions. without financial stability, price stability cannot guaranteed. still focus banks’ balance sheet i would like add money creation process asset side bank dampen even endanger high volume non-performing loans. that’s learn japanese experience. and experience eurosystem make clear strong expansion monetary aggregate necessarily result high increase bank lending. a large increase money supply may reflect low monetary capital formation, heavily dependent expectation financial markets. 2 bi review 72/2002 thus take account fact financial system become much complex. in germany, essentially two effects. first, role size financial market grow dramatically, provide new source finance investment opportunities. although bank remain centre financial system, much dependent financial market condition past. second, financial system far closely integrate rest world use be. on one hand, provide profit opportunity permit ample diversification risk. on hand, make u sensitive shock abroad. against background, i believe worthwhile expand basic problem monetary constitution describe lutz. whereas concentrate bank balance sheet pay special regard ever increase importance financial markets. there might conflict interplay market force financial market one hand, financial stability other, could clash competition bank lend monetary stability. the past teach u important adopt fairly broad approach develop tool protect stability financial system. in particular, cannot discus topic without look institutional framework. institution matter. any discussion ignore little use real world. two issue important. the first is, design individual institution, second relationship different institutions. let focus second issues. the classical view relationship institution let institution concentrate task. for example, price stability would fall responsibility central bank, stability financial system would task another government agency. separate tasks, argued, make institution accountable help limit agency problems. while much merit view, become aware task often cannot separate clearly. let u recall example central bank financial supervision. under certain circumstances, may short-term conflict interest price stability financial stability. in cases, low inflation may call cut interest rates, financial imbalance may warrant rate hike. what central bank do? if take idea separate responsibility extreme, central bank simply cut interest rate forget impact financial system, protection would regulator’s job. few would consider policy optimal. the reason conflict price stability financial stability necessarily agency problem. instead, may face short-term trade-off price stability financial stability. strictly separate two task could thus lead bad outcome coordinate task institutions. most non-europeans would stop here. in europe, consider additional factor: geographical dimension. different institution subject different jurisdictions. for example, prudential supervision national level, monetary policy emu-12 level, regulatory framework within supervision monetary policy take place eu-15 level. let turn relationship monetary fiscal policy. it long ago interest rate many country set finance ministry. one reason behind combine monetary fiscal policy decision single institution idea would result good policy mix. today, contrast, virtually central bank develop world independent, hard think country treasury decide level interest rates. the last two decade witness enormous paradigm change role central bank monetary policy. what reason behind paradigm shift? a key insight expectation-augmented phillips curve. it say monetary authority may incentive trigger boom relax monetary policy. however, cannot surprise agent often. they soon learn anticipate expansionary bias adjust behaviour accordingly. the result high inflation expansion. the way time-inconsistency trap install “conservative” central banker set interest rate independently. bi review 72/2002 3 central bank independence reduce time-consistency problem, cannot prevent possibility monetary policy may dominate unsustainable fiscal policy thus ineffective. this first show “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” sargent wallace 1970s and, recently, “fiscal theory price level”. at emu-level, relationship monetary policy fiscal policy become even complex. there one monetary policy whole euro area, yet many fiscal policy countries. a consequence, addition problem possible fiscal dominance, free-rider problem possible country reap benefit bear cost unsustainable fiscal expansion. this show quickly geographical dimension turn political dimension, important implication sovereignty. the stability growth pact mechanism design mitigate problem thus important part monetary constitution. let conclude say monetary stability consist price stability financial stability. from perspective two-pillar approach ecb provide excellent analytical framework. it allow ecb integrate asset price indicator variable second pillar. the ecb’s approach also allow analyse aspect financial stability within broad framework first pillar. a financial instability often create credit expansion rapid, pay particular attention counterpart money supply. that lutz tell u many year ago. and that’s one reason i support first pillar. in view, macro prudential element first pillar emphasize case past. bi review 72/2002 1 bodil nyboe andersen: recent financial economic development denmark speech mr bodil nyboe andersen, governor national bank denmark, annual meet association danish bankers’ association, copenhagen, 4 december 2002. * * * virtually every report article international economic development nowadays start describe unusually high degree uncertainty. not expect upswing defer another year, also become common hear expression concern economy's course usa europe. the term recession, depression deflation make frequent appearance headlines, often use interchangeably describe fact thing go well accustom 2000. economist apply three term describe different concepts: • recession least serious situation. a rule thumb say drop output two quarter run “technical recession”. in usa, national bureau economic research operate sophisticate definition recession, base development number macroeconomic time series. accord definition, bureau note year ago usa go recession march 2001. whether recession persistent cease reveal figure revise closely analysed, timelag many months, perhaps one year. • depression prolong period abnormally low growth high unemployment. so far serious situation recession. the term depression use particular describe persistent economic crisis 1930s. • deflation signify drop general price level, i.e. opposite inflation. a situation fall price dangerous, since tend self-reinforcing tendency. if sustain price drop expected, purchase investment postponed, deepen crisis. the confusion regard term exacerbate fact “deflationary” sometimes use merely describe tendency economy dampen. low growth necessarily major problem, however. after strong growth pressure labour market, calm period healthy. the challenge country experience strong growth relate reduction unemployment around millennium rollover. for many years, japan's economic development alarmingly poor, state close depression. moreover, japan also experience deflation, i.e. fall prices. japan's economic problem appear hard solve apply traditional economic-policy instruments. in europe, german economic development particular give grind concern. although remain europe's economic locomotive many decades, since mid-1990s germany experience moderate growth high unemployment. the international economic slowdown amplify problems. at time, germany face situation large budget deficit impede active fiscal policy counter development. even automatic budget reaction face dampen create problem germany's compliance budgetary requirements. what denmark? do recession, depression deflation? in fact none them. denmark reach high growth rate end 1990s. we experience moderate economic growth, employment situation extremely favourable; fact labour market pressure. this situation change significantly. 2 bi review 72/2002 the figure far available indicate denmark's economic situation robust, economic growth. the growth sufficient stabilise unemployment level low european standards. thus, far international economic slowdown present noticeable problem denmark. the economic slowdown generate debate within eu regard stability growth pact. it criticise inflexibility view maximum permit budget deficit 3 per cent gdp. however, limit one element pact. in order stay right side 3 per cent, member state commit respect medium-term budgetary objective position close balance surplus. in year favourable cyclical development, must sound budget surplus. this lend flexibility, i.e. “leeway”, business cycle weakens, automatic stabiliser come play. however, deficit good year already high, margin draw economy weakens. in situation, limit 3 per cent reach quickly. the fundamental idea behind pact therefore good year create room manoeuvre via strong budgetary situation. in case too, denmark actually good example. for number years, denmark's fiscal policy contribute create robust situation government finances. both previous present government maintain sound fiscal policy satisfactory budget surplus. if denmark's cyclical development also weakens, unemployment rises, budget deteriorate automatic stabiliser set in. low fiscal revenue high expenditure unemployment benefit classical example budgetary reactions. even effect rather strong denmark, underlie favourable budget situation accommodate impact. it important maintain room manoeuvre, therefore scope fiscal-policy relaxation. danmark nationalbank continuously emphasise importance firm consistent fiscal policy. this policy vital credibility maintain fixed-exchange-rate policy broad consensus denmark. over years, many country force abandon fixed-exchange-rate policy due speculation currency. but virtually every case speculation arise due country's lack ability adhere “rules game” fixed-exchange-rate policy. these rule impose requirement design monetary policy, also fiscal policy. for many years, denmark's observation grind rule firmly agree government danmark nationalbank. today, fixed-exchange-rate policy much embed economic policy actually long basis discussion. there broad agreement policy serve u well, rather chaotic foreign-exchange policy 1970s experience many year firm stable economic development. up 1 january 1999, denmark part ems, together large number eu member states. our monetary foreign-exchange policy adhere european standard, speak. however, member state part old em introduce euro, one out-countries participate erm ii. even though policy unchanged late 1990s, long internationally well-known model. therefore provide information goal mean monetary foreign-exchange policy. we cannot refer model. in principle, fixed-exchange-rate policy easy explain. currency trade twenty four hour day, anybody see time whether exchange rate match target set, econometric model need see whether thing track. danmark nationalbank's aim ensure krone's rate euro stabilise close central rate within erm ii, exchange rate sole basis monetary-policy deliberations. among market player degree uncertainty concern exact size decimal danmark nationalbank consider acceptable fluctuation. the bank often demand precise details. however, something prepare give. an exact description final bi review 72/2002 3 decimal place would eliminate basis currency market krone euro function real market, opportunity profit risk losses. in case, danmark nationalbank would quite simply take market's function. our effort design ensure fluctuation moderate ordinary business enterprise - contrast foreign-exchange dealer - long even need considered. our instrument also well-known: intervention currency market adjustment danmark nationalbank's interest rates. although market great extent stabilise exchange rate danmark nationalbank intervene currency market necessary, occasion often considerable amounts. danmark nationalbank's interest-rate policy fundamentally “shadow” interest rate european central bank. this mean raise low discount lend rate line ecb. in addition, adjust interest-rate spread ecb light foreign-exchange situation. we take account krone's position vis-à-vis euro, whether sustain inflow outflow foreign exchange. these adjustment take place concurrently adjustment ecb's interest rate, times. however, actual decision take basis information available concern currency market particular time. there never automatic reaction. during past year, great interest place fund kroner, mostly purchase currency. the foreign-exchange reserve therefore increase around kr. 50 billion. it also possible reduce interest-rate spread relation euro interest rate, low 20 basis points. when capital flow reverse point future, course also prepare sell currency. those familiar operation doubt danmark nationalbank's currency defence extremely resolute term intervention widen interest-rate differential. danmark nationalbank must continually monitor krone's position market, decision-making structure must design decision intervention adjustment interest rate take time. danmark nationalbank flexibility require able act immediately. in recent years, many central bank introduce fix publish date monetary-policy decisions, fixed-exchange-rate policy compatible fix decision-making dates. a central aspect measure take immediately halt inappropriate exchange-rate movement order prevent crisis emerging. the situation currency market quickly change. when conduct fixed-exchange-rate policy, therefore advisable prepare market forthcoming change interest-rate differential, practise many central bank monetary-policy objectives. furthermore, take view party market must access information, time, danmark nationalbank. danmark nationalbank's monetary-policy announcement thus publish great precision via several channel simultaneously. no hint give certain group capable interpret messages. danmark nationalbank therefore never comment forthcoming changes, even though frequently ask question respect. at technical level, ensure market participant receive information expect development liquidity. on monthly basis, danmark nationalbank publish estimate expect day-to-day movement banks' overall liquidity, time release information expect date danmark nationalbank's sale purchase certificate deposit. additional information development liquidity publish daily basis, give market participant good opportunity prepare positions, subsequently analyse developments. on basis, normally great uncertainty concern scale danmark nationalbank's intervention foreign-exchange market. openness transparency generally give high priority modern society. for monetary policy also mean achieve credibility essential central bank 4 bi review 72/2002 implement choose policy. however, must allow overshadow fact safe path credibility long period fulfil promise one makes, put bluntly: practise preached. bi review 72/2002 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, press conference hold frankfurt, 5 december 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. we continue in-depth assessment monetary, financial economic development discussion early november appropriate stance monetary policy, take account new information. overall, since last meeting, argument favour cut key ecb interest rate strengthened. the evidence inflationary pressure ease increased, owe particular sluggish economic expansion. furthermore, downside risk economic growth vanished. a result, govern council decide low key ecb interest rate 50 basis points. at today's meeting, also review reference value monetary growth, important role first pillar ecb's monetary policy strategy. the govern council decide leave current value unchanged annual growth rate 4½% broad aggregate m3. this decision take grind evidence continue support assumption form basis derivation reference value since 1999, namely relate trend potential output growth 2-2½% per annum trend decline m3 income velocity ½-1% per annum euro area. we issue separate press release afternoon explain great detail background decision. when compare current development reference value, important remember reference value medium-term concept. short-term movement m3 necessarily implication future price developments. moreover, deviation m3 reference value must analyse conjunction real financial indicator order understand implication price stability. turn recent data, period august october 2002 three-month average annual growth rate m3 7.1%, unchanged previous three-month average. m3 growth influence considerably portfolio re-allocations environment general uncertainty particularly stress financial markets. at time, also reflect low level interest rate euro area make hold liquid asset relatively attractive. there ample liquidity euro area. however, light sluggish economic growth, unlikely excess liquidity translate inflationary pressure near future. the recent moderation growth loan private sector, particularly non-financial corporations, support assessment. turn second pillar, recent information strengthen evidence decline inflationary pressure. the sluggishness real gdp growth euro area confirm yesterday eurostat's first estimate, indicate quarter-on-quarter growth 0.3% third quarter. this towards low end expectations. recent euro area-wide survey data suggest overall sentiment economy remain lacklustre, business confidence improve somewhat consumer confidence fall further. it expected, therefore, economic growth also remain subdue come months. this disappoint picture mainly reflect persistently high degree uncertainty. geopolitical tension potential consequence oil prices, development financial markets, sluggish growth world economy persistence global imbalance factor weigh adversely confidence. these factor also negative effect euro area consumption, investment labour markets. a hard predict uncertainty start abate, must take account medium-term outlook growth. the subdue economic activity limit potential upward risk price stability help ease inflationary pressure. let elaborate this. 2 bi review 72/2002 first, look back, recognise inflation rather persistent despite economic slowdown. this persistence partly reflect series transitory developments, indirect effect previous oil food price increase limit changeover effect. however, structural factor labour product market also play role, mirrored, particular, upward trend wage development observe recently. this trend show sign stabilisation. service price inflation also remain stubbornly high. indeed, structural rigidity impede appropriate adjustment wage prices. a result, annual inflation rate remain 2% 2002, include november, confirm eurostat's flash estimate, indicate annual hicp inflation rate 2.2%. second, look forward early part 2003, although recent development oil price low short-term price pressures, still factor could keep annual inflation rate 2% several month come. yet short-term outlook relate base effect indirect tax administer prices, i.e. temporary developments. third, look beyond short term, consider overall economic environment euro exchange rate, strengthen since early year, contribute towards reduce inflationary pressure. moreover, expect indirect effect previous increase oil price factor unwind. although wage-related risk remain place, judge le likely materialise long economic environment change substantially. the assessment guide today's monetary policy decision that, overall, prospect strengthen inflation fall 2% course 2003 remain line price stability thereafter. our decision also help improve outlook euro area economy provide counterweight exist downside risk economic growth, thereby support confidence. the likely scenario economic growth gradually recover course 2003 towards rate line potential. fall inflation support real disposable income and, together reduction gap perceive actual inflation rates, underpin private consumption. moreover, expect improvement world demand. this, low level interest rates, benefit investment. let point that, today's decision, key ecb interest rate reach low level historical standards. the govern council continue monitor closely factor may affect prospect inflation euro area. the outlook euro area economy also much depend visible progress policy areas. regard fiscal policy euro area, i would like reiterate budgetary discipline strengthen condition sustainable growth gdp employment. therefore, sound fiscal positions, enshrine treaty develop stability growth pact, interest member states. give disappoint fiscal development country challenge emerge eu fiscal framework, welcome move correct prevent excessive deficits, i.e. implementation excessive deficit procedure case germany portugal early warn issue france. country remain imbalance urge prepare sufficiently ambitious consolidation plan forthcoming stability programmes. emphasis place growth-oriented consolidation policy strengthen productive force economy. the govern council consider recent commission communication good start point rebuild confidence budgetary framework. a already reflect statement stability growth pact 24 october 2002, fully support commission's main objective, namely improve implementation pact within exist framework rules. finally, i like stress still urgent need implement decisively structural reform agenda. we note concern slow progress many euro area country call government take determine action. the medium-term impact reform economic growth potential euro area likely substantial. a prompt implementation structural reform labour, product financial market particularly important juncture since would contribute strengthen confidence euro area, thereby also support economic activity short term. we disposal questions. bi review 72/2002 1 the rt hon sir edward george: change financial service industry speech the rt hon sir edward george, governor bank england, 16th european finance convention, london, 6 december 2002. * * * mr chairman, lady gentlemen. may i begin congratulate you, claudio - colleague - organise remarkable 16th european finance convention london, spread past five days. i think i've ever see distinguish comprehensive list speaker - range politicians, central banker financial regulator representative international financial institutions, well representative private sectoral specialist financial service trade association expert commercial company - assemble one program. i gather attendance might week. but perhaps that's surprising: anyone stamen attend even half proceed certainly chronic insomniac. but reward know everything know recent development current state financial service industry might evolve. and still listen me! but despair - last lap - i'll try keep short! you certainly great deal discuss. the financial service industry - globally regionally within europe nationally - go prolong continue period unprecedented change. there mind two main driver change - first, progressive shift - within industrial world increasingly also past decade emerge market transition economy - away vary degree centralise economic administration towards increasingly open, market-based approach; - and, secondly, revolution information communication technology. the potential economic advantage free market competition nationally, logical counterpart free trade free movement capital internationally pretty well take grant everywhere. while no-one would pretend perfect guide, profitability best guide allocate limit real financial resource wherever productively used. so - potentially - effective mean generate wealth, employment rise live standard want see. and liberalisation deregulation - include liberalisation financial sector - need see context. of course cannot mean simply free-for-all. market need fair well free function efficiently practice - need rule minimise artificial non-commercial distortion relate resource misallocation would otherwise arise. and need rule reflect public policy concerns, relate particularly case financial market systemic stability, consumer protection fair competition. i come back that. the second main driver change financial service industry particular is, i say, ict revolution, make possible new financial instrument investment strategies, new mean measuring, monitor manage risk new - cheap - delivery, trade settlement mechanism on, facilitate great competition great efficiency need. these global influence course work within europe, like everywhere else. but change europe particular drive also two europe-specific factor - single european market program, essentially advanced, regional, form broad international shift towards free trade freedom capital movement; - introduction euro, which, eliminate currency risk participate countries, make substantial contribution increase depth liquidity european financial markets, include (small-e) euro market london. these four key element provide context ongoing current debate best promote single, integrated, european financial market - i mean “we” authorities, 2 bi review 72/2002 interest macro-economic efficiency market, also market participant themselves, stand benefit micro-economic level new opportunity provide. but i move question perhaps i might go may seem something tangent, reflect briefly upon experience uk move - fit start certainly general direction - heavily administer economic financial system one much market based. even i start bank 40 year ago post-war control largely dismantled. but economic financial system still govern kind direct control - exchange controls, credit ceiling - couple directional guidance, business restriction - activity build society example, queue equity issuance, price income policies, public ownership large part industry, - gone. it's true plenty regulation remain - reflect public policy concern relate essentially competition, consumer protection systemic stability. indeed intensify areas. it's hard imagine formal bank supervision country twenty year ago. but part regulation today tell u cannot do, rather set criterion must meet, behavioural standard expect observe, whatever choose do. it leaf much room consumer producer choice, include producer overseas, much room, incentive, therefore competition innovation. and, le prescriptive, permissive, environment, new technology bring massive change trade instruments, way market operate organise payments, settlement delivery arrangement on, which, without occasional problems, overwhelmingly balance bring massive benefit term market efficiency. in reflect whole process uk, number characteristic general approach i think important. the first relate extent market-driven. no attempt make far i aware - certainly bank - tell market player individually organise collectively. of course follow get closely, always stand ready help call upon market so, occasionally were, intervene initiative ensure public interest properly respected. for part take view market participant know good work won't; salary job line. where public policy issue involved, establish tradition extensive consultation right across relevant section market - tradition fsa certainly maintained. in uk's relatively well-developed market - particularly wholesale market - recognise early intervention judge necessary - interest market transparency prudential behavioural conduct example - need inform properly understand subtlety market reduce risk unforeseen consequence could either frustrate purpose intervention unnecessarily obstruct market innovation. in instance approach, i suppose might describe market-sensitive, involve encourage market address particular issue question preferable alternative official action. i think takeover panel, example, work people like adrian cadbury - auspex stock exchange - develop corporate governance standards, professional organisation set police accountancy rules. a similar approach follow relation many commercial bank issue - approve code conduct relation deal customer accompany ombudsman scheme. we country sensitive need distinguish different aspect financial market activity - obviously case distinction wholesale retail activity - try find appropriate way reflect legitimate public concerns. where official intervention, has, well-established tradition, seek avoid discrimination - whether different type financial institution form protective nationalism favour british-owned businesses, provide everyone undertake particular activity play rules. that approach necessarily always popular, i say, might benefit discrimination! but certainly one reason london's attraction international financial centre include attraction many financial company elsewhere europe. and international presence turn contribute enormously efficiency london market - indeed european market much part. bi review 72/2002 3 chairman, i could go reflect experience - i'm conscious weekend beckon - relevant question relate development single financial market across europe. the potential benefit integration i take granted. the continue debate - give start different position different tradition different public policy priorities, get there. it may well continuous public pressure high high standard financial market everywhere lead great official intervention way. but integration always bind involve intervention eu member state move towards degree harmonisation standards, require legal agreement european level reflect national legislation. and great deal progress has, course, already make direction financial service action plan due principle complete 2005. but everyone accept great deal remain do - context integration agenda - fact bind ongoing process market evolve new issue arise. in context recent agreement alexandre lamfalussy's proposal fast track procedure security market generally welcomed. but on-going debate extend beyond precisely want get to. at one extreme - i exaggerate make point - appear vision maximum harmonisation across eu, uniform regulation centralise oversight point future, whereas others lean towards harmonisation extent demonstrably necessary, mutual recognition, eu-wide passport base primarily removal barrier cross-border activity. of course approach leaf plenty room debate exactly “demonstrably necessary” means. underlie debate level legitimate difference priority different public policy concern - much weight put upon consumer protection systemic stability free competition, example, necessarily easy resolve even national level. and may - possibly - also be, le legitimate, differ perception national self interest. the truth easy answers, i think bind move forward pragmatic, incremental, way - recognise different consideration apply different area market rather basis grand design. in context, i actually rather encourage recent discussion paper put eurofi wick group, stand back little immediate issue look way forward broad - longer-term - perspective. they seem quite lot common term immediate priorities, although important difference term may ultimately end up. i welcome particular share emphasis involve practitioner consultation way forward every stage - indeed might make progress procedure generally adopt hitherto. i welcome also emphasis eurofi paper evolution - implicit wick - i le sure eurofi presumption point necessary inevitable progression towards eventual centralisation. but, whatever one's view particular suggestion proposal two paper really important thing issue raise debate discuss - market participant well relevant authorities. and that's i think conference kind important, chairman. i much hope follow convention important issue raise continue explore various trade association professional organisation represent here, make voice hear council europe way forward, indeed traditionally context develop market uk. i every confidence will. i'm grateful give opportunity join afternoon i wish european single market financial service every success. bi review 71/2002 1 hermann remsperger: germany crossroad speech professor hermann remsperger, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, nomura annual euro conference, tokyo, 26 november 2002. * * * lady gentleman news tone comment economic situation germany get considerably bad past weeks. take, example, weekend edition well respect newspaper 16 november. one view express – i quote, “in germany, nothing go right. the government box inability use monetary, fiscal exchange rate policy boost demand. fear grow germany go way japan, suffer 10 year stagnation. the danger that, like japan, would prefer muddle take tough policy decisions. germany see stricken giant, sick man europe.” such comment soon give rise notion germany edge deflation. to say straight out: view i share. i recognise large number problem exist germany, i perceive deflation. in words, i expect general price level germany decline long-term basis gdp shrink extend period. we bundesbank forecast continue low rate inflation moderate increase gdp germany come year. while price outlook gratifying, prospect growth rather disappointing. i shall return outlook subject deflation minutes’ time. my simple proposition outlook germany depend first foremost cop exist challenge economic policy. in order gain good understand this, however, first take look back. a look back take look back reveal that, since reunification boom petered out, germany one group country weak growth. while gdp present emu country rise total 15% since 1995, correspond figure germany 10%. in line this, annual average rate growth germany, 1½%, lag ¾ percentage point behind. compare germany euro area whole exclude germany, german shortfall growth increase 1 percentage point. in 2001, take own, figure much 1½ percentage points. in view, temporary long-term factor contribute germany's relatively poor performance euro area. a far temporary factor concerned, remember that, already run-up stage three european monetary union, interest rate fall sharply number eu country previously fairly high short long-term rate interest. for example, interest rate long-term government bond italy spain, even 1995, 5 6 percentage point high rate german federal bonds. a home former anchor currency erm, germany benefit directly process interest rate convergence. another cause relatively weak growth germany crisis construction industry, especially eastern germany. in sector, capacity build immediately reunification exceed longer-term ability real estate market absorb it. reduce construction activity depress german economic growth. without decline investment construction since mid-1990s, shortfall german growth compare euro area whole would therefore great. by contrast, construction activity european country remain important mainstay economic growth. 2 bi review 71/2002 consideration also give fact live standard monetary union still disparate. since poor country suppose catch emu average, go grow strongly country already achieve high level income. one important – important continue – reason inadequate pace economic growth germany heavy burden tax social security contributions. add strict regulation part economy. above all, little labour market flexibility germany. in period cyclical downswing, rise unemployment germany far sharp fall period upturn. for instance, number people work western germany rise cyclical low point 1991 1997 1.3 million around 2.5 million. by 2001, number unemployed reduce half million. in germany, incentive take employment restrict high-level marginal burden impose tax public levies. most type household germany marginal burden tax levy 50% more. in words, every additional euro earned, around 50 cent deducted. moreover, social benefit high level international standard act reservation wage. many expert agree demand labour germany also suffer complex legal arrangement relate work contracts. company cautious recruit labour difficult make redundancies. a may know, german parliament adopt labour market reform day ago. it main focus efficient placement unemployed person job increase temporary employment personnel service agencies. these initial step towards reform labour market are, generally, welcomed. however, danger regular job replace subsidise ones. if labour involve great extent production process, difficult germany achieve sustain high level growth again. an environment conducive growth, however, also include fiscal policy lead low tax burden. budgetary consolidation policy in current year, germany considerably exceed 3% limit deficit ratio 60% debt ratio. now, federal government promise package measure design reverse rapid deficit increase go back 3% limit come year. the volume package amount around ¾% gdp come year. in year that, envisage volume go well 1% gdp. make final judgement structure consolidation package difficult. the propose measure could still undergo change course legislative process. i therefore wish make somewhat general assessment point. the measure package include reduction labour-market-related spend tax changes. in view, initiative expenditure side head right direction. through low government spending, design reduce burden levy impede growth germany. cut subsidy labour-market-induced spend especially conducive improve condition growth medium term. while spend cut measure increase revenue intend balance come year, distinctly great role initiative increase revenue envisage year follow. in principle, true broaden tax basis abolish tax exemption indeed part successful consolidation policy. however, sense fundamental simplification taxation – call germany – thoroughgoing reform would desirable. this could also embed mark low tax rates. what more: tax initiative german government matter abolish exemptions. they also include interference regulation quite justify taxation point bi review 71/2002 3 view. for example: restrict possibility offset loss would end correct symmetrical treatment profit loss tax system. this would make investment project le attractive – especially associate high risk strongly fluctuate earn expectations. a i see it, set specific detail individual tax measures, particular attention pay impact corporate investment – something especially important medium-term growth. another point consider policy enhance attractiveness private old-age provision germany financial centre – disrupt rise tax burden. besides reduction deficit ratio, also important lose sight low overall burden tax social security contributions. above all, high rise social security contribution represent significant obstacle employment growth. the comprehensive review government activity state benefit need include social security sector too. in context, tax reform adopt two year ago bring relief. the tax retain profit low 40% 30%. the top income tax rate come 42% 2005. and progress germany field old-age pension provisions. the pension reform, adopt last year, pursue two objective simultaneously. first, payment state pay-as-you-go scheme cut back and, second, private pension provision strengthened. pension increase next year remain level increase wage salaries. macroeconomic assessment outlook lady gentlemen, cyclical worry global economy well germany undoubtedly increase course year. since spring, economic climate germany become cool again. the slump stock market price rise cost oil play major part that. that development reinforce high wage settlement year’s pay round. we germany thus clearly difficult economic situation. the current slight improvement still fragile. that improvement due primarily external stimulus influence inventories. the “cyclical breakthrough” therefore achieve yet. in cyclical terms, still initial phase improvement could quickly put risk again. even so, economy grow somewhat first three quarter year. thank order abroad, export make major contribution growth. owe increase number car sales, private consumption assist growth. in contrast this, fix capital formation still put firm brake growth. that apply build also machinery equipment. although capacity utilization pick somewhat low start year, continue significantly normal level capacity utilisation. add problem corporate sector finance condition which, whole, become difficult. in corporate sector great uncertainty future profits. if one look – way example – enterprise list stock market, analyst make considerable downward revision medium-term growth forecast corporate profits. but even down-revised assessment remain base expectation distinct recovery profits. the labour market come even heavily pressure since summer. it le le case redundancy manufacture construction sector offset positive development services. economic activity still weak relieve labour market. take together data currently available, economy whole cannot expect improve immediate future. the rate gdp growth 2002 ½%. a thing appear present, outlook 2003 is, fact, somewhat good overall. but many forecast point downside risks. 4 bi review 71/2002 there might cause optimism return great stability stock market oil price settle present level. that would mean risk premia financial market could go back normal again. that would allow favourable underlie monetary condition come operation. finally, might hope pass phenomenon “perceived” inflation. admittedly, great deal momentum expect cite factors. the underlie pace economic growth remain subdue first half next year. when export gain momentum negative confidence effect investment consumption peter out, upturn second half 2003 onwards somewhat strong broadly based. however, give high degree uncertainty unused capacity, expect improvement investment activity near future. we believe investment activity take turn good second half next year. experience investment behaviour past may indication pick-up investment machinery equipment modest. a regard investment construction, lead indicator show downward adjustment process come end likely continue near future. a i say beginning, outlook inflation much good outlook growth. but i turn price-side german economy, i would like conclude remark real side economy sentence germany’s export performance. real world market share germany recently, repeat reference sharp decline german world market share since begin 1990s, regard indicate germany’s lack competitiveness. indeed, development world market share may mislead – conventionally calculate basis nominal foreign trade value national currencies, convert current exchange rate u dollar - whenever significant exchange rate movement dollar. thus, depreciation euro u dollar, consider isolation, necessarily result fall germany's world market shares, even real market share actually remain constant. to avoid distortion seem reasonable calculate real world market shares, definition adjust change inflation differential exchange rates. in contrast nominal world market shares, germany’s real share show significant increase since mid-1990s. germany’s share global export rise 9 % 1995 10 % end 2001 thereby regain position hold early 1990s. this upturn reflects, particular, improve price competitiveness germany’s industry. germany's retrieval former position world market since mid-1990s become even clear country's export performance consider relation industrial country therefore account take fact industrial country whole lose market share emerge markets. if view context, german share real export industrial country increase 2½ percentage point since 1995. at 16%, germany's share exceed recently even old record level late 80s. the debate deflation in probability, german inflation rate remain low level next year too. germany among country low inflation rate euro area. such development german consumer price often interpreted, itself, signify risk deflation. some analyst already detect condition germany similar japan. in contrast that, i see low inflation rate advantage cyclical recovery. price stability bolster households’ disposable income. that important since burden tax social security contribution household set increase noticeably next year. bi review 71/2002 5 furthermore, labour market overshadow slow economic growth time come yet. so far, germany sign price-expectation-induced restraint private consumption. exactly view germany’s long-standing stability culture, idea expectation high inflation rate growth-enhancing effect seem unrealistic anyway. in term labour cost well, grind germany deflationary spiral – words, general long last price slump combine self-perpetuating recessionary pressure. this year’s pay round exhaust real scope income distribution. finally, bear mind ecb, quantify price stability, factor price measurement problem also safety margin deflationary zone. what make deflation theory popular germany moment is, i believe, weak potential growth. if potential growth weak, even small disturbance lead low growth rate or, fact, absolute decline overall output. look way, recessionary period become likely potential growth low. at time, pressure economic policymakers increases. when deflationary risk discussion germany, attention soon focus monetary policy. some economist claim ecb’s policy expansionary enough germany. it argue real interest rate high germany many euro area country low rate inflation. i believe, however, sufficient look real interest rate isolation. we take consideration least two factors. first all, point relatively low inflation rate germany result real depreciation within euro area. by itself, lead increase competitiveness part german economy. second, regard wage rate policy, repeatedly make clear rate inflation germany low euro-area average. the fact take account collective wage negotiations, low risk deflationary tendencies. financial market in discussion deflationary risk germany, question stability german financial system always raise well. it argue while, us, household bear brunt decline asset prices, germany wide range financial institution affect deterioration asset price credit quality. allow make four comment that. my first remark concern households. accord estimate, 30% decline equity price dampen gdp 0.1 0.2 percentage point result fall private consumption. this much low estimate us. the difference mainly due fact that, germany, 20% 25% equity hold households. the volume total share outstanding relation gdp well u figure. second, i would like point fact decline equity price also effect corporate finance. in germany, however, 5% 7% financial need corporate sector cover equity market. nevertheless, access bond market also become difficult enterprise owe fact credit rat declined. for firms, high risk premium corporate bond push finance costs. since german non-financial enterprise obtain 2% fund bonds, however, severe problem expect front either. german company rely mainly bank loans. and bank loan domestic private sector show hardly increase past months. in september, 1% year year. in actual fact, indication bank show certain amount restraint lending. in addition narrow margin lend business, high number business insolvency fact many enterprise low level capital likely play part this. the quality banks’ loan portfolio deteriorated. however, empirical study also clearly reveal cause weak credit growth germany lie much banks’ behaviour situation economy whole. this 6 bi review 71/2002 mean mark slowdown credit expansion mainly outcome cyclically induce subdue demand credit. in view, currently weak development credit cannot therefore cite evidence general credit crunch germany. allow come third point make remark insurance companies. the insurance sector germany one important institutional investors. in june 2002, financial asset entire sector amount almost 1000 billion € book values. more one-third amount invest capital markets. by far large part figure invest life insurance companies, – end first half 2002 – equity (excluding participate interests) mutual fund share amount €160 billion. life insurance company invest 20% financial asset equities. the fact share price fall around 60% peak march 2000 lead significant fall insurance companies’ overall earn thus also reduction capital bonus policyholders. so far, however, generate destabilise effect capital market. even 2002, insurance company still make new investment around €12 billion net equity mutual fund shares. moreover, insurance company major self-interest protect entitlement clients. they therefore establish rescue company fail institutions, although – – company take action. the extensive depreciation requirement due significant share loss mitigate legislation provide tax account relief. fourth, i would like take look german banks. the decline equity market lead reduction amount hide reserves. the growth weakness german economy reflected, all, high risk provision requirement domestic lend business. add low earn commission business own-account trading. all hit bank system where, structural reasons, margin comparatively narrow anyway. by international standards, german bank sector characterise low degree concentration well strong competition. in view, justify say bank crisis germany. there liquidity crisis. german bank face massive non-performing loan problem bank japan. and real-estate bubble germany. above take account german bank currently take comprehensive measure improve profitability. these measure concern, first all, cost side. the plan staff adjustment bring significant ease situation. in addition that, process consolidation way time among small bank gain momentum. and, finally, german bank industry show heighten risk awareness present. all factor together likely give renew boost earn power thus reinforce stability german bank system. bi review 71/2002 1 jean-claude trichet: monetary policy 2003 introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, governor bank france, forum institut für management, frankfurt, 2 december 2002. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, it great pleasure participate “international forum interest rates” exchange view audience prominent player financial markets. i welcome initiative forum institut für management. in promote discussion challenge issue market practitioner economists, contribute attractiveness spirit financial market euro area. i would like open discussion remark structural issue one keep mind examine prospect financial market europe. indeed, achieve primary objective pursue price stability medium-term perspective, monetary policy define govern council ecb lay foundation success euro. but foundation also embed far-reaching structural dynamic involve notably three components: • financial integration, • financial stability, • prospect european union enlargement. i would like make remark challenge opportunity arise three –interrelated– topics. 1 financial integration 1.1 a regard financial integration, european monetary union many respect modify way financial institution organise daily business euro area. this influence integration pattern various segment financial market. european union modify way financial institution organise daily business euro area: it true financial integration europe start january 1999, bank non-financial company included, strategies, set single european market, occur ten year ago. the expansion operation abroad notably drive force. to illustrate point, look stock foreign asset hold companies. in case france, stock triple 1992 2000, eur bios 131 eur bios 465. a result, non-financial company gradually introduce competition bank system, fund expansion non-domestic bond commercial paper issues, centralize financing. a example 40% external financial resource borrow french medium large company redistribute subsidiaries, 10 15% consist commercial paper bond issuance (figure end 2001)1. 1 source : banque de france – central balance sheet data - 2 bi review 71/2002 1.2 these changes, top introduction euro, influence integration pattern money market, bond markets, derivative market equity markets. integration certainly –and naturally– develop money market. interest rate differential across regional deposit market vanish “law one price” apply transaction within deep highly liquid pan-european market. cross-border transaction –for unsecured inter-bank deposit repos– account 50% money-market cash transactions. eonia euribor within short time become undisputed benchmark short-term interest rates. this reflect instance impressive development euro interest-rate swap market, transaction index benchmarks. this deep integration money market prompt new organisational pattern bank sector, concentration euro cash management activity make possible take advantage high liquidity level secondary market. for instance, accord survey international security market association june 2002, top ten bank panel 77 account 55% total report business european repo market. a result price discovery mechanism money market smoothen trade decision base information system capture relevant parameter euro-area level. the integration euro-area financial market also deepen bond market: • rapid internationalisation take place. between 1998 2001, relative share corporate bond issue corporate borrower euro area percentage gdp doubled, increase one third unite states2. • competition issuers, corporate sovereign, intensified. for sovereign issuers, disappearance currency risk convergence process drive maastricht treaty transform government bond directly compete risk free assets. a consequence, sovereign issuer implement strategy aim differentiate issuance profile –in order diversify opportunity offer investors– establish benchmark selection maturities. this reflect build outstanding amount least 5 bios euro internationally important 10 year segment, euro area country, issuance strategy segment –2, 5, 30 years– differ, country build relatively large outstanding amount 30 year maturity (italy), 5 year maturity (netherlands) 3. only large country (germany, france instance) able provide high level liquidity spectrum maturities. this competition provide market participant wide range product also standardised, allow development electronic trade enhance liquidity euro bond market. • internationalisation competition private issuer accompany impressive surge amount issued. issuance euro denominate non-government bond triple 1998 2002 4. it quite difficult isolate specific impact european monetary union, due fact large issuance 1999-2001 period also link refinance need arise intense merger acquisition activity. look ahead medium-term, growth bond market likely drive element development pension fund assets, retail saver may move away bank deposit invest save products. in turn, design save product benefit standardisation diversification fix income issuance5. the integration interest rate market euro area accompany new phase development derivative markets. the proportion worldwide open interest contract trade 2 bi imf statistic – quote rajan zingales – 2002. 3 oecd – debt management government security 21st century –

15 years6. a derivative market enhance ability manage trade risk, heart modern finance backbone financial innovation. their development enable market participant hedge risk, develop arbitrage, and, therefore, enhance efficiency price set financial markets. of course, side coin derivative sometimes criticise may regard circumstance potential threat financial stability. i come back point late on. the elimination currency risk within euro area also far-reaching effect equity markets. this crystal clear observe volatility pattern portfolio allocation methods. a regard volatility patterns, recent development seem consistent prediction economic theory, stock price reflect expectation future dividends, interest rate risk premia. it follow introduction euro associate reduction difference volatility across markets. indeed, recent empirical study 7 demonstrate country whose stock exchange structural high medium volatility regime, converge towards low volatility regime. from point view european stock market whole, show improvement global efficiency. a regard investment patterns, sector-diversification strategy define alternative country diversification. before emu, common practice institutional investor make geographical diversification first priority, and, secondly, select security accordance sectoral diversification pattern. there evidence “home bias” weaken since introduction euro. for instance, asset hold pan-european investment fund represent 25% total asset end 2000, 12% 19988. the development genuine pan-european approach also illustrate introduction various european stock indexes. the turnover option base index –for instance, volume option trade eurostoxx50 contract– match turnover option base well-established domestic index cac france. this provide evidence large investor look – actually recourse to– hedge product suit cross-border orient strategy. however, evidence strong impetus towards integration necessarily support argument brand new asset allocation overwhelmingly dominant. let emphasise two aspects. first, pan-european sectoral strategy also embrace non-euro area stock order reach appropriate level diversification. this case sector pharmaceuticals, telecom equipment, stock list non-euro area country switzerland, unite kingdom sweden. this line theoretical assumptions, state currency risk outweigh risk-return parameters, far invest equity concerned. this lead second aspect: sensitivity stock market general macroeconomic event suggest domestic macroeconomic variable still influence stock prices. therefore investor may still prefer avoid heavily weight country structural rigidities, high public debt levels, contrary overweight asset allocation country well-designed fiscal structural policies. in vein, suggest level connection stock exchange europe u could time varying, consider underlie factor also drive policy implement independently. a matter fact, surprinsingly, correlation yield european stock index appear high european u indexes, correlation increase since 1999. these result seem valid even take account increase correlation due increase absolute volatility levels9. 6 rajan zingales – 2002 – second ecb

account change long term interest rates. the correlation eurostoxx 50 4 bi review 71/2002 2 financial stability 2.1 like every modern independent central bank, eurosystem individual components, ecb national central bank euro area, fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensure price stability, secondly, preserve financial stability. discussion role central bank play circumstance illiquidity financial distress old central bank themselves. the involvement central bank financial stability issue stem superiority central bank money final settlement transaction financial markets. central bank money enable market participant risk-free low-cost work balance – risk-free counterpart risk central bank assume zero, low-cost because, target system, cost intraday credit limit opportunity cost deposit appropriate level collateral. therefore, central bank concern robustness payment system financial position bank participate money market, order prevent systemic risk could stem, instance, potential “domino effect” participant fail meet settlement obligations. central bank concern also financial stability monetary policy point view. i would say price stability regard bedrock financial stability, financial stability critical efficiency monetary policy. let elaborate two points. first, price stability backbone financial stability? financial stability achieve sustainable basis financial resource misallocated. past experience, well large number economic study provide evidence inflation bring distortion allocation resources. for instance, calculation return biased, due fact replacement cost fix asset structurally underestimated. this may result sub-optimal investment decisions, over-optimistic credit risk assessment. conversely, case deflation, solvency indebted company may jeopardized, value cash flow decrease time, face value debt remain stable. second, financial stability matter efficiency monetary policy? the efficiency monetary policy rely effectiveness transmission channel monetary policy. central bank direct control short-term interest rate only. the impact monetary policy decision price go various channel – act directly anticipation economic agents, influence bank credit conditions, exchange rate asset prices. uncertainty may arise channel act predictable way relatively stable time lags. in respect, financial instability may affect transmission channel monetary policy. for instance, large fluctuation asset price may modify behaviour agent decrease level confidence. such fluctuation also expose bank portfolio high risk losses, induce bank compensate risk restrict credit. let stress that, although price stability orient monetary policy conducive financial stability long term, episode financial instability know take place period low inflation. price stability must therefore regard necessary sufficient condition. other parameter influence financial stability, among financial integration particular interest point view central bank euro area. 2.2 the relationship financial integration financial stability twofold: • first, liquidity redistribution function take new dimension participant market deal wide range counterparties, actually trade large unit amounts. some bank treasurer paris mention average face value euro single transaction today equivalent face value transaction french franc 1998, is, six time higher. • second, financial market integration relate trend towards great share market allocation assets. at end 2000 financial asset euro area dow jones 70% period january 1999- october 2002 (70% measure base sp500), 100% cac eurostoxx50 (97% dax eurostoxx 50). bi review 71/2002 5 split almost equally intermediate non-intermediated assets10. although credit still play prominent role allocation financial resources, credit institution rely financial market manage balance sheets. these two point suggest benefit enhance liquidity entail management new range risks. this lead u conclude financial integration necessarily negative side effect point view financial stability. financial integration may help foster financial instability. i would like put forward three reason this: • first, set large currency area eliminate disruption arise currency risk would otherwise prevail participate countries. domestic economy immune currency misalignment episode disturb regional trade. currency risk premia eliminate interest rates. • secondly, set large currency area imply overhaul market infrastructure. in respect public bodies, national central bank market participants, unique opportunity pool best practices. indeed, case euro area where, example– target system, interlink domestic real-time gross settlement systems, demonstrate ability absorb large volume cross-border flows, perform well even critical circumstance september 2001. the target system process today around eur 1500 billion per day, 50% average 1999 estimate three time amount large-value payment system 12 euro area country process together 1990 11. • thirdly, large currency area mean deep liquid financial markets. this allow market participant diversify risk wide basis; moreover, currency risk eliminated, focus analysis credit risk. a large currency area also provide scope specialise institution develop. all all, market efficiency liquidity help cushion external shock 12. 2.3 take account benefits, one could question financial stability issue still important euro area. in view financial stability issue need re-visited today backdrop far-reaching change observe financial market last decade, take account succession market instability episodes. just name few, asian crisis, russian/ltcm crisis 1998, “tech-bubble” 2000. these episode characterise situation liquidity stress, market volatility, late discovery risk spread widely complex hedge financial innovation devices. in respect complex relationship volatility, financial innovation financial stability deserve attention. clearly, volatility level primarily reflect degree uncertainty market participants. from general point view, volatility kind genetic signature price set mechanism competitive market. price hover around equilibrium successive adjustments. when market participant express widely different view equilibrium price, volume transaction shrinks, volatility usually increases. in respect, close correlation occurrence crisis –such reveal insolvency emerge country, supply shock commodity prices, burst equity bubbles– excessive volatility. volatility indicator market inefficiency. however, excessively high volatility adverse effect behaviour market participant real economy. from corporate management point view, volatility capital market low predictability cost capital. when review investment 10 source : report financial structure – ecb - 2002 11 estimation « central bank financial stability – explore intermediate land » – second ecb central bank conference - 2002 12 bri – economic aspect regional currency area use foreign currency – 2002 – document non publié. 6 bi review 71/2002 opportunities, manager may want avoid rely heavily external finance uncertainty surround cost, even sheer availability, financing. this may lead company postpone downsize investment projects. from financial management point view, large investor may give priority company low risk profile, order bring back asset portfolio level volatility match requirements. therefore list company incentive adjust risk profile avoid hazardous –which may also innovative– investment projects. therefore, “entrepeneurship” may curb growth potential may influence adversely. another impact volatility financial management relate recourse hedging, namely derivative products. a i mention earlier, derivative drive force behind mature financial markets, strong development last two decade merely consequence benefit generated. more precisely, derivative relate financial innovation enable company transfer impact interest rate currency fluctuation financial institution investor ready manage it, whereby facilitate international trade project financing. meanwhile, price derivative closely link volatility. a volatility indeed difficult predict, market practitioner develop models, constantly refined. over time, market participants, –especially banks,– become competent manage risk, leave residual risk complex hard control. these consequence would major concern, episode excessive volatility accidental. peak volatility clearly reflect macroeconomic imbalances, soon market participant take account relevant information. this evidence study review factor behind currency crisis emerge countries. macro data –such balance payment fiscal policy indicators– prove discriminant-leading indicator point view13. however, i cannot affirm resolution market imbalance would result reduction volatility level prevail imbalance take account market participants. in view one underestimate part play technical factor persistence volatility peaks. this persistence volatility fuel technical feature facilitate build mimetic behaviour (amplifying effects), reinforce link various market segment (diffusion effects). mimetic behaviour course mean new phenomenon financial markets. however benchmarking, index management, risk management technique may gradually reinforce type behaviour, participant increase pressure follow peer match performance benchmark. there doubt spread benchmarking allow fund manager client good ass performance funds. but, context grow competition within sector, may well increase mimetic behaviour. some market participant (whose compensation closely link relative, rather absolute, profit loss generate) may indeed come conclusion would good wrong along everybody else, rather run risk right alone. a strike example rational mimetic behaviour influence hedge fund pose “opinion leaders” trend setters. by nature, trend follow amplify imbalance may point affect market, potentially lead vicious circle price adjustment liquidation positions. moreover, increase number participant able access financial market directly, expertise deal wide range technical information evenly distributed. this may also reinforce role “gurus”. index management, fund management technique, prove popular equity market may contribute exacerbate fluctuation financial asset prices. because goal mimic performance indices, “passive managers” constantly strive match composition benchmark. they thus help amplify market trends, buy market rise increasingly liquidate market drops. it argue index fund distort price target index that, result, index end create rather measure performance. 13 lead indicator currency crisis emerge country – burkart, coudert – note d’etude et de recherche – banque de france – 2000. bi review 71/2002 7 the impact risk management technique market dynamic particularly enlighten regard question asset price overshooting. value-at-risk calculation become crucial element standard approach use market participant evaluate risk inherent market activity set exposure limits. of course, central bank financial institution continue encourage use instruments. but, time financial turmoil, grow use sophisticate risk management technique financial intermediary might paradoxical effect amplify initial shock, exhaust liquidity contribute contagion phenomena. regardless intrinsic quality risk management tools, see grow use fashion market participant may produce pernicious effects. when market player rely converge risk evaluations, tend take decision time, thus amplify initial shock price trade volumes. financial technique also reinforce link various market segments. a strike feature recent development financial market quick spread disryptions one market segment another, especially equity credit markets. for example, short sell equity sometimes use hedge credit risk. the underlie reason credit default, value equity decrease symmetrically, equity gain compensate lender credit loss. a result, fall equity value, trigger credit default, amplify short sell operation. credit risk derivative constitute another financial innovation play increasingly important role last years. it contribute avoid credit institution heavily impact large credit default occur recently. credit risk derivative also enable bank fine-tune risk-return profile loan portfolios. from macro point view, credit risk derivative help diversify spread risk, assumption buyer risk deliberately alter risk-return profile. but ultimate risk remain result, sectors, insurance company pension funds, hitherto feel direct pressure worsen credit quality, may find directly impacted, sell derivative early stage. against background, beyond primary objective achieve price stability medium-term, part central bank play improve function financial market promote financial stability? apart operational task –such management money market liquidity monitor large value payment systems– central bank must endeavour unremittingly create condition international economy minimize misalignment asset prices, excessive volatility, purely speculative phenomenon dangerous herd behaviour. this underlie message central banks' repeat call prudence caution. i would like address third point, is, prospect european union enlargement. 3 european union enlargement at first glance, link topic two issue i deal appear quite tenuous. yet, issue arise market integration financial stability concern many central banks, manage eu enlargement distinctive concern eurosystem. i would like share view eurosystem act address concern, perform task regard price financial stability. ten country central, eastern southern europe –comprising 75 million inhabitant – join eu, thus complete european reunification. although combine gdp rather small (equivalent netherlands instance), term population' size propel eu (450 million inhabitants) largely ahead combine population u (population: 275 millions) russia (population: 145 millions). this testify again, need be, attractiveness european union framework, provide u economic prosperity political stability almost half century. accession country accomplish important progress stabilize strengthen economy institutions. observe accession countries, recent history show major improvement country made, hardly 10 years, road towards convergence eu. let u keep mind, sometimes rather slow pace current member state took, regard example trade openness, price liberalisation, macro economic discipline. 8 bi review 71/2002 nevertheless, also general agreement fact gap, term average gdp per capita, accession country euro area, although diminishing, remain still quite significant. the size gap, combine recently rather limit growth differential two group countries, suggest process real convergence gradual continue much beyond tentative date eu accession. although difference income level incompatible eu even emu membership, extremely important accession country increase real convergence. indeed, real convergence essential create economic cohesion within emu promote integration member states, thereby help minimize risk effect asymmetric shocks, best interest accession country themselves. let stress seven point particular relevance eurosystem, accession country road towards achieve catching-up convergence eu. • firstly, never forget nominal convergence must sustainable therefore constitute objective must meet give point time rather goal must achieve continuously. strict compliance maastricht criterion key join euro area. indeed, eu treaty calls, prerequisite adopt euro, high degree sustainable convergence field price stability, government fiscal position, stability exchange rate, long-term interest-rate levels. the sustainability nominal convergence presume sufficient preliminary progress make towards real structural convergence (and namely set fully-fledged market economy, catching-up income productivity levels, well economic social infrastructures, upgrade legal system…). conversely, sustainable catching-up process require macroeconomic stability. therefore, nominal real convergence pursue parallel, antagonistic. • secondly, i note several accession country already express intention join erm ii rapidly eu entry. this intention welcomed, although clear erm ii membership need neither happen immediately eu accession cases, limit two years, minimum adopt euro. it would totally mislead consider erm ii mere “waiting room” euro. on contrary, erm ii membership allow country retain limit exchange rate flexibility catching-up process offer meaningful, flexible credible framework increase nominal real convergence euro area, help determine appropriate level eventual irrevocable fixation parities, best interest candidate country themselves. to enter eurozone important, grave irrevocable act. neither accession country concern eurozone could afford risk associate mistake decision. • thirdly, accession country must strengthen fiscal external positions. give aim attain real convergence time, accession country devote significant public resource fund investment. however, candidate countries’ weight average public deficit amount 3.6% gdp 2001. the fiscal consolidation currently plan accession country welcome likely require sizeable expenditure cut tax increases. look ahead, accession country implement fiscal consolidation credibly view avoid risk associate existence high “twin deficits”, i.e. fiscal external. • fourthly, sound efficient bank financial system key. significant progress make past year rehabilitate bank sector encourage foreign ownership. the latter also contribute great integration eu financial system. nevertheless, adapt legal regulatory framework process entirely hand access countries. the intermediation role bank sector remain fundamental efficient use capital sustain growth. progress corporate governance, enhancement legal supervisory framework support bank sector, efficient fight money laundering, also crucial. these improvement conducive achieve macroeconomic objective accession countries. • fifthly, central bank independence essence. it integral part acquis communautaire, lay national legislation bi review 71/2002 9 maastricht treaty. the effective implementation acquis communautaire legal prerequisite accession eu. it also imply effective transformation accession countries’ economic framework, facilitate integration eu and, later, euro area. in context, ensure discrepancy central banks’ formal status legislation implementation legislation. it utmost importance present future member state respect economic institutional grind rule european framework. • sixthly, let u forget present future contribution central eastern european country economic prosperity europe large. it seem contribution might sometimes underestimated, relative influence u economy, instance, might sometimes overestimated. in fact, transition economies, whole, important u term external demand address euro area: enjoy share, i.e. 13% exports. and, last two years, transition economy contribute two-thirds overall growth total external demand, u contribute le 0.1%. more generally speaking, central eastern europe country already major contributor overall growth european continent. in 2001, despite international context, remain quite high level growth, around 2.8%. this contribution bind increase give countries’ considerable potential growth. i thank attention. bi review 70/2002 1 tony latter: preserve monetary stability face budget deficit speech mr tony latter, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, insight investment conference hong kong, 20 november 2002. * * * introduction there much talk recently hong kong possible threat exchange rate stability burgeon budget deficit, predict many reach 6% gdp current financial year whole. evidence concern apparent medium report suggest deterioration fiscal position invariably accompany weakening, even shortlived, forward exchange rate hk dollar. this phenomenon confine hong kong. in europe, news widen budget deficits, threaten breach term stability growth pact, allegation lack commitment among official degree fiscal discipline necessary conform pact, tend weaken euro's exchange rate, least temporarily. but another story told. this economy budget deficit rise 1½% gdp 4½% space 4-5 years. what happen exchange rate? it strengthen period 70% trade-weighted terms. the authority rein deficit somewhat next couple years, begin expand again. on occasion, deficit double within three years, exchange rate appreciate again. that country unite state reference episode deficit grow rapidly early 1980s turn 1990s. and observer detect sign today similar replay beginning. to fair, however, note dollar tend remain firm year deficit reduction late 1990s deficit rise early 1980s, that, balance, may clear long-term relationship either direction u deficit dollar exchange rate. but least u experience warn u presume automatic negative causation flow one other. the relationship fiscal monetary policy it may worthwhile examine generally certain aspect relationship fiscal policy monetary policy. the economy characterise comprise number different sectors. at high level aggregation classification usually public sector, corporate sector, household sector overseas sector (the counterpart external balance payments). each sector may financial surplus deficit, surplus deficit must, account terms, sum zero (although term available statistic may not, error omissions); every piece deficit necessarily match piece surplus. typically, one might envisage save surplus household sector channel bank financial market fund deficit corporate sector, arise capital investment work capital needs. in context deficit corporate sector seem perfectly acceptable. why, then, deficit public sector raise particular anxiety? isn't situation public sector fund need analogous private sector corporate entity needs? not necessarily so. a number factor may differentiate two situations. what factor special consideration may apply case public sector deficit? • first, assess impact different deficit one may need look behind them, associate development real economy. for example, financial deficit may reflect, one extreme, spend current consumption, particularly import result benefit domestic employment; may reflect, extreme, investment generate job great efficiency within domestic economy. if suspicion – whether well found – public sector deficit incline former category, judge le helpful long-term health economy thus tend weaken 2 bi review 70/2002 financial confidence. a sizeable underlie public sector deficit may anyway regard sign fundamental weakness economy, signify heavy involvement government run economy. it type consideration lead emergence various recommendation rule fiscal deficits. there is, example, "golden rule" uk finance minister, gordon brown, first espouse 1997, state that, cycle, spend current (as oppose capital) nature balance revenues, borrow countenance cover capital expenditure. in europe supposedly sacrosanct cap fiscal deficit member country euro-zone, 3% gdp. and hong kong basic law (article 107), state hong kong strive achieve fiscal balance avoid deficits. • second, finance private sector deficit subject market discipline, provide finance calculate expectation investment generate sufficient internal return repay due course. by contrast, case public sector deficit, investor's confidence base much knowledge rate return, any, expenditure fund destined, faith government's ultimate ability raise money taxation, necessary, future date order service borrowings. such prospect high taxation might, among things, serve dampener financial confidence. • third, may fear public sector borrow crowd worthy corporate sector borrow financial markets, detriment economy whole, although extent public sector deficit counterpart corporate sector surplus (or reduce deficit), corporate sector’s borrow requirement anyway reduced. • fourth, case public sector deficit may finance reduction net foreign currency assets. for instance, government may resort foreign borrow local financial market mature enough supply funding. or, exceptionally, case hong kong, government may raise fund run accumulate foreign currency investments. the respective build-up foreign currency liability reduction foreign reserve may raise concern context net national wealth, national economic security, credit ratings, on. moreover, foreign currency borrow expose government financial loss local currency term currency depreciate. • fifth, may lurk fear government tempt acquiesce inflation currency depreciation mean repair current finance (if belief revenue may affect quickly positively expenditure) reduce real value outstanding indebtedness. • sixth, may consequential fear that, mean end, government seek monetise debt – "printing money" fund deficit. this would, however, require cooperation central bank, jurisdiction nowadays form prohibition central bank abet strategy. more specifically, government tend prevent – force law moral pressure – obtain finance direct central bank (eg might occur bank force take issue government security primary market), although central bank invariably permit buy (or sell) government paper secondary market part discretionary monetary policy operations. practical experience what experience real world? reference already make case unite states. the u government regard best credit risk world huge global appetite u treasury securities. the federal reserve equally strong track record avoid inflation. for reasons, market seldom, live memory, consider large fiscal deficit u presage monetary laxity signal weak dollar. indeed, contrary often seem case: fiscal deficit provide circumstantial evidence deficiency domestic bi review 70/2002 3 savings, prospect interest rate might need rise bring save investment equilibrium – reality rise – may actually contribute strength dollar occasions, note already. a similar trait apparent deutschemark early 1990s wake german reunification: prospect – subsequent emergence – substantial budget deficit, hence high interest rate otherwise, accompany strengthen exchange rate. by contrast, however, discuss below, recent deterioration fiscal outlook germany positive factor euro. at extreme lie example country budgetary indiscipline plainly factor behind collapse currency. it would invidious mention names, story caricature follows. the government run deficit unable unwilling correct. domestic save short supply saver abundant faith government credit-risk perspective. the government find pay ever high interest rates, interest burden become significant component continue deficit. meanwhile government may meet fund need foreign currency borrow – initiate time international sentiment favourable interest rate seem attractive, least uncover basis. the situation begin unravel acutely. foreigner take fright wish roll forward lending, much high margin. the country can’t afford high foreign currency interest payments, still le make net repayment principal foreign borrowing. domestically mean leave cover deficit central bank fund it. this mean central bank lend government virtually demand by, effectively, credit government’s bank account – resort print press name. whether lend carry interest rate largely immaterial, since central bank continue stroke pen create money pay interest. this procedure inevitably inflationary, wayward government may welcome mean reduce real value outstanding domestic debt. it may even feel inflation aid current financial position, revenue inflate fast outgoings. all clear recipe disaster, including, probably, exchange rate crisis. between two extreme – u no-hoper – course many case situation le clear-cut le predictable. euroland provide interest example. give careful step take advent euro ensure insulation monetary fiscal policy outlaw monetary finance budget deficits, might wonder news impend budget overrun cause euro weaken. it seem credit spread face individual deficit country widen (presumably fear, however slim, sovereign default), also currency weaken fear government conspire central bank abandon mandate inflation break rule monetary financing. a rather different interpretation could foreign exchange market merely exhibit pavlovian reaction: brainwash effect deficit inherently bad surpass certain pre-announced limits, reaction breach occur bind negative, even analysis substance underlie breach provide little justification reaction. in context try identify relationship fiscal position exchange rate, example demonstrate simple, pre-ordained relationship. the outcome depend wealth factors, include nature disturbance affect public finances, policy regime policy responses, state sentiment financial markets. hong kong how present situation hong kong match various considerations? hong kong several respect exceptional, unique. it specific central bank law type common jurisdiction (although number laws, exchange fund ordinance bank ordinance, govern particular aspect monetary authority’s functions). it mainstream government debt. it operate currency board rather discretionary monetary policy. and quite recently become familiar idea budget deficit persist long isolate year two. although absence law explicitly prohibit monetary finance budget deficit – sort adopt many economies, new old, course past couple 4 bi review 70/2002 decade – may think weakness, need reality. whether formal legal basis, proscription monetary finance nowadays become firmly establish part policy landscape develop financial economies, dare breach would immediately crucify markets, world media, imf on. one could class sort de facto law nature, likely least effective durable law pass legislature, so. hong kong regard subject law nature. in event, hong kong’s currency board system rule creation money except exchange foreign currency, therefore serf operational safeguard monetary finance budget. in order fund deficit, government choice run asset (the fiscal reserve) borrowing, bank markets,. it choose time former route. the monetary impact would either case neutral. it may worth explain process. if fiscal reserve draw exchange fund fund consequently need realise foreign currency assets, foreign exchange sell market. the counterparty surrender hk dollars. these accrue temporarily exchange fund transfer government, turn pas party, counterpart budget deficit. the net result change ownership hk dollar money quantity outstanding. similarly, borrow hk dollar fund deficit would involve shift ownership dollar around economy, net increase quantity. the mechanic finance deficit ought therefore raise concern hong kong context monetary stability. nevertheless, practice market appear exhibit degree negative reaction deficit. why? a number possible explanation come mind. • first, rather obviously, hong kong’s basic law, indicate deficit avoided. it’s understandable market become nervous suspect law might infringed. • second, many people, whether hong kong elsewhere, anyway gut feel get debt imprudent. this stop individually borrow money, tolerant government debt, may nevertheless uncomfortable it. the underlie rationale hold view may well articulated, need – view exists, enough impact. and impact may reinforce government’s record appear run counter preaching. • this lead third point, hong kong boast since long ago budget surplus absence government debt. this make intellectually difficult deny significance deficit. not anyone try downplay – expression concern government official numerous, sincere unambiguous. but way serf highlight difference. the present position see represent sea-change financial circumstance hong kong, whereas economy familiar deficit might able take deterioration public finance easily stride. • fourth, specific concern, either two available mean finance deficit - by, now, realise foreign currency investment government borrow – would impact adversely hong kong's financial stand eye rat agency others. of course, mean obvious finance activity would necessarily endanger monetary stability weaken exchange rate. indeed, plenty example economy low foreign reserve high government borrow enjoy firm currency strong credit standings, hard see why, example, act hong kong

containment government spend restore fiscal balance due course, scepticism understandable; extraordinarily difficult field forecasters, since balance difference two large numbers, comprise many vary components. the air uncertainty give rise rumour – sweep expenditure cuts, asset sales, new taxes, high tax rate whatever – fear hong kong may able preserve distinctive edge place uncomplicated tax

institutional, economic monetary policy implication emu country apply accession eu speech mr michael c bonello, governor central bank malta, workshop organise university malta, gozo centre, gozo, 16 november 2002. * * * i guess familiar fact country’s eligibility join european union (eu) rest satisfy copenhagen criteria, include obligation achieve compliance eu acquis show commitment aim union, include relate emu. indeed, unlike denmark unite kingdom, current wave accession country expect join emu eventually. this imply also join exchange rate mechanism (erm ii). participation erm ii fact one maastricht criterion must meet admission euro area. this require national currency remain within fluctuation margin mechanism least two year without resort devaluation euro. what make erm ii important maastricht criteria? participation erm ii criterion accession country meet able join emu. prospective member euro area fact also require satisfy four maastricht criteria, relate inflation, interest rate, fiscal deficit public debt. i propose focus erm ii criterion two reasons. first, time emu membership condition two-year period embed exchange rate criterion. in malta’s case, part next enlargement may 2004 even fulfil maastricht criteria, early technically able participate emu mid-2006. early adherence criteria, therefore, become almost irrelevant. second, obligation participate erm ii implication term preparation national central bank make view eventual entry emu. this impinge directly central bank’s main function – formulation monetary exchange rate policy management external reserve – something true, example, fiscal criteria. erm ii thus particular interest central bankers. against background, i review issue eventual participation erm ii, late emu, raise policy maker malta. no significant change parameter govern monetary exchange rate policy emu entail adoption euro surrender autonomy area monetary policy european central bank (ecb). at point, however, relevant mention additional loss independence emu would represent formulation monetary policy malta minimal. this central bank malta already limit freedom action since operate fix exchange rate regime exchange control almost entirely removed. this mean bank must adjust domestic interest rate response movement capital flow way consistent peg. too low interest rate would encourage investor move domestic assets, create downward pressure currency, whereas high rate could attract interest-sensitive capital flow could create upward pressure exchange rate. to large extent, condition already govern monetary policy reserve management malta. while monetary policy advisory council take domestic economic condition account, decision official interest rate are, fact, primarily condition trend official reserve interest rate currency make basket maltese lira pegged. malta’s eventual participation emu, therefore, would involve significant departure current situation term degree autonomy enjoy central bank malta set interest rates. in view incompatibility monetary policy autonomy, full capital account liberalisation fix exchange rate, emu participant give independent national monetary police favour 2 bi review 70/2002 free movement capital adoption single currency. the main drive force behind decision desire overcome obstacle completion single market progress towards monetary and, eventually, economic union. a single currency logical step regard. give constraint adoption single currency entails, emphasis treaty put contain fiscal deficit labour mobility understandable. in set-up, fact, adjustment asymmetric shock take place fiscal policy labour market. since labour mobility within union still weak, however, practice mean onus adjustment fall fiscal policy. fiscal consolidation thus remain necessary precondition success emu. indeed, whereas could argue stability growth pact preclude fiscal policy respond short-term domestic needs, equally true constraint arise pact mean ensure government euro area necessary room manoeuvre medium-term. the presumption achieve close balance surplus positions, government would good position deal normal cyclical fluctuations. in addition, commitment refrain excessive deficit also necessary condition success emu itself. this case deficit occur one large euro area members, inflationary pressure result deficit could instil upward bias ecb interest rates. for accession countries, contain public spend flexible labour market also necessary point view achieve nominal real economic convergence. excessive deficit would accentuate inflation differentials, undermine ability country fulfil maastricht criteria, could also crowd private sector investments, delay progress structural reform convergence income levels. give large deficit labour market rigidity tend weaken country’s ability achieve nominal real economic convergence, policy address issue integral part preparation accession country make advance emu. the rationale behind erm ii erm ii fix exchange rate regime, involve adoption central exchange rate euro agreement ecb. this rate allow fluctuate within specify margins, normally +/- 15%, narrow band may adopt subject mutual agreement. the rationale behind erm ii that, country succeed maintain value currency euro within fluctuation band period two years, would reasonable assume country would able deal bind constraint emu. during phase, accession country prove able put discipline inherent fix exchange rate without imbalance arise sector economy. that accession emu conditional prior participation erm ii. furthermore, would unfair twelve euro area country eu demand le stringent condition present wave accession countries. upon eu accession erm ii phase, malta, like accession countries, would status “country derogation”. since erm ii neither entail formal transfer monetary policy responsibility ecb replacement domestic currency euro, not, i already indicated, involve significant departure current practice, although offer flexibility current fix exchange rate regime, involve fluctuation band. another difference obligation defend central exchange rate erm ii would bind ecb central bank malta. both institution would expect intervene preserve value. this turn explain central rate fluctuation band fix mutual agreement. the current regime also differ condition govern erm ii term anchor currency. strategy base free floats, peg currency euro crawl peg compatible erm ii. consequently, malta’s exchange rate, apart euro also link u dollar sterling anchor currencies, revised. the question answer is, “what exchange rate strategy malta pursue run-up erm ii?” bi review 70/2002 3 experience suggest move flexible regime prior erm ii whereas strategy pursue emu prescribe treaty, institutional framework govern erm ii limit strategy would compatible arrangement, principle exchange rate regime permit phase precede erm ii. what matter select regime contribute real economic convergence economy eu member countries, macroeconomic stabilisation transition function market economy capable deal competitive pressure within eu. indeed, accession country currently pursue different strategies. this diversity exchange rate regime explain term progress make thus far country disinflating economies; degree openness; extent capital account liberalisation; adequacy reserves. generally speaking, early phase transition many accession country face task disinflating economy restore credibility monetary policy, fix exchange rate regime norm. then, credible anchor form currency low-inflation trade partner view best strategy meet objectives. the rationale difficult understand. the persistence inflation differential fix exchange rate regime would lead appreciation real exchange rate, undermine country’s external competitiveness. the mere adoption fix exchange rate indeed signal intention subordinate monetary policy exchange rate policy, add credibility anti-inflationary monetary decisions. a country progress disinflation emphasis shift towards integration eu, continuation structural reform attract sufficient capital flow enhance real convergence, gradual move flexible regime become feasible. at first sight, shift would also seem indicate malta, particularly capital liberalisation programme approach full implementation. moreover, flexible regime additional benefit yield exchange rate reflect market force economic fundamentals, enable authority gauge proper level equilibrium exchange rate date entry erm ii draw closer. a thorough examination facts, however, suggest otherwise. malta likely maintain fix exchange rate regime whereas liberalisation capital flow could indeed lead upward pressure exchange rate countries, pressure unlikely overwhelm case malta, least function market economy already exists. econometric evidence fact suggest openness, maltese economy already expose significant capital flows, impact full capital account liberalisation likely significantly small accession country . to extent, bank’s external reserves, always remain well 60 per cent liability require law, also act cushion external shocks. in addition, structure maltese economy already similar main trade partner, eu, make fix peg arrangement appropriate event symmetric shock. empirical evidence also show fix exchange rate valuable nominal anchor restrain price wage increases. inflation fact remain 3% past five years. this confirm ecb assessment malta’s monetary exchange rate policy connection pre-accession economic programme report 2002, note current regime serve malta well promote real nominal convergence. in view considerations, give importance exchange rate stability trade investment, current regime remain prefer arrangement malta. take together, therefore, institutional arrangement govern erm ii successful experience current fix exchange rate regime suggest way forward consist gradual reduction weight u dollar sterling currency basket, time malta ready join erm ii euro sole reference currency. if unite kingdom join emu meantime, would automatically raise proportion euro currency basket, make approach erm ii much easier. consistently objective, weight euro basket increase 56.8% 70% last august. 4 bi review 70/2002 give malta’s optimal exchange rate strategy run-up erm ii identified, next question concern choice central exchange rate fluctuation bands. the choice central exchange rate fluctuation band some might argue choice central rate vitally important. after all, central rate re-aligned necessary, although move would require agreement ecb national central bank participate euro area. in practice, however, initial central rate choose important convey signal market ecb national authority consider equilibrium exchange rate. the determination central rate also crucial select rate turn incompatible economic fundamentals, market intervention ecb central bank malta could become frequent relation resource available. determine appropriate central rate, however, easy task. nevertheless, though available evidence suggest current economic climate maltese lira exchange rate sustainable prevail levels, work undertake order estimate equilibrium rate. the second choice concern fluctuation band. it matter choose low degree uncertainty volatility associate narrow fluctuation band flexibility inherent wide fluctuation band. on one hand, flexibility necessitate absence capital control would strengthen case wide band. on hand, malta’s dependence foreign trade investment, country’s track record fix peg well central bank’s commitment price stability would seem justify adoption narrow band. a real convergence progressively achieve structural reform proceed, case narrow band would also become stronger. should latter path followed, burden adjustment external shock would, course, bear real economy. in first instance, mean pursue prudent fiscal policy. the current aim fiscal policy indeed reduce deficit gdp ratio around 2.5% 2004, 5.3% last year 10% late 1990s. by restrain domestic absorption, tight fiscal policy enhance credibility exchange rate peg. moreover, small borrow requirement also free resource private sector help contain upward pressure interest rates, thereby stimulate economic growth. finally, bring budget deficit close balance give fiscal policy leeway respond event adverse shock cyclical downturns. the response shock also depend degree flexibility economy whole. unlike accession countries, malta long experience function market economy, drive private ownership productive asset much expose international competition. in general, therefore, private sector already prove cope adverse shocks. in regard, flexibility labour market especially important. this flexibility must, however, enhance order safeguard competitiveness. a case exchange rate strategy, sustainability central rate and, that, fulfilment maastricht criteria, hinge whether rate compatible economic fundamentals. fulfil criterion require unconditional willingness defend external value currency. for policy maker mean commitment abstain practice could conflict objective exchange rate policy. for participant foreign exchange markets, include central bank, imply need intervene market without hesitation. within context, importance acquis assign independence central bank understandable. whereas central bank malta formulate monetary policy independently since 1994, doubt recent amendment central bank malta act put bank good position defend peg. the amend act, fact, establish price stability primary objective bank, also protect bank external interference provide operate flexibility necessary effective prompt intervention foreign exchange markets. with come force amendments, malta achieve high degree compliance chapter 11 acquis emu. another crucial precondition maintain exchange rate peg ensure smooth transition single currency financial sector stability. in respect, regulatory supervisory framework base high international standard already place. maltese legislation area fact incorporate almost feature correspond eu directives, legislative bi review 70/2002 5 amendment i refer bring almost total harmonisation. institutional responsibility divide malta financial service authority, responsible regulation supervision banking, insurance investment services; central bank, charge ensure stability system whole. the bank also responsible domestic payment system, upgrade line development euro area. accord recent background paper prepare ecb , malta already financial intermediation mechanism broadly mirror composition different market segment euro area member states. despite growth non-bank financial intermediary development money capital markets, bank remain key financial institutions. total bank asset amount double gdp, whereas ratio domestic credit gdp broadly line eu average. more importantly, bank system generally healthy, enjoy ample liquidity broad capital base, ratio fund risk-weighted asset stand close 14%. some institutional aspect emu preparation i shall conclude remark preparation operational nature eventual integration within escb. an important area central bank obligation towards ecb statistics. this formulation monetary policy euro area rest timely availability standardise economic, monetary financial

instruments, contract control procedure bank us monetary foreign exchange operations. in case necessary change identify course implementation. with cooperation malta police, central bank also strengthen capacity detect case involve counterfeit note report case ecb europol. finally, bank analyse way composition official reserve could revise malta progress towards emu membership. a note above, key aspect smooth operation emu fiscal discipline. early on, i make reference stability growth pact. this, however, one element framework apply co-ordination economic policy fiscal surveillance

already start submit pre-accession economic programme (pep). the central bank malta collaborate ministry finance ministry economic service preparation necessary documentation. to date, like accession countries, malta submit two peps. conclusion the road emu clearly easy one task involve numerous difficult. for small central bank limit resource represent formidable challenge. on policy level, 6 bi review 70/2002 reason believe current fix exchange arrangement ideally maintain malta adopt euro. it also clear, however, government’s commitment contain fiscal deficit pursue structural reform vital prerequisite sustainability fix exchange rate regime. the importance fiscal discipline product factor market flexibility indeed increase malta progress towards emu. bi review 69/2002 1 michael c

previous year i use occasion focus issue relate country’s perennial challenge, converge economic standard develop trade partners. among appropriate response challenge i emphasise importance price financial stability, fiscal restraint, market-based reform viable exchange rate strategy. these indeed necessary element strong macroeconomic policy framework conducive export-led growth. the issue i shall address today need complement policy secure access international markets. the reason simple. without access, small open economy like cannot hope achieve sustained, quality growth today’s globalize world. a structured, regional approach build competitiveness in world economy drive cross-border flow foreign direct investment (fdi) seek profitable locations, challenge sustain economic growth must face head endeavour maintain cost competitiveness gain access large markets. study show country open trade tend achieve high growth rate compare le open economy comparable stage development.1 of course, openness also bring great exposure external shocks, particularly small economy cannot aspire degree self-sufficiency. experience, however, suggest exposure necessarily translate vulnerability small economy closely integrate large ones. for example, great resilience country central eastern europe number transition economy attribute relatively strong trade link former

financially integrate economy turn experience low degree output volatility close financial markets.3 this suggest trade financial integration major trade partner remain prefer option. this conclusion bear experience small state luxembourg singapore. the fundamental characteristic country resemble malta’s small open economy lack natural resources. both, however, achieve far high level prosperity.4

necessary deal competitive force globalisation optimally build stage participation regional arrangements. the implication order reap full benefit policy reform currently way, malta need integrate internationally, structure approach seek exploit potential synergy economies. the question arises, “what kind regional arrangement whom?”. malta’s potential partner regional integration traditionally, partner regional integration arrangement exhibit strong trade tie base complementarity term resource endowment geographical proximity, well common historical cultural background. these criterion limit scope integration malta number outlying european country transition economy eastern europe efta countries. in fact, malta’s commercial link country weak, economic sector could potential interest

likely potentially viable regional partner malta. a far latter country concerned, doubt make considerable progress recent years. most them, however, require time able take full advantage potential. a strategy base solely close tie countries, therefore, would tend condition malta’s development proceed slow pace potential would justify. furthermore, although effort make create euro-mediterranean free trade area (fta) 2010, date appear rather optimistic. this confirm spanish presidency last march, note critical mass implement ftas partner yet 5 singapore recently also initial bilateral

another country regional grouping. 9 the andean pact, example, also deal biodiversity, electronic commerce protection indigenous knowledge. bi review 69/2002 3 reached.10 finally, also note essential aspect eventual euro-mediterranean fta expect obligation achieve equivalence standards. at stage, therefore, growth strategy rely close link country appear neither plausible likely provide adequate opportunity term market access. the viable alternative thus seem forge strong tie eu, malta already closely integrate trade investment. the eu account half malta’s trade good around 80% incoming tourists.11 the eu equally important source fdi, account 43% total 2000.12 this suggest strengthen exist relationship eu likely produce early result attempt develop tie region start small base. malta’s relationship eu - alternative scenario malta could, example, retain, attempt upgrade, exist association agreement. a stands, agreement narrow scope, focus industrial good exclusion agricultural products. in addition, severely limit set rule origin whereby local export benefit preferential access eu market percentage value product originate malta exceed minimum threshold. if agreement upgraded, however, malta would make commitment today. indeed, many country eu comparable agreement manage obtain good deal malta much large term market size, also enter additional commitments. eea countries, example, indeed participate eu programmes, also offer substantial rebate loan-related interest payment commit nearly ecu 500 million direct grant project specific eu regions. in words, eea country contribute eu’s financial resources, specifically eu’s regional policy, without member eu. in addition, well know membership eea imply take large part eu acquis, whether past, present future, without say decision-making process. nor obligation come line acquis unique eea. a case switzerland, efta eea country, eu’s trade partner increasingly require approximate national law eu precondition access market13. the second conclusion emerge analysis, therefore, malta seek negotiate advantageous form association agreement, exporter able secure improve access eu partner maltese government make commitment area cover present agreement, include commitment achieve legal equivalence eu acquis. pressure liberalise, cost restructure obligation legal equivalence arise irrespective eu membership it could argue non-member pace legal equivalence would achieve would slow imply current enlargement calendar. in practice, however, difference time subtle. it must forget nine country also 10 in addition, recent study world trade organisation show one region low concentration regional trade arrangements, situation expect change much medium-term. see footnote 7

“businesses benefit economic environment trade facilitate adaptation harmonisation regulatory provision concern free movement goods, standards, right establishment, property rights.” 4 bi review 69/2002 join, mean shortly complete access enlarge eu market, also reciprocal trade agreement eu third countries. if local business lose competition new source, therefore, administrative burden financial outlay associate achievement legal equivalence adoption eu technical standard bear within time frame available candidate countries, irrespective whether malta join eu not. yet even compliance achieve schedule, arrangement membership malta would able tap market cover eu reciprocal agreement negotiate individual bilateral agreement country question. give malta’s limit negotiate capacity, combine slow pace conclusion agreement tend proceed also high degree protection many develop countries, seem unrealistic objective. this time malta already start graduate general system preference (gsp) develop country grant non-reciprocal preferential trade access le develop countries. for example, malta graduate gsp scheme usa end last year. in addition, pressure mount develop country wto extend preferential treatment accord subset wto member members, preferential treatment give malta country accord wto member lose case. in non-membership scenario, moreover, eu-malta income gap would tend widen new member continue reform conducive attract fdi. indeed recent study show eu decision open negotiation first-wave accession country reinforce fdi flow countries. this implication catching-up process, country absorb high amount fdi normally continue attract bulk new investment late years.14 so scale fdi flow malta fail keep go candidate countries, malta could easily fall behind country term gdp growth live standards. this time ceecs already absorb around 33% fdi flow eu emerge markets, region increasingly become dominant sphere eu investors.15 it is, therefore, paramount importance pace reform accelerated, irrespectively whether malta join eu not.16 against background, appear secure access eu market become increasingly difficult non-member. membership, hand, promise immediate benefit local exporters, product make malta would complete access eu, would also benefit preferential treatment eu receive various reciprocal trade agreement third countries, without need malta negotiate separate agreement without subject country origin limitations. the extent benefit could substantial eu merely reciprocal trade agreement northern eastern european country southern mediterranean partners, also finalised, close finalising, similar agreement distant country regional blocs, include mexico, south africa, chile, mercosur17 gulf co-operation council18. for many local firm eu membership would also translate opportunity outsource input cheaply, consumer wide choice cheap products. 14 this follow fact transnational corporation often react prospect large market arise regional arrangement establish integrate production distribution network within region question. 15 eurostat, european union foreign direct investment yearbook 2000. moreover, accord unctad’s late world investment report, poland, czech republic, russian federation, hungary slovakia absorb around seventy-five per cent world fdi flow eastern europe 2001. 16 stay eu also likely negative implication malta’s credit rating. in recent report, example, fitch credit rat agency note that: “staying would damage malta’s creditworthiness unless new government clearly determine retain develop part eu acquis start enhance efficiency competitiveness maltese economy.” 17 argentina, brazil, paraguay uruguay. 18 bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar, saudi arabia unite arab emirate bi review 69/2002 5 eu membership would also pose challenges. for example, membership imply free trade agreement, malta would apply eu’s common external tariff (cet) import third countries. upon close examination, however, seem unlikely major problem. for start, malta’s custom duty non-eu import already roughly line cet, much change would necessary. furthermore, cet forego case non-eu country benefit preferential access eu market, especially case raw materials. this mean import purchase alternative sources, possibly enlarge eu market, non-eu country enjoy access eu market. finally, cet also suspend import raw material re-exported outside eu finish product19. so cost production sector economy may increase, turn could implication inflation, least short-run, impact likely minimal practice. a member malta would also assume eu’s commitment non-reciprocal agreement develop countries. whereas could negative implication specific sectors, economy whole effect unlikely significant enduring. this proportion import country malta’s import bill marginal. second, cotonou agreement, eu’s relevant agreement regard, expire 2008, time expect supersede economic partnership agreement base reciprocity.20 if anything, therefore, eu network reciprocal trade agreement increase. within year importer consumer thus le access duty-free imports, short-run increase inflation neutralised. third, opportunity cost stay eu increase export-oriented firms.21 and finally, since acp (african, caribbean pacific) country party cotonou agreement important source raw material eu itself, duty-free access raw material actually benefit malta import raw material needs. in process local firm would, course, also become subject competition country cover reciprocal trade agreement eu, inefficient high-cost producer malta could well drive market. to great extent, however, adjustment already take place, least removal import levy well underway. thus, could increase costs, effect unemployment limited. in case, government eu mechanism design assist uncompetitive firms. it could also argue job loss inevitable really want give consumer good deal promote competitiveness domestic firms. a short-term increase unemployment, moreover, could well reversed. this unrealistic expectation. investor non-eu country find would good position tap enlarge eu market consolidate activity new member access market separately. the opportunity enlargement would provide investor underestimate give europe region great concentration regional trade agreement third countries, also region high proportion import outsource partner cover agreements. the resultant increase employment opportunity compensate job lose restructuring. the prospect access large market not, course, alone guarantee large inflow fdi. investment decision base solely consideration market size. unfortunately, malta disadvantage term relevant criterion resource endowment transport costs. such deficiencies, therefore, make factors, include sound 19 it could also argue additional tax revenue application cet import non-eu country would make least partly loss arise removal duty intra-eu trade trade eu partner cover reciprocal agreements. 20 the cotonou agreement additionally foresee number develop country continue receive non-reciprocal access eu market agreement type expect decline, although could remain certain degree asymmetry time take account specific need develop countries. 21 it also relevant mention although malta benefit directly pre-accession fund available accession country eastern europe, maltese company may already bid contract award project finance one fund question. (instrument structural policy pre-accession) the benefit would probably lose loose form agreement eu. 6 bi review 69/2002 macroeconomic framework, political stability, high productivity levels, transparent simplify regulatory framework, assurance business productive activity conduct line internationally accept standards. this would, course, hold true whether malta join eu not. cost participation international forum obviate eu membership while eu membership also entail administrative burden associate participation eu institutions, time help strengthen malta’s presence international fora. a malta capacity present every forum, would strong position member large block. one could, course, argue would also achieve scenarios. experience suggest otherwise however. for example, despite effort make create coalition small state decision-making body organisation world trade organisation, international monetary fund world bank, despite fact specific problem small state universally recognised, effort prove largely futile. the situation expect change near future view difference among small state themselves.22 a eu member, moreover, since malta’s representation eu decision-making body would proportionate population, voice would stand good chance heard, least accede country also small could potential ally issue common concern. indeed malta’s recent experience

this lead third conclusion. if, irrespective whether malta join eu, local producer service provider continue influence decision take eu, give channel malta could possibly gain good representation international forum well-developed, malta would probably strong bargain position eu member. the macroeconomic discipline aspect eu membership a club, eu membership access privilege associate entail obligation contribute common budget. now debate whether join eu far focus almost exclusively whether malta would net contributor recipient eu funding.24 a decision momentous implication cannot, however, base issue relate post-accession funding, time-bound mechanism design help lag eu region catch affluent ones. for apart broad geo-political social considerations, eu membership represent concrete, long-term response challenge develop modern economy capacity generate wealth sustainable manner. in case ireland, portugal, spain greece, eu indeed prove effective mechanism purpose. this eu

69/2002 1 david dodge: stay course speech mr david dodge, governor bank canada, panel discussion banco de méxico, mexico city, 12 november 2002. * * * the dramatic event last two year grow concern near-term prospect global economy create climate policy-makers focus current economic development lose sight longer-term goals. there's natural tendency focus now, use tool readily hand deal today's problems, without proper regard long-term consequences. it's easy forget hard-learned lesson past overlook longer-term fundamental necessary support strong recovery sustain positive economic performance time. what fundamentals? mr. greenspan, open remark conference, talk importance fundamentals, go way back adam smith. what's interest thing change much. but reach far history guide principles. we look four key principle emerge part oecd consensus 1980s. the first principle relate monetary policy. it basically recognize price stability appropriate goal monetary policy medium term. policy-makers advise respond symmetrically, forward-looking manner, excess demand supply keep economy even keel, thus achieve price stability maximize output medium term. the second principle apply fiscal policy need discipline approach manage public purse. rise debt level age population make clear concrete action necessary eliminate deficit put debt-to-gdp ratio firmly decline path. automatic stabilizer still allow work economic downturns. but good times, surplus would generate would help preserve budget balance keep debt-to-gdp ratio downward trend. the third principle focus need wide-ranging structural reform reduce rigidity inefficiencies. this mean remove burdensome regulation legislative restriction eliminate wasteful government expenditure distortionary tax subsidy systems. the fourth, final, principle call trade liberalization. it base premise free international trade country fully exploit gain increase specialization, enhance productivity, great competitiveness. these four principle liken four leg chair. the chair steady four leg length. similarly, economy stable progress make four policy fronts. but period unexpected, pronounce economic turbulence? the late worldwide economic slowdown increase pressure policy-makers take action number fronts. some encourage erect trade barrier order protect favour national sector foreign competition. but experience show beggar-thy-neighbour policy impose cost rest domestic economy, also undermine global economic welfare. other policy-makers advise forget structural reform short term, fear exacerbate economic weakness. unfortunately, approach virtually guarantee suboptimal performance future maximize long-term cost deal structural problem – many cases, sow seed future crises. in many countries, weak economic growth, couple rise government expenditures, recently lead deteriorate fiscal position, reverse hard-won gain make past decade. to extent result drive automatic stabilizer place, unavoidable desirable short run. but policy-makers careful call extensive, discretionary fiscal measure take stabilization purposes. such measure typically take effect long need 2 bi review 69/2002 additional stimulus passed, often difficult reverse. in end, often simply weaken country's structural budget position. without doubt, suitable tool deal short-term cyclical problem economy monetary policy. it flexible, easily reversible, general scope. if monetary policy allow perform function, inordinate pressure other, le appropriate, instrument policies. but let clear: say use monetary policy allow u avoid take necessary step three fronts. for example, inappropriate erect trade barrier say need monetary stimulus. it inappropriate allow rigidity build economy call central bank provide stimulus. the right thing continue work steady three leg chair use monetary policy appropriately. central banker must guard turn monetary policy source instability. so too, bottom line never lose sight longer-term objective low stable inflation. the prevail worldwide economic weakness, together geopolitical uncertainty financial market volatility, lead significant monetary ease countries. this ease broadly appropriate and, cases, indeed even may needed. but extremely important monetary authority keep eye firmly economic horizon. by concentrate development 18 24 month ahead, ensure critical medium-term objective met, short-term need economy also addressed. monetary policy-makers also wary take many additional responsibilities, try stabilize selective market assets. this say pay attention happen financial markets. we certainly should. these market convey important information future developments. and exert direct indirect influence real economy. but monetary authority must resist siren call active management financial market plea regular intervention help stabilize asset prices. it would unfortunate repeat costly past mistake sake near-term expediency. canada, like countries, commit four principle sound economic performance: low stable inflation, fiscal prudence, structural reform, trade liberalization. a country, make great progress four front recent years. of course, pressure emerge threaten undermine commitments. these pressure resist vigorously. while particular interest group unhappy resistance, canadian public whole support sound policies. canadian remain convince authority follow policies; household consumption investment smes continue strong. even face geopolitical international economic uncertainties, sound medium-term policy help maintain strong domestic demand. to conclude, current uncertainty dissipate, strong growth resume, provide continue pursue sound macro, trade, structural policies. what important anticipate institutions, structures, policy want place late turbulence subsides, focus narrowly present. although near-term challenge face may seem daunting, would unfortunate if, attempt deal them, impair prospect future growth improve economic performance. canada commit stay course. the true, i hope, country gather today. we important responsibility make sure lesson learned, continue strong commitment prudent policies, understand broadly. bi review 69/2002 1 nout wellink: current issue european monetary policy address dr nout wellink, president nederlandsche bank president bank international settlements, euro seminar: “a test faith” tokyo, japan, 26 november 2002. * * * it always satisfy u closely involve birth euro see widespread interest new currency is. actually, birth new currency respect similar birth child. you prepare both, soon learn cannot fully control develops. both child currency develop life – frequently face unexpected challenges. similarly, please others take interest child. i think i safely say birth pain new currency concentrate ‘normal’ challenge monetary policy. my colleague bank japan certainly well aware fact challenge continue develop. in respect much learn other. consistent observation, comment today immediate outlook euro area monetary policy. instead i dwell issue – large extent – topical discussion central bank around world. they include risk deflation, risk financial stability, cope oil price hikes, fiscal policy development enlargement monetary union. i hope comment provide insight way approach issue within eurosystem. be risk deflation? let begin respond question potential deflation euro area. a number country around world currently experience fall prices. in contrast, alan greenspan note consider u close deflation cliff. before discuss euro area situation, let first note persistent deflation damage – least damage persistent inflation, risk non-linear. a small fall price need damaging, ongoing fall certainly is. there need dwell – know good i do. this aversion deflation capture ecb’s definition price stability. we define price stability year year increase consumer price le 2% seek maintain medium term. in practice, preference inflation lie within range around 1 2%. this reflect potential measurement error price index well desire avoid deflation. have flag aversion persistent deflation, let turn substance question. my answer clear – present situation i see immediate risk deflation euro area, albeit wrong reasons. service price inflation account around 40% hicp index competition sector rather low. in addition, sizeable government sector role price set many areas. both factor tend put floor price increases. our wage price set mechanism simply flexible enough allow widespread persistent deflation absence severe prolong recession. although formal wage indexation europe considerably low early decades, point nominal wage cut likely broadly accepted. similarly, nominal price decline also rather rare. deflationary risk generally arise one follow factor – burst asset price bubble, difficulty financial sector ongoing loss businesses. clearly trigger generally interconnected, reinforce other. these interdependency make deflation difficult problem impact widespread corrosive. turn discussion triggers, prolong severe recession currently experiencing. in fact, situation relatively quick recovery observe early 2002 seem stalled. part reason continue feel difficult situation hop recovery would rapid. at begin year expect economic growth would close trend end year. in fact, growth remain substantially potential year recovery unlikely gain much momentum next year. i want go reason behind now. my point simply current downturn sufficiently severe 2 bi review 69/2002 generate deflationary pressures. and i argue below, conclusion hold regard possible trigger deflation – asset price decline financial sector fragility. overall, therefore, i confident europe experience period persistent deflation – associate problem could cause. i also assure aware risk. in particular, aware difficult put deflation genie back bottle come out. if sign widespread problem emerge, act swiftly counter them. an advantage measure monetary policy response date plenty policy room available react necessary. be risk financial stability closely relate question deflation issue financial stability. a period deflation could cause by, contribute to, financial stability problem real debt burden rise borrower struggle service debt commitments. again, i expect know i do. however, let give interpretation recent development europe implication financial stability. asset price decline one concern recent stock price decline could trigger financial instability weaken balance sheet across economy. clearly significant adjustment stock price around world past year so. europe also affected. european stock price back around level see 1998 fall around 30% since begin year. nevertheless, put fall perspective, stock price remain well 1996 levels, chairman greenspan make comment irrational exuberance. this hold true even adjust inflation. regardless whether stock price high, decline magnitude see bind impact macroeconomy. at dutch central bank estimate sustain decline 30% would cumulative negative impact ½ % european growth three years. our model imply insignificant impact prices. however, estimate direct influence low stock price abstract confidence effects. a aside, interest note wealth effect change share price considerably strong unite states. for example, fall 30% u share price result cumulative negative impact 3½ percent gdp three year period. there would also negative impact consumer price little ½% three years. the different impact stem largely low extent share ownership europe us. although direct share ownership gradually spread europe, remain considerably le widespread unite states. in addition, market capitalisation percentage gdp around 70% high unite state europe. house price major component household wealth. any widespread significant decline house price would substantial effect stock price declines. this particularly true euro area, homeownership widespread direct share holdings. estimate suggest 30% fall house price would cumulative negative impact gdp 1% euro area. for u comparable figure 3%, although i note house price estimate imprecise. there sign rapid house price increase small euro area country experience come end – certainly case netherlands. however, actual decline house price seem concentrate segment house market euro area countries. in particular, concentrate expensive end market, likely interdependence adverse demand effect stem capital loss stock market. i expect substantial decline house price widespread across euro area. bank system concern the bank system part world test result current economic slowdown associate credit losses. still, european bank sector shows, broadly speaking, sign widespread distress sort might lead financial stability concerns. in fact, bank system come recent decline share prices, crisis latin bi review 69/2002 3 america, economic slowdown, rather well. european bank generally small shareholding japanese banks, exposure fall share price lower. some consider german bank system vulnerable, although i think remain fundamentally sound. there sign increase risk aversion, lender distinguish carefully rat classes. this show wide credit spread case limit lend volumes. supervisor alert trends. in netherlands continue conduct range stress test ass vulnerability financial system shocks. we closely monitor exposure particular markets, include real estate, cause problem country past. stress test monitor advantage make management financial institution aware risk face. discussion basel new capital accord also place attention stress testing. my conclusion financial stability therefore clear. there sign financial instability euro area. i hope, central bank throughout eurosystem commit ensuring, remain case. problem may experience bank indicative problem across euro area whole. in event, central bankers, include myself, continuously assess financial stability risks. i pretend always able prevent instability occurring. the world financial market change rapidly lesson learn early experience need updated. however, i hope reduce chance instability. oil prices, conflict middle east impact monetary policy let turn risk point higher, rather lower, inflation. oil price one significant influence inflation past three year remain volatile. give impact even relatively moderate oil price change inflation, volatility pose ongoing challenge monetary policymakers. the possible consequence conflict middle east increase uncertainty look ahead. oil price currently incorporate risk premium, unknown extent, regard possible middle east conflict. therefore, additional impact price conflict unknown. it also possible oil price could decline within short period time. any conflict might also result exchange rate reaction, although direction size unknown. it possible develop plausible argument strengthen u dollar. give uncertainties, i go try forecast exchange rate. if i could degree accuracy, i would probably sit side room analyst trader, rather stand central banker. whichever way exchange rate moves, impact could critical determine monetary policy reaction – europe, also countries. policy maker appreciate currency le need tighten policy – room ease – confront depreciate currencies. so, instead try achieve impossible task describe precise policy response conflict, i say something briefly framework use assess issue. an obvious sometimes overlook point ecb monetary policy base comprehensive assessment outlook price stability. this affected, solely determined, movement oil prices. to extent oil price alter outlook price stability, try look so-called first round impact, try counter second-round impact. in oil crisis 1970s, learn need prevent upward wage-price spiral developing. luckily nowadays easy achieve two reasons. firstly, le wage indexation spiral slow develop. have inflation expectation anchor low level also helps. the second key factor dependence oil lower. fiscal policy development stability growth pact let turn issue closely connect monetary policy decisions, two form part environment within operate. the first fiscal policy. while central banker sometimes face challenge fiscal policy makers, i think euro area rather unique – stem fact monetary union sovereign states. within europe clarity consensus institutional framework cover relationship fiscal monetary 4 bi review 69/2002 policy. despite consensus, discussion continue detail implementation framework. a know, number country make insufficient progress towards fiscal consolidation recent years. some country go reach balanced-budget position 2004, intended. more seriously, several have, likely to, post deficit exceed 3% gdp. the lacklustre economic climate obviously play part explain fiscal slippage. equally obviously, several country fail make sufficient consolidation effort early period robust economic growth. instead, take advantage growth year low tax raise spend mistake belief good year would never end. sadly, one life’s lesson good thing eventually come end. country follow rule suffer consequences. again, analogy child come mind. a parent knows, child need clear rule – rule need enforced. both parent monetary policy maker understand need consistent credibility maintained. we’ve learn hard way. the rule life apply fiscal policy. credibility suffer promise do. moreover, rule adhere to, problem could also develop area common european policy. enforcement mechanism lack credibility. in sense, risk loss credibility concern current development euro area fiscal policy. everyone agree return large fiscal deficit 1970s. that simply crowd private sector investment. the importance reach sound fiscal position reinforce need plan ahead fiscal consequence population ageing. postpone adjustment make easy – problem disappear. have country undertake necessary fiscal consolidation good year reach position fiscal balance, 3% deficit limit impose treaty would sufficient deal slowdown. however, keep current event perspective. the budget deficit euro area whole expect 2% gdp 2002 2003. by way comparison, u deficit expect 3% years. enlargement european union european monetary union the last issue i want discus today concern european enlargement. a know, 10 country likely join european union 2004. two year later, earliest, country could eligible join monetary union participate decision make process within ecb. some commentator argue enlargement could prove damage expand monetary union. two main argument seem given. the first decision make prove impossible within large group. the second economic condition accession country different rest euro area, governor vote basis national economic circumstance rather euro area developments, monetary policy set incorrect. let first cover discussion number decision makers. in comparison central banks, current size ecb’s govern council large. we 18 members. that problem take interest rate decision date. in fact, experience able efficiently discus key issue reach decisions. nevertheless, cannot continue expand council without limit. however, problem is, view, largely one perception. there concern unable take decision efficiently enlargement may lead focus national developments, rather euro area whole. to address concerns, rotation model might introduce would restrict number national central bank governor vote point time. the unite state federal reserve us form rotation federal open market committee. however, let stress i expect substance discussion decision change. the fact continue participate discussions, even vote, facilitate continuity. our focus continue euro area whole. bi review 69/2002 5 conclusion look key issue currently face u ecb, seem new currency rapidly ‘grown up’. our challenge long uniquely associate birth euro. instead, mostly concern issue challenge central bank around world. that doesn’t make job easier, least mean move uncharted territory. of course, financial market analyst medium also get use issue confront with, style deal issues. i think come age currency also reflect comment attract analyst media. there seem increase understand try go it. there is, naturally, always room improvement. i hope comment today make contribution respect add understand go monetary policy formulation within europe. bi review

difficult firm household work whether price product buy sell change relative goods, whether change overall price level. such confusion lead firm produce, least temporarily, wrong level output. and many firm make mistake time result unnecessary fluctuation aggregate output. another decision affect uncertainty price investment. many investment specific particular model product, become sink costs. for irreversible investment may pay wait invest since time resolve uncertainty. a premiership football team may decide postpone construction new stadium survival league assured. or car manufacturer may postpone decision open new plant see rise demand temporary appear likely last. and uncertainty could stem difficulty disentangle relative absolute prices. in language finance, option value wait uncertainty return irreversible investment. so project must offer rate return sufficient cover cost finance project, also option value waiting. that may explain survey firm show hurdle rate return often well excess cost either equity debt finance. for example cbi survey last year find average real hurdle rate uk firm 11.3% - rate around 15% survey conduct 1994 - still well cost financial capital. if uncertainty inflation create option value waiting, reduce investment. and grow bi review 68/2002 9 empirical evidence inflation key explanatory variable cross-country difference investment output ratios.5 (ii) redistribution wealth debtor creditors. unexpected change price level - standard value use define contract - produce arbitrary redistribution wealth. a keynes write powerful advocacy price stability a tract monetary reform, “we leave save private investor. we leave responsibility set production business man. these arrangement great advantages. but cannot work properly money, assume stable measuring-rod, undependable. unemployment, precarious life worker, disappointment expectation, sudden loss savings, profiteer - proceed, large measure, instability standard value”. or, lenin remarked, best way destroy capitalism debauch currency. it arguable whether high inflation serious deflation result great economic damage. in europe 1920s hyperinflation undermine economic social arrangements, do recently latin america. but deflation prove unpopular inflation. in 274 a.d. roman emperor aurelian try restore integrity coinage adulterate workman mint. aurelian exchange good money bad, order destruction account draw devalue currency. in long run operation restore value money. but short run cause hardship. gibbon, decline fall roman empire, observe “a temporary grievance nature scarcely excite support serious civil war”. unfortunately, take different keynesian view long run dead, population time rise insurrection. many find dead short run well, seven thousand soldier countless civilian perish suppression uprising. so let u consider cost wealth redistribution arise unanticipated deflation. such redistribution low aggregate demand. why? since difficult either borrow insure uncertain future employment earn opportunities, current asset act buff stock make possible smooth consumption face shock future prospects. when net worth small risky run buff stock even further, marginal propensity spend wealth much high household low net worth family whose asset comfortably exceed liabilities. if significant number debtor little net worth - recent first-time house-buyers high debt-to-value ratio prime example - unanticipated deflation could cause sharp fall aggregate consumption spending. such effect amplify spend - consumption investment - depend value asset use collateral loans. a fall price produce vicious circle initial fall demand low asset prices, reduce value collateral, turn lead borrower repay debt, exacerbate original decline aggregate demand. this “debt deflation” first formulate clearly irving fisher 1930s, recently revive sophisticate form nobu kiyotaki john moore, london school economics. because deflation are, fortunately, far between, lack hard empirical evidence quantitative significance debt deflation. in 1993, i argue depth recession uk u early 1990s result debt deflation. consumption fell sharply would expect give movement income interest rates, reflect unexpected fall inflation asset prices. the effect consumption negative equity house particularly severe. the experience japan may add knowledge area, although, show chart 6, despite stagnant economy past decade, deflation consumer price especially large. and i confident central bank best prevent sample size country suffer serious deflation

(iii) aversion long-term contract excessive resource devote hedge inflation risks. a seen, high inflation go hand hand great uncertainty future inflation. inflation is, therefore, associate positive risk premium compensate investor uncertainty. the long time horizon, great risk premium likely be. that discourage long-term contract interest rate contract often depend upon future spot interest rates. floating-rate mortgage good example. with floating-rate mortgage borrower expose risk sharp fluctuation proportion income devote debt service, many household britain still remember late 1980s interest rate double 15%. fixed-rate mortgage eliminate risk, cost introduce new risk: real value outstanding debt may change relative value house. john campbell joão cocco (2002) suggest superior contract would fixed-rate mortgage principal index-linked. that would reduce income capital risk. for whatever reason market generate many private-sector index-linked contracts, despite encouragement high inflation past. perhaps risk generate exogenous process, policy decisions. in event, price stability good alternative indexation. the move regime high inflation one price stability consequence best illustrate house market. a credible move inflation target bring inflation expectation relatively quickly, even lag. chart 7 show inflation expectations, measure surveys, fell steadily follow introduction inflation targeting, anchor 2.5% target. but move low inflation consequence may le easily understood. price stability mean low nominal interest rates, low mortgage interest payments. it may also mean low real interest rate inflation risk premium falls. but fall nominal rate likely much large fall real rates. the low mortgage payment largely reflect rise effective duration loan inflation long erode real value debt quickly before. in low inflation world, nominal income rise slowly real burden service debt persists. it may take long household work bi review 68/2002 11 impact low inflation real interest rate realise rate increase price everyday purchase fallen. learn take time. chart 7 one-year ahead inflation expectation inflation outturn uk, 1988-2002 note: inflation four quarter change rpi. expect inflation base quarterly barclays basix survey inflation one year ahead. it weight average across survey sub-groups, exclude general public. expect inflation lag year chart, expectation outturn period compared. source: ons basix. one possible consequence slow adjustment low inflation household may mistake much reduction nominal interest rate permanent fall real rate. a result, asset price bid level prove unsustainable learn finally occur - lse know time learn. how far theoretical argument apply british house market present difficult say, demonstrate risk current house price earn ratio close peak reach late 1980s. * * * so much cost unanticipated inflation. what cost anticipate inflation? time permit comment briefly four cost anticipate inflation note lord kingsdown. (i) distortion cash balance money - note coin - may longer, sally bowl claimed, make world go round, but, even world plastic, oil wheel transactions. cash still account large number transactions, albeit small fraction value transactions. the opportunity cost hold cash interest rate deposits. inflation raise nominal interest rate hence cost. so agent economise real money balances, incur additional cost form frequent trip cash dispenser - so-called ‘shoe-leather costs’ inflation. the traditional view cost could measure area money demand curve. such estimate typically small, leave researcher wonder cost inflation really important. but high inflation rate affect money demand. if agent economise money balances, transaction cost may rise market goods, labour assets. a argue hahn (1965) recently articulate wallace (2001), many monetary model contain hide inconsistency sense ignore credit trade friction - particular, imperfect 12 bi review 68/2002 monitor enforceability - give money essential role first place. to ass welfare implication inflation need theoretical framework take seriously role money transactions. i discuss elsewhere (king, 2001) potential importance money reduce transaction cost firm reduce liquidity premia wide range financial markets. there much learn here. (ii) incomplete indexation tax system a second cost anticipate inflation add inefficiency arise already distortionary tax system incompletely indexed. martin feldstein (1999) edit major study cost incomplete indexation include detail analysis tax distortion saving, consumption investment several major countries, bank england contributed. the benefit reduce inflation already low inflation environment estimate low uk country part tax system indexed. nevertheless, author estimate reduction inflation 2 percentage point would bring annual benefit equivalent 0.2% gdp. that may sound small, large absolute number. against that, end mortgage interest deductibility low impact. (iii) front-end load debt burden a third distortion front-loading real debt burden debt contract fix nominal terms. inflation reduce amount household borrow raise cost service loan early years. in way decision consumption investment may distorted. (iv) cost change price list the cost change price list catalogue - so-called menu cost - generally agree little direct consequence. but may produce degree nominal rigidity wage price take great significance. inflation cause relative price variability firm able change price time. the cost great relative price variability discuss above, continue active field research. recent work institute fiscal study (2002) show inflation higher, large dispersion inflation rate face individual households. this find point strongly role nominal rigidity contribute relative price dispersion. take together, verdict economics, history common sense inflation deflation costly. it clear high inflation - extreme case hyperinflation - lead breakdown economy. there considerable body empirical evidence inflation output growth negatively correlate high-inflation countries. for inflation rate single figures, impact inflation growth le clear. but study 133 market economy past 50 years, stanley fischer co-author (2002) conclude “the old idea sense inflation may good growth perhaps inevitable part growth process remain bury cemetery harmful policy ideas”. 4. price stability: mean practice? so strong case price stability. but price stability mean practice? recall definition price stability offer alan greenspan alan blind rather general nature make reference particular index price precise number inflation. there good reason this. the price good i buy may rise different rate good buy. relative price always changing. and basket good service buy today different basket could would buy fifty hundred year ago. the official retail price index include computer cable tv, long bowler hat price admission cricket matches. measurement problem mean unique way calculate inflation. information price individual commodity past find harrod catalogue publish mid-1890s 1930, catalogue army navy store 1872 1940, advertise record selfridges go back 1909. to illustrate problem bi review 68/2002 13 measure inflation, i shall draw largely historic price material kindly provide harrod - mainly catalogues, harrod news, harrod food news. no record publish 1970, supplement historical data researches. and i grateful young bank england economist apprehend food hall, suspect compare price competitor open store across road. the richness information see size catalogue 1907 - weigh six pound contain 1375 pages. in day telegraphic address harrod “everything, london”. the internet nothing harrod 1907 telephone service real people answer available take order right night despatch early next day free local delivery (as far windsor) mail elsewhere. accord catalogues, record player harrod cost £11 1910 (approximately £627 today’s money). that would buy hand-cranked machine provide low-quality sound. today, could buy record player little £39 internet, harrod good quality model £250. how much record-players increase price? ignore quality changes, price rise factor 3.5 (that is, £39/£11). but ignore vast quality improvement would surely overstate increase - quality change bias. so quantify increase quality today’s record player relative one 1910? statistically, number way deal issue: one determine price function characteristic change time. the prime example hedonic price technique use today price computers, quality characteristic - performance term speed memory - fairly accurately measured. but hedonic price way deal measurement issue, recent research suggest technique may overstate extent quality improved. be record player still relevant product, since record player today use small group enthusiast - outdated - vinyl records? perhaps computer cd (or dvd mp3) player relevant product today. from £34 buy cd player internet today. this much sophisticate piece equipment even today’s record player, feature impossible compare 1910 record player. if ignore invention market new products, introduce new product bias. to illustrate quality change new product bias, imagine go shop harrod today 1910. suppose give £350 spend - amount years. in 1910 could buy vacuum cleaner, record player, iron, camera, telephone. the vacuum clean would spread much dust removed, record player would hand-cranked iron would need fill coal. the camera would bulky awkward set up, telephone would largely silent people own one. today buy similar bundle good total outlay, would vastly superior quality. so durable good clear cost live increase all. but buy food, however, result different. unlike appliances, many food item 1910 unchanged today - mcvitie’s digestive biscuits, quaker oats, rose’s lime juice, bournville cocoa, frank cooper’s oxford marmalade, marmite, heinz bake bean colman’s mustard familiar item precise comparison year possible. in 1910 could feed 10p day eat marmite hovis toast breakfast; eggs, bacon toast lunch; heinz bean toast dinner; pint milk drink. the menu, consist exactly brand products, would cost £4.80 today. the food basket increase price factor 48. a vacuum cleaner, want one 1910, cost £229. that 6 year worth food base menu use previous example. a vacuum clean item luxury owner would invite friend round ‘hoover parties’ show prize possession. over years, price food increase nominal term factor 48, price vacuum clean stay roughly same. today still buy vacuum clean £229. but 47 day food shopping, rather 6 years. a vacuum clean become cheap relative food, people buy - ignore change would introduce substitution bias. if degree substitutability products, rational consumer would take account change relative prices, weight particular good consumption bundle may 14 bi review 68/2002 changed. the overall result substitution expenditure share electrical appliances6 change much, least past 50 years. if ignore fact vacuum clean rare luxury item 1910 apply today’s quantity calculate 1910 consumption basket, would greatly understate increase average cost living. and, course, harrod today exactly typical place go shop - much talk 1910 suburban shop centres, internet shopping. ignore development retail practice introduce outlet bias. have bias remain constant years, would le issue measure retail price inflation, clearly not. quality change bias, new product bias, substitution bias outlet bias - issue boskin commission discuss report measure inflation unite states.7 the find report, generate wide national international interest, u cpi might overstate change cost live 0.8 1.6 percentage point per year. the example i give show difficult measure change price level time. precision had. accord official retail price index, general level retail price rise factor 52 1910 2002. but change nature good service available, nature retail selling, make comparison treacherous. doe matter price stability? probably not. the greenspan-blinder definition price stability suggest know price stability see it, rather, stop hear inflation. there nothing mystical rpix measure inflation, figure 2.5%. but important precise numerical target easy understand order provide anchor inflation expectation mpc hold accountable. 5. monetary policy next decade: challenges? although inflation target deliver many benefit low inflation promise ten year ago, remain real challenge monetary policy next decade. two question prominent recently. first, inflation target enough? second, deflation, inflation, main threat present? be inflation target enough? do rapid increase asset price pose threat stability, even though inflation target deliver steady growth low inflation? some commentator suggest monetary policy target asset price addition inflation.8 but asset prices, would mean interest rates? house price rise rapidly, ratio average earn reach previous peak late 1980s. that might suggest interest rate higher. sterling six year around 30% high euro (or predecessors) before, trade deficit grow profitability manufacture fall two-thirds. that might suggest interest rate lower. equity price rise 120% 1995 2000, fall 40% subsequently. presumably would imply first high low interest rates. what mean asset price cannot sensibly view isolation, context economy whole. i believe that, although justifiable concern recent movement asset prices, policy dilemma analyse within framework inflation target uk. no honest person actually know “equilibrium” level asset prices. they dominate expectation price investor pay asset future. the relevant uncertainty rarely quantify observe frequency event past. and response asset price change monetary policy also unpredictable. so target asset price directly virtually impossible. but change asset price major impact level spend mpc devote considerable time question change affect policy. 6 electrical appliance audio-visual equipment share 0.021 1956 0.018 2002. 7 see boskin m et al (1996) ‘towards more accurate measure cost living’. final report senate finance committee advisory committee study consumer price index. 8 the rigorous statement case stabilise asset price dupor (2002). bi review 68/2002 15 the immediate question whether change asset price lead imbalance within economy pose risk large negative demand shock point future. i believe answer yes; big risk extremely difficult judge, appropriate policy response far clear. beneath surface overall stability uk economy lie remarkable imbalance buoyant consumer house sector, one hand, weak external demand, other. a summary statistic imbalance, table 4 show unite kingdom growth real domestic demand exceed growth output le 7½% five year 2002 q1, five year period 1980s major country recent past. even optimistic mr micawber would realise cannot continue indefinitely. how then, timescale, imbalance unwind?

it important recognise fall price manufacture good general deflation. in fact price stability, sense inflation rate overall around 2½% year, likely mean price manufacture good will, average, rise all. fast productivity growth manufacture services, average around 2% last twenty years, mean price service rise fast manufacture goods. and rise sterling past five year increase difference inflation rate two sectors. table 5 show inflation rate good service major economies. positive rate inflation services, account around half consumer spending, show deflation world economy still way off. in country past decade gap good service price inflation reflect productivity differences. that gap widen somewhat recent year increase competition new producer drive price tradable goods. but strike feature table extent difference increase le 5.7 percentage point uk, much u turn gap large elsewhere. exchange rate movement largely responsible differences. the extent service inflation rise relative good inflation another manifestation imbalance within uk economy. table 5 total, good service inflation uk u euro area japan cpi inflation (year aug 2002) 1.9 1.7 2.2 –0.9 cpi good –1.1 –0.1 1.4 –1.6 cpi service 4.6 3.1 3.3 0.0 service - good infl. 5.7 3.2 1.9 1.6 service - good infl.

4%. elsewhere, deflation remote. all serf remind u that, single instrument, monetary policy cannot ensure inflation target output trend time. to suppose otherwise believe “myth straight line”, nigel lawson describe it. monetary policy reduce, eliminate, fluctuation output. cycle real activity sometimes reflect behaviour outside influence monetary policy. a lawson (1994) put it, “i find wholly unconvincing believe credit cycle cause simply mistake monetary policy. of course, mistake exacerbate cycle; cycle would without them. there way monetary authority fine-tune bank lending, fine-tune expectations”. that framework introduce 1997 explicitly recognise mpc would attempt bring inflation back target immediately follow large shock. a result inflation might deviate 2.5% target one percentage point. that would require governor write bi review 68/2002 17 open letter chancellor. ed ball explain oxford lecture 2001, “some assume [the requirement write open letter] exist chancellor discipline mpc inflation go outside target range. in fact opposite true. in face supply-shock, big jump oil price, push inflation way target, mpc could get inflation back 2.5 per cent quickly draconian interest rate response - expense stability, growth jobs. any sensible monetary policymaker would want measure stability-oriented strategy get inflation back target. and open letter system allow sensible approach explain mpc allow chancellor publicly endorse it.” that apply supply shock, also demand shock might follow large movement asset prices. both challenge policy future one aspect common: make u think carefully consequence current policy inflation well future. asset price raise question far one err side caution imbalance build up. deflation make u aware risk zero low bind interest rate might bind future. they imply while, normal circumstances, monetary policy focus meet inflation target eighteen month two year ahead, practise may necessary look even ahead consequence present actions. but deflect monetary policy task keep inflation track meet target medium term, word achieve price stability. 6. conclusion when lord kingsdown address lse ten year ago, say departure exchange rate mechanism, offer opportunity - “an opportunity demolish image unite kingdom second-rate inflation-prone economy”. i believe opportunity taken. today uk low stable inflation. and come

philadelphia feed policy forum crises, contagion coordination: issue policymakers global economy, philadelphia, 22 november 2002. * * * first i want express thank organizer invite interest conference. let especially thank tony santomero everything do previous capacity inspire assist u riksbank year academic adviser. i wish you, tony, every success president philadelphia feed important policy maker u.s. i think one say central banker around world never central well respect position past decade. their task seem well define job deliver price stability work rather well. much mystique typically surround central bank gradually disappeared. openness transparency become key word day. moreover, research concern monetary policy make good progress past decade. the world central bank indeed undergo positive changes. however, would dangerous us, central bankers, sit relax belief important problem field monetary policy resolve need consideration. one aspect indeed need think issue financial cycle could mitigate whether monetary policy play role so. let say word this. before i become involve central bank i state secretary sweden’s ministry finance early 1990s dealt, among things, management nation’s bank crisis. be middle crisis like indeed frighten experience. financial crisis would seem evolve excessive optimism. that is, credit expansion (domestic foreign), fee asset prices, low cost capital, stimulate investment subsequently lead economic boom. eventually, investment find sustainable generate profits. the whole structure may ultimately collapse, economy move boom bust, often follow bank currency crisis combination two. the severe bubble historically involve rapid credit expansion bank system. economic history book full example process. also, 1990s provide many illustration similar events. the discussion financial cycle far new. one example major debate 1920s 1930s austrian (hayek, etc.) one hand, keynes other. keynes focus demand side get bust, whereas hayek focus supply side economy get bust first place. while great deal do understand reason behind financial instability, many question remain unsolved. so discussion continue come crisis prevention, two conventional piece policy advice seem emerge. the first line defense moral suasion. the central bank could warn market participant various way become overly optimistic expectation future cash flows, talk instance stock real estate. the problem moral suasion difficult calm market rush new highs. talk rather action often enough. still, bubble start build up, may worth try. this one reason several central bank begin publish financial stability reports. in way one perhaps broaden public discussion happening. the second line defense prudential regulation. however, way prudential regulation do practice raise two, interrelate problems. the first fact financial crisis stem individual bank get difficulty affect others contagion. rather, cases, many institution act le similarly, encourage overoptimistic expectation macroeconomic condition extrapolate uncritically future. the second problem prudential regulation tool often base perception risk independent credit asset price cycle itself. on one hand, underlie actual risk 2 bi review 68/2002 build expansion leverage continue financial cycle proceed on hand, apparent risk decline rise collateral values. this cause difficulty supervisor tend concentrate individual institution treat risk exogenous. this deny improve prudential regulation, set international standard (for example basle ii) etc, risk financial instability significantly reduced. supervisor also recognize shortcoming i mention increasingly focus development generate systemic macroeconomic risk construct built-in mechanism dampen financial amplification business cycle. for example, supervisor try encourage stress-testing private sector risk manager enable good see asset market misalignments. another way make provision practice forward-looking present adopt conservative, le cyclically sensitive measure value. the idea build capital cushion good time use bad times. hence financial cycle could milder. whether improve prudential regulations, supervisory practice risk management technique suffice avoid financial cycle future remain seen. our experience far does, however, leave doubt this. this bring u possible third line defense could least principle use prevent large financial cycles. i course think monetary policy the argument since live fiat money system, exogenous constraint supply credit except monetary authorities. if reaction gear exclusively control inflation, monetary anchor may counter build-up credit immediately lead inflation price current output. hence, little prevent emergence cycle price real financial asset include measure inflation. in addition, experience teach u price stability not, itself, sufficient ensure financial stability. so don’t central bank simply change way conduct monetary policy also try prevent financial cycles? well, conventional view not. there powerful argument central bank try respond credit expansion “misalignments” asset price lead inflation good services. first, know bubble bubble reflection fundamental values? second, even central bank recognize emerge bubble want prevent build up, time could form judgement this, would late. third, central bank fortunate recognition timing, still risk cause economic recession. to effect excessive optimism future return financial assets, monetary response might be. nevertheless, cost financial cycle sufficiently large warrant exploration several avenue mitigate should, mind, exclude possibility monetary policy actions. i’m say central bank target asset price per se. stock price real estate price rise fall many reasons. in view, however, central bank need observant notable increase asset price one several imbalance build even inflation good service show sign rising. such imbalance could combination strong credit growth, rapidly rise investment mark deterioration private sector’s financial balance. i mean imply determine situation way particular easy. my point monetary policy exclude priori scenario like this. there many difficult assessment central bank make. here i think variable like economy’s potential growth rate, output gap nairu etc. why identify asset market misalignments, excessive credit growth rapid decline private financial balance difficult form opinion variable these? my view monetary policy respect course closely bind experience swedish bank crisis, also line central bank’s mandate achieve long-run price stability. if anything, financial crisis substantially increase risk outright deflation time. the central bank could manage risk two ways: least try prevent bubble build tighten monetary policy early stage, loosen monetary policy aggressively bubble build burst anyway. to mind, action would line focus long-run price stability, whether central bank follow explicit implicit inflation target approach. although i leave job governor bank sweden towards end year, i qualm forecast financial stability remain agenda key challenge financial authority many year come. bi review 67/2002 1 roger w ferguson, jr: financial engineer financial stability speech mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, annual

industries. new financial instrument allow risk transfer willing, presumably able, assume manage them. and new risk-measurement technique form basis meaningful public disclosure firms’ risk profiles. but use new instrument result large well-documented loss firms, firm use new instrument hide loss traditional activities. policymakers generally support use derivative new risk-transfer mechanism regulate unregulated entities. policymakers try create incentive risk mitigation seek address potential pitfall combination regulatory oversight market discipline. however, raise concern potential effect new risk-management technique stability financial system whole. in effect, argue even individual firm manage risk prudently effectively, aggregate effect activity may make financial system le stable. a i shall make clear, i believe potential new instrument technique produce instability overestimated. nonetheless, argument deserve careful consideration, policymakers financial industry professional well. if argument correct, new instrument technique would likely provide le protection firm use assume. today i review three specific topic raise discussion instrument techniques: (1) dynamic hedge options, especially option prepay fixed-rate mortgages, (2) so-called herd induce common risk-management techniques, (3) concentration counterparty credit risk produce credit derivatives. in case i shall first evaluate concern consider market would function absence new instrument techniques. dynamic hedge mortgage the development market home mortgage past two decade dramatically alter role traditional financial intermediation depository institutions. let illustrate change. in 1980, depository institutions, primarily save loan associations, hold two-thirds home mortgage portfolios. that proportion fall le one-third today. over period, share mortgage securitized rise 10 percent 59 percent. of course, intermediary still play vital support role today’s mortgage market originate service mortgage hold mortgage-backed security investment portfolios. the interest rate risk inherent home mortgage still present mortgage-backed securities. the risk simply transfer originator mortgage investor, presumably will able manage risk. nevertheless, even able, manage risk significant challenge. the challenge manage prepayment risk. prepayment risk arise mortgage borrower right prepay mortgage time without penalty. the right prepay enormously popular--and therefore almost surely permanent--element mortgage finance unite states. when market rate fall, holder fixed-rate mortgage find principal repay borrower refinance new lower-rate mortgage. when market rate rise, prepayment rate drop dramatically. 2 bi review 67/2002 one common strategy hedge interest rate risk mortgage-backed security short fixed-income instruments, ten-year treasury note interest rate swaps. but unlike fixed-income securities, mortgage-backed security carry prepayment risk, cause change level interest rate change amount treasury swap one need short effective hedge. specifically, interest rate fall, prepayment increase, result, amount ten-year treasury need hedge falls. thus, reduce short position ten-year treasuries, hedger must buy ten-year treasury price rising. this point concern emerge financial engineer may lead high market volatility. such “dynamic” hedger mortgage-backed-securities adopt strategy require buy bond price bond rising. conversely, must sell bond price bond falling. put another way, always reinforce current direction market never “leaning wind.” clearly, hedging-related transaction large relative underlie market, hedge strategy could make significant demand market liquidity lead high market volatility. that theoretical argument behind concern dynamic hedge mortgage could exacerbate volatility fixed-income markets. to see whether concern theoretical curiosity practical, two question must answered. first, hedging-related transaction large relative underlie market? second, could mechanism hedge prepayment risk small impact volatility therefore hedge risk effectively? on first question, research market observation suggest hedging-related transaction large enough effect underlie fixed-income markets, effect small dissipate relatively quickly. research federal reserve bank new york cover year 1996 2000 also monetary policy tighten spring 1994 find hedging-related effect present u.s. dollar interest rate movements. although effect large enough detectable, small relative overall interest rate volatility last long six weeks. market participant describe market condition november december 2001 unique combination circumstance make hedging-related effect much strong usual. these circumstance include recent history decline mortgage rate (which increase prepayment risk), sharp unanticipated rise market rate november december, low market liquidity month right year-end, general reduction activity september 11. even factors, market participant estimate temporary hedging-related effect ten-year treasury yield 25 basis points--again, measurable small effect. accord market reports, hedging-related effect underlie fixed-income market appear mute far year, despite record volume mortgage refinance thus far second half 2002 surpass last year’s peak. turn second question, market participant way hedge prepayment risk besides dynamic hedge sort i described. one way acquisition interest rate options, either buy option, so-called swaption, issue callable debt option embed it. this allow holder mortgage hedge prepayment risk without dynamic hedging. the fact hedger alternative dynamic hedge weaken link hedge volatility. at time, suggest hedge prepayment risk buy interest option begin affect price dynamic option market. clearly complicate force work. how hedge prepayment risk affect market cash derivative fixed-income instrument seem fruitful topic future research. also, must keep mind market participant incentive monitor limit impact dynamic hedge underlie market interaction make hedge le effective. suppose effect hedge underlie market rise substantially current low level. dynamic hedge would become le effective and, result, risk premium associate exposure interest rate risk mortgage-backed security would rise. the rise risk premium would reduce demand hedge induce homeowner switch adjustable-rate mortgages. it would also increase availability alternative dynamic hedging--more swaption writer issuer callable debt would step forward take advantage high risk premium. in short, expect market find efficient way adjust change circumstances. to evaluate performance current market-based finance model home mortgages, include effect dynamic hedging, need compare benefit cost relative bi review 67/2002 3 appropriate alternative model. in light history market, relevant alternative would seem intermediary-based finance model characterize u.s. mortgage environment 1980. give experience date, shift intermediary-based model market-based model past two decade has, balance, benefit mortgage borrowers, show strong preference fixed-rate mortgage prepay time. the value fixed-rate prepayable mortgage outstanding rise around $1 trillion 1980 almost $5 trillion today. a u probably aware, old model concentrate interest rate risk depository institutions, specifically save loans. and interest rate soar early 1980s, save loan industry suffer huge loss collateral effect real economy. in comparison, market-based model clearly seem spread interest rate risk mortgage throughout economy, depository institution still bear risk investment mortgage-backed security callable debt. what lesson policymakers? i suggest two. first, policymakers still need fulfill traditional supervisory role. they need ensure regulate intermediary manage prepayment risk effectively adequate capital absorb losses. second, i would note new risk-transfer instruments, swap swaptions, play important role transfer interest rate risk mortgage broad diversify group investors. herd my second topic today concern common approach risk management, value-at-risk modeling, may promote herd behavior destabilize markets. the idea market participant use similar risk management technique may respond perceive increase riskiness position par back size position perhaps par back position market well. such response, rational perspective individual market participants, may collective unintended consequence reduce market liquidity time needed. i recognize relevance question realize herd might theoretically occur number markets. however, base observation model actually construct use financial firms, i would like outline three reason concern might overstated. first, sophistication structure risk-management model vary widely. this point apply full force value-at-risk model use commercial banks, area federal reserve knowledge supervisory oversight. our examiner observe bank implement common objective--measuring value-at-risk bank’s trade account--in highly diverse ways. give early stage development diversity implemented, use model seem likely create herd behavior. second, source diversity exist among financial firms, include difference risk appetites, customer bases, product lines. these additional source variation create considerable heterogeneity financial firms’ trade strategies, risk-taking, respond market shocks. in short, neither future model actual risk position likely similar assume observer concern potential negative implication risk management. finally, risk model are, be, one part formal risk-management process. regulator institution must overestimate role model play, play, decisionmaking. risk manager get useful information risk models. but judgment, experience, limits, procedure exception also play significant role risk management. a consequence, risk model never likely dominant driver action financial firm therefore unlikely generate significant herd behavior. a aware, model bring degree quantification rigor risk-management process badly needed. before advent models, particularly value-at-risk models, bank manager could easily compare aggregate risk various activity firm. the fixed-income desk would summarize risk term portfolio’s duration, foreign exchange desk would use net delta currency, equity desk would use portfolio standard deviation. value-at-risk put type trade risk common footing--as amount lose certain probability certain time horizon. 4 bi review 67/2002 formal risk modeling, perfect, balance improvement previous practice. in judgment, model make risk-transfer process efficient otherwise would been, proper test. formal model help firm attempt shed risk identify available hedge strategy choose strategy appropriate, give prevail market conditions. formal model help firm large risk appetite evaluate capacity absorb manage additional risk shift others. i would argue firm large risk appetite relatively will take additional risk good model manage risk. at time high market volatility, firm would still able sense firm’s risk rise even without formal risk management. but would uncertain exactly affect them. they would be, effect, fly seat pants. the uncertainty, seem clear, reduce effectiveness decisionmaking, reduce ability transfer risk someone will bear others, too, face uncertainty, therefore increase potential market simply freeze up. what role policymakers oversee growth formal risk-measurement models? first, must continue promote use best-practice risk-management model one component good risk-management system. these model enable firm good quantify risk face. have good information risk improve firm’s decisionmaking. second, remind firm formal risk model one part sound risk management. firm look output model isolation, they. for example, firm continue augment formal risk model judgmental stress testing. third, imposition rigid requirement risk model firm allow use would mistake. it would increase likelihood risk model could lead herding. also, firm constantly improve models, policymakers support process. credit derivative my final topic today credit derivatives. the credit derivative market grow rapidly past years. accord statistic bank international settlements, notional value credit derivative outstanding rise $108 billion 1998 $695 billion 2001. accord market sources, rapid growth continue unabated. bank important engine behind growth credit derivatives. they typically use credit derivative transfer credit risk incur make loan create customize credit-risk exposure investors. bank pay investor take credit risk. the investor agree compensate bank case credit loss. investor sell credit protection motivate desire earn high return exchange take credit risk desire increase geographic, sectoral, diversification credit portfolio expand range borrower exposed. insurance companies, particularly insurance company continental europe, cite large investor market. in theory, risk transfer associate bank’s purchase credit protection loan book effective. instead suffer loss borrower defaults, bank suffer loss borrower credit derivative counterparty default. the risk simultaneous default certainly much low risk single default. credit derivatives, make market complete, panacea must use wisely. most credit derivative require counterparty make payment bank credit loss default occurs. for type credit derivative, traditional credit risk may reappear counterparty credit risk, is, risk bank’s counterparty fulfill agreement compensate bank case credit loss. the price credit derivative take consideration credit risk pose seller protection appropriate default correlation, though default correlation difficult estimate precisely. but credit derivatives, credit-linked notes, prefunded--the counterparty pay principal front repayment receive maturity contingent credit event occurring. bank sell fund credit derivative counterparty credit risk all. recognize must understand characteristic new risk-sharing mechanisms, several regulatory body take close look credit derivative market recent years. the federal reserve, role bank supervisor, monitor banks’ participation credit derivative market. bi review 67/2002 5 in addition, u.k. financial service authority bank england issue report credit derivative recent years. thank efforts, much good picture credit derivative market year two ago. these group report find evidence credit derivative market threaten financial stability. the nonbank firm active credit derivative market, notably insurance companies, appear understand nature risk take on. although regulatory capital arbitrage cite factor spur early growth credit derivative market, increasingly active portfolio management credit risk, bank insurance companies, drive growth market recent years. even relatively early stage life cycle, credit derivative appear offer benefits. the creation market credit risk transfer probably enhance efficiency economic resiliency enable credit risk disperse throughout financial system. credit risk diversification use credit derivative think many one factor help bank weather recession 2001, accompany increase defaults, without apparent major problems. in recent financial releases, several u.s. bank specifically note credit derivative help mitigate credit losses. of course, general improvement credit-risk management bank recent year another important factor. the experience 2001 recession markedly different precede recession unite states, 1990 1991. in recession, bank take serious hit credit losses, weakness bank sector lead “headwinds” restrict availability business credit slow recovery. the past two year see largest-ever corporate bankruptcy, worldcom, largest-ever sovereign default, argentina. there many high-profile defaults, global crossing, kmart, enron. by help spread credit risk associate large borrower throughout financial system, credit derivative market likely contribute financial stability. these large default give u insight one concern i mention earlier--that growth credit derivative market drive investor understand risk take on. because default enron, argentina, worldcom, others, investor market make large payouts credit derivative recently. if investor underestimate risk before, certainly now. on contrary, appear general retreat market. the credit derivative market continue grow. i conclude majority investor must understand risk will able bear them. what financial policymakers response rapid growth credit derivative market? clearly, must keep abreast market development perform traditional supervisory role. regulator continue insist bank manage counterparty credit risk prudently. this prudence include pay attention potential concentration counterparty credit risk. however, important ensure regulator keep enough distance market give financial innovation credit derivative chance succeed. the new market credit derivative grow largely outside traditional regulatory oversight, i described, evidence date suggest make important contribution financial stability recent credit cycle. conclusion the three topic i address today--dynamic hedge mortgages, risk measurement system value-at-risk, credit derivatives--are example new risk-management techniques. because technique relatively new, regulator market participant must work build understand function differ economic environments. to date new tool appear demonstrate financial engineer enhance economic efficiency and, time, contribute financial stability enable firm disperse risk throughout financial system. all new technique make possible fact financial firm latitude develop pursue one appear useful. for three techniques, best approach policymakers monitor developments, insist regulate firm practice sound risk management, encourage transparency, avoid interfere financial innovation potential improve financial stability, whether occur inside outside realm regulation. bi review 67/2002 1 ernst welteke: european monetary union - experience outlook speech mr ernst welteke, president deutsche bundesbank, svedbank, stockholm, 19 november 2002. * * * i lady gentleman it good stockholm. thank good friend, connection sweden grow deep past years. today, i pleasure share view experience eurosystem almost four year existence. i well aware ongoing debate membership european monetary union. therefore, experience might particular interest you. that relate monetary economic aspect well practical matters, changeover banknote coins. in addition, ask extend view also give outlook near future. again, major challenge monetary union stem process enlargement. too often, enlargement refer respect eastern southern europe. to me, equally interest important question whether sweden country northern western europe (uk, denmark) join monetary union. i guess may answer yet. however, i may, i would like express wish late on. ii the primary objective european monetary union (emu) maintain price stability. the govern council ecb define price stability year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) euro area 2%. at time, govern council also state price stability “is maintain medium term”. look annual hicp rate euro area past year light requirement tend reveal mix picture. it 1999 - year start eurosystem - annual rate price increase, strongly influence development 1998, remain within define stability corridor 1.1%. since then, price norm met. in 2000, average annual rate inflation 2.3%. in 2001, greece join euro area, figure 2.5%. in first nine month year, rate 2.2%. it therefore long possible speak short-term overshooting. in defence, ecb-council point number exceptional circumstance past year - event ecb influence intensify upward pressure prices. first, been, times, sharp increase international oil price thus also european energy prices. second, bse foot-and-mouth disease addition unfavourable weather conditions, especially southern europe, lead considerable rise food price start 2001 early 2002. exclude volatile components, energy unprocessed food, picture significantly favourable. this give core rate 2.0% 2000 and, 2.0% 2001, core rate edge price norm. in current year, however, figure clearly exceeded. all all, large currency area cushion substantial price shocks. especially, additional yield spread occurred. so far, general expectation euro area, single currency single monetary policy, would see rapid convergence price development fulfilled. since 1997, trend widen range data individual countries. this indicate specific, persistent, national factor continue shape price developments. one reason may see consumer habits, vary country country. another reason consist diverge price trends, especially sector non-tradable service service limit tradability. 2 bi review 67/2002 a consequence, euro-area real rate interest vary quite considerably. however, national real interest rate sector. the relevant real interest rate differ accord different price developments. it low sector high sectoral inflation rate et vice versa. for sector tradables real interest rate differ much. european economic monetary union population 300 million people. that around 20 million unite states. however, overall output euro area almost 30% low per caput income much one-third low usa. in many instances, expectation would real convergence - word reduction prosperity gap. the necessary strengthen economic growth euro area - hop - would le occur automatically. in context, reference made, first, expansionary impact interest rate convergence low german level run-up stage three, mainly benefit former “high interest rate” countries. second, expect introduction single currency would lead good allocation production factor capital result sudden improvement capital market integration. furthermore, accelerate restructure corporate landscape owe increase number merger participation - add intense competition euro area - suppose act “fitness programme” european enterprises. significant positive growth effect also forecast owe disappearance foreign exchange rate risk within euro area. so far, however, expectation start fulfilled. on average year since 1999, rise overall output euro area, 2% annually, noticeably slow usa (2½%). the pace expansion also lag behind pre-ins, unite kingdom sweden. the euro area thus unable isolate cyclical slowdown usa, hop early 2001. it has, fact, le fully shadow price slump u stock market deterioration sentiment u investor consumers, even though bubble it telecom sector le pronounce macroeconomic imbalance le severe. the differential per caput income compare unite state - population grow considerably quickly euro area - narrow somewhat since 1999, however. but development due fact usa hit hard cyclical slowdown euro area was. look longer-term trends, u lead potential growth euro area - imf put ¾ percentage point - even large difference population growth. this mean that, conditions, per caput income two economic area even diverging. the euro area’s growth performance has, whole, unsatisfactory. this reveal least fact emu, despite undeniable progress, still represent quite heterogeneous economic area. this show wide spread growth rate among member countries. in 2000, example, rate growth range 3% italy germany 10% ireland. the differential growth across euro-area country narrow 2001 2002. however, number member country converge low german pace expansion - way round, would actually desirable. in almost every case, economic analysis euro area’s growth weakness come conclusion problem lie mainly labour market. the contribution make factor labour economic growth 1991 2000 period roughly one-third high unite states. the inadequate involvement factor labour production process also reflect high core level structural unemployment emerged, all, large euro-area member countries. it follow strengthen force growth europe much macropolicy task challenge structural policy. in connection, key importance elimination rigidity labour markets. although significant effort undertake respect past years, many press problem remain government well side industry face them. the development external value euro disappoint first two year introduction. it much depreciation felt surprise exaggerate rather scale. at peak, exchange rate loss trade-weighted average 12 important trade partner outside euro area amount 23%. a crucial factor bi review 67/2002 3 development strength u dollar, reflect decidedly robust pace growth u economy early 2001. it since many high, ultimately unfounded, expectation part market player give way sober assessment development stabilise and, certain extent, go reverse. however, still long way exchange rate relationship exist changeover monetary union. the depreciation inflict last harm euro-area countries. the exchange-rate-related gain competitiveness trade country outside euro area provide growth region external mainstay. and inflationary effect intermittently strengthen oil-price-induced external price surge bring control monetary policy. in long run, however, business euro area cannot rely advantage continuing. ultimately, option keep eye cost-side risk undertake structural reform order strengthen efficiency adaptability euro-area economy sustain basis inside. in second half 1990s, significant improvement fiscal position general government member state euro area. the average deficit ratio euro area initially continue go down, government debt-to-gdp ratio. the fiscal policy framework monetary union, enshrine maastricht treaty stability growth pact, play crucial role this. the majority member state meet requirement, lay stability growth pact, budget close balance surplus normal cyclical conditions. however, country - include large economy euro area - neglect use year favourable cyclical development consolidate public finances. in many cases, welcome tax cut adequately counter-financed save expenditure side, lead deterioration underlie budgetary position. together cyclically induce strains, result situation country find difficult comply - already overshoot - 3% deficit ratio limit. germany among countries. the eu-commission already implement excessive deficit procedure. the fiscal policy problem country occasion debate possible change stability growth pact, imply soften terms. this would, however, jeopardise objective sound underlie fiscal policy conditions, major essential component monetary policy gear stability. in order preserve credibility fiscal policy grind rule monetary union, country need instead undertake speedy correction undesirable development emerge achieve structurally balance budget near future. this make easy european central bank perform task maintain price stability. sound public finances, moreover, contribute sustain economic growth long-term increase employment. over past four years, govern council ecb demonstrate take stability mandate seriously. with consistent forward-looking monetary policy, govern council succeed anchor inflation expectation target low level. that success notable view fact price development euro area since january 1999 shaped, describe earlier, series negative shocks. in term monetary policy strategy, ecb govern council repeatedly contend accusation lack transparency. criticism mainly arouse unclear weight two pillar event conflict. the ecb improve communication market extent interest rate decision are, rule, correctly anticipate markets. but still say two-pillar strategy, owe complexity, make heavy demand eurosystem’s communication policy. follow two pillar strategy ecb council neither ignore possible threat monetary expansion feel bind monetary orthodoxy. it true, inflation monetary phenomenon. however, hold long run. for short term inflation also determine couple non-monetary variables. in addition, growth monetary aggregate disturb special determinant portfolio effects. therefore, suitability indicator may suffer. a consequence, ecb-council pursue broadly base approach. a second pillar added. in monitor price development determinant ecb-council judge inflation expectation medium term. 4 bi review 67/2002 for euro-area financial markets, introduction euro far-reaching implications. these include, particular, rapid convergence national market form fully integrate euro money market, strong growth market euro-denominated corporate bond well wave consolidation case bank stock exchanges. it gradually become apparent, however, complete integration financial system currently still hind large number regulatory, tax legal obstacle eliminate obstacle prove complex arduous. the lamfalussy proposal design accelerate process. iii let turn practical aspect monetary union. european monetary union works. that mean matter course. the introduction workable common instrument monetary policy, proper function payment system harmonisation statistical methodology crucial success monetary union. most important among technical aspect manage eurosystem was, course, smooth introduction euro banknote coin sole legal tender. the 2002 cash changeover prove formidable challenge cash management communication departments. the legacy currency withdraw 300 million european well outside euro area, especially d-mark circulation. at time, new currency issued. to meet challenge, long thorough preparation take place. the general framework changeover - include national changeover scenario - agree european level early 1999 2000. close collaboration third party - mainly banks, retailer manufacturer cash handle machine - initiate early stage. the withdrawal national currency start mid-2001. an award-winning campaign title “don’t let sleep coin lie”, bundesbank call upon general public hand unused coin hide piggy banks, pillow among socks. by november 2001, already collect 20% coin circulation. of course, substantial amount d-mark still circulation. in comparison december 2000 almost 4% d-mark banknote circulation. some may never come back. however, bundesbank commit exchange d-mark banknote indefinite period. the logistical preparation introduction euro banknote coin cash prove equally successful. in order smooth final changeover, bank supply note coin advance (front-loading). the banks, turn, provide retailer new cash - process know sub-frontloading. of course, special debit model apply credit institution order limit cost incur changeover. in addition, set coin worth 10 euro (starter kits) sell general public around christmas time order familiarise new coin provide small change would need early new year. euro cash put circulation change euro give first day 2002 onwards. by 4 p.m. 2 january, average 92% automate teller machine convert dispense euro note across 12 countries. moreover, new cash rapidly gain overwhelm acceptance. the old currency therefore withdraw much quickly expected.this also lead exceptionally high demand low-denomination euro banknote coin even cause short-term bottlenecks. besides logistical challenge, changeover call major effort communication. every man woman child familiarise new currency. that meant, least, denomination, appearance security features. equally, reluctant make security feature know early potential threat counterfeiting. and indeed, indication euro lead currency subject counterfeiter former national currency small countries. hitherto, germany number counterfeit euro banknote limit low before. therefore, tremendous effort prevent counterfeit prove worthwhile. all major instrument communication policy used. the information campaign provide general public detail new banknote coins. there close cooperation press mass media. bi review 67/2002 5 of course, differ information need general public professional cash handler (banks, retailers) take consideration. opinion leader inform cash handler train work euro cash advance. all account system cash point make ready new currency dual circulation period. a thing turn out, two-month dual circulation period was, anything, long. the changeover give rise fear inflation there three main aspect this. first, possibility business might try recoup changeover cost put prices. second, business might defer schedule price increase changeover owe need display price new currency. third, price increase might occur owe round differences. however, changeover major impact consumer prices. many consumer good subject automatic conversion since pay stand order bank account. nevertheless, even almost year changeover, perceive inflation diverge significantly actual low rate inflation. consumer perceive inflation much high react accordingly. they attach great importance price development good service buy frequently pay cash. however, harmonise indicator consumer price cover broad basket goods. high perceive inflation occur first germany course year also member countries. the govern council ecb keep close watch development perceive inflation - crucial acceptance new currency also may additionally macroeconomic implications, match rise wage demands. all all, euro cash changeover outstanding example eurosystem’s ability cope major challenges. iv at last meeting, ecb govern council discuss depth argument cut key interest rates. the rate leave unchanged, indicate would closely monitor downside risk economic growth euro area. after rather mild recession 2001, economic growth pick remarkably us. in major economies, slight growth mainly drive external factors. capacity adjustment - particular hi-tech business major industrialise country - still take place. therefore, investment prospect look clouded. the ongoing deflation japan due persistent structural problem bank sector. recent announcement reform bank system shed light possible solutions. a usual, however, hard implement reform announce them. japan, however, benefit little fairly strong growth east asian countries. recent data may point least end recession ongoing fiscal year. among emerge markets, east asia eastern europe perform good again-crisis-ridden latin america. the crisis argentina subsequently uruguay brazil prove contagious early emerge market crises. financial market aware fundamental aspect nowadays. contagion limited. however, economic integration side atlantic seem close ever. the devastate effect september 11 mean confine unite states. we realise major repercussion european economy, even though trade financial flow react time lag strongly. this psychological transmission channel much fast trade flow even financial investments. the worsen business climate u impact german investment. in spite high expectation early year, euro-area economy accelerate first quarter. among reason oil prices, considerable turbulence financial market loom threat military conflict. both factor continue among downside risk economy. nevertheless, ecb govern council expect growth rate pick return potential course 2003. private consumption might benefit rise real income due low inflation rates. investment activity support low level interest rate possible stabilisation 6 bi review 67/2002 financial markets. and improvement world economy well fast trade growth foster export development. the present annual inflation rate, 2.2% close mark stability. most likely development indicate decline rate first half next year. of course, upward risk price always present. most important among oil price labour costs. at recent meet govern council, price risk judge balanced. however, describe growth scenario subject great deal uncertainty. the risk economy tend - i sorry say - downside. v the outlook european monetary union medium term depend first foremost enlargement process union’s ability cope it. the ongoing enlargement european union join emu represent important challenge. the accession candidate country central eastern europe major item agenda. eu accession decide basis criterion adopt copenhagen european council. monetary union final stage process evolution. in principle, maastricht criteria, include exchange rate criterion, meet country join eurosystem. country-specific exception must allow set precedent. at most, exchange rate arrangement base currency board could potentially consider equivalent erm ii. for accession country join monetary union, need catch strive real nominal convergence. the past year already see significant progress towards real nominal convergence. however, individual accession country’s situation must judge separately. some country already level prosperity convergence close eu average. case point cyprus slovenia. per caput gdp, express purchase power parities, 85% eu average cyprus 69% slovenia. those two country generate high per caput gdp eu countries. some remain accession country lag considerably behind. when look averages, forget that, cases, major regional disparity within eu country accession countries. in real economic terms, accession central east european country already fact life. between 1993 2000 share accession countries’ total export go eu rise two third. sixty per cent import come eu. the integration central east european country make easy progress capital market liberalisation. positive macroeconomic data prospect eu accession lead large-scale direct investment. since 1999, direct investment account around 5% accession countries’ gdp. the heterogeneous nature monetary union increase along enlargement - labour good market therefore need flexible adjustment mechanisms. the single monetary policy catalyst reform policy areas. the nation state competition one another find best solution economic, labour market fiscal policies. successful policy solution set benchmark le successful countries. besides economic criterion successful monetary union, european system central bank reform cope enlargement. the present structure design 15-member monetary union. reform take account fact that, years’ time, eu could comprise many 27 members. reform must therefore design take account current round enlargement, ten nation join eu. let conclude make comment debate possible emu membership. the ecb govern council well aware ongoing public discussion country. sweden would welcome monetary union. more that, sweden - neighbour finland across baltic sea germany - emu membership natural choice. in macroeconomic terms, membership would mutual benefit. the swedish business cycle move notably close harmony euro area. inflation, inflation expectation long-term interest rate closely correlated. bi review 67/2002 7 at core debate country lie concern threat asymmetric shock. to mind, eurosystem demonstrate capacity cope well economic shocks. in addition, strong asymmetric shock increasingly rare time ongoing economic integration. the possibility major asymmetric shock decline rise importance trade, foreign direct investment capital market integration. swedish bank already show great inclination invest foreign markets. they are, extent, among leader term european integration. to sum up: economic financial integration deepen within monetary union even side atlantic. therefore, built-in-stabilisers cushion effect integrate european market provide shelter need - country well - cope asymmetric shocks. sweden’s emu membership interests. i hope soon, another visit beautiful country, i shall able use currency i rome, paris frankfurt. bi review 73/2002 1 mark w olson: the importance market structure remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual conference central bank chile santiago, chile, 13 december 2002. * * * it great pleasure participate interest thought-provoking conference, i wish begin thank carlos massad central bank chile invite attend. my remark today address, perspective policymaker, former banker, former adviser congress, issue raise morning's session discuss afternoon's presentations. specifically, i would like comment potential implication u.s. bank sector's change structure competition context board's supervision antitrust responsibilities. i also discus deposit insurance system, administer federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) allocation credit, focus loan small businesses. a everyone fully aware, change market structure profound effect areas. by change market structure, i refer primarily change number, size, charter, characteristic firm supply side bank nonbanking market bring ongoing consolidation bank financial service industry. however, demand side market also clearly relevant, necessary, i include demand characteristic discussion. the issue i refer new unique unite state but, rather, exist many year transcend national boundaries. in fact, consolidation bank type financial institution one notable feature international financial landscape past decade more. in recognition importance financial consolidation, potential impact market structure, potential implication public policy concerns, finance minister central bank governor g-10 nation late 1999 ask deputy study financial consolidation potential effects. my colleague, roger ferguson, direct study, publish early 2001. today, i would like use find study start point address issue i mention moment ago. because study international scope allow put comment unite state global context. competition in unite state many countries, common concern potential bank financial consolidation change structure bank market way reduce competition thus harm consumers. the fact federal reserve significant responsibility enforce antitrust law bank ensure issue receive considerable attention fed. consolidation u.s. bank industry occur massive scale. in 1934, year federal deposit insurance implement unite states, total number bank charter great 14,000. a similar number charter institution still function consolidation wave begin 1986. today number le 8,000, reduction 43 percent. that consolidation, however, cause diminution competition consumer small businesses. for many reasons, include rise nonbank provider many bank bank-like service increase use electronic banking, consolidation unite state generally accompany heighten competition. still, view, ignore significance market structure implication competition would mistake. this certainly conclusion g-10 study. for example, study find that, unite state nation include study, market number key bank product - retail deposit small business loan - appear primarily local. local, context define market approximate geographically concept metropolitan area rural county unite states, province canton nations. on demand side, study unite state indicate household small 2 bi review 73/2002 business procure key component bank service overwhelmingly supplier locate within mile themselves. it still common consumer deal institution reach telephone internet. on supply side, number bank office develop countries, include unite states, continue increase, despite consolidation process reduce number independent bank organizations. in unite states, example, although number bank charter decline 43 percent past fifteen years, number bank branch increase 47 percent (from 44,392 65,600). this increase suggest firm continue feel need local presence compete business customers. of course, bank many product market local way i define term. for example, market product large corporate loans, bond equity underwriting, credit card generally national international scope. even product mortgage single-family homes, tend originate locally unite states, funded, serviced, trade securitized asset national markets. but evidence continue indicate structure properly define market, regardless whether geographic scope local, national, international, make difference. study unite states, italy, switzerland find substantial increase market concentration potential cause reduction deposit interest rate increase loan interest rates. in research policy analysis unite states, supply structure bank market measure share of, say, top three five firms, indicator overall structure, use measure concentration know herfindahl-hirschman index. at antitrust policy level, unite state use screen base measure determine propose merger potential adversely affect consumers. there indications, however, bank system's ongoing evolution may make traditional measure le reliable indicator degree competition give market. i would like report result interest research board staff area. in three recent studies, member board staff analyze possible effect aspect market structure consider traditional research. these study strongly reinforce importance local market antitrust analysis certain financial products, especially retail deposit small business loans.1 but also suggest current focus u.s. antitrust analysis traditional measure local market concentration i mention earlier, exclusion structural measures, perhaps become le appropriate. specifically, relative market presence bank operate multiple market market share large bank may also significant. supervision administration safety net a critical issue address g-10 study whether ongoing change bank system structure study nation affect risk individual institution or, important, level systemic risk overall bank industry. the study conclude that, type risk, effect change market structure unclear. with regard risk individual institution, study come intuitively appeal conclusion evaluation individual firm risk must do case case matter market structure. the one area consolidation seem likely reduce single institution risk diversification gains, although even possible outcome complex. for example, diversification gain seem likely occur consolidation across region give nation combination across national borders. in unite states, evidence diversification gain generally result expansion interstate banking. banker unite

justification merger typically take one two form - either consolidate presence exist market enter new market. consolidation within exist market typically expect achieve great efficiency significant consolidation operations. merger enter new market provide few opportunity achieve efficiencies. not uncommonly, consolidate bank, particularly enter new market, achieve cost save efficiency gain initially expected. a result, merger actually increase operational reputational risk consolidate institution. in part net effect consolidation risk individual firm must assess case case, net effect consolidation systemic risk also uncertain. the g-10 study, however, conclude that, large complex bank organization become impaired, consolidation attendant organizational complexity may increase

truly risk. one aspect prudence unite state concern administration deposit insurance system. of sixty-eight deposit insurance system evaluate international monetary fund 1999 worldwide study, u.s. system oldest. create 1933, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) begin insure deposit approve bank january 1934. in original form, fdic model clarity regard mission function. it mission insure deposit small-dollar saver $2,500. it function essentially pay agent insure depositor event bank failure. at time, insurer, supervisory regulatory authority. the original construct last one year. the follow year, congress amend charter give fdic supervisory authority double amount coverage $5,000. for next forty-five years, change deposit insurance subtle. but subtle change significant public policy implications. insurance coverage increase several stages, remain relatively stable constant dollar term 1980. of great long-term significance fdic's practice resolve bank failure era arrange merger fail banks; institute de facto policy effectively insure 100 percent deposits. this practice receive careful scrutiny period, public policy implication 100 percent coverage remain unnoticed. the public policy implication finally receive attention failure continental illinois bank 1984 subsequent decision hold depositor harmless. in volatile 1980s, public policy issue implicit policy - "moral hazard," "too big fail," expansion "safety net" - become unavoidable need addressed. through series legislative initiatives, 1989 1999 congress addressed, vary degrees, issues. not bank industry fdic insurance fund face public policy issue decade. the save loan industry insurer, federal save loan insurance corporation (fslic), even severe pressure. with loan portfolio consist largely fixed-rate mortgages, thrift industry come extraordinary duration-risk pressure late 1970s early 1980s, inflation drive deposit rate double-digit range maturity deposit instrument drop four year le one year new save deposits. the thrift regulator respond allow and, times, encourage mergers, many little 4 bi review 73/2002 tangible capital. a result, real estate loan go sour year later, save loan industry capital strength withstand strain. eventually, congress compel step recapitalize underfunded fslic fund and, time, move administration fdic. current fdic chairman donald powell, like predecessor, offer number proposal reform current fdic law. the extent fdic need fundamental update best describe follow examples. a well-managed, well-capitalized bank $1 billion deposit annual premium deposit insurance range low zero high $2.3 million, entirely basis overall level fdic fund. in words, range bear relationship risk profile individual institution. a second example, newly charter insure institution - say, bank affiliate security firm - could grow rapidly aggressively market insure deposit product and, accumulate premium long-time institutions, could enjoy free ride pay deposit insurance premium time insurance fund mandate threshold 1.25 percent total insure deposits. yet several fast-growing, free-riding institution could trigger premium increase entire industry alter ratio fund's level total industry deposits. add need address fundamental change fdic statute arbitrary nature 1.25 percent designate reserve ratio, maintenance trigger wide premium swings. the ratio product political expediency write law decade ago assume relevance far exceed value. all all, current deposit insurance system number aspect one would never observe private sector need reformed. indeed, party deposit insurance issue agree need provide fdic great flexibility set premiums, eliminate free-rider provision, encourage increase risk-based assessment premiums. the federal reserve board governor federal reserve system endorse propose changes. my final observation deposit insurance reform concern controversial part current debate unite states: whether raise deposit insurance limit. a many know, fellow board member i oppose increase in, index of, current $100,000 deposit insurance ceiling. in judgment, increase coverage would unlikely add measurable way stability bank system. macroeconomic policy element federal safety net depository institutions, include still-significant level deposit insurance, continue effective deterrent bank runs. moreover, household depositor would benefit increase coverage apparent. accord periodic survey consumer finances, u.s. household depositor balance well current insurance limit, large balance appear adept achieve level deposit insurance coverage desire open multiple accounts. such spread asset hold perfectly consistent counsel always give investor diversify asset - stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificate deposit - across different issuers. some small bank argue need increase deposit insurance coverage compete effectively large diversify cousins. an analysis small bank performance support claim. for example, since mid-1990s, small banks' asset uninsured deposits, adjust effect mergers, expand twice pace large banks. throughout 1990s, small banks' return equity well maintained, viability small bank evidence fact 1,350 new bank charter past decade unite states, virtually small institutions. with few, any, benefits, raise ceiling would risk incur substantial net cost expand safety net, increase government subsidy banking, encourage moral hazard, reduce incentive market discipline. supply credit small business i turn final topic today - possible implication change structure u.s. bank sector supply credit small businesses. in unite state many bi review 73/2002 5 countries, consolidation bank industry involve large number small banks. a net result mergers, failures, new entry, number commercial bank unite state total asset $100 million (in 1994 dollars) fell little 8,800 1990 quite 4,800 end 2001. although, i indicated, small bank generally quite well, observer express concern

medium news conference, zurich, 13 december 2002. * * * the past year eventful one international financial markets. the global deterioration economic prospect erode investor confidence deepen stock market slump middle year. parallel development, interest rate level continue fall. the central bank contribute interest rate reduction. however, risk premium increase time, finance condition fail improve many company actually often deteriorated. foreign exchange follow steep slide u dollar, exchange rate stabilise mid-year onward become clear growth slump affect major economic region equally. the swiss franc fluctuate within relatively narrow margin euro year. the geopolitical uncertainty premium apply swiss franc shock 11 september 2001 still pay (see graph). in current year, record phase heighten upward pressure swiss currency. we try counteract negative consequence strong swiss franc risk upward movement low interest rate several times. since begin september 2001, key interest rate differential euro swiss franc widen one two percentage points. the yield long-term bond swiss franc also around two percentage point correspond euro paper. this low attractiveness swiss franc somewhat compare euro. the stabilisation euro/swiss franc relationship – albeit relatively high rate swiss franc – positive development. experience show exchange rate development significant influence business activity switzerland. we still determine counteract additional upward trend swiss franc might jeopardise economic recovery. 2 bi review 73/2002 bond in capital market around world, nominal yield drop considerably (see graph). however, borrower medium low credit rat benefit much development credit risk premium rise year. this also limit macroeconomic stimulus effect yield decline. in addition, real interest rate decrease extent simultaneously inflation expectation subside markedly. particularly euro's core country – first foremost germany – real interest rate high. they depress economic outlook increase growth difference member countries. share stock market characterise extraordinarily sharp fluctuation hefty price losses. this due risk aversion increase course year effectively high risk level, depress share prices. the sharp price swing mirror difficulty assess risk opportunity environment. the stock market slump persist almost three year now. in past weeks, though, major stock market least witness upward corrections. bi review 73/2002 3 the long-term expectation high yield achieve take high risk prove true relatively long period time. unlike shares, low-risk bond generate attractive yield phase. this experience together fact numerous, notably institutional investor lose part risk capability might, many instances, result equity weight remain low foreseeable future. this change behaviour limit stock markets' growth potential time being. at present, price/earnings ratio major stock market close average past 15 years. this indicator suggest that, despite price loss suffered, share yet particularly low-priced. however, compare low yield level bonds, important investment alternative, share seem quite inexpensive. doe stock market slump adverse effect economic development? this seem certain several reasons. for corporate sector, become expensive raise capital, undermine investment activity. although direct shareholding le common switzerland than, example, unite states, asset loss incur discourage private consumption. in many cases, deteriorate financial position pension fund necessitate increase contribution and/or decrease exist premium reductions. such perspective occasionally voice doubt reliability pension promise adversely affect consumption investors' willingness take risks. last least, bearish stock market directly affect value add financial sector, contribute 10 percent gdp. risk management in switzerland abroad, bank adopt cautious attitude. international institutions, particular, manage credit risk much actively use to. they sell risk financial intermediaries, include insurance company institutional asset managers. the available data allow reliable conclusion draw risk distribution credit risk transfers. it concluded, though, credit risk bear large number market player previously diversification possibility probably good utilise nowadays. in interbank business, too, attention pay worldwide default risks. a grow share interbank business hedged; also case switzerland, repo business develop steadily. unhedged transaction still clearly account bulk interbank business, average volume approximately sfr 20 billion, interbank repos, neglect long time, 4 bi review 73/2002 grow respectable size. with respect system stability, development favourable promoted. continuous link settlement (cls) a regard credit risk

reserve system, economic club new york, new york city, 19 december 2002. * * * although gold standard could hardly portray produce period price tranquility, case price level 1929 much different, net, 1800. but, two decade follow abandonment gold standard 1933, consumer price index unite state nearly doubled. and, four decade that, price quintupled. monetary policy, unleash constraint domestic gold convertibility, allow persistent overissuance money. a recently decade ago, central bankers, witness half-century chronic inflation, appear confirm fiat currency inherently subject excess. but adverse consequence excessive money growth financial stability economic performance provoke backlash. central bank finally press rein overissuance money even cost considerable temporary economic disruption. by 1979, need drastic measure become painfully evident unite states. the federal reserve, leadership paul volcker support carter reagan administrations, dramatically slow growth money. initially, economy fell recession inflation receded. however, important, activity stag vigorous recovery, progress make reduce inflation largely preserved. by end 1980s, inflation climate alter dramatically. the record past twenty year appear underscore observation that, although pressure excess issuance fiat money chronic, prudent monetary policy maintain protract period contain force inflation. with story major economy postwar period emergence of, battle inflation, concern deflation, one bane early century, seldom surfaced. the recent experience japan certainly refocus attention possibility unanticipated fall general price level would convert otherwise relatively manageable level nominal debt hold household business corrosive rise level real debt real debt service costs. it appear learn deflation, well inflation, long run monetary phenomena, extend milton friedman's famous dictum. to sure, short medium run, many force play complicate link money prices. the widen globalization market economy recent years, example, integrate grow share previously local capacity operationally meaningful world total. that process has, least time, bring substantial new supply good service global markets. in addition, rapid rate technological innovation, evident unite states, boost pace productive potential expanding. these shift aggregate supply - whether foreign domestic origin - influence relationship money prices. moreover, tie money price alter dysfunctional financial intermediation, witness japan. thus, recent experience understandably stimulate policymakers worldwide refocus deflation consequences, decade dismiss possibility remote long warrant serious attention. the mean deflation characteristic differentiate usual experience inflation subject actively study inside outside central banks. a i testify congress last month, unite state nowhere close slide pernicious deflation. moreover, major objective recent heighten level scrutiny ensure latent deflationary pressure appropriately address well become problem. * * * central banker long believe price stability conducive achieve maximum sustainable growth. historically, debilitate risk premium tend rise expect inflation deflation, minimize condition approximate price stability. although u.s. economy largely escape deflation since world war ii, well-founded reason presume deflation threat economic growth inflation. 2 bi review 73/2002 for one, low bind nominal interest rate zero threaten ever-rising real rate deflation intensifies. a relate consequence even debtor able refinance loan zero nominal interest rates, may still face high rise real rate cause balance sheet deteriorate. another concern deflation reside labor markets. some study suggest nominal wage easily adjust downward. if low price inflation accompany low average wage inflation, prevalence nominal wage constrain fall could increase price inflation move toward zero. in circumstances, effective clear labor market would inhibited, consequence high rate unemployment. take together, consideration suggest deflation could well damage inflation economic growth. while asymmetry overlooked, several factor limit significance. in particular, rapid advance productivity make asymmetry le severe. fast growth productivity, buoy expectation future advance wage earn thus aggregate demand, enable real interest rate high would otherwise case without restrict economic growth. moreover, extent more-rapid growth productivity show fast gain nominal wages, few instance nominal wage pressure fall. one also overstate difficulty pose monetary policy zero bind interest rate nominal wage inflexibility even absence fast productivity growth. the expansion monetary base proceed even overnight rate drive zero low bound. the federal reserve authority purchase treasury security maturity indeed already purchase security part procedure keep overnight rate desire level. this authority could use low interest rate long maturities. such action precedent: between 1942 1951, federal reserve put ceiling longer-term treasury yield 2-1/2 percent. with respect potential difficulty labor markets, result research remain ambiguous extent persistence downward rigidity nominal compensation. clearly, would desirable avoid deflation. but deflation develop, option aggressive monetary policy response available. * * * fortunately, ability economy weather many shock inflict since spring 2000 attest market system's remarkable resilience. that characteristic far evident today two three decade ago. there may numerous cause increase resilience.1 among them, ongoing effort liberalize global trade add flexibility many aspect economy time. furthermore, quarter-century bipartisan deregulation significantly reduce inflexibility market energy, transportation, communication, financial services. and, course, dramatic gain information technology markedly improve ability business address fester economic imbalance inflict significant damage. this improve ability facilitate increase willingness worker embrace innovation generally. irrespective deflationary force might influence it, economy 1 a considerable economics literature recent year document decline volatility real gdp past two decades. some researcher argue decline volatility result small disturbance macroeconomy. others argue improve monetary policy credit reduction. another line work point structural change increase flexibility economy respond shocks. in vein, i argue advance information technology cumulative effect quarter century deregulation likely play major role promote increase flexibility economy. of course, explanation mutually exclusive could, indeed, interconnected. but extent resilience reflect increase flexibility economy, search policy enhance economic flexibility dismantle policy contribute unnecessary rigidity. the flexible economy is, great ability self-correct inevitable disturbances, reduce size consequence cyclical imbalances. an implication that, give point time, economy likely produce close productive potential. so often, discussion policy intend improve macroeconomic performance focus solely traditional monetary fiscal policies. but structural policy intend promote flexibility may important complement standard macro policies, may important enough influence cyclical performance long-run growth potential economy. this issue surely deserve examination debate. bi review 73/2002 3 benefit enhance flexibility, has, least date, allow u withstand potentially destabilize effect substantial negative shocks. * * * certainly, lurk background evaluation deflation risk concern force could unleash burst bubble asset prices. this connection, real speculative, raise interest question effective approach conduct monetary policy. if burst asset bubble create economic dislocation, prevent bubble might seem attractive goal. but whether incipient bubble detect real time whether, detected, defuse without inadvertently precipitate still great adverse consequence economy remain doubt. it may useful, first step, consider economic circumstance likely impede development bubble circumstance conducive formation. destabilize macroeconomic policy poor economic performance likely provide fertile grind optimism usually accompany surge asset prices. ironically, low inflation, economic stability, low risk premium may provide tinder asset price speculation could spark technological innovation open new opportunity profitable investment. even circumstances, bubble price likely inhibit company history. to sure, stock price old-line company rise somewhat arbitrage market whole propel high stock price cutting-edge technologies. but difficult imagine stock price well-established season old-line company surge wholly unsustainable heights. with prominent exceptions, capability future profit largely test delimited. the situation likely different case new company employ innovative technology. under circumstances, dispersion rationally imagine possible future outcome could wide. if forecast unfettered need consistency past, investor might take unwarranted flight optimism. moreover, skeptic find expensive risky short sell share company, especially stock price rise rapidly. the condition extend low inflation low risk combine breakthrough technology produce bubble recent years. but condition always produce bubble? it seem improbable surge innovation near future would generate new bubble substantial proportions. investor likely sensitive need asset price back ultimately ongoing stream earnings. hence, necessary condition emergence bubble passage sufficient time erode traumatic memory early post-bubble experiences. * * * most standard macroeconomic model fit experience recent decade imply distortion valuation ratio induce bubble offset adopt sufficiently restrictive monetary policy. accord models, tight monetary policy, average, credibly constrain demand low asset prices, else equal. these model also interpret suggest incremental monetary tighten gradually deflate stock prices. but conclusion consequence model's construction. it base evidence draw history. in fact, history indicate bubble tend deflate gradually linearly suddenly, unpredictably, often violently. in addition, degree monetary tighten would require contain offset bubble substantial dimension appear great risk unacceptable amount collateral damage wide economy. the evidence recent years, well event late 1920s, cast doubt proposition bubble defuse gradually. a i relate summer annual jackson hole symposium sponsor kansa city federal reserve bank, "... experience past fifteen year suggest monetary tighten deflate stock price without depress economic activity often associate subsequent increase level stock price .... such data suggest nothing short sharp increase short-term rate engender significant economic retrenchment sufficient check nascent bubble. the notion well-timed 4 bi review 73/2002 incremental tighten could calibrate prevent late 1990s bubble almost surely illusion."2 in short, unless model specify capture apparent market tendency toward bid stock price high response monetary policy aim maintain macroeconomic stability, accompany forecast belie recent experience. face uncertainty, federal reserve focus policy would, i testify congress 1999, "...mitigate fallout [of asset bubble] occur and, hopefully, ease transition next expansion."3 the federal open market committee chose, know, embark aggressive course monetary ease two year ago become apparent variety forces, include importantly slump household wealth result decline stock prices, restrain inflation pressure economic activity. it soon judge final outcome strategy adopted. the contractionary impulse decline equity price appear diminish around middle year. but fallout stock price corporate governance malfeasance, argue spawn bubble, become intense. this, turn, damp capital investment trim inventory plans. more recently, course, geopolitical risk rise markedly, weigh demand. though unrelated bubble burst 2000, muddy evaluation post-bubble economy. if postmortem recent monetary policy show result address bubble burst unsatisfactory, would leave less-appealing choice future. in case, find way identify bubble contain progress would desirable, though history caution prospect success appear slim. the difficulty policymakers private agent face become especially acute economic expansion lengthens. the decline risk premium circumstance presumably results, part, rational appraisals. in economy business cycle average four year length protract period, household business would doubtless become cautious fourth year new cycle. but behave when, past two decades, expansion long cyclical downturn exceptionally rare? after five six year uninterrupted expansion, irrational even unreasonable assume expansion would continue subsequent six months? thus, disturb observe risk seemingly price cheaply late 1997 bbb corporate spread ten-year treasury sink 70 basis points. that spread 250 basis points, although narrow significantly recent weeks. * * * weave monetary policy path thicket bubble deflation possible aftermath something modern central banker much experience. a i note earlier, seem ironic monetary policy successful induce stability may inadvertently sow seed instability associate asset bubbles. i trust use central bank deliberately inflationary policy protection bubble readily dismissed. while current episode yet concluded, appear that, respond vigorously relatively flexible economy aftermath bubbles, traumatic may be, le inhibit long-term growth chronic high-inflation monetary policy. moderate inflation might possibly inhibit bubbles, though cost reduce economic efficiency. however, i doubt policy could sustain well-controlled central banks. among realistically limit alternatives, deal aggressively aftermath bubble appear likely avert long-term damage economy.4 2 alan greenspan, “economic volatility,” august 30, 2002, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city jackson hole, wyoming. 3 committee bank financial services, u.s. house representatives, july 22, 1999. 4 some argue bubble prevent defuse financial regulatory initiatives. it observe asset bubble often associate rapid credit expansion, hence claim restrain credit growth could quash nascent bubbles. a bubble could conceivably defuse restrictive credit regulation stifle economic growth. it bi review 73/2002 5 regardless history's verdict policy address aftermath bubbles, still need improve understand dynamic bubble deflation contain latter, former. * * * before close evening, i would like take minute address recent economic developments. a i point earlier, u.s. economy exhibit considerable resilience series post-boom shocks. the list rather impressive: first, halve stock price household equity wealth; second, dramatic decline capital expenditures; third, tragic event september 11; fourth, disturb evidence corporate malfeasance; fifth, recent escalation geopolitical risks. i would scarcely state economy shake series shocks, one top other. but experience mild recession, real gdp grow excess 3 percent year end third quarter. the recovery, however, run resistance summer, apparently consequence renew weaken equity prices, revelation corporate malfeasance, heighten geopolitical risks. concern part lead federal open market committee reduce target federal fund rate 50 basis point early november meet insurance possibility weaken would gain footing. although probable forecast already growth would pick up, judge cost insurance provide additional ease exceptionally modest view risk imminent rise inflation remote. the limit evidence since november ease support view u.s. economy work way soft patch. and patch certainly soft. the labor market remain subdued, business apparently reluctant add payrolls. the manufacture sector remain especially damped, nonresidential construction trend lower. by reports, state local government continue struggle deterioration fiscal conditions. oil price recently rise and, least, economy major trade partner show little vigor. still, low interest rate rapid advance productivity provide considerable support economic activity. those influence evident consumer spend new home sales, remarkably firm year. motor vehicle sale support low finance costs, high level customer incentives, high rate vehicle scrappage multiple car ownership. more broadly, strong growth labor productivity, supplement reduce tax payments, provide boost income spending. meanwhile, new home sale buoy low mortgage interest rate well favorable demographics. cash borrow process mortgage refinancing, important support consumer outlay past year, bind contract point, average interest rate households' total mortgage portfolio converge interest rate new mortgages. however, application refinancing, peaks, remain high. moreover, simply process backlog early application take time, factor alone suggest continue significant refinance origination cash-outs early month 2003. corporate risk-taking undergo pronounce retrenchment follow traumatic disclosure corporate malfeasance summer. capital appropriation slow noticeably across broad spectrum american industries. aggressive account practice seemingly disappear virtually overnight. i would surprise disclosure questionable practice surface month ahead, i would quite surprise practice introduce mid-2002. since early october, condition financial market turn le adverse. stock price have, net, move up, corporate yield spreads, especially below-investment-grade debt instruments, narrow significantly. those spreads, nevertheless, remain quite elevate relative mean clear, however, regime would conducive wealth creation time current regulatory system. also relevance, vibrant financial system, exist unite states, always many avenue available investor finance bubble. furthermore, many analyst maintain stock price margin institution little finance needs. 6 bi review 73/2002 read early 2000. credit derivative default swap improve recently line yield spreads. the overall cost business capital clearly declined, induce recent week increase issuance bond grade halt runoff commercial paper business bank loans. the recent increase expansion business credit may hint stir capital investment, simply early tell. there evidence corporate manager begin tentatively venture risk scale. new order capital good equipment software, fall sharply precede two years, stabilize case turn nominal term year - improvement, sure, necessarily begin vigorous recovery. in end, capital investment dependent outlook profit resolution uncertainty surround business outlook geopolitical situation. these consideration present impose rather formidable barrier new investment. profit margin run little high year last, aid importantly strong growth labor productivity. but lack price power remain evident corporations. a vigorous broad-based pickup capital spend almost surely require gain corporate profit cash flows. a full enumeration caveat surround economic outlook would, usual, lengthy. but often-cited concern level debt debt-servicing cost household firm appear bite stretched. the combination household mortgage consumer debt share disposable income move historically high level. but upward trend series reflects, part, financial innovation increase access credit market many

add fix cost associate financial obligations, rental payment tenants, consumer installment credit, auto leases, total service cost face household relative income appear somewhat elevate compare

mexico, russia, several asian develop country 1990s reinforce already appear grow consensus peg exchange rates. the experience country show peg exchange rate regime greatly limit ability real exchange rate adjust reaction external shock restrict monetary authorities' ability correct excessive growth credit act lender last resort. fix rate also tend encourage excessive borrow foreign currency, reduce concern exchange rate risk, contribute particularly abrupt disruptive reversal investor confidence exchange rate peg broken. some countries, particularly monetary policy low credibility, felt adoption fix exchange rate necessary reduce inflationary expectations. in particular, country history high inflation poor macroeconomic management may felt need fix exchange rates, least transitional period, develop good track record policy performance. in cases, key question long rigid exchange rate regime must stay place inflationary expectation reduced. the experience 1990s suggest that, context rapid international capital mobility, sustain fix exchange rate face domestic policy imbalance international financial market shock difficult, force abandonment peg rate pressure prove quite disruptive. to provide great stability fixed-rate regimes, country adopt currency board system move full-blown dollarization. however, move mean panaceas, evidence argentina's current difficulties. considerably country move opposite direction--toward freely float exchange rates--often follow experience peg exchange rate prove viable. i believe that, general rule, flexible exchange rate regime best choice emerging-market economies. a fixed-rate regime appropriate relatively rare instance fully credible. the fact many policymakers emerging-market economy seem adopt similar viewpoint recent year provide grind optimism that, future, emerging-market economy may experience few le severe financial crises. debt management in recent years, broad consensus emerge within international official community prudent debt liquidity management key element crisis prevention. emerging-market economy experience financial crisis late 1990s generally significant mismatch composition maturity liability asset leave vulnerable external shocks. in particular, almost crisis country high ratio short-term external debt foreign reserves. there much emphasis borrow strategy aim simply minimize short-term fund cost that, process, create significant rollover risks. authority also fail adequately monitor national balance sheet consolidate basis, take account off-balance-sheet obligations, implicit government guarantees, various contingent liability might arise private sector unable honor obligations. 4 bi review 102/2001 one general principle draw experience emerging-market country avoid issue large quantity short-term debt ongoing exposure rollover risk intensify vulnerability change market conditions. some initial fiscal cost may associate lengthen debt maturity long-term interest rate generally high short-term rates. however, extent lengthen maturity country's debt improve fiscal viability reduce likelihood borrow high rate charge crisis, increase debt-service cost see prudent insurance premium. in addition, development domestic government security markets, debt denominate local currency issued, help reduce vulnerability shift global capital flows. the international financial institution launch several initiative help emerging-market country improve debt- risk-management policies. last year, imf world bank staffs, respond discussion initiate financial stability forum, complete document entitle "guidelines public debt management" base principle discussed. these guideline use inform imf's technical assistance surveillance efforts. the imf also conduct research examine various indicator may serve guidepost debt may help manage reserve emerging-market economies. standard code among initiative arise emerging-market crisis international official community's effort articulate "standards codes" encourage improve practice economic financial policy emerging-market countries. some noteworthy progress make area. standard code develop cover wide array areas, include data quality dissemination, transparency monetary fiscal policy, best practice bank supervision, payment systems, account standards. the financial stability forum focus way provide incentive great compliance standard codes. the imf lead implementation effort, international bodies--including world bank, basel committee, organization economic cooperation development--are also take part. example action far include financial sector assessment program, imf bank staff ass strength vulnerability member countries' financial sectors, imf preparation report observance standard codes, address country's progress meet standard broad range areas. while promising, initiative without difficulties. implementation compliance emerging-markets country uneven, much remain done. market participant begin pay attention compliance standard codes, scope significant progress area remains. for example, compliance appear important set credit rat lend terms. more fundamentally, emerging-market country complain lack sensitivity particular circumstance, call realistic view feasible pace reform clear priorities. for emerging-market economies, make sense standard code focus minimum standard appropriate standard vary across country depend resource experience officials, structure financial systems, cultural value norms. because country may unique circumstances, international standard appropriate emerging-market economy. in basel ii process, example, standard appropriate large, internationally active bank develop industrial economy may inappropriate emerging-market economies. reform international financial institution another focus reform effort recent year international financial institutions. change made, planned. the imf's lend facility modified, include introduction "expectation early repurchase," tend reduce maturity imf lending, escalation loan charge country's outstanding obligation imf exceed certain thresholds. these measure intend encourage countries' return capital market quickly possible discourage excessive dependence imf financing. the imf also recently move make price contingent credit lines, ccl, attractive potential borrowers. the ccl establish 1999 provide liquidity prequalified country track record sound policies. however, facility never used. country bi review 102/2001 5 express concern benefit prequalified offset potential cost disqualify policy subsequently deem weakened. country also voice concern simply apply ccl may interpret market signal vulnerability. a mention previously, imf also move improve ability ass economic financial vulnerability members, include effort identify national balance sheet liquidity risks, part broad initiative strengthen imf's surveillance efforts. measure discourage misreporting strengthened, effort make make imf's operation transparent, include publication policy documents. the role conditionality imf program subject ongoing debate. critic argue programs, particularly construct asian crises, carry many detail condition focus disproportionately structural objective rather macroeconomic issue imf's core mandate. it argue represent micromanagement reduce scope country ownership adjustment programs. in response critique, imf say move streamline focus conditionality, particularly respect structural measures, provide great clarity condition certain area include exclude programs. though effort provide great focus conditionality welcome, come expense underlie rigor fund program protection resource conditionality provides. there also initiative reform multilateral development banks. it suggest increase selectivity projects, reform price policy involve differentiation across lend activity borrowers, improve method monitor compliance borrowers. in addition, call imf world bank show great sensitivity need world's poor countries. the process translate general principle concrete policy somewhat progressed, appear still early stages. private-sector involvement an important evolve aspect deal emerging-market financial crisis come refer private-sector involvement. the central issue role private-sector creditor default restructure emerging-market economy's debt. unlike bankruptcy firm domestic market, procedure generally codify settled, default sovereign nation currently involve bind legal jurisdiction enforcement mechanism. the goal private-sector involvement ensure that, crisis, private-sector creditors, particularly bondholder instrument denominate link foreign currency, participate effort resolve problem. such participation take various forms--debt exchanges, rollovers, restructurings, provision new money, outright losses. the extent private sector help resolve emerging-market crisis evolve time. during debt crisis 1980s, official support generally focus finance current account shortfall ease macroeconomic adjustment process. bank creditor restructure old loans, extend new loans, eventually--under brady plan--exchanged loan bond diminish value. during 1990s, however, bond become much important source credit many countries. this great importance raise new issue debt restructuring, give atomistic disperse nature bondholder group. the emergence large international support packages--for mexico 1995, several asian country brazil 1997 1998, turkey argentina recently--may see part response perceive difficulty engage private creditors, particularly bondholders, resolution emerging-market debt problems. this point, however, overstated. many private investors--most notably invest equities--have take substantial loss recent crises. the provision large financial-assistance package criticize focus two possible outcome emerging-market economy face financial difficulties--either default default, international official community view often endeavor avoid default costs. develop procedure aim facilitate intermediate solutions--namely, form debt restructure private-sector involvement--might, view, help avoid disruptive, corner solution outcomes. moreover, large support program criticize exacerbate so-called moral 6 bi review 102/2001 hazard encourage overborrowing overlending lead investor believe official community bail debt repayment problem arise. a key argument private-sector involvement market price risk properly allocate resource efficiently investor force bear cost bad decisions. the hope that, broad principle achieve private-sector involvement know advance, might reduce investors' uncertainty rule game help ensure workout proceed smoothly predictably. the principle could facilitate orderly resolution financial crisis might also help prevent crisis reduce uncertainty investor would deal time crisis. in recent years, tremendous amount discussion devote consider mean private investor could involve financial crisis orderly, systematic, predictable basis. yet effort still long way go. some member official community find difficult accept notion sanction arrears default. also, concern strict limitation official imf support could constrain official sector support genuinely need avert international contagion. agreement abstract principle private-sector involvement remain elusive, practical level, instance private-sector involvement accumulating, lay foundation practice precedent serve make future restructure orderly predictable. in recent years, international bond restructure conduct pakistan, ukraine, ecuador mean either deal exist default avoid impend default. in addition, imf-led financial assistance turkey argentina include various form private-sector involvement. the authority argentina currently exchange government debt term involve significant concession private sector. imf first deputy manage director anne krueger recently weigh issue international bankruptcy arrangements. she propose that, event imminent financial crisis imf borrower, be, among policies, imf-sanctioned temporary standstill debt-service payment negotiate restructure imf auspex debt private-sector creditors. though good international bankruptcy arrangement certainly longstanding need--as note chairman greenspan far back 1995, immediately mexican crisis--an initial read krueger's proposal suggest would face significant practical problems. the major problem krueger proposal, scheme establish international bankruptcy arrangements, stem fundamental fact political sovereignty nations. debtor creditor country alike would cede significant sovereignty imf krueger's proposal would almost certainly prove reluctant so. krueger's proposal merit study, evolutionary, piecemeal change international debt-restructuring arrangements, i discuss general rubric private-sector involvement, probably represent realistic hope near-term improvement international bankruptcy arrangements. what be leave to be done? i outline main effort prevent mitigate financial crisis emerging-market economies. now question arises--what main task remain accomplished? many initiative i discussed, formulation standard codes, reform international financial institutions, development procedure private-sector involvement debt restructurings, process already well way momentum own. these area much need new initiative extending, improving, implement exist initiatives. for future, main objective improve economic policymaking institution emerging-market economies. all economy subject periodic external financial shocks. but shock unlikely turn financial crisis country experience shock sound macroeconomic environment robust, well- regulate financial institutions. it hard think emerging-market economy experience crisis past decade preexist financial market weakness prominent feature. they certainly play central role asian financial crisis late 1990s, financial-sector reform key ingredient imf program country entered. though significant progress make regard, much remain done. in particular, sometimes governmental initiative launch area bank reform corporate governance without sufficient followup. once stable financial-market bi review 102/2001 7 condition returned, hard work implement financial-sector reform sometimes slackened. however, extent significant financial-sector weakness remain, potential future crises. economic crisis emerging-market economy usually manifest form financial-market pressures, unsound fiscal policy frequently root problem. an unsustainable fiscal position often prove main threat financial stability. fiscal problem important factor crisis experience mexico russia second half 1900s argentina currently. if market participant come perceive high level government debt continue fiscal deficit threaten government's ability willingness meet debt obligations, capital flight triggered. when government's fiscal position truly unsustainable, international financial assistance aim provide temporary liquidity suffice, form debt restructure become unavoidable. thus, sound fiscal position important healthy financial sector prevent emerging-market financial crises. we must realistic feasible pace improvement economic policymaking many countries. economic institution practice take long time develop--they cannot put place change radically overnight. furthermore, i argue previously, effort introduce policy open economy international market appropriate legal institutional infrastructure place--for example, take control short-term capital movement bank system underdevelop inadequately regulated--can counterproductive. thus importance sequencing--of coordinate time policy reform evolution support institutions. some change international economic environment recent year appear favorable reduction likelihood financial crisis emerging-market economies. although difficult generalize, macroeconomic policymaking emerging-market economy seem improve somewhat recent years. the trend toward adoption flexible exchange rate regime already mentioned. also, past decade policymakers emerging-market country seem develop heighten recognition cost high inflation, evidence general reduction inflation rate economy period. the behavior investor international capital market appear evolve way make future financial crisis somewhat le likely also. the composition international capital flow shift toward relatively foreign direct investment longer-term portfolio investment relatively le flow shorter-term "hot money" investments. also, international investor seem differentiate clearly among emerging-market economies, indicate current wide dispersion debt spread across countries. this situation could mean le potential serious contagion one country get trouble, since would reduce tendency treat emerging-market country alike. the far minimal financial market spillover emerging-market economy current difficulty argentina turkey consistent trend. furthermore, extent international investor differentiate among emerge markets, country incentive improve availability quality economic data way favorably distinguish themselves. conclusion in conclusion, worth reiterate important consideration prevent future emerging-market financial crisis establish sound domestic policy robust financial institution individual economies. no reform international financial architecture can, themselves, overcome deficiency critical areas. however, incremental contribution nonetheless make improvement international financial system international institutions. such initiative provide information, incentives, assistance emerging-market economy encourage adopt sound policy mitigate damage international financial market problem arise. a number initiative way, hold promise reduce incidence severity emerging-market financial crisis future. bi review 102/2001 1 i j macfarlane: australia international cycle talk mr i j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, australian business economists/economic society australia (new south wale

recently period mid 1997 begin 1999, asian crisis confront u pronounce fall demand export pretty skittish international capital markets. we survive – indeed, prosper – period, much good u think likely time. now confront another period weak international demand, time unite state – former powerhouse world economy – principal source weakness. this time confront problem global rather specific region. the current problem not, course, start 11 september, i think tendency exaggerate economic consequence event, under-estimate underlie weakness precede it. if i give date become clear international economy rough ride, i would nominate 3 january, feed surprise everyone first reduction interest rate phase fortnight previous meet keep rate constant. after flurry interest rate reduction around world next months, situation settle while. in australia, three initial reductions, pause four month evaluate incoming information. by mid august, conclude international situation worsen again, begin second round ease early september, week fateful event new york. thus, take event together, situation conscious weaken world economy virtually full year. during time – three quarter cover national account – australian economy grow annual rate 4 per cent, u flat. we also do good comparable economies. this encourage result us, success far guarantee success future. indeed, large body opinion say destine follow others led. table 2 growth inflation 2001 per cent, year-to-date annualised. gdp growth cpi inflation unite state 0.2 2.1 canada 0.5 1.8 euro area 0.9 2.5 unite kingdom 2.1 1.5 australia 4.0 3.0 i suppose question everyone’s lip quite month – world economy go recession, unite state japan do much rest world seem doing, mean australia follow? people would answer yes question would point do past, example, mid 1970s, early 1980s early 1990s. why time different? this view world i would call historical determinism, may may good guide. but accept prediction, challenge close examination circumstance now. what examination reveal present domestic circumstance different prevail early episodes. to put bluntly, bring lot problem previous episodes, whereas time do so. on previous occasions, could honesty make claim mainly fault rest world – much fault clearly making. in words, australia lot serious domestic imbalance contribute downturns. imbalance - for start, early downturn precede episode high inflation. in 1970s 1980s, cpi rise double digits; 1990s, although measure peak low rate – 8 per cent – accompany unsustainably high asset price inflation. accordingly, monetary policy tighten three occasion combat imbalances, short- bi review 102/2001 3 term interest rate reach high level – either little 20 per cent occasion. nothing remotely like happen time either inflation interest rates. perhaps importantly, monetary policy time able ease much early previous occasion – interest rate successively low nearly year now, economy grow good rate. while i think different behaviour inflation interest rate big change now, number factor contribute difficulty early time present now. i list before, harm again: • there large rise real wage squeeze business sector 1970s 1980s. this time wage grow reasonably steady 3½ per cent per annum past year two. • there investment boom lead over-capacity early 1980s. investment quite subdue past two years, and, normal circumstances, due pick-up. even current circumstances, straightforward read last week’s capex survey suggest rise current financial year, though concentrate mostly one sector (mining). • in early 1990s, exchange rate appreciate sharply period ahead downturn. on occasion, go without say exchange rate exert expansionary influence. • on early occasion, deficit current account balance payment widen amount alarm many people. on occasion, fall level see 20 years. i return subject later, i so, i would like address another form historical determinism. imbalance - unite state australia the macro-economic performance australia unite state term output growth inflation similar 1990s. it would therefore unreasonable ask question also similar first year new century. again, i think reasonably straightforward answer question stress big difference two economies. • the u economy exhibit late stage expansion two three development arguably warrant use term “bubble”: • the u stock market, particularly technology sector measure nasdaq, rise exceptional height since fallen. the broad index s&p 500 wilshire 25 per cent peak, whereas australia asx 200 4 per cent. • in unite states, burst physical investment towards end expansion, mainly high technology equipment. we see reaction consequent excess capacity, form sharp fall investment. a explain earlier, pattern action reaction absent australia. • the trade-weighted value u dollar rise appreciably recent year and, despite low interest rate fast country year, currency remain high level. these three factor really manifestation excessive euphoria associate widely hold view secret economic success pour resource “high tech” sector. in event, country expose sector one show large fall output. 4 bi review 102/2001 the transmission world australia so far, i emphasise strong point australian economy, difference u vulnerable economies. but would foolish deny fall, even pronounce slowdown, world economy world trade would significant contractionary effect australian economy. clearly, effect occur, already show up. the two classical channel fall volume export low term trade, may also channels. the remainder presentation look probable size channels. table 3 export contribution gdp downturn period (year-ended) contribution gdp mid 1970s mar 1974 –1.4 early 1980s jun 1983 –0.9 early 1990s dec 1989 0.3 it true world recessions, volume australian export usually falls. table 3 show time previous world recessions, australia experience period fall weak export roughly coincident recessions. but negative contribution gdp one year large; big identify 1.4 percentage point year march 1974. clearly, rest economy grow reasonable rate, would enough induce recession. traditionally, australian economy reputation good economy good time suffer bad times. one reflection australian dollar see “commodity currency” heavily influence term trade. again, true previous world recessions, australia experience period fall term trade coincide roughly recessions. the big negative contribution 1.7 percentage point gdi year march 1975 (following massive positive contribution previous two years). the magnitude effect that, although make noticeable contribution slow economy, would enough cause recession. table 4 term trade contribution national income (gdi) downturn period contribution gdi mid 1970s year mar

like say little term trade i leave subject. a i say earlier, tendency see australia sort “loser” international economic competition vulnerability term trade movements. there assumption term trade subject long-term downward trend, also cyclically sensitive, characteristic stem unfortunate export mix, over-representation “commodities”. i think somewhat date view follow reasons: • on question long-run trends, note low point term trade far back 1986/87. the two trough since successively high levels. • on question cyclical sensitivity, conflict signal recent years. our term trade fell mid 1997 mid 1998 result asian crisis, since time, i.e. past three years, risen, even though last three year weak one world economy. they peak reach immediately asian crisis. • the focus export price misplace really interest action seem take place import prices. they cyclical export prices, show pronounce downward trend 1990s, particularly past five years. we know lot due sharp fall price telecommunication compute equipment, widespread this. of 29 category good ab publish import prices, 26 fell sdr term 1996 present. nearly category manufacture goods. whether trend price particular category internationally-traded good depend large extent long-run supply elasticities. it seem likely high supply elasticity find large-scale manufacture rather resource-based goods. semi-conductors obvious example, le sophisticate product clothing, textile footwear, also seem true electrical equipment, automobiles, many type industrial equipment. in senses, “commodities” international trade. i suggest manufacture good characteristic, seem do. my conclusion discussion movement exports, import term trade big enough transmit world recession domestic recession. a fall domestic spend would require bring result. why domestic spend fall domestic economy reasonably good shape? one possible explanation multiplier effect export sector, econometric estimate suggest would large enough tip balance. another channel confidence effect – perhaps business consumer confidence influenced, domestic developments, also international ones. give 6 bi review 102/2001 massive amount information u economy routinely transmit australians, would surprise case. it clear international event show measure confidence among australian consumer business, september 11 obvious example. but, hand, consumer confidence still long-term average, like measure business confidence, recent trough march/april period 2001 – nine month ago. at time, get bad news domestic front, particularly temporary decline gdp december quarter 2000. the level confidence recover temporary trough, average past six months, good deal high early year, hold reasonably well recent international turmoil. there one thing recent business behaviour worry little, far seem mainly confine unite states. i refer practice company announce large lay-offs employment whenever downward earn revision occurs. this practice doubt design please investor therefore prop company’s share price. if lay-offs occur announced, suggest rapid employment response previous downturns. while practice may help one company view isolation, serious error think company general protect earn way. earn mean decline cyclically circumstance present impossible cut cost fast revenue declining. the cyclical fall earn resist way, transfer employment, pronounce cycle becomes. conclusion calendar year 2001 difficult one world economy, first half 2002 look like remain weak recovery get underway. this would mean 18 month economic weakness world economy, classify recession like mid 1970s, early 1980s early 1990s. the australian economy get first half reasonably good shape consider circumstances. can keep present performance environment reasonable world growth? can span valley? i give number reason i think can, even though experience fall exports, fall earn usual inventory adjustments. these example externally-induced contractionary effect cannot avoided, big enough cause recession. for occur, would see over-reaction domestic consumer businesses. the evidence date survey confidence, household spend business investment intention hold reasonably well. far over-reacting, exert generally stabilise influence. if change worse, appear outlook world economy weak currently assumed, prepare adjust monetary policy accordingly. bi

power, term may diplomatically familiar: 25 pound dinner london restaurant would set south african diplomat back r280 begin 2001. just christmas 2001, would cost diplomat r500. today, meal's bill

import substitution progress south african export penetrate various market quite successfully. this help along improve market access. in regard, africa growth opportunity act unite state mentioned,

share output flow export market. in process, upcoming market china india also receive due attention. tourism also well spite of, perhaps even of, unease follow september 11 attacks. south africa pleasant destination. the number non-residents visit south africa rise 4,8 million first 10 month 2001 5,3 million period 2002. visitor number virtually country increase significantly, exception argentina - worsen exchange rate instance cause decrease 13 000 person ten month october last year 4 000 year. under circumstances, south africa maintain healthy growth rate first three quarter 2002. it seem likely growth real gross domestic product year amount around 3 per cent, compare 2,8 per cent 2001. it also hearten growth spread across virtually sector economy. a gratify aspect economy's current performance acceleration real fix capital formation, necessary boost future production potential economy. from contraction 1999, real fix capital formation reverse 0,8 per cent growth 2000,

without create job huge number unemployed people. however, second quarter 2002 quarterly survey non-agricultural employment series pick up, rise 0,6 per cent. this may early days, stand welcome contrast decline trend employment record since 1989. sadly, 2001 fall external value rand cause strong surge inflation 2002. this first foremost visible production prices, accelerate twelve-month rate

inflation 6 3 per cent target range, south african reserve bank respond tighten monetary policy. on occasion, january, march, june september 2002, reserve bank's repurchase rate raise one percentage point, lead correspond increase interest rate charge commercial banks. the banks' prime overdraft rate instance rise 13 per cent begin year 17 per cent present. at level, public clearly feel impact monetary policy. our assessment sufficient bring inflation fairly dramatic fashion course next year. but dish medicine make bank popular. bi review 72/2002 3 partly reaction tight monetary conditions,

worth imports, double much 5 year ago. it pleasant duty also point south africa's government finance healthy shape, tax revenue exceed early projection deficit borrow 2002/03 project amount 1,6 per cent gdp. le pleasant point setback bank system early 2002. one trouble bank's business eventually sell institutions, second medium-sized bank acquire one big four banks. this episode test numerous depositors' bankers' nerve extreme; many elderly investor choose keep deposit one institution, wise move. 4. financial market south africa's financial market robust, liquid well-developed. turnover remain brisk 2002 date. in bond market, example, value turnover single month approximately equal south africa's annual gross domestic product one trillion rand. non-residents also take keen interest markets. in average month non-residents buy r100 billion bond r18 billion share bourses. they course usually sell bond share roughly equal amount, net inflow outflow record month month. during first half 2002 nonresident buy net amount r13 billion share bond south african formal exchanges, sell r17 billion third quarter. further net sale october follow net purchase november. predict foreign

economy open statement mr i j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, warrnambool, 6 december 2002. * * * i would like endorse remark chairman say pleasure warrnambool, second hear conduct outside sydney-melbourne-canberra triangle. the first wagga wagga, i remember time suggest second little away canberra. warrnambool pass test important agricultural tourist centre, fit venue meeting. i would also like thank mayor warrnambool, councillor jam nicol, hospitality host civic reception committee member bank appear it. i would like start substance statement observe six month hear previous one may quite lot changed, important influence judgment need monetary policy. this change happen relatively steadily, result financial market public generally trouble adjust change outlook. we assisted, think necessary, way several speech article subject past six months; probably help margin, although i think public difficulty recognise change outlook unfolded. that so, could argue nothing add subject. however, i aware fact i give quite frank indication expect future direction monetary policy previous hearing, indication follow through. so i would like place record committee another account change circumstances, even risk accuse go old ground. in may i say committee since australian economy behave normally, world economy get back normal, unless unforeseen development intruded, continue process get real interest rate back normal, time carefully examine incoming data, abroad, ensure development remain track. we continue process get interest rate towards normal june, do anything direction follow six months. why not? i think answer obvious nearly everyone - something intrude incoming data abroad show development remain track. after promise start year, world economy begin weaken mid-year. financial market - particularly equity bond market - first show begin second quarter year. by mid-year also sign range economic indicator unite state euro area recovery likely weak formerly thought. these sign tend become clear event progress second half year. a good way summarise large body data look three indicator perception economic conditions: business confidence, consumer confidence, consensus forecast gdp growth. a see graph unite state euro area, indicator show clear improvement first half year follow clear deterioration second half. so see world economy weaken calendar year 2001, apparent strong recovery first half 2002, follow relapse second half 2002. the relapse mean world economy return recession, indicate recovery go weak think likely mid-year. this gradual change outlook second half year obviously implication monetary policy around world. in first half year, country strong fundamentals, australia, canada, new zealand sweden, start process get interest rate back normal. this process occur meet may, and, i say time, process think would continuing. in event, continue much longer, fact none country raise rate since july, one (sweden) cut them, unite states. 2 bi review 72/2002 the caution show central bank derive part downward revision world growth, also part suspicion risk downside. in words, outcome different consensus occur, would likely weak stronger. have say that, i recognise even though second half year disappoint compare first half, equity bond market become little confident past month so. it soon, course, know whether represent change direction another blip data. turn australian economy, i approach way usual practice review forecast i give committee last time present new ones. last time i say expect gdp growth 2002/03 3½ 4 per cent - forecast around 3 per cent. obviously, major factor behind reduction drought, weak world economy also effect margin. on hand, fact house-building forecast continue expand long period push forecast somewhat. for next year, calendar 2003, forecast growth year 3¾ per cent. the fact high current financial year rest importantly assumption recovery drought second half year, world economic recovery gradually pick momentum year. a i say before, strength house-building continue long early thought: nevertheless, still expect downturn occur sector course 2003, subtract growth. on inflation front, i say forecast cpi remain near top target range 2002/03, although expect go slightly time come back up. implicit forecast rise phase would continue mid-2003 so, thing equal, begin exceed target range second half 2003. what happen far headline cpi slightly 3 per cent, estimate underlie inflation run 2¾ per cent. we see reason expect underlie inflation rise further, forecast stay around rate calendar 2003. the main reason slight downward revision compare forecast six month ago low forecast world australian growth. the price effect result drought effect hold cpi inflation next quarter two reduce slightly late forecast period. bi review 72/2002 3 i would like return subject committee spend fair bite time discuss may, namely residential property prices. a know, become particularly concern issue notice virtually increase house loan approval past year go investors, aspire owner-occupiers. at time, build approval data show monthly approval build multi-unit developments, i.e. apartments, speed exceptionally fast pace, approval build house go along steadily. these development suggest u disproportionate amount upward pressure residential property price come investors. one response would sit back say nothing, grind market would sort problem. we accept doubt would, could take lot time, excess could get bad meantime, eventual resolution issue could cause lot financial distress. the problem market works, long lag people encourage take decision base little optimistic extrapolation past. developer continue put new apartment block ever investor will pre-commit buy. when investor purchase apartment plan (and almost exclusively investor market directed), make financial commitment wisdom may become apparent 18 month so. it take possession apartment discover whether find tenant will pay high enough rent justify financial calculation underlay original purchase. of course, individual investor hope get around problem sell another investor, turn depend find renter. investor group dependent find enough tenant will pay sufficiently high rent time comes, may 18 month away more. these investment calculation (or forecasts) difficult, fear many investor assume thing work out, dangerous thing make highly-leveraged investment. certainly, recent trend would warn assumption. from best figure available, clear rent fall vacancy rate apartment rising. and, pipeline partly-built build completed, many new apartment come onto market next two year recent years. our purpose say try get market work little good avoid overshoot often characterise part property market. we remember excess occur commercial property 1980s large fall price follow them. investor remember even buy residential unit, make 4 bi review 72/2002 commercial property decision, i.e. borrow investment rent tenant purpose make profit. there preliminary indication market force start work last. i already refer fall rent rise vacancy rates, also recent evidence flatten or, cases, fall apartment price mark fall auction clearance rate sydney melbourne. there also report ambitious project plan brisbane melbourne withdrawn, make surprise large increase october approval build multi-unit buildings. on balance, however, developments, fully understand investors, make cautious limit extent over-supply come years. i suppose big event area occur since meet last may bring final report reform credit card scheme australia august. in context, welcome endorsement reforms, chairman, ‘an important win australian consumers’. our intention, state document, put reform effect stage next year. although reform challenge court two main international credit card systems, i think court action prevent answer questions. i think i need say present. we plenty time discus subject i cover plus others committee member may wish raise. bi review 72/2002 1 ernst welteke: an institutional framework monetary stability open speech mr ernst

foundation. it great pleasure able welcome president william poole federal reserve bank st. louis, professor otmar issing mr nout wellink govern council ecb, counsellor gerd häusler imf. it honour mr stanley fischer, vice-chairman citigroup, find time us. last least, i especially delight many prominent member academic world take part conference. i wish extend warm welcome professor alan meltzer behalf. the monetary stability foundation establish 1 january year. but idea behind foundation naturally much old that. one think uppermost mind desire transfer positive quality associate 50 year stable money germany new era european monetary union. that important outset. and i happy take on, together finance minister han eichel, sponsorship major inaugural conference foundation. han eichel address tonight. good time bad time teach german people importance stable money stable financial system. one may well ask whether, light this, really necessary underline point yet again. however, history also teach u stability never take granted. prior start monetary union indeed fear end d-mark might harm stability culture. we take worry seriously - show maastricht treaty escb's monetary policy make clear. naturally intellectual basis policy continually examine anew. time new challenge arise new development take consideration. i wish cite examples. since 1960s attention worldwide direct primarily towards fight inflation. however, past year show seriously danger deflation take well. the transformation process former socialist country make u aware important institutional framework are. we become aware importance think statutory frameworks, least financial world. the academic debate correct strategy monetary policy go on. with creation ecb debate actually become lively again. i could cite many example show that, even today, automatic mean ensure stable money stable markets. it ongoing task. in word goethe: “what inherit father / earn yourselves, order posse it.” in sense task monetary stability foundation encourage research area. and, more, broad basis. the fund already available purpose come issue dm 1 gold coin bundesbank. 2 bi review 72/2002 indeed, last summer experience unusually heavy demand gold coin. part net proceeds, dm 100 million (or € 51 million), form foundation's capital base. this link d-mark underline quite clearly much foundation bind monetary stability. by far great part foundation's fund use finance research unit, link university. this research interdisciplinary nature. monetary stability study point view economics, finance law. it desire centre pursue new avenue academic study policy consultation. interest institution currently ask apply. eighteen university express interest first round. however, take time yet process finalised. a small part foundation's income use future finance scholarship conferences. and bring back point today: inaugural conference new foundation. it also cue hand professor hermann remsperger, chairman supervisory board monetary stability foundation. he make start conference, i declare open. i hope enjoy two interest informative day frankfurt. thank much. bi review 71/2002 1 glenn stevens: inflation, deflation speech mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, australian business economist 2002 forecast conference dinner, sydney, 4 december 2002. * * * introduction in formative year current generation economists, inflation consider one press macroeconomic problems. that's surprising, since net rise price occur human history take place late 1940s 1990, plot price index industrial country would show. in australia's case, observable 1950s that, period business cycle downturn, price stop rise actually fall. this contrast pre-world war ii experience, price level fall recessions. by second half 1960s, even clear price level acquire persistent upward trend, around time become normal look price level first difference form (i.e. inflation rate) rather level.1 a u remember well, inflation reach nearly 20 per cent mid 1970s. thereafter police aim reduce it, mix success first, last success aftermath early-1990s downturn. a number country clearly break back serious inflation early 1980s; take little longer. but general could say period really serious inflation western world last late 1960s early 1990s. the subsequent decade period low inflation almost everywhere. most recently, global business cycle downturn, inflation globally decline further, currently low low places. so natural ask whether, generation worry inflation, might face deflation. certainly word 'deflation' use much great frequency long time. it use usually conjure vague notion great depression, last time widespread deflation occurred. so worth examine detail. i want first clear mean deflation, ask whether fact occurring. then i want ask whether worry it, so, might counter it. 1 a gauge i consult successive rba annual reports. throughout 1960s, level cpi plot charts. the first time appear change report 1969/70. 2 bi review 71/2002 let clear outset, i repeat follows, australia experience deflation now, unlikely time soon. the issue international one much domestic one, give prominence worth consideration. 1. what deflation, would problem? deflation generalise persistent decline most, all, price good services. more likely this, occurred, would accompany decline price many real asset pressure for, even actuality of, decline wage salary incomes. a situation observe decline price product qualify deflation sense. it nearly always case price thing falling, price thing rising. be look 100-odd expenditure class australian consumer price index, would find 30 record decline particular quarter. this feature low inflation era since 1990. even high inflation period 1970s 1980s, normal see 10 15 per cent expenditure class record price decline give quarter. this kind relative price change price mechanism work market economy, distinguish general deflation price thing decline. a simple useful work definition deflation, then, price enough good service decline cause aggregate price index like cpi record fall. deflation general nature not-uncommon event. for example, nineteenth century, normal think relatively stable average price level fairly long periods, noticeable fluctuation around mean period year – period inflation follow period deflation. in australia, 1914, deflation occur almost half year data, outcome dissimilar see country (see follow table). it really last decade twentieth century become accustom idea price level normally rises, even time peace, almost never declines. bi review 71/2002 3 deflation proportion year cpi fell (year-average basis) 1870-1914 inter-war post war australia 45.5 36.4 1.8 canada 31.8 40.9 1.8 unite kingdom 38.6 36.4 0.0 unite state 25.0 50.0 3.5 austria 50.0 22.7 1.8 belgium 43.2 31.8 7.0 denmark 54.5 45.5 3.5 finland 34.1 40.9 1.8 france 59.1 40.9 3.5 germany 38.6 22.7 5.3 italy 45.5 31.8 1.8 japan

university press, oxford.subsequently, national sources. deflation need harmful. in case exceptionally strong productivity growth accompany strong demand growth, price level fall even incomes, profit economic activity expand. this sort 'good' deflation can, principle, see aftermath sort technology breakthrough, perhaps open previously over-regulated close economy incentive competitive market place. no-one likely worry much sort deflation, coincide feel increase prosperity. why might deflation harmful? the main reason fix nominal contract wages, debts, etc. the real value dollar high deflation before. so owe dollar, debt burden higher. if owe dollar, earn dollar, real wealth income higher. price change nature, unanticipated, lead different distribution wealth income people bank make contracts. usually, disruptive economy (not mention unfair). this problem exactly nature arise inflation, except reverse. in time, course, people learn price change occurring, adjust behaviour accordingly. but adjust income downward deflation typically hard adjust upwards inflation. so percentage point percentage point, deflation arguably bite painful inflation. harmful deflation typically occur parallel development price asset balance sheets. this usually aftermath boom accommodate big run debt, involve large increase capacity response optimistic expectation future sale profits. when optimistic expectation cannot met, apparent firm over-invested over-leveraged. they pressure shore balance sheets. asset price fall, firm seek disinvest. bank lender find quality asset deteriorated, tempt reduce flow new credit order conserve capital. aggregate demand economy declines, price good service fall. this 'debt deflation' describe irving fisher many year ago. depend size precede boom, policy pursue bust, process exceedingly painful. 4 bi review 71/2002 in case expectation ongoing deflation become strongly held, moreover, possible fairly serious problem economic management emerge. expectation price continually fall may lead people postpone spending, course amplify deflationary pressure. the rate deflation might, extreme circumstances, also mean attempt boost growth reduce interest rate run problem nominal interest rate cannot fall zero, might mean real interest rate high economy's needs. i return below. 2. be deflation happening? might happen widely? deflation certainly happen australia. for year past, cpi rise 3 per cent. underlie measure rise slightly le that. about 70 per cent item cpi basket record increases, 30 per cent fell, i note fairly typical experience past decade. in part economy price determine market force (as oppose subject direct influence government), price good rise 2 per cent, price service rise nearly 5 per cent. in period ahead, forecast inflation continue now. nor deflation happening, normal definition, north america europe. the u cpi rise 1½ per cent past year. good price decline 1 per cent, partly result strength u dollar, service price rise 3½ per cent. in europe, cpi rise core term bite 2 per cent, good price little 1 per cent, service price 3 per cent. the low rate price increase occur germany belgium, inflation 1 per cent cases. so deflation average, even low tail distribution. rate price increase are, however, pretty low around world. the chart show characteristic set inflation outcome group countries, 48 all, classify imf advance industrial country emerge market countries. the median inflation rate 2½ per cent, 6½ per cent 1990. the twentieth percentile inflation rate simple unweighted distribution 1½ per cent – i.e. one country five sample inflation 1½ per cent lower. the eightieth percentile inflation rate 5½ per cent, compare 25 per cent 1990. bi review 71/2002 5 give central tendency inflation low, surprise that, look low tail distribution broad group, find handful country deflation. interestingly, asia.2 the chart show annual average inflation rate hide short-run dynamics. but one count five country asia whose annual cpi inflation figure now, point within past year been, zero. these china, japan, hong kong, singapore taiwan. one could debate individual case proximate cause are, whether 'good' deflation bad. china's deflation arguably candidate classify 'good' deflation, since seem associate rapid overall growth rise live standards. hong kong's deflation partly necessitate peg strong u dollar, though cumulative decline 13 per cent hong kong's cpi since mid 1998, half due decline rents, associate decline house value early boom there. of course, hong kong impressive capacity adjust shocks, even painful process. there doubt japan's deflation bad kind. various factor work countries. but stand back individual cases, something pattern. while hardly amount widespread deflation, deflationary spiral, clear instance fall price little common, tend little persistent, use case. nor process decline inflation necessarily finished. accord imf forecasts, world economy grow le average 2001 2002, 2003 forecast see roughly average growth. in words, crudely measured, global spare capacity increasing, remain elevate next year. short inflationary shock occur supply side, would unreasonable expect global inflation average decline next year two. so year two now, average inflation could low indeed, could easily country low tail distribution outcome experience deflation. for major country apart japan, deflation seem likely outcome, dip zero inflation rate is, perhaps, within distribution possible outcome cases. so even though outlook could class general deflation global sense, probably enough instance deflation around people talk year two. 2 argentina deflation prior collapse currency board arrangement early year, follow rather familiar problem inflation, accompany host serious difficulties. 6 bi review 71/2002 3. should worry deflation? i already say seem unlikely anyone worry much 'good' deflation, give part story rise prosperity. it obviously kind deflation people worry about. this symptom sick economy, profit poor hence prospect near-term growth relatively weak, unless consumer government induce expand spend quickly date. but extent kind deflation symptom problem weak demand, weakness worry u deflation per se. imagine two scenarios. the first one inflation been, expect remain, steady 3 per cent. everyone's behaviour fully adjust expectation. then, result period temporary demand weakness, inflation fall 1 per cent. the second one inflation been, expect remain, steady 1 per cent, everyone's behaviour fully adjust expectation. then, result period temporary demand weakness extent first scenario, inflation fall -1 per cent. apart absolute numbers, two case identical. should worry latter former, simply zero line crossed?3 3 i obviously abstract australian circumstances. if target inflation rate 2½ per cent, inflation fall -1 per cent, would serious miss target. that would reason concern – every bite big concern inflation go 6 per cent – mostly deviation target rather negative sign would worry. bi review 71/2002 7 on first pass, clear should. both outcome cause weak demand, worry u equally cases. both inflation 2 percentage point low anticipate – mean income wealth behave differently people's expectations. that disruptive equal concern case. in cases, outcome is, course, cause action expand demand. there may sufficient nominal rigidity around zero adjustment temporary period unexpectedly low inflation awkward second case. if true, reason aim inflation 1 per cent start – that's another story. but apart that, temporary drop zero line due cyclical period demand weakness otherwise healthy economy obviously cause much concern cross 2 per cent line would imaginary economy here. at least, provide drop temporary, expectation future price change remain well-anchored bite zero. but happen expectation ongoing deflation take hold? that different. here scenario i think people worry about: kind mild temporary deflation symptom period short-term economic weakness, kind deflation might cause economic weakness future. the reason get concern possibility may easy escape situation. to put stark, imagine economy deflation strongly expect continue, rate exceed natural real interest rate economy – equilibrium return real capital. in situation, nominal interest rate cannot fall zero, real interest rate set central bank cannot go natural 'neutral' rate. since conventional monetary policy work expansionary direction low interest rate financial sector neutral rate, follow conventional monetary policy render incapable apply stimulus economy situation. the real interest rate high, mean policy remain contractionary, prolong deflationary pressure. there 'deflation trap', learn undergraduate economics 'liquidity trap'. some argue right diagnosis japan's situation.4 the question is: likely country get sort problem? my view le likely occur dynamic economy asia. these country must tremendous opportunity profitable investment future. on assumption, natural interest rate almost certainly much high present likely future rate deflation. so deflation low inflation country probably sign temporarily weak demand, something policymakers presumably wish address, still seem likely find deflation trap kind sketch above. what us? we tell year return capital high, associate strong productivity growth. for late 1990s, market certainly behave though expectation. if still think prospective return pretty good, one would unlikely worry get deflation trap. it would take pretty large, persistently expect deflation rate spring trap. of course, excessive build-up capital, return might poor while, natural rate might low period take excess work off. that case make investment information technology communication make second half 1990s u elsewhere. but large chunk 'old economy' probably reasonable, even spectacular, prospect returns, obviously follow u economy danger kind deflationary experience would awkward stop. that say, course, u monetary policy necessarily work miracle return u economy full health strength hurry – always take time, even policy effectiveness. the point simply conclude monetary policy has, yet, lose potency. perhaps case little le clear cut part europe, various economic rigidity may constrain business profitability countries. but many country periphery euro area, potential entrant common currency, would appear strong investment opportunities. if expense investment core countries, matter 4 i go skip issue whether 'quantitative'measures help here. 8 bi review 71/2002 adjustment (including relative price levels, charlie bean5 recently point out). it look like generalise deflation trap. widen perspective global one, observe excess supply many global industries, hard believe much capital everywhere, excess rationalisation. be us, example, satiate infrastructure airports, roads, electricity generation, name few? be world's emerge market satiated? and process innovation development new product market grind halt? that's unlikely. it's likely medium term hold many opportunity profitable deployment capital, different place rage late 1990s. 4. what deflation occur? to summarise discussion: • deflation widespread, persistent decline level prices. • it happen australia, likely foreseeable future. it happen japan several years. it happen major countries, though inflation rate quite low now, deflation little common internationally past decades. it quite possible country experience mild degree deflation point next years, entirely inconceivable one two major country might among them. • in majority case deflation clearly symptom weakness demand output, would occurred, matter concern reason. • in relatively case likely expect deflation cause economic weakness. japan arguably position, country currently experience deflation seem likely find natural rate interest low policy rate cannot get it. whether one think zero interest rate constraint likely bind u euro area, experience deflation, hinge one's view outlook return capital. these might poor sectors, follow poor across board. have say that, japan's experience show deflation happen, still ask: response policymakers give possibility, reality, deflation? the first thing say that, countries, deflation outcome avoided, like inflation avoided. stability general level prices, interpret practice low positive rate price increase, appropriate goal. forward-looking monetary policy seek maintain inflation zero, actively look keep maximum rate. so, state obvious, first order business is: set avoid deflation. second, deflation occur unexpectedly, end world. don't panic. but country would probably signify insufficient aggregate demand relative supply. demand management policies, could pre-empt situation, respond forcefully ex post. third, thing avoid strenuously persistent deflation become embody expectations. it situation question deflation trap become relevant, particularly country natural interest rate come low levels. policy must work keep price expectation fall far, hard work get expectation excessive level early times, articulate goal clearly, see take action consistent achieve goals. fourth, if, despite effort monetary policy, persistent deflation become embody expectation zero interest rate become, threaten become, bind constraint, role policies. if structural rigidity reduce return capital, 5 see 'the mpc uk economy: should fear d-words?', speech charles bean, chief economist, bank england, the emmanuel society, london, 25 november 2002 - available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches/speech182.pdf bi review 71/2002 9 example, deflationary environment, thing hamper macro policy's effort engender recovery. so policy address problem would important. these would include make sure excess capacity rationalise allow failure weak suppliers, efficient survive producer expect earn reasonable return. further, active use fiscal policy promote recovery would quite order case entrench deflation, especially country fiscal consolidation achieve good times. in situation investor saw little return private investment, hard believe would good economic social return various form public investment. hence would be, scenario, strong case short-term stabilisation grind government borrow invest. conclusion i sure one sensibly say deflation present. the fact talk possibility remarkable change year ago. insofar mean 'great inflation'is well truly finished, good thing, provide course alert new sort risk emerge. there probably bite much emotive baggage carry word 'deflation'. for average country, short-lived experience mild deflation, occurred, would end world, even unprecedented. it would sign problem insufficient aggregate demand ideally avoided, which, fail that, address quickly. the observe deflation would tell u thing various real activity indicators: thing weak economy need encouragement grow. the big concern would possibility ‘deflation trap’ conventional monetary policy would become largely ineffective. it seem country likely outcome anyway, good policy round able lessen probability further. even country find situation unexpectedly, beyond capacity policymakers devise way get it, although would want full armoury policy disposal. australia would one last economy world deflation would expected. in remote possibility occur here, could expect would still plenty investment possibilities. so unless corporate financial sectors' financial structure become seriously flaw – something sign present – would ample scope monetary policy stimulus effective. in (even unlikely) event enough, government sector exceptionally strong balance sheet would well-positioned use fiscal policy assist economy, extreme situation. i hope help u realistic balance assessment deflation, way concern affect think policies. thank attention. bi review 71/2002 1 willem f duisenberg: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, brussels, 3 december 2002. * * * it pleasure continue today regular dialogue. i start open remark explanation european central bank's assessment economic monetary developments. subsequently, i address issue relate eu arrangement financial regulation, supervision stability. economic monetary development already time last meet october, expectation fade economic activity euro area would reach growth rate line trend potential end 2002. in course summer, downside risk economic growth become evident, reduce likelihood upward risk price stability would materialise. this development mainly relate episode turbulence financial market persistence geopolitical tensions, create uncertainty affect outlook economic activity euro area global level. start first pillar monetary policy strategy, since last meet monetary growth remain rather strong euro area. however, recent monetary data need interpret caution, dynamic m3 recent month considerably boost high uncertainty financial markets, favour portfolio shift liquid instrument include m3. at time, persist strong monetary growth result ample liquidity also drive low level short-term interest rates, stimulate demand liquid asset include narrow aggregate m1. loan private sector stabilise growth rate 5 5 ½% recent past. these level which, real terms, low give cyclical situation. overall, liquidity available would need finance sustainable, non-inflationary growth. at time, current economic environment, see risk excess liquidity translate inflationary pressure near future. turn second pillar ecb's monetary policy strategy, start economic activity, available evidence indicate economic activity likely continue grow moderately third quarter year. a already noted, hesitant pace economic activity, compare expectation early 2002, together lacklustre confidence, reflect significant degree uncertainty build recent months. early indication fourth quarter 2002 suggest pace economic growth remain broadly unchanged. for time being, main scenario euro area remain economic growth return rate close potential course 2003. this expectation consistent forecast publish international organisation private institutions. in addition, financial market show sign stabilisation recent weeks, although volatility stock market remain high historical standards. the expectation improvement economic activity euro area contingent unwind current high level uncertainty recovery growth private consumption, show sign resilience recent past. in addition, expectation also base gradual recovery world demand which, together low level interest rates, help strengthen investment. however, several downside risk scenario. they relate persistence macroeconomic imbalance global economy, geopolitical tension uncertainty size adverse effect past sharp decline stock price aggregate demand euro area major region world. moreover, risk also stem fact structural rigidity euro area economy facilitate process price wage adjustment external shocks. thus, overall, remain difficult predict juncture time strength acceleration economic activity. 2 bi review 71/2002 regard price developments, annual hicp inflation rate slightly 2% recent months. these annual hicp inflation rate likely increase remainder 2002 stay 2% early month next year, mainly account base effect increase indirect tax administer price number countries. subsequently, however, hicp inflation rate fall again, provide oil price increase significantly wage moderation prevails, reach level line definition price stability course 2003. look ahead, strengthen euro exchange rate year subdue economic activity continue contribute towards reduce inflationary pressures. furthermore, price pressure contained, crucial upward trend labour cost indicator observe recent year continue. the notable inertia wage despite subdue economic expansion concern, although recent development may suggest wage cost accelerate course year. at last monetary policy meet 7 november discuss extensively whether reduce key ecb interest rates, view high uncertainty surround future economic growth implication medium-term inflationary pressures. sum up, element favour alternatives. on one hand, subdue trend economic activity strong exchange rate euro support view inflationary pressure decline. on hand, stubbornly persistent rate inflation exclude volatile component energy food price well monetary wage trends, argue caution. overall, occasion view keep key ecb interest rate unchanged prevailed. however, also indicate need monitor downside risk economic growth impact medium term inflationary pressures. since last meeting, evidence strengthen inflationary pressure ease somewhat downside risk economic growth vanished. regard fiscal policy euro area, i would like reiterate budgetary discipline indispensable success emu. fiscal discipline strengthen condition strong sustainable growth conducive employment. sound fiscal position also provide scope deal expect fiscal challenge cause population ageing. clearly, therefore, sound public finances, enshrine treaty develop stability growth pact, interest member states. i want stress current fiscal framework strike right balance discipline flexibility. by prescribe medium-term objective budgetary position close balance surplus, stability growth pact guarantee fiscal policy preserve sustainability public finance provide sufficient flexibility automatic fiscal stabiliser operate. while clear that, many – partly formal – reasons, annual budgetary target always need set nominal terms, assessment fiscal policy naturally must take account cyclical developments. though discussion surround issue may, times, appear confusing, reflect flaw pact critic claim. in context, worth recall member state reach budget position "close balance surplus". current fiscal problem country arise rule inflexible, country honour commitment make progress fiscal consolidation, particularly good times. it high time country deficit approach even exceed 3% gdp honour commitment respect rules. we much support eurogroup agreement country remain imbalance undertake fulfil commitment implement clear consolidation strategy. and much believe growth-oriented consolidation policy – aim strengthen productive force economy – important mean strengthen economic prospect euro area juncture. additional effort regard transparency timeliness implementation procedure pact also necessary. they help convince public current framework fully successful preserve discipline provide flexibility. in context, commission recently issue communication aim clarify certain aspect fiscal framework strengthen main principle objectives. the ecb consider good starting-point rebuild confidence budgetary policy framework. finally, neither discussion monetary fiscal policy, current economic outlook divert attention need implement decisively structural reform agenda. we note concern progress slow many country euro area. i like emphasise bi review 71/2002 3 benefit reform economic growth potential euro area likely substantial. while benefit fully reap medium term, i believe reform would particularly important current juncture. indeed, determine structural reform labour, product financial market

remark prepare presentation bi central banker dinner mexico city 11 november 2002. * * * i please honor opportunity talk distinguish group. when andrew crockett call 10 day ago invite make remarks, suggest i discus subject price deflation ask i try way provoke discussion. i’m happy so. deflation certainly important issue. it real problem japan. i’m frequently ask people business general public whether u experience deflation head deflation and, so, do it. similar concern raise europe, especially respect germany. and deflation occur u europe, contribute economic weakness either region, would important consequence every country tonight. i deal briefly four questions: first, u germany experience deflation - persistent decline overall price level - american business friend assert? second, would deflation bad thing? and, deflation undesirable, do prevent and, occurs, do reverse it? i’ll try deal four question 15 minute andrew suggest i talk - know i won’t examine issue fully i might do. that enough provoke discussion. let begin summarize overall conclusion. neither unite state germany deflation deflation potential problem avoided. the best environment household business decision-makers one price stability. deflation, well inflation, interfere smooth run economy. in ways, moderate deflation damage moderate inflation, although moderate inflation likely get hand lead rapid inflation. nevertheless i believe would mistake allow fear deflation provide rationale policy could lead unwanted price inflation asset price bubbles. be u germany experience deflation? i’ll start question whether u germany actually experience deflation. for u answer official statistical measure no. the gdp price index increase 1.2% year correspond index personal consumer expenditure 1.9%. the consumer price index rise rate 2.6% first 9 month 2002 core cpi (excluding food energy) 2.1% rate. i believe situation roughly similar germany euro area generally. consumer price germany rise 1.5% wide euro area increase faster. the reason many american businessmen believe period deflation price product sell fact falling. the producer price index finish good september 1.9% low year ago. and price consumer good investment good gdp index fall quarter year. 2 bi review 70/2002 this decline producer price finish good inevitable consequence success central bank achieve virtual price stability. to see why, think economy literally inflation. since rise productivity translate equal rate increase real wages, price stability imply nominal wage must rise rate productivity. for service like hair cutting, productivity gain, price service must rise level nominal wages. achieve overall price stability therefore require balance inflation service price decline price goods. although u achieve zero inflation, general wage gain drive productivity cause service price rise 3% year overall consumer price gdp rise 1.9%. price decline goods, especially producer level distribution costs, balance increase price services. some analyst argue current low inflation rate may continue decline eventually become negative excess capacity labor product markets. while cannot rule future, support evidence now. in spite u recession begin early 2001, rate wage salary increase last 12 month 3.2%, correspond period 1999. one issue whether u experience deflation accuracy measure price movements. although u price index improve past years, i believe official price index still overstate inflation inability deal adequately quality change new products. our measure inflation rate 1.2% may correspond true inflation rate (if i may use term) zero even –1%. the significant fact, however, even true inflation zero slightly negative, nominal wage rise nominal interest rate positive. thus deflation, exists, limit cause problem either wage interest rates, subject i turn next. would deflation bad thing? that bring question whether deflation - evidence decline measure price level - would bad thing. in judgement, would be. to repeat i say before: price stability - rather either inflation deflation - best environment household business make decisions. the experience price stability also create confidence persist. one problem inflation deflation create uncertainty future path prices, uncertainty harmful. before talk adverse effect deflation, let deal interaction inflation tax rules. because tax u country base nominal capital income expenses, high rate inflation raise effective tax rate capital income thereby increase distort effect capital taxation. reduce inflation therefore reduce tax distortion raise real national incomes. although logic analysis imply small negative inflation rate would reduce tax distortion even price stability, i believe uncertainty adverse effect deflation would outweigh gain reduce tax distortion. the adverse effect deflation depend whether anticipate unanticipated whether small large. a small, persistent therefore anticipate deflation least damaging. but like mild chronic disease, we’d rather it. before i talk anticipate deflation, consider first unanticipated shift low inflation rate say 2% permanent deflation rate –2%. the nominal interest rate new bond new mortgage would eventually decline 4%, le maintain initial real rate obligations. but unanticipated shift deflation would cause real interest rate exist debt rise four percentage points. in unite states, would create problem home owner since would generally able pay mortgage without penalty refinance new low nominal interest rate. the serious problem would company long term debt. the real value annual debt service would rise time ratio debt real capital would also increase. for highly leverage company financial firm substantial mismatch asset liabilities, bi review 70/2002 3 unanticipated shift deflation could serious problem. obviously, great unanticipated rate deflation, damage would done. what long-term effect mild permanent fully anticipate deflation at, say, 2% rate? in many ways, economy could - least principle - adjust 2% positive rate inflation. real interest rate marketable security mortgage would remain unchanged nominal mortgage rate bond interest rate decline fall anticipate inflation. if productivity growth raise real wage 2.5% year, nominal wage would rise 0.5%. there however potential problem even mild anticipate deflation. when inflation positive, individuals’ real wage reduce without difficulty actually cut nominal wages. but deflation 2%, wage decline relative average would often cut nominal terms. if cannot occur, result would rise unemployment market finally adjust need nominal wage cuts. deflation would also create problem implement traditional monetary policy base short-term rate interest since zero nominal interest rate floor would way drive real rate zero stimulate weak economy.1 deflation would pose special problem within euro area. to extent euro area integrate market good services, different rate inflation deflation cannot persist indefinitely. but combination relative price level adjustment among country overall price stability euro area whole cause period deflation countries. moreover, since interest rate euro bond must countries, real interest rate rise deflate country. in way, deflation within part euro area cause contractionary monetary environment part euro area lead even deflation. the problem cause anticipate deflation - whether u europe - substantially bad sustain rate deflation great rate productivity growth real rate interest risk free securities. nominal wage would fall2 real rate return riskless security would least equal rate deflation. security great risk le liquidity would offer high real returns. this upward shift yield entire range private debt equity instrument would raise cost capital business, reduce investment productivity.3 the problem acute manufacture firm since rate change output price would even negative overall rate deflation. there gap 3% overall gdp inflation rate rate change producer prices. if gdp price whole deflate 2%, producer price might fall 5%. for manufacture firms, real cost fund (in term product prices) would exceed nominal interest rate five percentage points. such high real interest rate part economy (where much inventory equipment investment concentrated) could contractionary effect long-term adverse effect investment productivity. prevent deflation reverse deflation occur although neither unite state country europe currently deflation, low inflation rate make slip deflation clear possibility. japan’s persistent deflation show deflation certainly happen modern industrial economy. i’ll conclude therefore follow andrew’s request i provocative ask do reduce risk deflation deal occurs? 1 the real federal fund rate average 2% past decade. with 2% deflation, 2% real fund rate would require nominal rate zero. in practice, therefore, average real rate would 2% would way drive real rate zero stimulate weak economy. 2 for example, combination deflation 6% year productivity gain raise real wage 3% year would require nominal wage fall average 3%. while achieve wage decline could principle occur, hard believe could achieve without long period increase unemployment. 3 the 6% rate deflation would imply real return 6% cash. risky security would require high real yield, thus raise cost capital. 4 bi review 70/2002 some people argue would good abandon goal price stability accept low significant inflation rate - say 4% - provide good margin safety actual deflation. i disagree suggestion i would interest know whether anyone think right advice. some economists, include author widely cite federal reserve staff study, suggest unusually vigorous expansionary policy - monetary fiscal - pursue economy danger slip deflation. i take would mean expansionary policy measure inflation 1% 2% - even either inflation rate would acceptable even real economy show particular sign weakness. such strategy may desirable also run risk cause unwanted increase inflation unwarranted rise price financial asset real estate. it also difficult know policy pursued. the specific context suggest federal reserve staff study japan year 1995. with benefit hindsight look like desirable policy. but time japan appear experience accelerate real gdp positive inflation rate. how would one know whether expansionary monetary policy context would prevent deflation would lead unwanted inflation return japanese asset bubble? the recent ease federal reserve seem appropriate action weakness uncertainty real economy. i believe would appropriate even inflation rate 1% higher, especially give fed’s well deserve anti-inflation reputation. the extent risk take avoid deflation depend part difficult reverse deflationary price movements. the obvious problem so, i already referred, combination deflation zero floor nominal interest rate make impossible reduce real short term interest rate countercyclical strategy. would increase stock money monetary base provide way reverse deflation even short term nominal interest rate already zero? would unusual monetary policy - include purchase long term financial asset even equity effective suitable? my inclination would look also fiscal policy. although substantial experience indicate discretionary fiscal policy useful deal typical short recession downturn, discretionary fiscal stimulus may appropriate face long-term weakness type experience japan anticipate deflation. contrary usual assumption, fiscal stimulus need involve increase budget deficits, especially important point country like japan even large national debt would serious long-term problem possibly would outweigh direct expansionary effect fiscal stimulus. a structural tax change stimulate incentive spend change relative price - example temporary investment tax credit finance temporary corporate tax surcharge - could stimulate spend without raise budget deficit national debt. an analogous structural tax policy could use stimulate consumer spend japan country value add tax.4 great progress make recent year bring inflation achieve essential price stability. it important judgement allow price stability deteriorate deflation. but also important fear deflation lead central bank give progress inflation. 4 see “the role discretionary fiscal policy low interest

sweden euro speech m kristina persson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, swedish chamber commerce germany, frankfurt, 27 november 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, let begin thank swedish chamber commerce invite conference subject immediate importance sweden course riksbank. this also subject i take strong interest many years, member riksdag also briefly member european parliament. we live challenge time euro area, face present downturn global economy, future enlargement include new eu member central eastern europe. it also decisive period sweden, issue emu participation come fore. give approach decision euro referendum sweden riksbank naturally step preparation ensure smooth rapid transformation sweden riksbank eurosystem. i today share view development far euro area possible swedish membership. my presentation naturally focus economic aspect emu, let nevertheless emphasize i personally think political argument european cooperation remain crucial, especially time nationalism rise continent. the day tomorrow, swedish prime minister hold consultation fellow party leader come agreement set date referendum emu. it look referendum hold autumn next year. if outcome referendum yes, government propose swedish riksdag sweden seek end derogation full participation stage three monetary union. the riksbank course play central role process, i briefly mention two aspects: on one hand le spectacular le important preparatory work transition euro. the riksbank hold consultation financial sector tax social security administrations. we estimate least 18 month require achieve transition, introduction banknote coin would come later. another, publicise role riksbank, swedish participation erm2. the exchange rate regime sweden today decide government, riksbank decide issue concern implementation. if government decide join erm2, swedish finance minister riksbank governor party common accord euro area finance minister ecb central rate swedish krona euro erm2. and occasion important step taken, mean modification monetary regime. there simple criterion determine appropriate central parity rate. what riksbank use various model disposal combine result expert knowledge good judgement try narrow reasonable interval analyse consequence different choices. all model forecast riksbank's disposal suggest real exchange rate appreciate come years. the question much. the different model give wide range estimate real appreciation, range per cent 10 per cent current level. with realistic assumption inflation sweden euro area come years, imply interval nominal sek/eur rate extend approximately 8.20 little 9 kronor. even riksbank thus participate actively preparation euro introduction not, independent non-political institution, actively involve referendum debate. in 1997, the riksbank's govern board take decision favour early participation emu response government report emu membership chair professor lars calmfors. however present executive board take common position ahead referendum, although personal view several board member emu well publicised, include pro-euro stance. 2 bi review 70/2002 the euro area performance since 1999 sweden’s situation so say state monetary union, three year inception? let first emphasize three year short time span evaluate project scale, nearly enough anyone make authoritative judgement. but, undoubtedly, great expectation regard convergence, increase competition high productivity first three year euro disappointment respects. many hop creation euro, integration financial markets, increase cross-border competition reduce transaction costs, would usher period high growth productivity gain euro area. instead, see slowdown productivity economic performance steadily us, also slightly sweden pre-in countries. since 1999 gdp growth average 2.3 percent euro area 2.9 percent sweden, overall productivity euro-economy accord oecd 0.6 percent euro area 1999-2001, 1.0 percent sweden. so, least superficially, appear case sweden underperform non-participation euro area. during economic boom 1999 2000 euro area lag behind u sweden productivity increases. and downturn 2001 2002 europe still underperform u sweden. this reality, course simplistic level make poor publicity emu prior swedish referendum. yet i believe would mistake blame monetary policy indeed emu disappoint performance. on close inspection emu achieve major objective first three half year existence. most importantly price stability successfully achieved. headline hicp inflation state maximum target level 2 percent 1999 slightly follow years. however achieve rather adverse conditions: 2001 begin 2002 price much affect triple impact animal disease (affecting meat prices), oil price changeover euro coin notes. core inflation, exclude volatile food price energy, reasonably close 2 percent level 1999-2002. inflation expectation also appear firmly anchor close 2 percent. now course also quite high degree divergence inside area, inflation range 5 % netherlands 1.8 % france 2001 (and even low figure germany 2002). this create difference real interest rates, wide enough explain overall lag productivity growth. none caveat explain euro area's poor performance. the overall macroeconomic climate problem, fact rather favourable. i might add macroeconomic environment rather favourable sweden too. the period 1999 underline confidence achieve outside emu. hicp inflation sweden actually low euro area, price development also line inflation target, inflation expectations. the interest rate differential swedish german bond firmly low decimal even short period time negative. if overall macroeconomic condition favourable, euro area sweden, real issue problem macroeconomic policy, structural side, product market labour markets. in euro area recent fall productivity business sector increase unit labour cost seem reflect high degree labour hoarding, say refusal cut staff face low demand, thus poor reallocation employment. there might good reason this, high cost find train right personnel competence drive economy, nevertheless indicate wage flexibility need increase. and despite overstaffing, wage growth slow down. similarly, study oecd recently publish research highlight important differential growth u europe poor employment growth europe. the u certainly advantage young grow population, europe large number unemployed underemployed people could become mobilize increase growth bi review 70/2002 3 economy, this need imply europe must adopt u hire fire practices, way achieve this, economic incentives, labour market policy education. challenge sweden ahead possible emu participation wage formation also important challenge sweden prior possible emu participation. the main issue possible participation euro zone loss exchange rate independent monetary policy stabilisation tools. if sweden, within emu, step business cycle euro area, neither exchange rate, swedish interest rate available adjust this. in reality, exchange rate may fact le efficient stabiliser expected. it quite apparent macroeconomic fundamental sweden's position business cycle only, sometimes even major, factor affect exchange rate developments. if weaken krona 2001 indeed cushion blow global recession, early period weakness run counter overall improve relative growth performance. personally, i believe might tendency swedish debate overstate gain flexible exchange rate long run. our recent experience show small currency highly volatile financial market risk affect big currency factor control direct relevance economic performance. one example reaction currency market day follow 11 september events. it also quite apparent present strengthen krona influence prime minister raise issue referendum emu. furthermore, recent experience imply deviation euro average growth large normal case. even swedish growth productivity somewhat high euro area since 1999, recent evaluation show business cycle euro area sweden fairly synchronised, despite asymmetric shock due crisis mobile telecommunication it sectors. however, cannot rule sweden become subject serious asymmetric shocks, i.e. disturbance affect sweden differently rest euro area. on occasion important sweden alternative way stabilise economy. one possible instrument course use fiscal policy. the riksbank recently present view government report "stabilisation policy monetary union" elaborate possibility use fiscal policy stabilise inflation similar way monetary policy today. this imply fiscal policy give clear mandate, clear targets, strong institutional arrangement high degree openness. of course, use fiscal policy effective tool additionally imply strong budgetary position cycle - also important give present demographic trend point increase cost support age population. i believe discussion could also interest relation present debate stability growth pact, stress importance strengthen institutional framework long term goal national stabilisation policy monetary union, oppose passive policy simply let automatic stabiliser take course. and, like sweden, euro area need strong fiscal stance order cope future fiscal burden age populations. even important alternative stabilise economy structural reform need increase potential growth contribute economy responsive change circumstances. if do successfully problem instability probably arise le significance. a analyse sweden's labour market worry unit labour cost increase slightly rapidly sweden euro area recently. a possibility conduct independent economic policy decreases, need function adjustment mechanism increase imply great flexibility factor product market sweden. this flexibility labour market could apply increase variability nominal wage increase increase professional geographical mobility labour force. 4 bi review 70/2002 potential gain euro membership so far i concentrate disadvantage join monetary union. but let mistake, certainly important gain emu sweden. while large swedish corporation already enjoy many advantage use euro, already well integrate european market, join euro area may essential small medium size enterprises, small use advance method handle exchange rate volatility. a recent survey reveal 80 percent large corporation sweden already invoice euros, compare 15 percent small medium-sized enterprises. our overall macroeconomic model always capture strength microeconomic force play company level transaction cost reduce barrier trade investment lowered. some recent research, gravitation model present professor andrew k. rise others, compare wide set countries, give significant increase trade growth currency unions. similarly, comparison remarkably high price differential comparable neighbour area u canada indicate existence price transparency affect prices. today focus much price increase service introduction euro coin notes, let u bear mind price durable good subject cross border comparisons, indeed increase le average even decreased. there already sign convergence price durables also area-wide euro price firms, reflect increase price competition across borders. to conclude, monetary union present attractive proposition sweden, give continue improve function wage formation labour market ensure solid institutional foundation fiscal policy stabilise economy. the could fact say euro area countries: with structural reform solid foundation fiscal policy, present emu-countries would much good possibility employment growth productivity gains. monetary union put pressure industry politician improve performance year come. bi review 70/2002 1 svein gjedrem: transatlantic economic partnership - nordic american perspective speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge

financial welfare remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, calgary chamber commerce, calgary, 18 november 2002. * * * good afternoon, thank invite today. it's difficult year many sector alberta economy. certainly, severe drought hurt many western farmers, investment energy sector hold back low oil gas prices. in addition, slump telecom sector affect calgary. this said, believe outlook positive province's economy, i would interest hear view discussion later. in minutes, i spend time talk canadian economy prospects. but first, i want discus something preoccupy business leader public official year – need restore trust financial markets, corporation raise fund markets, financial professional monitor them. restore confidence financial market let tell bank canada concern issues. the bank regulator financial institution markets. but responsibility promote financial stability oversee systemically important clear settlement systems. and fiscal agent government, actively involve function fixed-income markets. therefore, keen interest efficiency financial market operate. confidence key efficient operation financial markets. in unite states, confidence shake enron, worldcom, corporate account scandals. despite fact problem magnitude emerge canada, confidence canadian markets, market worldwide, affect event unite states. that watch closely current effort restore confidence trust corporate report financial market generally. it seem exactly right incentive place corporate management, boards, auditor investment banker disclose relevant information always act manner fully conducive fair open markets. the market provide solution problem currently undermine investor confidence. but others may best deal regulation. the market impose discipline. it reward firm successfully maintain investor confidence, punish abuse investor trust sufficiently transparent. i impress seriously private sector respond challenge raise event year. account body regulatory agency also seek way improve practice restore confidence. they re-examine role responsibility external auditor board shareholder – differ duty auditor sometimes ask carry management. and ask shareholder board tool power hold management accountable. it's important continue work issue and, moreover, see work them. we live world impression matter capital market increasingly global. canadian issuer judge standards, also worldwide standard accounting, disclosure, governance. at time, must careful impose overly onerous burden process paper businesses, particularly small firms, give importance canadian economy. let clear: principle must apply public companies. while business must abide spirit new standards, may well appropriate larger, widely hold firm face detail requirement small firm whose share widely held. the challenge develop appropriate canadian formula make difficult single lead security regulator, unite states, unite kingdom, australia. i'm argue whether canada single lead regulator. the point need improve current system, need now. if don't, risk damage reputation world capital markets. 2 bi review 69/2002 in sum, best way restore investor confidence put place system incentive encourage manager board always act best interest shareholders. disclosure key. in every case, shareholder best protect full, fair, accurate disclosure information. to quote recent c.d. howe report, "if reform cannot help investor distinguish good bad investment prospects, avenue improve confidence." this bring important issue bank. we share responsibility promote sound financial system – together department finance, office superintendent financial institutions, canada deposit insurance corporation, well provincial regulatory bodies. for years, bank conduct analysis research relate canadian financial system, much publish bank canada review, technical report work papers. we prepare take step interest make information financial system widely available. i please announce bank canada introduce new semi-annual publication, the financial system review (fsr). we plan first issue available late next month. in it, publish bank's ongoing work monitor financial system development analyze direction financial sector policy. the fsr aim promote knowledge of, discussion about, change development canadian financial system. i would point central bank publish document. for example, bank england, swedish riksbank, international monetary fund also produce similar reports. promote economic welfare inflation control while work promote financial stability conjunction agencies, alone responsible monetary policy. the foundation policy inflation-targeting system. how system work may familiar grind you, worth discuss again, especially uncertain economic times. the bank canada act call u "to promote economic financial welfare canada." we want strong sustainable economic employment growth. the best way help achieve promote confidence among canadian future purchase power currency. in words, want canadian confident inflation remain low, stable, predictable. for decade, follow joint agreement federal government, bank operate system inflation-control targets. under current term agreement, bank aim keep trend consumer price inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent range. since institute agreement, inflation expectation become firmly anchor 2 per cent target. well-anchored expectation promote economic growth stability. why? investor good ass future value investments. saver confident future purchase power unexpectedly erode inflation. debtor good ass real burden interest payments. wage financial contract set long terms. all possible people confident inflation stay around 2 per cent medium term. inflation "output gap" our inflation-targeting system also help smooth peak valley business cycle avoid boom-and-bust pattern see early decades. we act symmetrical manner; is, pay equal attention significant movement inflation away 2 per cent target, whether below. the crucial task control inflation judge economy perform relative economic potential. economic potential important concept, i want take minute describe it. potential output, production capacity, amount good service produce without put pressure – either direction – inflation. when economy produce le potential, economist say output gap. that gap tend put downward pressure inflation, bank ease monetary policy stimulate growth. we low target overnight interest rate. when economy operate potential, excess demand builds. this put upward pressure inflation, bank tighten monetary policy try cool economy, bring back level production potential, return inflation target. bi review 69/2002 3 keep mind change policy rate work way economy slowly. it take two year change interest rate full impact demand, output, ultimately, price inflation. so forward-looking interest rate decisions. at fix announcement dates, try affect today's inflation. what aim future inflation act pre-emptively achieve balance supply demand go forward. this may sound easy theory, reality complicated. for one thing, impossible measure economy's potential precision. all economist make best estimate – highly educate estimate, i might add, estimate nonetheless – level economic activity represent full capacity. and since one cannot measure potential precision, impossible measure exact size output gap amount excess demand. so bank look wide variety indicator ass much pressure capacity. we monitor statistic canada report closely factory operate relative capacity. we survey business across country see firm feel production constraints. we look data labour market, well figure input cost wages. we look real estate market indicators. and, course, pay careful attention financial market developments. we also measure inflation inflation expectations. one key indicator core inflation, strip eight volatile component consumer price index, along effect change indirect tax remain components. we find measure give good indication trend future inflation. indeed, do good job predict path total inflation cpi itself. all give u comprehensive view economy operate relative capacity, future. and i point bank's web site, find late data indicator look ass capacity pressures. canada's current growth prospect let turn economic outlook, tell view evolve year. in last april's monetary policy report, project economic growth would range 3 4 per cent, annual rates, second half year end next year. excess capacity economy expect eliminate second half 2003. and note since take policy interest rate historically low level 2001, would raise interest rate timely measure way. so begin tighten monetary policy, raise target overnight rate three time april july, total three-quarters percentage point. by late summer, however, uncertainty stem beyond border begin mount. we note slow growth demand unite state likely hurt export short run. we also note global financial headwind could affect spend canadian business households. finally, say concern corporate governance unsettle geopolitical situation could cause firm household delay spending. by october, cumulative impact slow global growth financial headwind lead u reduce near-term growth projection canada. in late monetary policy report, say expect growth average slightly le 3 per cent, annual rates, middle 2003. but assume financial headwind geopolitical concern dissipate second half next year, see strengthen domestic foreign demand resumption above-potential growth canada. it interest note current view level economic activity canada middle next year far back april, although quarterly growth profile changed. we still project small amount excess supply remain economy take output growth move potential growth second half 2003. finally, let say word inflation. in october monetary policy report, note core inflation next month would likely high previously anticipated. we cite specific, one-off movement relative prices, include insurance premium effect change structure ontario's electricity market. we also say core inflation would likely move still high fourth quarter year, "echo effect" price discount take place 2001 follow 11 september terrorist attacks. but say core inflation return 2 per cent second half next year. we still view. however, 4 bi review 69/2002 change electricity price ontario, monthly pattern price movement likely different early expected. in october, indicate high crude oil price could continue push total cpi significantly target range end year. but crude oil price moderate recent weeks. should moderation continue, total cpi likely peak low level think october. we also continue expect total cpi converge core rate, around 2 per cent, second half next year. however, continue watch closely, make sure one-off influence i mention early fee price generally. to conclude, let repeat say last monetary policy report. a go forward, need remove monetary stimulus place economy reach level full potential. the pace action continue depend balance domestic external development implication pressure capacity inflation canada. bi review 68/2002 1 ben s bernanke: deflation - make sure "it" doesn’t happen speech mr ben s bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, national economist club, washington, dc, 21 november 2002. the reference speech find website board governor u federal reserve system. * * * since world war ii, inflation--the apparently inexorable rise price good services--has bane central bankers. economist various stripe argue inflation inevitable result (pick favorite) abandonment metallic monetary standards, lack fiscal discipline, shock price oil commodities, struggle distribution income, excessive money creation, self-confirming inflation expectations, “inflation bias” policy central banks, still others. despite widespread “inflation pessimism,” however, 1980s 1990s industrial-country central bank able cage, entirely tame, inflation dragon. although number factor converge make happy outcome possible, essential element heighten understand central banker and, equally important, political leader public large high cost allow economy stray far price stability. with inflation rate quite low unite states, however, express concern may soon face new problem--the danger deflation, fall prices. that concern purely hypothetical bring home u whenever read newspaper report japan, seem relatively moderate deflation--a decline consumer price 1 percent per year--has associate year painfully slow growth, rise joblessness, apparently intractable financial problem bank corporate sectors. while difficult sort cause effect, consensus view deflation important negative factor japanese slump. so, deflation threat economic health unite states? not leave suspense, i believe chance significant deflation unite state foreseeable future extremely small, two principal reasons. the first resilience structural stability u.s. economy itself. over years, u.s. economy show remarkable ability absorb shock kinds, recover, continue grow. flexible efficient market labor capital, entrepreneurial tradition, general willingness tolerate even embrace technological economic change contribute resiliency. a particularly important protective factor current environment strength financial system: despite adverse shock past year, bank system remain healthy well-regulated, firm household balance sheet part good shape. also helpful inflation recently low quite stable, one result inflation expectation seem well anchored. for example, accord university michigan survey underlie index consumer sentiment, median expect rate inflation next five ten year among interview 2.9 percent october 2002, compare 2.7 percent year early 3.0 percent two year earlier--a stable record indeed. the second bulwark deflation unite states, one focus remark today, federal reserve system itself. the congress give feed responsibility preserve price stability (among objectives), definitely imply avoid deflation well inflation. i confident feed would take whatever mean necessary prevent significant deflation unite state and, moreover, u.s. central bank, cooperation part government needed, sufficient policy instrument ensure deflation might occur would mild brief. of course, must take care l confidence become over-confidence. deflationary episode rare, generalization difficult. indeed, recent federal reserve study japanese experience conclude deflation almost entirely unexpected, foreign japanese observer alike (ahearne et al., 2002). so, say deflation unite state highly unlikely, i would imprudent rule possibility altogether. accordingly, i want turn exploration cause deflation, economic effects, policy instrument deploy it. before go i say comment today 2 bi review 68/2002 reflect view necessarily colleague board governor federal open market committee. deflation: cause effect deflation define general decline prices, emphasis word “general.” at give time, especially low-inflation economy like recent experience, price good service falling. price decline specific sector may occur productivity rise cost fall quickly sector elsewhere demand output sector weak relative demand good services. sector-specific price declines, uncomfortable may producer sector, generally problem economy whole constitute deflation. deflation per se occur price decline widespread broad-based index prices, consumer price index, register ongoing declines. the source deflation mystery. deflation almost case side effect collapse aggregate demand--a drop spend severe producer must cut price ongoing basis order find buyers.1 likewise, economic effect deflationary episode, part, similar sharp decline aggregate spending--namely, recession, rise unemployment, financial stress. however, deflationary recession may differ one respect “normal” recession inflation rate least modestly positive: deflation sufficient magnitude may result nominal interest rate decline zero close zero.2 once nominal interest rate zero, downward adjustment rate occur, since lender generally accept negative nominal interest rate possible instead hold cash. at point, nominal interest rate say hit “zero bound.” deflation great enough bring nominal interest rate close zero pose special problem economy policy. first, nominal interest rate reduce zero, real interest rate pay borrower equal expect rate deflation, however large may be.3 to take might seem like extreme example (though fact occur unite state early 1930s), suppose deflation proceed clip 10 percent per year. then someone borrow year nominal interest rate zero actually face 10 percent real cost funds, loan must repay dollar whose purchase power 10 percent great dollar borrow originally. in period sufficiently severe deflation, real cost borrow become prohibitive. capital investment, purchase new homes, type spend decline accordingly, worsen economic downturn. although deflation zero bind nominal interest rate create significant problem seek borrow, impose even great burden household firm accumulate substantial debt onset deflation. this burden arise because, even debtor able refinance exist obligation low nominal interest rates, price fall must still repay principal dollar increase (perhaps rapidly increasing) real value. when william jennings bryan make famous “cross gold” speech 1896 presidential campaign, speak behalf heavily mortgage farmer whose debt burden grow ever large real terms, result sustain deflation follow america’s post-civil-war return gold 1 conceivably, deflation could also cause sudden, large expansion aggregate supply arising, example, rapid gain productivity broadly decline costs. i don’t know unambiguous example supply-side deflation, although china recent year possible case. note supply-side deflation would associate economic boom rather recession. 2 the nominal interest rate sum real interest rate expect inflation. if expect inflation move actual inflation, real interest rate variable, nominal interest rate decline inflation declines--an effect know fisher effect, early twentieth-century economist irving fisher. if rate deflation equal great real interest rate, fisher effect predict nominal interest rate equal zero. 3 the real interest rate equal nominal interest rate minus expect rate inflation (see previous footnote). the real interest rate measure real (that is, inflation-adjusted) cost borrow lending. bi review 68/2002 3 standard.4 the financial distress debtor can, turn, increase fragility nation’s financial system--for example, lead rapid increase share bank loan delinquent default. japan recent year certainly face problem “debt-deflation”--the deflation-induced, ever-increasing real value debts. close home, massive financial problems, include defaults, bankruptcies, bank failures, endemic america’s bad encounter deflation, year 1930-33--a period (as i mentioned) u.s. price level fell 10 percent per year. beyond adverse effect financial market borrowers, zero bind nominal interest rate raise another concern--the limitation place conventional monetary policy. under normal conditions, feed central bank implement policy set target short-term interest rate--the overnight federal fund rate unite states--and enforce target buy sell security open capital markets. when short-term interest rate hit zero, central bank long ease policy low usual interest-rate target.5 because central bank conventionally conduct monetary policy manipulate short-term nominal interest rate, observer conclude key rate stand near zero, central bank “run ammunition”--that is, long power expand aggregate demand hence economic activity. it true policy rate drive zero, central bank long use traditional mean stimulate aggregate demand thus operate le familiar territory. the central bank’s inability use traditional method may complicate policymaking process introduce uncertainty size time economy’s response policy actions. hence i agree situation one avoid possible. however, principal message talk today central bank whose accustom policy rate force zero definitely run ammunition. a i discuss, central bank, either alone cooperation part government, retain considerable power expand aggregate demand economic activity even accustom policy rate zero. in remainder talk, i first discus measure prevent deflation--the preferable option feasible. i turn policy measure feed government authority take prevention effort fail deflation appear gain foothold economy. prevent deflation a i already emphasized, deflation generally result low fall aggregate demand. the basic prescription prevent deflation therefore straightforward, least principle: use monetary fiscal policy need support aggregate spending, manner nearly consistent possible full utilization economic resource low stable inflation. in words, best way get trouble get first place. beyond commonsense injunction, however, several measure feed (or central bank) take reduce risk fall deflation. first, feed try preserve buff zone inflation rate, is, normal time try push inflation way zero.6 most central bank seem understand need buff zone. for example, central bank explicit inflation target almost invariably set target inflation zero, generally 1 3 percent per year. maintain inflation buff zone reduce risk large, unanticipated drop aggregate demand drive economy far enough deflationary territory low nominal interest rate zero. of course, 4 throughout latter part nineteenth century, worldwide gold shortage force price country tie gold standard. ironically, however, time bryan make famous speech, new cyanide-based method extract gold ore greatly increase world gold supplies, end deflationary pressure. 5 a rather different, historically important, problem associate zero bind possibility policymakers may mistakenly interpret zero nominal interest rate signal condition “easy money.” the federal reserve apparently make error 1930s. in fact, price falling, real interest rate may high monetary policy tight, despite nominal interest rate near zero. 6 several study conclude measure rate inflation overstate “true” rate inflation, several bias standard price index difficult eliminate practice. the upward bias measurement true inflation another reason aim measure inflation rate zero. 4 bi review 68/2002 benefit buff zone inflation must weigh cost associate allow high inflation rate normal times. second, feed take seriously--as course does--its responsibility ensure financial stability economy. irving fisher (1933) perhaps first economist emphasize potential connection violent financial crises, lead “fire sales” asset fall asset prices, general decline aggregate demand price level. a healthy, well capitalize bank system smoothly function capital market important line defense deflationary shocks. the feed use regulatory supervisory power ensure financial system remain resilient financial condition change rapidly. and time extreme threat financial stability, federal reserve stand ready use discount window tool protect financial system, 1987 stock market crash september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. third, suggest number studies, inflation already low fundamental economy suddenly deteriorate, central bank act preemptively aggressively usual cut rate (orphanides wieland, 2000; reifschneider williams, 2000; ahearne et al., 2002). by move decisively early, feed may able prevent economy slip deflation, special problem entails. a i indicated, i believe combination strong economic fundamental policymakers attentive downside well upside risk inflation make significant deflation unite state foreseeable future quite unlikely. but suppose that, despite precautions, deflation take hold u.s. economy and, moreover, fed’s policy instrument--the federal fund rate--were fall zero. what then? in remainder talk i discus possible option stop deflation get way. i emphasize comment topic necessarily speculative, modern federal reserve never face situation pre-committed formally specific course action deflation arise. furthermore, specific response feed would undertake would presumably depend number factors, include assessment whole range risk economy complementary policy undertake part u.s. government.7 cure deflation let start general observation monetary policy zero bound, sweep rug moment technical operational issues. a i mentioned, observer conclude central bank’s policy rate fall zero--its practical minimum--monetary policy lose ability stimulate aggregate demand economy. at broad conceptual level, view practice well, conclusion clearly mistaken. indeed, fiat (that is, paper) money system, government (in practice, central bank cooperation agencies) always able generate increase nominal spend inflation, even short-term nominal interest rate zero. the conclusion deflation always reversible fiat money system follow basic economic reasoning. a little parable may prove useful: today ounce gold sell $300, less. now suppose modern alchemist solve subject’s old problem find way produce unlimited amount new gold essentially cost. moreover, invention widely publicize scientifically verified, announce intention begin massive production gold within days. what would happen price gold? presumably, potentially unlimited supply cheap gold would cause market price gold plummet. indeed, market gold degree efficient, price gold would collapse immediately announcement invention, alchemist produce market single ounce yellow metal. what get monetary policy? like gold, u.s. dollar value extent strictly limit supply. but u.s. government technology, call print press (or, today, electronic equivalent), allow produce many u.s. dollar wish 7 see clouse et al. (2000) detail discussion monetary policy option nominal short-term interest rate zero. bi review 68/2002 5 essentially cost. by increase number u.s. dollar circulation, even credibly threaten so, u.s. government also reduce value dollar term good services, equivalent raise price dollar good services. we conclude that, paper-money system, determine government always generate high spend hence positive inflation. of course, u.s. government go print money distribute willy-nilly (although see later, practical policy approximate behavior).8 normally, money inject economy asset purchase federal reserve. to stimulate aggregate spend short-term interest rate reach zero, feed must expand scale asset purchase or, possibly, expand menu asset buys. alternatively, feed could find way inject money system--for example, make low-interest-rate loan bank cooperate fiscal authorities. each method add money economy advantage drawbacks, technical economic. one important concern practice calibrate economic effect nonstandard mean inject money may difficult, give relative lack experience policies. thus, i stress already, prevention deflation remain preferable cure it. if fall deflation, however, take comfort logic print press example must assert itself, sufficient injection money ultimately always reverse deflation. so might feed target interest rate, overnight federal fund rate, fell zero? one relatively straightforward extension current procedure would try stimulate spend low rate along treasury term structure--that is, rate government bond long maturities.9 there least two way bring longer-term rates, complementary could employ separately combination. one approach, similar action take past couple year bank japan, would feed commit hold overnight rate zero specify period. because long-term interest rate represent average current expect future short-term rates, plus term premium, commitment keep short-term rate zero time--if credible--would induce decline longer-term rates. a direct method, i personally prefer, would feed begin announce explicit ceiling yield longer-maturity treasury debt (say, bond mature within next two years). the feed could enforce interest-rate ceiling commit make unlimited purchase security two year maturity price consistent target yields. if program successful, would yield medium-term treasury security fall, (because link operate expectation future interest rates) yield longer-term public private debt (such mortgages) would likely fall well. low rate maturity spectrum public private security strengthen aggregate demand usual way thus help end deflation. of course, operate relatively short-dated treasury debt prove insufficient, feed could also attempt cap yield treasury security still long maturities, say three six years. yet another option would feed use exist authority operate market agency debt (for example, mortgage-backed security issue ginnie mae, government national mortgage association). historical experience tend support proposition sufficiently determine feed peg cap treasury bond price yield short maturities. the strike episode bond-price peg occur year federal reserve-treasury accord 1951.10 prior agreement, free feed responsibility fix yield government debt, feed maintain ceiling 2-1/2 percent long-term treasury bond nearly decade. moreover, simultaneously establish ceiling twelve-month treasury certificate 7/8 percent 1-1/4 percent and, first half period, rate 3/8 percent 90-day treasury bill. the feed able achieve low interest rate despite level outstanding government debt (relative gdp) significantly great today, well inflation rate 8 keynes, however, semi-seriously proposed, anti-deflationary measure, government fill bottle currency bury mine shaft dig public. 9 because term structure normally upward sloping, especially period economic weakness, longer-term rate could significantly zero even overnight rate zero bound. 10 see hetzel leach (2001) fascinate account event lead accord. 6 bi review 68/2002 substantially variable. at times, order enforce low rates, feed actually purchase bulk outstanding 90-day bills. interestingly, though, feed enforce 2-1/2 percent ceiling long-term bond yield nearly decade without ever hold substantial share long-maturity bond outstanding.11 for example, feed hold 7.0 percent outstanding treasury security 1945 9.2 percent 1951 (the year accord), almost entirely form 90-day bills. for comparison, 2001 feed hold 9.7 percent stock outstanding treasury debt. to repeat, i suspect operate rate longer-term treasury would provide sufficient leverage feed achieve goal plausible scenarios. if low yield longer-dated treasury security prove insufficient restart spending, however, feed might next consider attempt influence directly yield privately issue securities. unlike central banks, bar change current law, feed relatively restrict ability buy private security directly.12 however, feed broad power lend private sector indirectly via banks, discount window.13 therefore second policy option, complementary operate market treasury agency debt, would feed offer fixed-term loan bank low zero interest, wide range private asset (including, among others, corporate bonds, commercial paper, bank loans, mortgages) deem eligible collateral.14 for example, feed might make 90-day 180-day zero-interest loan banks, take corporate commercial paper maturity collateral. pursue aggressively, program could significantly reduce liquidity term premium asset use collateral. reduction premium would low cost capital bank nonbank private sector, beneficial effect already confer low interest rate government securities.15 the feed inject money economy still ways. for example, feed authority buy foreign government debt, well domestic government debt. potentially, class asset offer huge scope feed operations, quantity foreign asset eligible purchase feed several time stock u.s. government debt.16 i need tread carefully here. because economy complex interconnect system, feed purchase liability foreign government potential affect number financial markets, include market foreign exchange. in unite states, department 11 see eichengreen garber (1991) toma (1992) description analysis pre-accord period. both article conclude fed’s commitment low inflation help convince investor hold long-term bond low rate 1940s 1950s. (a similar dynamic would work fed’s favor today.) the rate-pegging policy finally collapse money creation associate buy treasury security generate inflationary pressures. of course, deflationary situation, generate inflationary pressure precisely policy try accomplish. an episode apparently le favorable view feed manipulate treasury yield so-called operation twist 1960s, attempt make raise short-term yield low long-term yield simultaneously sell short end buy long end. academic opinion effectiveness operation twist divided. in case, episode rather small scale, involve explicit announcement target rates, occur interest rate close zero. 12 the feed allow buy certain short-term private instruments, bankers’ acceptances, much use today. it also permit make ipc (individual, partnership, corporation) loan directly private sector, stringent criteria. this latter power use since great depression could invoke emergency deem sufficiently serious board governors. 13 effective january 9, 2003, discount window restructure so-called lombard facility, well-capitalized bank able borrow freely rate federal fund rate. these change important bear present discussion. 14 by statute, feed considerable leeway determine asset accept collateral. 15 in carry normal discount window operations, feed absorb virtually credit risk borrow bank remain responsible repay discount window loan even issuer asset use collateral defaults. hence private issuer asset bank would fail nearly simultaneously feed take loss. the fact feed bear credit risk place limit far feed drive cost capital private nonbank borrowers. for various reason feed might well reluctant incur credit risk, would happen buy asset directly private nonbank sector. however, additional measure become necessary, feed could course always go congress ask requisite power buy private assets. the feed also emergency power make loan private sector (see footnote 12), could bring bear necessary. 16 the feed commit congress use power “bail out” foreign governments; hence practice would purchase highly rat foreign government debt. bi review 68/2002 7 treasury, federal reserve, lead agency make international economic policy, include policy toward dollar; secretary treasury express view determination value u.s. dollar leave free market forces. moreover, since unite state large, relatively close economy, manipulate exchange value dollar would particularly desirable way fight domestic deflation, particularly give range option available. thus, i want absolutely clear i today neither forecast recommend attempt u.s. policymakers target international value dollar. although policy intervene affect exchange value dollar nowhere horizon today, it’s worth note time exchange rate policy effective weapon deflation. a strike example u.s. history franklin roosevelt’s 40 percent devaluation dollar gold 1933-34, enforce program gold purchase domestic money creation. the devaluation rapid increase money supply permit end u.s. deflation remarkably quickly. indeed, consumer price inflation unite states, year year, go –10.3 percent 1932 –5.1 percent 1933 3.4 percent 1934.17 the economy grow strongly, way, 1934 one best year century stock market. if nothing else, episode illustrate monetary action powerful effect economy, even nominal interest rate near zero, case time roosevelt’s devaluation. fiscal policy each policy option i discuss far involve fed’s act own. in practice, effectiveness anti-deflation policy could significantly enhance cooperation monetary fiscal authorities. a broad-based tax cut, example, accommodate program open-market purchase alleviate tendency interest rate increase, would almost certainly effective stimulant consumption hence prices. even household decide increase consumption instead re-balanced portfolio use extra cash acquire real financial assets, result increase asset value would low cost capital improve balance sheet position potential borrowers. a money-financed tax cut essentially equivalent milton friedman’s famous “helicopter drop” money.18 of course, lieu tax cut increase transfer government could increase spend current good service even acquire exist real financial assets. if treasury issue debt purchase private asset feed purchase equal amount treasury debt newly create money, whole operation would economic equivalent direct open-market operation private assets. japan the claim deflation end sufficiently strong action doubt lead wonder, case, japan end deflation? the japanese situation complex one i cannot fully discus today. i make two brief, general points. first, know, japan’s economy face significant barrier growth besides deflation, include massive financial problem bank corporate sector large overhang 17 u.s. bureau census, historical statistic unite states, colonial time 1970, washington, d.c.: 1976. 18 a tax cut finance money creation equivalent bond-financed tax cut plus open-market operation bond fed, arguably explicit coordination needed. however, pledge feed keep treasury’s borrow cost low, would case prefer alternative fix portion treasury yield curve, might increase willingness fiscal authority cut taxes. some argue (on theoretical rather empirical grounds) money-financed tax cut might stimulate people spend public might fear future tax increase “take back” money received. eggertson (2002) provide theoretical analysis show that, government bond index inflation certain condition apply, money-financed tax cut fact raise spend inflation. in brief, reason people know inflation erode real value government’s debt and, therefore, interest government create inflation. hence believe government’s promise “take back” future tax money distribute mean tax cut. 8 bi review 68/2002 government debt. plausibly, private-sector financial problem mute effect monetary policy try japan, even heavy overhang government debt make japanese policymakers reluctant use aggressive fiscal policy (for evidence see, example, posen, 1998). fortunately, u.s. economy share problems, least anything like degree, suggest anti-deflationary monetary fiscal policy would potent japan. second, important, i believe that, say done, failure end deflation japan necessarily reflect technical infeasibility achieve goal. rather, byproduct longstanding political debate best address japan’s overall economic problems. a japanese certainly realize, restore bank corporation solvency implement significant structural change necessary japan’s long-run economic health. but short run, comprehensive economic reform likely impose large cost many, example, form unemployment bankruptcy. a natural result, politicians, economists, businesspeople, general public japan sharply disagree compete proposal reform. in result political deadlock, strong policy action discouraged, cooperation among policymakers difficult achieve. in short, japan’s deflation problem real serious; but, view, political constraints, rather lack policy instruments, explain deflation persist long has. thus, i view japanese experience evidence general conclusion u.s. policymakers tool need prevent, and, necessary, cure deflationary recession unite states. conclusion sustain deflation highly destructive modern economy strongly resisted. fortunately, foreseeable future, chance serious deflation unite state appear remote indeed, large part economy’s underlie strength also determination federal reserve u.s. policymakers act preemptively deflationary pressures. moreover, i discuss today, variety policy response available deflation appear take hold. because alternative policy tool relatively le familiar, may raise practical problem implementation calibration likely economic effects. for reason, i emphasized, prevention deflation preferable cure. nevertheless, i hope persuade federal reserve economic policymakers would far helpless face deflation, even federal fund rate hit zero bound.19 19 some recent academic literature warn possibility “uncontrolled deflationary spiral,” deflation fee become inevitably severe. to best knowledge, none analysis consider feasible policy type i describe today. i argue policy would eliminate possibility uncontrollable deflation. alan bollard: the evolution monetary policy speech dr alan bollard, governor reserve bank new zealand, rotary club wellington, wellington, 25 november 2002. * * * a new central bank governor, i would like first give overall perspective role reserve bank new zealand economy. i focus role monetary policy, implication new policy target agreement, conclude discuss relate achieve strong sustain economic growth. monetary policy formulation key function reserve bank, often news. but public attention obscure important task reserve bank undertakes. in hubbub, fact monetary policy part large picture often lost. the overall purpose bank, i see it, maintain stability efficiency new zealand financial system. by financial system, i mean tool new zealander make transaction rest world. for simple transactions, new zealander use note coin issue reserve bank. a may know, nowadays bank note make polymer material last much long day paper money. this reduce reserve bank’s costs. a side effect you’ll see dr brash’s signature around place yet. polymer note also difficult forge, modern security features. that relate goal efficient financial system. a banknote easy forge would make transaction difficult. imagine check every twenty dollar note come eftpos machine. of course, nowadays significant payment make use electronic mean transfer fund provide financial system. these much cheaper, faster, secure use large volume cash, particularly long distances. the financial system also facilitate transaction involve borrow lending. for example, individual accumulate save financial system, invest save asset like share term deposits. these fund often find way new zealand corporation households, use build new zealand’s infrastructure. typically, individual investor receive return investments, able late draw originally invest funds. we often take system granted, yet smooth operation essential wellbeing new zealand economy. bank play key role direct fund individual wish save individual wish borrow. the system work people confidence fund deposit bank available future, fund retain buy power time. the reserve bank central role provide regulatory framework institution wish describe “banks”. we register bank monitor compliance comprehensive financial disclosure regime, require minimum capital adequacy ratios, limit loan make relate parties. our framework emphasis role bank director ensure bank effectively manage risks, role market strengthen incentive prudent management. this help promote sound bank system. however, bank system without risk. depositor still need make decision carefully. bank new zealand guarantee government reserve bank. there mandatory deposit insurance new zealand. i mention efficient financial system need mechanism money stored. this people access money need it, without save erode value. ensure money hold value primary purpose monetary policy. indeed, statute governor reserve bank require use monetary policy keep buy power new zealand dollar broadly stable time. maintain price stability mean keep price every item same. i charge maintain stable overall level prices, individual price always changing. some things, like computers, probably continue get cheaper, thing may continue get expensive, like martinborough pinot noir. but overall buy power people’s save intend remain broadly constant time. in current policy target agreement, i specifically direct attempt achieve trend inflation outcome 1 3 percent. why primary objective monetary policy? both economic theory hard experience suggest money hold value time help economy achieve potential. stable money silver bullet, achieve little. however, stable money one build block successful economy. yes, i could use monetary policy engineer temporary economic growth. by low interest rate i could encourage people borrow spend period. a firm saw increase demand products, would seek expand output meet demand. they would invest new capital hire workers, would create even demand economy. at first would look like virtuous circle, one could lead extend period economic growth. the problem low interest rate period create thin air resource need growth. firm try employ labour buy capital good would quickly run shortages. that would lead cost increase them, also lead put price themselves. eventually, rise cost would make people realise increase activity profitable. then boom would turn bust, firm would force retrench. moreover, boom period, inflation would rise beyond price stability target, perverse incentive inflation cause investment plan decision would begin weaken economy. to sure, i allow inflation climb 4 5 per cent, effect would subtle damage do much high inflation back 1970s 1980s. but 4 5 per cent inflation would add nothing new zealand’s endure growth rate might well trigger large inflation problem late on. so i commit deliver trend rate inflation consistent 1 3 percent range new policy target agreement. in words, i plan deliver similar inflation rate one new zealand see last decade. but also important make clear monetary policy 21st century involve fight inflation. i’ve describe over-arching goal maintain stability efficiency new zealand financial system. thus, reserve bank cannot afford be, word bank england governor eddie george, “inflation nutters”. we permit cure patient kill it. let explain flexible monetary policy avoid result. by nature, new zealand economy often hit economic disturbance - example, change condition world economy, el nino la nina period weather fluctuation number people move new zealand. all thing major impact new zealand business cycle. they frequently also consequence inflation rate, sometimes temporary nature. one example likely temporary effect drought, short term typically push price agricultural product like fruit vegetables, generate inflation. however, increase price thing like fresh fruit vegetable generally would see public start general inflation problem. so unlikely inflationary consequence sort disturbance would long lasting. that particularly true overall spend economy would reduce drought, farm income would down. so monetary policy excessively focus price stability attempt stop inflation cause temporary climatic shocks, could end exacerbate recession. by contrast, policy look short-term inflation fluctuation much le disruptive real economy, and, course, that’s do. in addition, challenge central bank face change time. look develop country past decade so. have successfully eliminate inflation problem 1970s 1980s, central bank could forgive expect late 1990s decade easy ride. in reality, many central bank face arguably great challenges. for example, japan, despite interest rate fall near zero, weakness private sector demand persist best part decade. monetary policy japan unable prevent deflation - is, persistent fall overall level prices. in unite states, challenge run monetary policy period many people believe economy move technological revolution would lead prolong inflation-free, economic boom. that belief translate high asset prices, help underpin long period strong consumption investment spending. a key question policy maker face whether asset price represent fair value, bubble reflect collective over-optimism future. finally, many central banks, include new zealand, struggle consequence volatile nominal exchange rates. for example, norwegian british currency persist high level tough exporters. there little scope monetary policy country solve problem without generate inflation would equally damage exporters. in view new zealand undergo scenarios. but world face move world 1989, reserve bank act pass law. maintain price stability, i require do, different firstly achieve it, require then. a know, become governor, i sign new policy target agreement minister finance. this new agreement offer monetary policy bite scope take evolve circumstance account. in particular, new agreement make clear reserve bank maintain price stability flexible way unnecessarily disrupt real economy. the key change agreement inflation target explicitly define term “future inflation ... average medium term”. this imply monetary policy forward-looking, avoid get distract transitory fluctuation inflation rate. in typical circumstances, expect give attention outlook cpi inflation next three years. if outlook trend inflation period inconsistent target, adjust official cash rate. our intention project inflation comfortably within target range latter half three year period. this mean set policy inflation within target range medium term, unless hit major surprise event. if major surprise occur, explain cause inflation high low wanted, step take ensure go back comfortably within band. i say new policy target agreement offer u little flexibility, it’s flexibility need apply care. the language new agreement make clear inflation persistently outside either end band. this sustain breach target could affect people’s perception trend inflation rate. that could create major inflationary problem. thus, one disturbance i mention early appear strongly stimulate weaken activity new zealand - suppose sharp persistent increase tourist number example - inflationary consequence might transitory. so, keep inflation rise activity go boom-bust cycle, monetary policy still need act counteract impact disturbances. and monetary policy still need respond particularly assertively inflation expect well outside target range, persistently outside it. but, times, inflation fairly stable see pressure potential get control, mandate little flexible response. be increase flexibility justified? in words, little flexible past without take risk price stability? i think can, keep price stable get easy price already stable extend period. if inflation suddenly rise period, like 1980s, control, risk spark self-fulfilling belief control again. in words, people believe inflation bag, may translate high price good service sell high demand increase salary wages. by contrast, inflation low stable long time, people much le likely see price fluctuation start something serious. then self-fulfilling prophecy much le likely. our freedom flexible without compromise price stability goal thus consequence hard-won achievement, predecessor’s tenure, environment price expect broadly stable time. in operate monetary policy, continue carefully monitor people’s perception inflation outlook, confirm confidence price stability remain strong. what new zealand’s current economic situation? a know, new zealand economy go strong period, stimulate international condition favourable us. we record tourist numbers, excellent return dairy product many agricultural commodities. we’ve also quick turnaround net outflow migrant year ago strong net inflow, double new zealand’s population growth. in combination, factor lead pressure new zealand’s resources. for example, many firm see strong demand products. this particularly apply firm sector like retail construction supply new zealand households. when they’ve try expand meet demand, employer report difficulty find additional staff. this tend create pressure prices, indeed, present, inflation near price stability ceiling. but run policy look forward, clear long effect offshore stimulus last. in unite state long expansion give way recession, recovery recession appear faltered. the australian economy experience effect drought and, like us, deteriorate trade condition offshore. moreover, new zealand dollar rise low level see year ago. for reasons, next couple year expect economic growth new zealand slow present high rate. we expect constrain much inflationary pressure see sector economy. at time, rise dollar mean new zealand dollar price import fallen. a result, expect new zealand’s overall inflation rate slow quite quickly next year. in term monetary policy, situation i see good grind wait see thing evolve. interest rate level new zealand where, view, significantly stimulate restrain economy. if world economy pick new zealand expansion continues, probably need contractionary policy set 2003. on hand, deterioration offshore sign catch new zealand could require stimulatory monetary policy settings. so keep option open. finally, let’s go back broad context reserve bank’s task. i describe bank focus help deliver stable efficient financial system new zealand public, low stable inflation important part that. i suggest contribute sustainable balance economic development. i’ve also say price stability contribution solution economic challenge face new zealand. how i see challenge? recall new zealand’s standard living, measure gdp per capita, barely improve 1975 early 1990s. it last decade new zealand economy manage achieve sustain lift growth. the projection i release last week suggest growth continue, pace sufficient close gap develop gdp per caput oecd average. to that, next 20 year rate growth gdp per caput would rise 2.2 per cent last decade almost 3 per cent follow twenty years. that’s presume rest oecd grow rate last decade. achieve sort productivity improvement worthy challenge. it meet challenge get thing need: great tax income, improve standard health care, education, environmental protection, fast fast boat keep defend america’s cup. i hope i make clear today reserve bank work achieve continue price stability without stand way sustainable economic growth. indeed, i think sound, flexible monetary policy contribute strong, balance economic growth that, agree, new zealand needs. bi review 67/2002 1 bank japan’s november report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 20 november 2002 * * * the bank’s view2 japan’s economy stabilize whole, great uncertainty toward recovery. with regard final demand, decline business fix investment almost come halt, private consumption continue weak. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment declining. while sign recovery still observe domestic demand, export lose momentum. the completion cutback inventory stock still underpin increase industrial production, pace increase become slow export rise anymore. a employment situation, overtime hour work continue increase number employees, widely cover various non-regular employee temporary workers, appear stop declining. however, firm still maintain stance reduce personnel expenses, household income continue decrease noticeably due to, among factors, ongoing decline wages. thus, employment income situation household overall remain severe. turn economic outlook, widely share prospect overseas economy throughout next year follow gradual recovery path. however, increase number economic indicator soften countries, particularly unite states. base development, recovery overseas economy likely anemic least time being. therefore, export industrial production expect le unchanged immediate future. with respect domestic demand, public investment project follow decline trend private consumption likely remain weak time due severe employment income situation. business fix investment expect support improvement corporate profit date, distinct recovery unlikely time due to, among things, great uncertainty regard overseas economies. overall, assume overseas economy recover next year even moderate pace, increase export production resume, make foundation japan’s economic recovery gradually firmer. however, economy unlikely show clear sign recovery time, since export production expect virtually unchanged time restrain force excessive labor input debt persist. furthermore, uncertainty regard outlook u.s. overseas economies, include geopolitical factor effect

bi review 67/2002 1 klaus liebscher: international institution financial market stability speech dr klaus liebscher, governor austrian national bank, centre study international institution (csi) conference 2002, innsbruck university, innsbruck, 22 november 2002. * * * lady gentlemen, today’s liberalize universal character financial market capital flow make impossible even strong national state handle governance global finance own. thus, various network intergovernmental consultation cooperation develop parallel accelerate globalization finance recent decades. ensure financial market stability can, therefore, regard global public good. this rest simple observation bank financial institution operate many different jurisdiction often without due cognizance consequence may create. this require international agreements, cooperation coordination ensure international public control, negative externality systemic risk possible negative impact economic growth due financial instability prevent far possible. in addition, international cooperation help ensure regulatory “level playing-field” exist possibility regulatory arbitrage avoided. international financial integration governance thus imply central bank national authority develop policy foster financial stability domestic also international level. let give example underline point refer tragic event 9/11. without cooperation eurosystem central banks, federal reserve international central banks, may, indeed, negative impact upon international financial system even bad repercussion global growth. in past decades, impress number policy measure initiative make european international level govern issue financial market stability - broad context - economic policy. on international level witness effort achieve global convergence consider “good economic policy measures”; european level monetary union represent successful model inter alia instill stability financial system; hard work put forward-looking measure prevent crisis financial system like basle ii imf’s financial sector assessment program (fsaps). let outline international effort coordination cooperation detail you. convergence economic policy measure the meet international economic policy maker various institution forum produce remarkable convergence idea concern domestic economic management. the general approach economic management within developing, emerging, transition economy well within industrial world perhaps sum “macro-economic stability supply-side flexibility”. these objective pertain monetary fiscal policy agree 1994 annual meet imf madrid. the emphasis since price stability immediate goal macro-economic policy. this simply end measure balance aggregate demand underlie supply economy whole. in effect aim monetary policy particular moderate, rather aggravate, economic cycle, provide basis sustainable growth around underlie rate potential growth. in relation fiscal policy, emphasis limit public sector borrowing, outstanding level public sector debt, level sustain medium long term without need increase tax imposition rise real interest rates. you notice principles, already formalize madrid declaration, also one underlie european monetary union. this aim macro-economic stability bring sharp focus structural, supply side, economy. here, too, strengthen international presumption favor open market free competition - domestically internationally - continue strong presumption predatory trade use competitive devaluation. the justification undistorted competition contribute potential global economic growth increase efficiency 2 bi review 67/2002 effective allocation productive resources. fast growth turn provide favorable context address social concerns, include issue poverty. monetary union: european dimension with introduction euro, economic weight single market rise level match usa. and single currency gain important international dimension: the euro segment global money market rise 25%. in bond market, too, euro play crucial role foster deep liquid market. the introduction euro pave way issuer access broad base investors. investor gain access wide spectrum investment opportunities. the euro’s share net issuance currently amount 39%. regard use official reserve currency, euro already attain weight predecessors. within euro area, monetary union keep member country expose harmful intra-european exchange rate tension type many country use suffer external shock occurred. it become quite obvious austria’s inclusion stability-oriented economic monetary union protect country negative shock much adequately possible past regimes. moreover, almost four year emu bear impressive testimony fact stability-oriented interplay monetary fiscal policy provide solid foundation well suit weather economic policy challenge period. with euro eu successfully supply important international public good form stability anchor deep attractive financial markets. this especially relevant view enlargement eu. european integration truly successful reach whole europe. if eu manage enlargement process successfully, also conducive eurosystem´s goal guarantee stability whole euro area. such mutual improvement desirable broad sense: political stability, financial market stability, macroeconomic - particular interest eurosystem - price stability. already today, euro key currency central eastern europe. in ceecs’ monetary policy strategies, exchange rate play vital role and, wherever formal informal intermediate target, least key monetary policy indicator. it euro upon ceecs’ currency oriented, formally linked. thus, emu euro already anchor stability ceecs. moreover, enlargement thus extend zone stability europe, strengthen europe’s international competitive position contribute substantially prosperity, security peace long term. integration financial service market eu beyond monetary union huge amount work undertake eu improve function single market international financial system. by abolish national boundary harmonize different legislations, european integration foster development single financial market europe. but current regulatory supervisory framework still strongly rely national responsibilities. the eu’s brouwer report find need enhance arrangement cross-border cross-sectional co-operation, improve alignment supervisory practice reinforce collaboration supervisory central bank functions. the eu’s regulatory roadmap integration financial service action plan. it contain 40 legislative non-legislative measures. the deadline agree european council implement entire plan 2005, early deadline 2003 security risk capital markets. moreover, considerable progress make recent attempt implement lamfalussy recommendation field security market regulation. consistent efficient implementation regulatory rule promote new institutional arrangement delegate rule-making power committee regulator whereas implementation national level undertake committee supervisors. these two example illustrate initiative way debate ongoing. however, recommendation brouwer report implement many issue still need investigation debate. but development show head right direction. bi review 67/2002 3 the increase integration european financial market one example economic policy become subject common interest european union. it also require put financial stability eu-wide perspective alongside still important national point view. accordingly, enhance cooperation field financial supervision, nationally emu member states, minimize risk involve deepen financial market integration indisputable advantage take effect. at national level observe various proposal reorganize restructure financial market supervision. in austria, legal foundation well practice supervision evolve rapidly respond development financial sector, implement eu financial sector directives, introduce ongoing improvement international best practice. the visible change supervision regulation establishment single financial supervisory agency. since april 1st, 2002, financial market authority perform banking, securities, insurance pension fund supervision. the financial market authority autonomous. it operate independently bind instructions. the restructure aim establish high-quality, effective time cost-efficient supervisory regime. give oesterreichische nationalbank’s far-reaching operational integration bank financial market supervision, austrian central bank fulfill manifold macroprudential task also within eurosystem thus contribute safeguard financial stability. the close involvement central bank supervisory process various advantages. it give central bank much clear picture economic reality behind number visible book banks. this information facilitate role safeguard financial stability create special advantage spot early warn indicator financial crisis potential situation economy-wide financial distress. moreover, part eurosystem central bank integrate already function network national supranational institutions. such network decisive importance light structural change european financial market already take place likely come near future. international financial system: transparency crisis prevention the integration international financial market new phenomenon. what unprecedented short-term nature, high turnover many financial market agents. this evolution actively encourage public policymakers academics, alike. in addition improve international allocation capital, internationally integrate market think provide welcome discipline domestic policymakers. the stability financial market rests, essence, three pillars: institutions, market participant infrastructure. a financial system strong govern practices, financial soundness institutions, efficiency market infrastructure. instal use sound governance practice share responsibility market participant regulatory agencies. indeed, recent experience systemic significant financial sector crisis underline importance good governance part regulatory agencies. in nearly financial crisis past decade - venezuela, mexico, east asia, russia, ecuador turkey - political interference regulatory supervisory process, weak regulations, inefficient supervision lack public sector accountability transparency, identify contribute factor depth size systemic crises. many major initiative international community taking, occur reaction financial crisis 1990s. base this, policy-makers try become forward-looking avoid potential difficulties. in particular, three area concern emerged: first, many international forum issue internationally applicable “core principles” “standards best practice”. these encourage improve practice economic financial policy emerge market industrial country alike. some noteworthy progress make area many initiative emanate imf. the main vehicle evaluate regulatory governance practice overall context macroeconomic stability joint imf-world bank financial sector assessment program (fsap). aim identify risks, vulnerabilities, development need financial system, one main principle underlie fsap quality efficacy regulatory governance impact 4 bi review 67/2002 overall governance practice within financial system, hence function stability. the fsap provide assessment framework offer “peer review” national financial systems, common platform policy advice technical assistance bank fund. the main instrument regulatory governance practice assess fsap assessment key international financial sector standards. since inception fsap 1999, public sector governance issue assess nearly 45 countries, 200 standard assessments. give positive impact fsaps make change within austrian supervisory structure establishment financial market authority (fma), austrian authority decide apply assessment themselves. second, transparency part economic agent deem improve function international market lead great financial stability. much said, and, importantly, achieve area transparency recent years. indeed, explosion code standard different aspect economic financial policy. so much so, country claim process need slow down. we realize standard code cannot universal certain extent since may appropriate country certain stage development. therefore, standard code reflect different stage development. the imf’s initiative report observance standard code (roscs) welcome step direction. i deem critical monitor observance standard code fully integrate imf surveillance article iv. third, important turn principle good behavior good practice. the international forum institution i mention power enforce principles. only imf leverage monitor compliance give legitimacy article iv consultation process real bite program countries. peer pressure, internationally accept codes, market discipline seem viable way forward. yet end, enforcement compliance still discretion nation states. international institution forum gear towards financial market stability the institutional architecture current governance global finance multilayered dispersed. it involve complex network state, suprastate, substate, private-sector actors. the challenge ahead certainly coordinate network efficiently. let give examples. the imf due near universal membership currently 184 country probably true international organization legitimacy. it mandate encompass promotion macroeconomic stability sustain noninflationary growth among members. the fund contribute good governance policy advice, technical assistance, program conditionality. it within area expertise cover effective transparent management public resources, maintenance stable, economic, regulatory legal environment.the fund take lead role management third world debt crisis 1980s emerge market financial crisis 1990s. since 1996 imf promote data standard - sdds - aim make information financial market reliable accessible. recently fund’s international monetary financial committee (imfc) serve important forum intergovernmental consultation regard international financial architecture, draw upon discussion fsf g20. at present, imfc example engage draw fundament sovereign debt restructure mechanism (sdrm) allow good resolution external sovereign debt crises. central bank governor group ten (g10) advance industrial country meet regularly basle bi since 1962 discus monetary financial matter mutual concern. unfortunately austria direct member group, surely profit initiatives. most important international financial governance group seven (g7) summits, hold annually since 1975. from time time, g7 leader give orientation important policy initiatives. the g10 g7 time time set work party explore specific issue relate global finance. the best-known example basle committee bank supervision (bcbs), bi review 67/2002 5 form stand group g10 1975. most significantly, bcbs formulate basle capital accord, framework first issue 1988 assess capital position international banks, revision (basle ii), core principle effective bank supervision, publish 1997. on specific problem, g7 create financial action task force (fatf) 1989 combat drug-related money launder recently involve combat finance terrorism. after asian russian financial crises, g7 promote establishment financial stability forum (fsf), first convene april 1999. the forum’s mandate important step towards good identification vulnerability affect international financial system improvement coordination information exchange among big authority responsible financial stability. while greatly welcome work important committee, completely satisfy trend move important discussion main international financial institutions, country represented, special forum selective membership. private sector initiative the financial sector present outstanding example another major trend contemporary governance, namely, turn nonofficial mechanism regulation. a number national security exchange commission lie private sector time, course, iosco also include fifty security exchange dealer association affiliate members. meanwhile several industry association promote international harmonization standard devise number self-regulatory instrument bond equity business global financial markets. these body include international council security association (icsa), international federation stock exchange (fibv), international primary market association (ipma), international security market association (isma). the isma indeed describe task ‘regulation market, market’. in addition, private bond-rating agency like moody’s investor service standard & poor’s - financial market whose sentiment reflect - come exercise considerable discipline authority many national governments. private industry play important role discipline device specific area conduct business security markets. this probably due ability show security industry, recently, discipline effectively line public objectives. however, ability put question increase complexity financial market instruments, enron case shows. indeed, tendency reinforce public authorities’ vis-à-vis self-regulatory organisation observe anglo-saxon countries, response concern. private-sector input governance global finance also figure outside security area. for example, nongovernmental group like group thirty derivative policy group take lead develop rule derivative markets. two private-sector bodies, international account standard committee (iasc) international federation accountant (ifac), devise main accountancy audit norm currently use global business. however, past year bring widespread question quality integrity information available market - behavior corporate executives. both private well public sector stake healthy function financial markets. therefore, foster new public/private partnership governance financial markets. moreover, also need international public partnership avoid arbitrage ‘standards’. conclusion first, standard-setters have, by-and-large, pass initial stage establish continuity create mutual recognition trust among members. there are, however, clear difference level ambition across standard-setters. second, whenever market force fail remove relevant obstacle integration, public authority

washington, dc, 19 november 2002. * * * today i would like share evolve international financial issue engage u federal reserve past year. i, particularly, focus innovation management risk implication innovation global economic financial system. foster low trade barriers, cross-border exchange good service past half century increase far fast world gross domestic product. but even remarkable large

many investment worldwide suggest potential far large world financial system currently exists. among large world trade economy bias investment foreign asset apparent still-high correlation domestic save domestic investment. in decade past, risk perceive increase distance. a paucity information surplus regulation discourage cross-border movement funds. even today, regulatory bar low information access much enhanced, bias cross-border investment remain high. however, continuous probe enhance returns, unless inhibit governments, seem poise create much large global presence financial linkage economies. a aspect life, expansion one’s activity beyond previously explore territory involve take risks. and risk nature carried, always carry it, possibility adverse outcomes. accordingly, globalization continue foster expand live standards, risk must manage ever effectively century unfolds. the development paradigm contain risk emphasize dispersion risk willing, presumably able, bear it. if risk properly dispersed, shock overall economic system good absorb le likely create cascade failure could threaten financial stability. the broad success paradigm seem evident unite state past two one-half years. despite drain impact loss $8 trillion stock market wealth, sharp contraction capital investment and, course, tragic event september 11, 2001, economy still growing. importantly, despite significant losses, major u.s. financial institution drive default. similar observation pertain much rest world somewhat less extent unite states. these episode suggest mark increase past two

financial innovation afford lender opportunity become considerably diversify borrower become far le dependent specific institution market funds. the wide-ranging development market securitized bank

that, turn, critical support consumer outlay unite state throughout recent period cyclical stress. this market’s flexibility particularly enhance extensive use interest rate swap option hedge maturity

telecommunication technologies, significantly low cost of, expand opportunity for, hedge risk readily deflect early decades. moreover, counterparty credit risk associate use derivative instrument mitigate legally enforceable net grow use collateral agreements. these increasingly complex financial instrument especially contributed, particularly past couple stressful years, development far flexible, efficient, resilient financial system exist quarter-century ago. great resilience evident many segment financial markets. one prominent example response financial market burgeon deflate telecommunication sector. worldwide borrow telecommunication firm currency amount equivalent one trillion u.s. dollar year 1998 2001. the finance massive expansion fiber-optic network heavy investment

system. however, compare decade past, bank significantly capital absorb shocks, employ improve system manage credit risk. in conjunction improvement, cause effect, bank tool disposal transfer credit risk and, doing, disperse credit risk broadly financial system. some tools, loan syndications, loan sales, pool asset securitizations, relatively straightforward transparent. more recently, instrument complex le transparent--such credit default swaps, collateralize debt obligations, credit-linked notes--have develop use grow rapidly recent years. the result? improve credit-risk management together good risk-management tool appear significantly reduce loan concentration telecommunication and, indeed, area associate stress bank financial institutions. more generally, instrument appear effectively spread loss default enron, global crossing, railtrack, worldcom, swissair, sovereign argentinian credit past year wide set bank might previously case past, banks, largely short-term leverage,

but, date, appear function well. the market credit derivative grow prominence ability disperse risk also information contribute enhance risk management bank financial intermediaries. credit default swaps, example, price reflect probability net loss default ever-broadening array borrowers, financial nonfinancial. a market credit default swap expand deepens, collective knowledge hold market participant exactly reflect price derivative instruments. they offer significant supplementary information credit risk bank’s loan officer, example, heretofore rely mainly in-house credit analysis. to

recent months. the perceive risk default financial nonfinancial firm rise markedly wake company-threatening scandals, though level remain moderate most. * * * derivatives, construction, highly leveraged, condition large benefit achilles’ heel. the benefit risk dispersion accomplish without hold massive position underlie financial instruments. yet, often financially checker past, access leverage induce speculative excess lead financial grief. we scarcely likely reform underlie human trait lead excess, need buttress risk-management capability best delimit detour path balance growth. more fundamentally, recognize choose enjoy advantage system leverage financial intermediaries, burden manage risk financial system lie private sector alone. leverage always carry remote possibility chain reaction, cascade sequence default culminate financial implosion proceed unchecked. only central bank, unlimited power create money, high probability thwart process become destructive. hence, central bank have, necessity, draw become lender last resort. but implicit role assumption burden risk arise extreme outcome way allocate public private sectors. thus, central bank lead provide essentially amount catastrophic financial insurance coverage. such public subsidy reserve rare occasions. if owner manager private financial institution anticipate prop frequently government support, would encourage reckless irresponsible practices. in theory, allocation responsibility risk bear private sector central bank depend upon private cost capital. to attract capital, least retain it, private financial institution must earn minimum overall economy’s rate return, adjust risk. in competitive financial markets, great leverage, high must rate return invest capital adjustment risk. if private financial institution absorb financial risk, degree leverage limited, financial sector smaller, contribution economy limited. on hand, central bank effectively insulate private institution large potential losses, however incurred, increase laxity could threaten major drain taxpayers, excess creation money central bank, both. in end, would face severe misallocation real capital. in practice, policy choice much, any, extreme market risk absorb government authority complex. yet central banker make decision every day, either explicitly, implicitly inadvertence. moreover, never know sure whether decision make appropriate. the question whether action see necessary retrospect; absence fire mean pay fire insurance. rather, question whether, ex ante, probability systemic collapse sufficient warrant intervention. often, cannot wait see whether, hindsight, problem judge isolate event largely benign. thus, governments, include central banks, must balance responsibility give relate bank financial systems. we responsibility prevent major financial market disruption development enforcement prudent regulatory standard and, necessary rare circumstances, direct intervention market events. but also responsibility ensure regulatory framework permit private-sector institution take prudent appropriate risks, even though risk sometimes result unanticipated bank loss even bank failures. the inevitable rise potential systemic risk international financial system inexorably expand contain improvement effective risk management private sector, improvement domestic bank supervision regulation, continue cooperation among financial authorities, and, necessary, central bank act lender last resort. in past two decades, bank supervisor develop country work together, basel committee bank 4 bi review 67/2002 supervision, improve bank supervision regulation. this effort ongoing place priority encourage bank improve risk-management systems. similar effort toward share

cultural economic. they largely reflect differ convention business behavior, especially attitude toward competition. * * * competition, course, facilitator innovation. and creative destruction, process less-productive capital displace innovative cutting-edge technologies, drive force wealth creation. thus, perspective aggregate wealth creation, competition better. but unfettered competitive capitalism mean fully accept optimal economic paradigm, least yet. some involve public policy often see competition frenetic. this different perspective capture clearly soliloquy attribute prominent european leader several year ago. he asked, “what market? it law jungle, law nature. and civilization? it struggle nature.” a major determinant regulatory regime rule law apply strike balance perceive

continuously evolve technology advance political perception proper extent regulation also changeable, wonder regulation always seem flux. while regulation must change financial structure do, regulatory change must keep minimum avoid foster uncertainty among innovator investors. moreover, shift regulatory scheme unavoidably leave obsolescent regulation wake. business people abroad
