Dr. Stals looks at current developments in monetary policy in South AfricaAddress by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. C. Stals, at a Luncheon of theRotary Club of Durban on 17/3/97.1. Monetary policy and total economic activityAt this stage, there is general expectation amongst economists in the privatesector that monetary policy will be eased during the course of 1997. Differences of opinion mayexist on how soon the easing will begin, or by how much interest rates will decline as a result ofthe easier conditions.This assumption is based, firstly, on a projection of some further slow-down inthe rate of expansion of the total domestic economic activity. Last year, the rate of growth ingross domestic production declined to 3.1 per cent, down slightly from the 3.4 per cent of 1995.It must also be noted that the decline in the rate of growth in the non-agricultural sectors waseven more pronounced, where the rate of increase in total real value added declined from 4½ percent in 1995 to only 2 per cent in 1996. In the very important manufacturing sector, the declinewas from 7½ per cent growth in 1995 to only ½ per cent in 1996. It was a strong recovery in theagricultural sector that maintained overall growth at the level of 3 per cent plus for last year.Agriculture will not make the same contribution to growth in 1997 and foreconomic analysis purposes it makes sense to assess the future prospects for non-agriculturalproduction before deciding on a possible course for monetary policy during the rest of this year.There were some tentative signs that total manufacturing production may have started with anew expansionary phase in the fourth quarter of last year when a seasonally adjusted annualiseddecline of 1 per cent in the third quarter switched to a 2 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter.This expansion in production was boosted partly by a rising demand from the rest of the worldfor South African products, following the depreciation of the rand last year. This importantdevelopment can make a further contribution to the maintenance of reasonable growth in 1997.Developments on the demand side of the economy also indicated a markedslow-down in total economic activity last year. The rate of increase in total domestic expendituredeclined from 6.5 per cent in 1994 and 5.2 per cent in 1995, to 3.0 per cent in 1996. In this case,the decline was more broadly based and the rates of increase in gross domestic fixed investment,private sector consumption expenditure and accumulation of inventories all receded last year.There was only one exception, and that was consumption expenditure by general governmentwhich rose by 5 per cent in real terms, compared with an increase of only ½ per cent in 1995.This slower rate of increase in total domestic expenditure established betterbalance between production (supply) and expenditure (demand). With both sides of the economynow growing at about 3 per cent per annum, there is better equilibrium and less friction in theeconomy, which contributes also to more stable conditions in the financial markets.It is important that this balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supplybe retained  --  both should gradually be raised to a higher level, but the upward movementshould be in tandem. Monetary policy has an important part to play in maintaining thisequilibrium over time. Any artificial stimulation of the economy through a premature easing ofmonetary policy will lead to further tensions in the balance of payments and in the financialmarkets, and will lead to further upward pressure on inflation.BIS Review   31/1997
At this stage, economists predict some further slow-down in the rate of increase inprivate sector consumption expenditure with continued growth at the current levels in grossdomestic fixed investment. An important factor in this projection therefore will be the behaviourof government consumption expenditure. It is in this regard that the provision made by theMinister of Finance in his Budget Speech of last week for an increase in total governmentexpenditure of only 6.1 per cent in 1997/98 is of vital importance. In real terms, that is afterprovision for depreciation, total government expenditure will indeed decline and therefore makean important contribution to the retention of macroeconomic equilibrium this year.2. Monetary policy and the balance of paymentsMonetary policy decisions are obviously also affected by the overall balance ofpayments situation, and not only by developments in the domestic economy. Last year,international economic relations dominated the South African economic scene. Towards the endof the year, however, better equilibrium was also restored in the external accounts and thiscontributed to the expectation of an easier monetary policy in 1997.The current account of the South African balance of payments showed asubstantial and growing deficit in the first half of 1996. In the second quarter, the seasonallyadjusted annualised rate of the deficit reached R12.9 billion and there was justifiable concernthat it could increase even further. Against the background of a slow-down in total domesticexpenditure in the second half of the year, the growth in imports levelled off and, with somegood increases in exports, the current account of the balance of payments improved to anannualised deficit of R4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Prospects are good that only asmall deficit will be recorded in the current account of the balance of payments in 1997.The main reason for the balance of payments problems of last year was to befound in the capital account. The net capital inflow declined from R19.2 billion in 1995 to onlyR3.9 billion in 1996. The capital inflow was no longer sufficient to cover the deficit in thecurrent account, and the official gross foreign reserves, which were at a very low level to beginwith, declined by R5.4 billion.These developments exerted extreme pressures on the exchange rate of the randand, as is well-known, the average weighted value of the rand against the basket of currencies ofSouth Africa’s major trading partners depreciated by 21.9 per cent from 31 December 1995 to31 December 1996.The balance of payments situation obviously demanded a restrictive monetarypolicy throughout the past twelve months. Here also, however, important changes took placeafter October 1996. The improvement in the domestic economic situation and in the currentaccount of the balance of payments restored some confidence in the market for foreignexchange, particularly as the foreign reserves started rising again in the fourth quarter. Theexchange rate of the rand reached a lower turning point in October 1996, stabilised in Novemberand December and showed an impressive appreciation of about 9 per cent since the beginning ofthe new year.Optimism for the balance of payments for 1997 rests very strongly on theexpectation that there will be a good net inflow of capital into the country during this year. Sofar, the results have been encouraging with a relatively strong demand for South African equitiesand bonds from non-residents. In January and February, non-residents were indeed net buyers ofBIS Review   31/1997
- 3 -more than R5 billion of South African listed securities, but this total amount did not necessarilyrepresent a net inflow of foreign exchange into the reserves.The announcements made by the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech lastweek for the further relaxation of exchange controls can also have an important effect on thecapital account of the balance of payments. It is difficult to forecast how much capital ofresidents may leave the country because of these relaxations, but it is generally assumed that thiswill be balanced by the inflow of more non-resident funds into the country. Indeed, it is notunreasonable to assume that a total net inflow of capital in excess of the projected currentaccount deficit will add some amount to the official foreign exchange reserves during the courseof this year.If these assumptions prove to be correct, the exchange rate of the rand, measuredagainst the basket, should be more stable this year than the experience of last year. Such abalance of payments situation will also reduce pressure on monetary policy and will contributeto easier domestic financial conditions.3. Monetary policy and the domestic financial situationIn a more stable macroeconomic situation with better equilibrium in the balanceof payments, monetary policy can be aimed more directly at influencing developments in themore important domestic financial aggregates. In a statement issued last Friday, the ReserveBank indicated that the rate of increase in the M3 money supply should not exceed 10 per cent in1997. This will provide for real growth in the economy at a rate of between 2 and 3 per cent, andinflation at a level well below 10 per cent.The Reserve Bank is concerned about the rising trend in inflation that gainedsubstantial momentum during the course of 1996. The average rate of inflation for last year was7.4 per cent, being the lowest rate of inflation South Africa had since 1972. The annual figuredisguises the fact however, that inflation reached a lower turning point of 5.5 per cent in April1996, and has since then risen to a level of 9.4 per cent in December 1996 and also in January1997. In the fourth quarter of last year, the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised rateof inflation was as high as 12.7 per cent.The escalation in inflation was caused mainly by the depreciation of the rand, bysharp rises in food prices, by rising interest rates and also by a rise in the unit labour costs perunit of production. In this situation, however, it is imperative that the rate of increase in themoney supply will be constrained, which requires a meaningful slow-down in the rate ofincrease in bank credit extension. Last year, the M3 money supply rose by 13.6 per cent, andtotal bank credit extended to the private sector by 16.1 per cent. If we want to make sure that thecurrent trends in inflation will not be perpetuated, we must make sure that increases in themoney supply will not automatically accommodate rising prices, or even further stimulate theinflationary pressures that are emerging from other sources.The most recent developments in the financial situation therefore do not emit thesame optimistic signals emanating from the real economy and from the balance of payments foran early easing of monetary policy. On the contrary, the Reserve Bank would still want to seeclear signs of a slow-down in the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the moneysupply before lending official support to a decline in interest rates, or an easing in monetarypolicy in general.BIS Review   31/1997
4. Monetary policy and the BudgetFor monetary policy purposes, the most important aspect of the Fiscal Budget isthe deficit that must be financed through borrowing by Government. A large deficit absorbs agreater share of the available savings of the private sector and therefore leaves less scope forexpenditure in the private sector. A large deficit will force an increased demand from the privatesector for more bank credit to replace what Government is withdrawing from the savings pool.More bank credit, however, creates more money and increases the risk of higher inflation infuture.The Reserve Bank is therefore particularly pleased with the determined effortmade by the Minister of Finance to reduce the deficit in the Budget from 5.4 per cent of grossdomestic product in 1996/97 to 4.0 per cent in 1997/98. In absolute terms, the net borrowingrequirement (i.e. the deficit after taking the opening cash balance into consideration) increasedby only R1.3 billion, from R23.5 billion to R24.8 billion. Taking account of a much loweramount of maturing debt in the new fiscal year, the total gross borrowing requirement has in factbeen reduced from R41.0 billion in the current fiscal year to R36.8 billion in the next.There are more reasons than just relieving pressure on monetary policy forreducing the deficit on the annual budget. One is, of course, the growing burden in the budget ofthe cost of servicing government debt. In the Budget Review Document, it was indicated thattotal Government debt as at the end of February 1997 amounted to R309.5 billion, equal to 55.3per cent of gross domestic product. This is a relatively large deficit for a country with arelatively low overall savings ratio, and with massive needs for the development ofinfrastructure. For the 1997/98 fiscal year, total interest payments in the government debt willabsorb R39 billion, or more than 20 per cent of the total expenditure.It is also laudable to note that the smaller deficit on the Budget is being achievedthrough constraints on government expenditure, and not through an increase in taxes. Bothgovernment expenditure at a level of 30 per cent and government revenue at 26 per cent of grossdomestic product, are regarded as on the high side and there is a desire to reduce these levelsover the next few years. This will further ease the burden on monetary policy.5. SummaryThe 1997/98 Budget will, in summary, bring about a better balance in themonetary and fiscal policy mix that is required to maintain overall financial stability in the SouthAfrican economy. In the longer term, as the implications of the Budget work through to thefinancial markets, it should reduce some pressure in monetary policy.In the short term, however, the main objective of monetary policy must be toforce a similar mood of financial discipline also in the private sector. Not only government, butalso private sector individuals and corporates must reduce their reliance on credit for thefinancing of their economic activity. Some decline in the rate of increase in the total amount ofbank credit extension to the private sector, together with some slower growth in the total moneysupply, have become first priorities of monetary policy. This will be the only way to avoid thecurrent inflationary pressures in the economy from being perpetuated into a new extended periodof double digit inflation.BIS Review   31/1997
Dr. Stals assesses the new opportunities for South African investors in anenvironment of no exchange controls   Address by the Governor of the South African ReserveBank, Dr. C. Stals, at a Business Breakfast Forum hosted by Marriott Merchant Bank andDeloitte & Touche in Durban on 17/3/97.1. BackgroundThe announcement on the further relaxation of exchange controls by the Ministerof Finance, Mr. Trevor Manuel, on Wednesday last week received as much, if not more,attention as his announcements on fiscal policy for the 1997/98 fiscal year.For more than 35 years, South African residents were not permitted, at leastwithin the rules of the law, to make investments outside of the country without prior approvalfrom the exchange control authorities. Approval was seldom given, particularly not before 1994when the besieged South African economy had to contend with international sanctions, boycottsand disinvestment campaigns.Following upon the political and social reforms in the country and the withdrawalof punitive international economic actions, the Reserve Bank and the Department of Financestarted with a gradual phasing out of the exchange controls. A major constraint remained anacute shortage of foreign exchange reserves which were completely depleted by the time theGovernment of National Unity came into power in April 1994.Looking back over the past three years, good progress has nevertheless been madewith the gradual phasing-out of the exchange controls. As a first priority, all restrictions onnon-residents to repatriate their investment funds from South Africa were removed. Variousways and means were introduced to enable South African corporates to acquire foreigninvestments in branches or subsidiaries controlled by them. They were, for example, allowed touse the proceeds of foreign equity or convertible debenture issues to finance foreigninvestments. The Reserve Bank has approved a cumulative amount of more than R18 billion forthis purpose.In June 1995, a scheme was introduced to enable South African insurers andpension and mutual funds to diversify part of their existing asset portfolios into foreign currencydenominated investments. Approval has been given for more than R30 billion of asset swaptransactions in terms of which institutional investors could exchange South African assets forforeign assets in this process. According to information available to the Reserve Bank, morethan R17 billion of these transactions have been executed.A number of internal arrangements were introduced to reduce the administrativeburden of exchange controls, for example to grant the authorised dealers in foreign exchangemore scope for discretionary decisions on exchange control applications, without prior referenceto the Reserve Bank. In the process, virtually all exchange controls on current accounttransactions in the balance of payments (i.e. payments for goods and services) were removed.The announcement made by the Minister of Finance last week extended theexchange control relaxation programme now also to foreign investments by private individuals.A basis has been established for a continuation of the gradual removal of the exchange controlsthrough the periodic lifting of limits and other administrative measures over a wide front tocover the corporate sector, institutional investors and private individuals. There remains but theBIS Review   30/1997
- 2 -blocked assets of emigrants (former South African residents) that need to be addressed at somestage.2. The relaxations announced last weekThe announcement of some further exchange control relaxations last week by theMinister of Finance was very important, not only for the substance of the relaxations but also forthe clear policy direction indicated. This was the first major relaxation of the exchange controlsannounced by Mr Manuel since he became Minister of Finance in April 1996 and confirmed hisendorsement of the policy of the gradual removal of the exchange controls.Secondly, the Minister himself regarded the announced relaxations as animportant change in the underlying philosophy held by the Government on exchange controls. Inhis Budget Speech the Minister said:“The package of exchange control reforms placed before this House today movesSouth Africa to a system with a positive rather than a negative bias ....... The objective is toreach a point where there is equality of treatment between non-residents and residents in relationto inflows and outflows of capital.”The Minister, in other words wants to indicate that South Africa now has a freeforeign exchange system with a number of temporary exceptions, instead of a controlled systemwith a few special concessions.The wide-ranging concessions now made give South African corporates morefreedom to make direct investments outside of South Africa, with some special dispensation forinvestments in other members of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC);increase the scope for institutional investors to diversify part of their portfolios into foreignassets and for the first time enable South African private individuals to make foreigninvestments, either directly or through South African authorised dealers in foreign exchange.Some of the details of these relaxations must still be worked out, but the Minister indicated thatall the relaxations announced will be implemented by 1 July 1997.3. New options for the investorIn the past, many South Africans wanted to invest part of their savings outside ofthe country for non-financial reasons, and this may still be so in future. The more rationalinvestor, however, may think twice before making an investment in a foreign currency, in aforeign country and perhaps also in the shares of a foreign company. In considering such apossibility, a few important macroeconomic realities will have to be taken into account.The first is that markets, the more free they become and the more efficient theyfunction, also work more effectively as a catalyst for equalisation. For example, if the averagerate of inflation in South Africa over time is 10 per cent per annum and the average rate ofinflation in the rest of the world is 3 per cent, nominal interest rates in South Africa will onaverage be about 7 per cent above the level of nominal interest rates in other countries.Differences in real rates of interest will reflect differences in the risk factor attached toinvestment in different countries.In the same example, the exchange rate of the South African rand will depreciateover time by about 7 per cent per annum. The depreciation in the exchange rate will thereforeBIS Review   30/1997
- 3 -make sure that the converted rand value of a foreign investment will keep up with the value of asimilar South African investment, adjusted for inflation. There are therefore no special gains tobe made from the investment in a foreign currency.Thirdly, taxation in South Africa will be levied on income earned on foreigninvestments on the same basis as income earned in South Africa. (The taxation on “passiveincome” earned in foreign countries as referred to by the Minister in his Budget Speech.)Foreign investments will, however, hold new risk exposures for South Africaninvestors, particularly in an environment of volatile international exchange rates. The timing ofthe transfer of an investment into a foreign currency can be detrimental. A South Africaninvestor who may have transferred his savings into a sterling investment earlier this year whenthe exchange rate between the rand and the pound was R8.00 = £1.00 could have lost 10 per centof his investment within a very short period of time. Last Friday the exchange rate was back toR7.10 = £1.00. This brings into any foreign investment a new speculative element that does notexist in the local investment market.Finally, very few private individuals in South Africa have the knowledge and theexpertise to manage foreign investment portfolios, and to assess the alien risk exposures that areconnected to such investments. We should not, just because of sentimental reasons, make use ofa new freedom to invest funds abroad when a local investment will serve our needs better andmore effectively.4. Monetary policy in an environment of no exchange controlsThe new situation brings new challenges also for monetary policy. Thedepreciation of the rand last year, and the appreciation of almost 10 per cent since November1996, gave us a taste of the new exposures of our financial system to the global markets. IfSouth Africa wants to be part of the global village, we shall have to abide by the rules of theinternational markets.Without exchange controls, capital in and outflows will be dictated by marketforces, and markets are inclined to put heavy penalties on errors made by governments andcentral banks in their macroeconomic policy decisions. It will be fatal for a country to liberaliseits financial systems and to encourage the integration of its domestic financial markets into theglobal system, and then to balk at the disciplines of these markets.5. Financial institutions without exchange controlsMany South African financial institutions have already taken up the challenge ofbecoming part of the international financial community. Such institutions will also have toconsider carefully how this new venture will affect their own security, liquidity and solvability.There are numerous examples in the world of the collapse and failure of major financialinstitutions because of international exposure.Governments or financial regulators and supervisors cannot protect multinationalinstitutions against the many risks involved in being global. South African institutions wereprotected from these international risk exposures through the isolation of our country from theBIS Review   30/1997
- 4 -international markets. Now that the opportunities are being opened up for an outwardmovement, they have to tread with care and with caution.6. ConclusionThe removal of exchange controls opens up new opportunities for South Africancorporates, institutional investors and private individuals. All of them, however, must not beoverwhelmed by emotional considerations inspired by a new freedom, but must give carefulconsideration before any decision is taken to invest hard earned savings in a foreign country, in aforeign currency and in a foreign institution.BIS Review   30/1997
Mr. Thiessen discusses monetary policy and the Canadian economy in achanging world   Text of the Dr. Harold Walter Siebens Lecture delivered by the Governor ofthe Bank of Canada, Mr. Gordon G. Thiessen, to the Fraser Institute in Vancouver on 6/3/97.The performance of the Canadian economy is a popular topic these days.Canadians wonder why our economy seems to have been struggling recently, turning in alacklustre performance that has left the unemployment rate high and a significant margin of ourproduction capacity unused.When people focus on the recent record of the Canadian economy, they point inparticular to the contrast with the United States where the economy has been operating at closeto full capacity over the past couple of years. The United States is by far our most importanttrading partner. And in the past, economic developments in Canada have tended to followreasonably closely those in the United States. Naturally, people want to know what is differentthis time.The fact that the Canadian economy has not been expanding at a strong pace isalso worrying to governments trying, as they are, to address budgetary problems. They areconcerned that fiscal cutbacks may weaken the economy further.Of course in all of this, questions are also raised about the role of monetarypolicy. I would like to take this opportunity today to discuss the factors that have affected therecent performance of the Canadian economy, to explain the role that monetary policy hasplayed, and to conclude with some comments on our future economic prospects.The Canadian economy in a changing world environmentThe world economy has been going through profound changes.Many developing countries have embraced open markets and international tradeas a means of accelerating their economic progress. Deregulation and privatization initiativeshave been undertaken by both developing and industrial countries, typically as part of structuraladjustment programs to improve economic performance. Technological changes have reducedthe cost of capital relative to labour, encouraging businesses to use more physical capital, inparticular more computers and computer-based equipment. And there has been an accompanyingshift in the demand for labour away from unskilled workers.These technological innovations, along with reductions in transportation andcommunications costs, have also made possible a wider geographic dispersion of the productionprocess -- not just nationally but internationally. And to ensure access to foreign markets,countries have been pursuing multilateral and regional trading arrangements.As a result, all nations have been adjusting to the new reality of heightenedinternational competition and to the accompanying substantial shifts in the location ofproduction of many goods. Such shifts have not been limited merely to the diversion of theproduction of goods requiring unsophisticated techniques to the developing countries. Indeed,some developing nations, particularly in Asia, are establishing themselves as important suppliersof a wide range of internationally traded products, including high-technology manufacturedgoods. At the same time, industrial economies are moving more towards the export of services,as a result of improvements in communications and information technology.BIS Review   29/1997
- 2 -All in all, these changes are to the good, in that they should result in expandinginternational trade, more rapid increases in productivity and, hence, improved living standardseverywhere, but especially in developing countries. However, these ongoing globalization trendsand adjustments to new technology do imply changes in the structure of national economies.Canada and other industrial countries are having to cope with these changes. Butchange is never easy and is often stressful. Even in the large U.S. economy, there has beenconsiderable concern over the uncertain job prospects, especially for unskilled workers, in lightof the changes in technology, production and trade trends that I have just described. However,the process of adjustment in the United States to these developments began early, and theireconomy has been operating successfully at full capacity.Why is it that in Canada we seem to have had a more difficult time of it? Thereare a number of reasons for this. But, in my view, one of the most important is the fact that inCanada we started adjusting later and, as a result, we were further behind. Why was that?The depreciation of the Canadian dollar in the mid-1980s, by easing the pressurefrom foreign competition, blunted the urgency to adopt more efficient production processes.And through much of the second half of the 1980s, because many Canadians were still acting onexpectations of accelerating inflation, we were devoting a good part of our energies andresources to speculative activities, rather than investing in improvements in productivity andcompetitiveness. Rising government deficits, which were absorbing increasing amounts ofdomestic savings, were not helping either. Thus, with poor productivity growth, rapidly risingwages and generally weak cost control, Canadian businesses and exporters found it increasinglydifficult to compete, especially at the end of the 1980s, when the Canadian dollar had reversedits earlier depreciation.For a nation that is highly dependent on foreign trade, Canada certainly was doingall the wrong things to get ready for the new world of changing technology and increasingglobal competition. It was not until the early 1990s that many Canadian businesses realized thatthey had to undertake major adjustments. They had to restructure, invest in new technology andimplement tight cost control. And they had to do it quickly if they were going to positionthemselves to take advantage of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, thesubsequent North American Free Trade Agreement and then, more generally, the multilateralagreement on trade liberalization.Adjustments of this magnitude are never easy. They are often disruptive andstressful, generating a great deal of uncertainty about the future for both individuals andbusinesses. But because the adjustment process was delayed in Canada, it ended up being morefar-ranging and more intense than in the United States. For many businesses, restructuring hasmeant downsizing.But the business sector has not been the only area of the Canadian economy inneed of an overhaul. There has also been an urgent need for fiscal adjustment. Here again, thatadjustment was late in coming. As a result, the cutbacks and downsizing necessary to restorefiscal health have been more sweeping and more disruptive than if action has been taken muchearlier.Thus, we have had two major structural adjustments vital to our economy takingplace back to back. Indeed, over the past year, these adjustments have been overlapping, and thatmay continue for some time. And while a good deal of the restructuring in the private sector hasBIS Review   29/1997
- 3 -already occurred, the adjustment in the public sector still has some way to go. This restructuringhas affected the unemployment rate as more people move between jobs, taking time to retrainand upgrade their skills. And the related uncertainty among workers has been reflected in lowconsumer confidence and an unwillingness to spend. As a result, the recovery of the Canadianeconomy has been slower than it might otherwise have been.However, what we must not forget is that restructuring in both the private andpublic sectors was absolutely necessary, and it will have significant payoffs for the Canadianeconomy in terms of productivity gains, competitiveness and an improved standard of living.The role of monetary policyWhat has been the role of monetary policy in all of these developments? Shouldmonetary policy have been following a different course to ease some of the difficulties that oureconomy has encountered?During the last half of the 1980s, monetary policy sought to prevent excessivedemand pressures from fuelling an accelerating trend of inflation. The intention was to putinflation on a gradual downward trend once the demand pressures subsided.In February 1991, the Bank of Canada and the federal government made a formalcommitment to price stability as the objective of monetary policy. To make the path to pricestability more explicit, the Bank and the government agreed on specific targets for inflationcontrol. The targets aimed at bringing inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) downfrom about 5 per cent at the end of 1990 to 2 per cent by the end of 1995.Inflation decelerated sharply between 1991 and 1992 -- much more than the Bankhad anticipated or indeed was aiming for. This was mainly the result of thesharper-than-expected downturn of the Canadian economy in 1990-1991 and the subsequentslow recovery. Our economy had to cope with both the economic distortions caused by past highinflation and with the large and overdue adjustment needed to respond to the changes intechnology and the more open and competitive world markets that I have been describing.When I reflect on the view expressed by the Bank’s critics that the 1990-1991recession, the slow recovery and the sharp deterioration in our fiscal situation were all caused byan excessively tight monetary policy in the late 1980s, I find it useful to ask what would havehappened if monetary policy had in fact been less anti-inflationary in the late 1980s.I believe that such a policy would have led to even greater inflation-relateddistortions in our economy, an even more pronounced recession afterwards and still greaterproblems for businesses trying to adjust to the new technology and the more competitiveinternational environment. Moreover, higher inflation would have led to higher interest rates andmore expensive debt-servicing costs for governments and other debtors. Indeed, with the benefitof hindsight, if there is a lesson in this experience, it is that the Bank should have pursued atighter monetary policy earlier in the second half of the 1980s. A tighter monetary policy earlieron might have moderated some of the speculative activity and debt accumulation thatsubsequently weighed so heavily on our economy.The other lesson is that fiscal policy, too, should have been tighter during thatperiod. With a tighter fiscal policy, some of the buildup of public debt that governments are nowhaving to contend with would have been avoided. More fiscal restraint during the second half ofBIS Review   29/1997
- 4 -the 1980s would also have moderated the excess spending demands on the economy, removingsome of the upward pressure on interest rates and the Canadian dollar at the time.Since the sharp deceleration of inflation in 1992, the role of monetary policy hasbeen to keep inflation low. In doing so, monetary policy has provided Canadian businesses witha more stable, lower interest rate environment in which to undertake the investments and costcontrols necessary to adjust to the new competitive reality I have described.Looking to the futureSo, where is the Canadian economy now, and what are the prospects for thefuture?I believe that Canadian business has gone through a remarkable transformation inthe last few years. There has been substantial investment in machinery and equipment,particularly in computer-based technology, to improve productivity. And strict cost control isnow the norm. As a result, Canadian businesses have become much more competitive, both athome and internationally. The low Canadian dollar has, no doubt, also been helpful in thisrespect. But businesses are using the low exchange rate to help them get into new world marketsand expand their market share rather than needing it to offset uncontrolled costs and poorproductivity.The benefits from this restructuring can already be seen in the success thatCanadian businesses have had over the last few years in exporting their products and incompeting with imports within Canada. Indeed, exports are likely to remain the main locomotivefor economic expansion in the period ahead.The restructuring process for the public sector is not that far advanced as yet. As Inoted earlier, most governments in Canada took major steps last year to reduce their fiscaldeficits. However, public debt levels remain high in relation to our total national income.Evidence of investor concerns about these debt levels, and about political uncertainty, can beseen in the persistence in Canada of medium and longer-term interest rates that are high relativeto similar rates in the United States. These high interest rates have the potential to discouragesome of the investments that will be needed to keep the Canadian economy productive andcompetitive in the future. In order to reduce these interest rates, Canadian governments muststay the course of fiscal consolidation, and bring down the levels of public debt in relation tonational income.The largest part of economic activity in our country revolves around the spendingby Canadian households on consumer goods of all kinds and on housing. This has been the areamost affected by the stresses and uncertainty of the restructuring.As I said before, a good deal of the restructuring in the private sector has alreadyoccurred. And private sector jobs have been increasing -- by 3.5 per cent in 1994 and 1.5 percent in 1995. We now need to reduce some of the anxiety associated with public sectorrestructuring by getting on as quickly as possible with the fundamental decisions needed to putgovernment programs and their funding on a sustainable basis.As for monetary policy, our good inflation performance and the fiscal measurestaken so far have given the Bank of Canada some room to ease monetary conditions in Canada.

Mr.Chidambaram’s budget of 1997 has been widely acclaimed as a trail-blazing breaking budget. From the point of view of Reserve Bank of India, it has verysignificant implications. The budget has acknowledged that interest tax is a bad tax and hascommenced its phasing out. It has removed tax deduction at source on Government securitieswhich was an irritant in developing an active secondary market for Government securities. TheGovernment has accepted RBI’s proposal to launch a capital indexed bond. In the externalsector, the policy of capital outflows has been liberalised, acknowledging that globalisation isnot a one-way street. Replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and designing a process ofcapital account convertibility are two of the announcements in the budget which are very dearsubjects to me, but I will not comment on them. A Working Group and a Committee in the RBIare working on them and I cannot pre-empt their conclusions. There is, however, one subjectwhich has generated debate, sometimes based on misinformation if not misunderstanding. Thatis the elimination of ad hoc Treasury bills Treasury bills and the introduction of a new system ofWays and Means Advances (WMA). My predecessor, Dr. S.S.Tarapore, who played asignificant part in pursuing this idea, has described this change-over as a watershed in Indianmonetary history.The origin of ad hoc Treasury bills3. The intellectual origins of ad hoc Treasury bills in their present form can betraced to the First Five Year Plan. It said, “Judicious credit creation somewhat in anticipation ofthe increase in production and availability of genuine savings has also a part to play”. Thus,deficit financing, which in our context meant RBI credit to the Government, was assigned aplace in the financing of the Plan though its volume was to be limited to the extent that it wasnon-inflationary.4. The ad hoc Treasury bills thus emerged as a mode of financing the CentralGovernment’s deficit in the mid-1950s. For the smooth conduct of Government business, it wasmutually agreed between the Central Government and the RBI that a minimum cash balance ofRs.50 crore on Fridays and Rs.4 crore on other days would be held by the Central Government.To adhere to this administrative arrangement, it was agreed that the Reserve Bank wouldreplenish the Government’s cash balances by the creation of ad hoc Treasury bills in favour ofthe Reserve Bank. The ad hoc Treasury bills, which were meant to be temporary, gained apermanent as well as a cumulative character. Indeed, it became an attractive source of financingGovernment expenditures since it was available at an interest rate pegged at 4.6 per cent perannum since 1974, i.e. actually at a negative real interest rate.The assault on ad hoc Treasury bills5. The Committee to Review the Working of the Monetary System recommendedthat the Reserve Bank adopt a system of monetary targeting with feedback. The target is to beBIS Review   28/1997
- 2 -fixed taking into account the growth of the real sector and an acceptable order of increase inprices. The adherence to the target implied a limit to the monetisation of the Government’sdeficit. After all, any investment in Central Government securities by the RBI results in themonetisation of Government’s deficit, as the RBI’s credit to the Government is a source ofreserve money generation.6. Dr. Rangarajan, our Governor, brought out the ill-effects of the automaticmonetisation of the Government deficit through ad hoc Treasury bills in his Presidential Addressat the Annual Conference of the Indian Economic Association in December, 1988. He has beenpursuing this subject with missionary zeal since then. Analysing fiscal and monetaryinteractions, he brought out the following issues.First, the scale of Government borrowing was maintained at a high level andsurpluses on revenue account have given way to deficits.Second, such borrowing has been at less than market rates.Third, even the growing captive investors in Government securities such ascommercial banks were not willing to subscribe beyond their statutory obligations.Fourth, the RBI as the manager of public debt became the residual subscriber.Fifth, since the Government incurred deficits year after year, the question of theretirement of Treasury bills did not arise.Sixth, the expansionary impact of these deficits, after taking into account themovements in net foreign exchange assets, had to be countered.Seventh, to counter the impact, open market operations were not possible giventhe interest rate structure.Eighth, this meant that the cash reserve ratio had to be increased to absorb theexcess liquidity.Finally, when ad hoc Treasury bills were created automatically to finance theCentral Government’s deficit without any limit, the system contributed to rapid monetaryexpansion when the budget deficit became very large.Dr.Rangarajan concluded his analysis with a solution, i.e. an agreement betweenthe Government and the Reserve Bank of India setting a limit each year on the size of the fiscaldeficit and its monetisation. This agreement would provide greater manoeuvrability to the RBIto regulate the volume of money. Monetary targeting would then be meaningful. What we havearrived at today in the budget of 1997 is exactly what was envisaged in 1988.The process of elimination7. The process of the elimination of ad hoc Treasury bills has been designed inthree stages :First, through limits on the creation of ad hoc Treasury bills which operatedbetween 1994-95 and 1996-97.BIS Review   28/1997
- 3 -Second, through a transition period of two years beginning April 1, 1997, whenad hoc Treasury bills are eliminated and the new system of Ways and Means Advances isintroduced; but, overdrafts above Ways and Means would be permissible beyond ten continuousworking days, though at a cost.Third, the full-fledged system of Ways and Means Advances operates effectiveApril 1999.We have completed the first phase, agreed on the second and third phases and arecommencing the transition period, viz., the second phase from April 1997. The second and thirdphases would become operational through a fresh agreement between the Government of Indiaand the Reserve Bank of India. Incidentally, the arrangements for WMA to state governmentsare also based on agreements between the Reserve Bank of India with state Governments.The experience with the first phase8. In September 1994, it was mutually agreed between the Government and theRBI that limits will be placed on the net issue of ad hoc Treasury bills for year-end and alsowithin the year. The year-end limits of Rs.6,000 crore for 1994-95 and Rs.5,000 crore for thenext two years were fixed. The within-the-year limit during this period was kept at Rs.9,000crore.During 1994-95, the net issue of ad hoc Treasury bills during the greatest part ofthe year was negative and even at the end of the year the net issue was only Rs.1,750 crore,much lower than the year-end cap. During the years 1995-96 and 1996-97, though, there wassome difficulty in staying below the within-the-year limits; it may be noted that during 1996-97,since August 14, 1996, net issues of ad hoc Treasury bills remained mostly below the within-the-year limit. The most significant part of this agreement was that the practice of issuing ad hocTreasury bills to finance the Central Government’s deficit would be totally discontinued by1997-98. In last year’s budget, the Government committed itself to announcing concreteproposals for phasing out ad hoc Treasury bills. This year, the Finance Minister did exactly whathe promised - to comply with the agreement.9. A question that is often asked is what happens to the ad hoc Treasury billsoutstanding? The outstanding level of ad hoc Treasury bills as at end-March 1997 will have tobe funded into special securities at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum. These securities, inaddition to the volume of funded securities of Rs.71,000 crore already in the books of the RBI,will continue to be held by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank at a later stage may have to usethese securities for open market operations by converting them into marketable lots.The New System10. What will the proposed system be like?First, a scheme of WMA by the Reserve Bank of India to Government of India(GOI) has been evolved to accommodate temporary mismatches in Government receipts andpayments.Second, the limit for WMA and the rate of interest on WMA will be mutuallyagreed between the RBI and the Government from time to time.BIS Review   28/1997
- 4 -Third, any withdrawals by the Government from the Reserve Bank of India inexcess of the limit of WMA would be permissible only for ten consecutive working days.Fourth, when 75 per cent of WMA is utilised, the Reserve Bank would trigger afresh floatation of Government securities.Fifth, consistent with the discontinuance of ad hoc Treasury bills, the system of91 days tap Treasury bills will also be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997.Sixth, with the discontinuance of ad hoc Treasury bills and tap Treasury bills andthe introduction of WMA, the concept of the conventional budget deficit loses its relevance.Therefore, it is proposed to discontinue the practice of showing the budgetary deficit; instead thegross fiscal deficit would become the key indicator of the deficit. As a transparent way ofreporting the monetised deficit, or net RBI Credit to the central Government, the likely extent ofRBI support in respect of dated securities and auction Treasury bills is shown separately as the‘monetised deficit’ in the budget document.Ad hoc Treasury bills and WMA: differences11. There are significant differences between ad hoc Treasury bills and WMA.First, WMA will not be a source of financing the budget deficit. It is only amechanism to cover day-to-day mismatches in receipts and payments of the Government.Therefore, the use of WMA will have to be periodically suspended. WMA will also not beshown as a source of financing in the budget estimates.Secondly, limits on WMA will be fixed and any excess withdrawal by theGovernment beyond the limit will become permissible for no more than 10 consecutive workingdays.Thirdly, WMA will be charged at a market related interest rate.The transition period12. It is possible to argue that the period of agreement between 1994-97 itself wasa transition and a further transition now is not necessary. However, the introduction of afundamental change in a public system requires that functionaries in a variety of organisations inGovernment change procedures and cash management practices. This simply cannot happen likea dress rehearsal before the new system. In fact, some minor modifications may be needed as wego along. To say that transition is meant to dilute implies a predisposition to suspect the motives.After all, the change-over from the old system to new system should be smooth. TheGovernment should evolve expenditure control mechanisms and improve its day-to-day cashmanagement. It may be necessary for the Government to discuss with major ministries for thispurpose. The Reserve Bank would also attempt to streamline its debt management techniques.The RBI will make efforts to develop the Treasury bills market by proactive participation andissuing of Treasury bills of different maturities. Therefore, a transition period of two years hasbeen proposed. During the transition period, the Government would be allowed to exceed thelimit of WMA for periods beyond 10 consecutive working days. But, additional interest will beapplied for such periods on the amount of overdraft.The current debateBIS Review   28/1997
- 5 -13. Following the announcement of the new system and the presentation of thebudget incorporating the new system there has been a debate on the features of the system aswell as its functioning in 1997-98.First, that it is only a new name for the old system.Second, that without a statutory ceiling on debt, the system will serve no purpose.Third, that the degree of autonomy for monetary policy is still limited.Fourth, that the budgeted figures show that the new system will involve largeborrowings and more monetisation and, therefore, is inflationary. Let me analyse each one of theissues.14. As already explained, the new system implies the repayment of advancesmade and not their accumulation year after year. The limits are fixed and exceeding the limits issimply not permitted beyond ten days once the system becomes fully functional. There is a costof using such advances which is market-related. In addition, there is also the importantadvantage of providing mechanisms for open market operations to take care of surges in inflowsof foreign capital. This is difficult under a system of ad hoc Treasury bills but is possible whenauction Treasury bills and dated securities take the place of ad hoc Treasury bills. Market-basedinstruments are absolutely essential as we move along the path of capital account liberalisation.Further, the system is far more binding and transparent since the level of borrowings and thepattern of financing, especially RBI’s contribution, are made part of budget documents. Finally,the mixed bag that budget deficit represents is replaced by a more transparent method.15. Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the three concepts viz. the budget deficit, themonetised deficit or the net RBI credit to the Government and the RBI’s support in primaryissues of central Government securities. The budget deficit is defined as the total of the net issueof 91-day Treasury bills (at face value) - ad hoc Treasury bills Treasury bills, tap and auction -net of increases in central Government balances during the financial year. Therefore,conceptually, the budget deficit is the short-term financing availed of by the central Governmentboth from the Reserve Bank and other entities which include banks, financial institutions, stateGovernments, corporates and other parties. In this set-up, the Reserve Bank is only one of thefinancing units of the budget deficit.Net reserve bank credit to the central Government, on the other hand, includes notonly the Reserve Bank’s holdings of 91-day Treasury bills but also its holdings of datedsecurities and rupee coins net of the increase in the central Government’s cash balances. In otherwords, the Reserve Bank’s holdings of 91-day Treasury bills that forms a part of budget deficitis also a subset of the monetised deficit. However, it may be noted that while the constituents ofthe budget deficit are measured at face value, those of the net Reserve Bank credit to the centralGovernment are measured at book value. This valuation difference is, however, negligibleparticularly for 91-day Treasury bills.The correlation between the budget deficit and the monetised deficit growsweaker at times of easy liquidity such as during the current financial year as absorption by themarket of Government securities including 91-day Treasury bills has gone up substantially. Thepurchase of Government securities by non-RBI entities reduces the monetised deficit in twoways : (i) directly by reducing the devolvement on the Reserve Bank of 91-day Treasury billsand dated securities auctions as well as through the sale of dated securities including repos andBIS Review   28/1997
- 6 -ii) indirectly, as the market off-take of tap Treasury bills and fresh Government securitiesimproves the central Government’s cash balances and reduces the central Government’s recourseto ad hoc Treasury bills.16. The RBI’s support to primary issues of central Government securities reflectsonly its support in the primary offers, and net RBI credit to the Government could be verydifferent due to other factors. Let me illustrate this with some figures. In 1993-94, the RBI’ssupport to Government was Rs.7,014 crore, but net RBI credit was only Rs.260 crores. In1996-97, till February 14th, RBI’s support was Rs.12,099 crore, but, net RBI credit was onlyRs.7,837 crore. The monetised deficit is one source of the money supply and is not the onlyfactor affecting the money supply.17. It is sometimes argued that the real instrument for fiscal prudence should be astatutory ceiling on debt. True, our constitution enables Parliamentary legislation relating to aceiling on debt. The Ministry of Finance is due to bring out a Discussion Paper on this. Let menot pre-empt its content. But, clearly the new system has merits of its own and will co-existmore effectively with a ceiling on debt. It has merits in itself since it seeks to limit the extent ofthe RBI’s support. Technically, there is nothing to stop the Government from accessing all thedebt within the ceiling from the RBI if the new system did not exist. A ceiling on debt providesa constraint on the broader issue of debt management and impinges on fiscal policy moredirectly. The new system tackles the issue of fiscal/monetary interface which is a criticalcomponent of both fiscal and monetary policies.18. It is sometimes argued that the degree of autonomy for monetary policy is stilllimited. To the extent the limits on WMA interest costs and the RBI’s support to theGovernment are negotiable during the transition, there is room for the Government to influencethe RBI. The main difference is that under the earlier system of automatic monetisation theGovernment could unilaterally determine the limits, while after the new system becomes fullyfunctional, the pattern similar to state Governments would be followed. The data in the budgetfor 1997-98 are quoted to show that the RBI has not gained in autonomy. That leads me to ananalysis of these figures and the inflationary potential of the borrowing programme and thepattern of financing.19. In the current debate, some have presumed that as per budget estimates, theincrease in high-powered money for 1997-98 would consist of Rs. 16,000 crore (the monetiseddeficit) plus Rs.7,000 crore on account of the increase in the average level of WMA. Thispresumption is wrong for two reasons:First, the budget estimates for monetised deficit at Rs.16,000 crore would consistof the increase in RBI’s holdings of Government securities including dated Governmentsecurities and the RBI’s holdings of auctioned Treasury bills.Second, the budget estimates for 1997-98 have not assumed any contribution tothe budget from WMA. It may be mentioned that Rs.100,000 crore has been shown on both thereceipts side and the disbursements side, implying that whatever WMA were taken by theGovernment would be repaid before the end of the year.20. Some others have argued that there is a large increase in net borrowings ofGovernment, of the order of 33 per cent, negating the intentions of the new system. Here again,the comparison between the net market borrowing figures of Rs.25,498 crore for 1996-97 andRs.33,820 crore for 1997-98 is misleading. The figure for 1996-97 excludes financing throughBIS Review   28/1997
- 7 -the budget deficit i.e., mainly through the instrument of 91-day Treasury bills including ad hocTreasury bills. The figures of 1997-98 under market borrowings would include borrowingsthrough 91-day (auction) Treasury bills. Therefore, the comparable figures would be Rs.32,398crore for 1996-97 [(Rs.25,498 crore of net market borrowing plus Rs.6,900 crore of the budgetdeficit (RE)] and Rs.33,820 crore for 1997-98 (total net market borrowing), implying anincrease of only 4.4 per cent.21. Some others have argued that, at 16 per cent, the growth in the money supplywould imply an inflation of 10 per cent if GDP grows at 6 per cent. The money supply growthindicated here is in terms of broad money and not narrow money. The income elasticity ofdemand for broad money which has been proven to be reasonably stable and is in the range of1.5 to 1.6 in India should be taken into account. Even accepting that growth in GDP will be nomore than 6 per cent, the implied inflation could be only between 7.0 per cent (16.0 - 9.0 ) and6.4 per cent (16.0 - 9.6).Outlook22. Let me conclude with the outlook for the successful implementation of thenew system.First, let us recognise that what we are doing is really adhering to what the FirstFive Year Plan visualised, viz. judicious credit creation.Second, we are trying to operationalise the monetary targeting that Prof.Sukhamoy Chakravarthy's Committee wanted us to. No doubt, we have to move to indirectinstruments of monetary policy, but we cannot escape some sort of effective monetary targeting.Third, a process of thinking initiated by Dr. Rangarajan in 1988, furtherelaborated by him into a proposal in the Kutty Memorial Lecture on “Autonomy of CentralBanks” in September 1993, and formalised through an agreement between him as Governor andProf. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister has been honoured by our present Finance MinisterShri P. Chidambaram. We therefore have reason to believe that there is a consensus on the newsystem.Fourthly, the critics have not questioned the need for closer fiscal monetaryinteraction or a more autonomous monetary policy. If at all, the critics want to make sure thatthe new system works effectively towards its objectives.Finally, what has been put in place is a system and undoubtedly a better systemthan ad hoc Treasury bills and is certainly more suited to our times as well as our policies in theexternal sector. How it operates depends on public opinion, economic compulsions and the goodfaith with which this is implemented by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India.BIS Review   28/1997
Dr. Duisenberg assesses the future importance of the euro   Address by thePresident of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements,Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, on the occasion of a dinner hosted by the Board of Directors of the‘Association for the Monetary Union of Europe’ (AMUE), at Kasteel De Wittenburg,Wassenaar, 4/3/97.1    It is a great pleasure for me to be able to address you here tonight inWassenaar. Your Association has always been among the strongest supporters for speeding upEuropean integration, particularly Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This emphaticsupport gives the speaker the luxurious feeling of playing before a home audience.2    Tonight, I would like to ponder two issues related to the future importance ofthe euro. First, what are the chances of the euro becoming an important reserve and invoicingcurrency? Second, how should the European Central Bank deal with the external value of theeuro?Future role of the euro as a reserve and invoicing currency3    I know that the first issue - the future role of the euro as a reserve andinvoicing currency - has been receiving a lot of attention from your Association over the years.As a matter of fact, you very strongly believe in a powerful role for the euro. I quote from yourlatest report: “By placing Europe in a much stronger position vis-à-vis the United States ofAmerica and other countries, the introduction of the euro improves investor climate andultimately favours employment. Also, the use of the euro will rapidly develop world-wide, inproportion to the external trade of the European Union which already ranks first in the world”.I very much welcome this positive approach to the euro. The internationalizationof the euro is only partly in the hands of European policy-makers. Policy-makers can provide forthe right incentives by pursuing sound policies, thereby making their currency attractive. But, atthe same time, the success of the euro is also in the hands of the markets. In this respect, I wouldencourage the European business community to take every opportunity to promote the privateuse of the euro and increase its role as a vehicle currency and store of value.4    Let me elaborate a little by discussing three major factors that will determinethe future importance of the euro: the stability of the euro, the amount of trade conducted in it,and the depth of euro financial markets. Safeguarding the stability of the euro is the biggestresponsibility of the European Central Bank. The safest currency for all investors is the currencyof the country with the lowest inflation rate over time. Here, the prospects for the euro are good.Over the years, inflation in European core countries has been constantly lower than in the UnitedStates, and there is no reason to believe that this would change with the start of EMU. It is alsovery important that the euro will be strengthened by the institutional independence of theEuropean Central Bank and its objectives of price stability. Furthermore, safeguards have beenput in place, such as the Stability Pact, to prevent EMU countries from pursuing unhealthy fiscalpolicies. All in all, I firmly believe that the euro will be a strong currency.5    As regards the other major determinants of the future importance of theeuro - trade and financial markets - the role policy-makers can play is more limited. This is notto say that the euro’s starting position is unfavourable. On the contrary, over the last twentyyears international private portfolios have been gradually diversified in the direction ofEuropean currencies. Also, European currencies have been increasingly used as vehicle and, to alesser extent, as invoicing currencies. There is every reason to believe that these trends could bestrengthened by the introduction of the euro. After all, the euro will eventually cover anBIS Review   27/1997
- 2 -economy whose gross domestic product is larger than that of the United States. If intra-EU tradeis excluded, the EU and the US both account for around 20 percent of world trade. Furthermore,with 350 million inhabitants the EU is the largest consumer market in the OECD area,consumers whose needs will partly have to be met by trading with the rest of the world.Companies which trade principally with European counterparties may be inclined to invoice andpay in euros. If the euro is going to be widely used in international trade transactions, exportersand importers within the European Union will no longer be exposed to exchange rate risks norhave to hedge against such risks. The European business community thus has ampleopportunities to reap the benefits provided by the introduction of the euro.6    It is more difficult to predict the future role of the euro in internationalfinancial markets. Fortunately, at the European level agreement has been reached on legalprovisions that guarantee the continuity of ECU contracts. This provides a good starting pointfor euro capital markets. Ultimately, however, the choice of currency in which to borrow andlend depends on the depth and liquidity of the underlying market. Presumably, some segments ofthe euro market will become deeper. For instance, government bond markets are likely tobecome deeper and more liquid, and will offer international investors more instruments thancurrent national markets. It is also important that experience in the last few years has shown thatfinancial markets can put increasing pressure on political authorities to conduct prudentmacroeconomic policies. In such an environment, governments can no longer afford to outrunthe constable, and credit spreads between different debtors may in practice be rather small.The external value of the euro7    Let me now briefly discuss the issue of the external value of the euro.Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on this issue. Should the ECB, for instance, setan exchange rate target vis-à-vis the dollar?In my view, this is not the appropriate way to go. The primary task of the ECB isto guarantee internal price stability. As I have mentioned earlier, the euro area will have aneconomic and commercial weight comparable to that of the United States. This means a huge,but relatively closed economy. With a low import ratio, the effect of exchange rate movementson internal price developments will be limited compared to what currently holds for individualEU countries. Therefore, it is simply wiser for the ECB to focus on euro-wide indicators, such asmoney growth for the whole euro area. Put differently, the internal value of the euro is theobjective of monetary policy and the external value the outcome.8    This is not to say, of course, that Europe could adopt an attitude of benignneglect with regard to the external value of the euro. As is the case now, exchange ratedevelopments will continue to be informally monitored by the major global players. Indeed, theintroduction of the euro may even enhance the opportunity for strengthened policy coordination.With Europe speaking with one voice, the players on the global field are being put on a moreequal footing. This could add to globally balanced and stable policies, which is in the interest ofthe three poles concerned.Furthermore, there is the relationship between the euro and the currencies of thosecountries which will not participate in EMU from the beginning. A new Exchange RateMechanism has been designed which aims to ensure that the EU Member States stay togetherand that the working of the Internal Market is not frustrated by exchange rate fluctuationsbetween the euro zone and other EU currencies. It will also help those countries which will notjoin EMU right from the start to orient their policies towards convergence, in order to enablethem to qualify for participation as soon as possible.BIS Review   27/1997
- 3 -To conclude......, there are reasons to believe that over time the euro could develop into animportant reserve and invoicing currency. Good opportunities for the euro arise from the factthat the EU economy is even larger than that of the United States. Furthermore, it is theresponsibility of European policy-makers to safeguard the attractiveness of the Europeancurrency by pursuing sound policies. In this respect, the stability of the euro is in the good handsof the ECB. At the same time, I would like to emphasize that the success of the euro is also inthe hands of the markets. It should be borne in mind that it took the dollar half a century and twoworld wars to replace sterling as the international currency, despite the fact that the UnitedStates had been the major economic power since the beginning of this century. All in all, theseare challenging times for Europe. Let me, therefore, propose a toast to the future success of theeuro.BIS Review   27/1997
Prof. Tietmeyer expresses his praise for Dr. Duisenberg as the committedchampion of stability   Text of the laudatory address by the President of the DeutscheBundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, in honour of Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, President of theNetherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements, on the occasion of the award ofthe prize for the “European Banker of the Year 1996” by the Group of 20+1 in Frankfurt on3/3/97.IBeing elected in Frankfurt is something rather special. I am not thinking so muchof yesterday’s local elections. After all, for centuries Frankfurt was the venue of the election ofthe German King, and later on of the Holy Roman Emperor. Today, however, we are concernednot with the Emperor, but with the European Banker of the Year. And the votes were cast not bythe seven princely Electors, but by the 21 margraves of the international economic press.By electing Wim Duisenberg as European Banker of the Year, the Group of 20+1landed a triple coup.-They honoured the individual: Duisenberg, the committed champion ofstability.-They honoured the institution: The Netherlands Bank, that stronghold ofstability.-And they honoured the nation. The Netherlands is today, in a sense, themodel country - the shining example on the continent.IIWhile others were still moaning about the flood of economic challenges, theDutch were already starting to come to terms with them. They weeded out their social system.They increased the flexibility of their labour market; they encouraged part-time working,widened wage differentials, seized the opportunities presented by the services sector.To be sure, even the Netherlands still has some problems to contend with. But theadjustments are already paying off. Unemployment is falling. Employment is rising. And despitethe difficult environment (and, by the way, also despite almost identical exchange ratemovements to ours), economic growth has turned out to be exceptionally resilient.The long-standing traditions of the Dutch are obviously still intact. After all, asseafarers and merchants, they have been obliged for centuries to satisfy the requirements offoreign markets. That is why today they are a good distance ahead of other countries in theadjustment process.I know, of course, that many of the Dutch are not very fond of eulogies of theirsuccess. Too much praise from outside might impede the domestic reform process. And weknow very well that even long-standing “model pupils” have to take care to see that their marksremain good. But I believe the Dutch are sufficiently self-assured to be able to cope with praise,too.It is the ability to adjust flexibly that determines “the ascent and decline ofnations”, and thus their currencies as well. The example of the Netherlands, in particular, showsBIS Review   27/1997
- 2 -that an internally and externally hard currency helps to create jobs. Admittedly, the political willto effect domestic adjustments, and the social consensus that they should be carried out, are alsoessential.The erstwhile pegging of the guilder to the D-Mark has long since given way tocoexistence on equal terms. Nowadays it is not unfair to ask whether the guilder has notmeanwhile itself become the new anchor currency in Europe. In a sense it has, at any rate jointlywith the D-Mark.There are two reasons why the Netherlands has been able to assume this role ofthe guilder as the “co-anchor” in the ERM:-First of all, an economic reason: the markets see that the Dutch are notdependent on importing their stability through the exchange rate link.Their “stability culture” stands firmly on its own feet.-And secondly, a political reason: the Netherlands has played a crucial partin ensuring that the ERM exists at all in its present shape.This is because a critical situation arose in the summer of 1993, under the impactof upheavals in the ERM. In the monetary “summer gales” of those days, it was suggested attimes that Germany should be relegated to the status of a spectator. But the Dutch refused tounpeg the guilder from the D-Mark. And the other member states then felt that the ERM was ofno particular interest without those two.The unambiguous stance of Dutch economic and monetary policy is payingdividends. Today Dutch interest rates are below German rates, at both the short and the long endof the market, despite the slight increase in the last few days. Whether De Nederlandsche Bankis already the actual “interest-rate leader” in Europe is a question I would rather leave open.True, we at the Bundesbank know that we cannot, and do not wish to, permit ourselves any signsof laxity. But for the time being we do not think that the turning point for an upward interest rateadjustment lies with us. The Dutch success up to now has not been achieved overnight. It is theupshot of a long and consistent road which Wim Duisenberg has done a great deal to shape.IIIWim Duisenberg comes from Friesland. What is puzzling is how he comes by thename of Duisen-berg. As you know, Friesland is so flat that you only need to stand on anewspaper to be able to overlook the entire countryside.Frisians are supposed to be very attached to their native locality, which is by nomeans the same thing as being “provincial”. And they are said to be, above all, indomitable,which the uninitiated sometimes interpret as “self-willed”. But that doesn’t matter. As you willknow, such a characterisation is not entirely unknown for a Westphalian, either. That is hardlysurprising. After all, our birth-places are only 120 kilometres apart.There were signs of Wim Duisenberg’s international vocation at an early age. Asa student he was particularly interested in international economic relations. He wrote his doctoraldissertation on the topic: “The economic consequences of disarmament”. And he worked for theInternational Monetary Fund for five years.BIS Review   27/1997
- 3 -But then he responded to the call of his homeland. There was nowhere he was notneeded. Economic research needed him. He became a professor of macroeconomics inAmsterdam. The government needed him. He became the Minister of Finance at an early age.Actually, that’s a contradiction in terms. Youth, after all, tends to be idealistic and impetuous,whereas age tends rather to be distrustful and wary. And a finance minister needs to be highlydistrustful and wary. The banking industry needed him. He joined a commercial bank. Andfinally the central bank needed him. He became its Governor, which elicited from him thefollowing comment: “It’s the best job ... The pity is that there’s only one such job per country.”Well, being Central Bank Governor in the Netherlands is a longer-termoccupation. Anyway, I don’t know any other country that has had only three Governors in thepast fifty years. His spell as Governor did not begin very auspiciously. Against his advice, theguilder was devalued against the D-Mark as part of the major realignment within the ERM in1983. That was due less to economic calculation than to a political oversight. And at that timethe youthful Governor was unable to get his way in all respects vis-à-vis the politicians. But themarkets were resentful for a long while afterwards. In the course of the 1980s, however, themarkets’ confidence was regained. And Wim Duisenberg played a major role in that, too.Wim Duisenberg’s professional life has meanwhile come full circle. TheDutchman who was always interested in the world at large has held a number of importantinternational offices. For instance, he is now, for the second time, Chairman of the Board of theBIS in Basle. He is also the incoming EMI President; specifically, in Frankfurt. (I know hewould have been only too glad to be EMI President in Amsterdam. But there his chances wouldcertainly have been lower.) The newspaper Börsenzeitung wrote: “The new lion-tamer for theEMI”. And that would seem to make him the obvious candidate for the office of the futurePresident of the European Central Bank.IVThe boat of European monetary policy needs a shrewd and experienced captain.But, Wim, beware of the song of the sirens. In Europe, as you know, there is an island. There,some observers are loudly singing the praises of a specific financial culture which is claimed tobe the only culture for the future. But that culture differs in some respects from continentalfinancial culture. All I can say on that score is: Wim, stay on the continent!Continental (or should I say: German) financial culture is not as out-dated assome people make out. Long-termism is not to be equated with immobility or lack of flexibility.To be sure, the continent needs more flexibility - in the area of social security and on the labourmarket alike. But our financial sector is already flexible. After all, we do not want to mix upflexibility with volatility. It may well be the case that short-termism sometimes makes assetprices “more flexible”.But what matters is the financial sector’s capacity to come to terms with changedrequirements in the economy. Long- termism is certainly no obstacle to that. Long-termismmakes the seas less rough. That helps the central bank to stay on course and set the sailsproperly. And one day the European Central Bank will have to do just that. The expectationspinned on the courage and navigational skill of the future ECB Governing Council are high.But I am quite sure that, with you as Captain, the ECB crew will manage tomanoeuvre the euro to an anchorage in the safe haven of monetary stability. In Germany thepoliticians are vowing that the euro will be as stable as the D-Mark has been. Actually, theBIS Review   27/1997

The fact that there has long been a virtualmonetary union between our two countries owes much to you. What we envisage is just such astable monetary union on a larger scale.I am sure that that is your objective, too. We Governors of the other central bankswill give you every assistance when you assume the presidency of the EMI in a few months’time. I am convinced that you will prove a worthy successor to Alexandre Lamfalussy. And he,after all, has set a high standard.Wim, my good friend, I should like to congratulate you sincerely and cordially onhaving been elected European Banker of the Year 1996. Seen from the Frankfurt perspective, allI can add is: Frankfurt is such an interesting and attractive city that I would wish that you mayremain here for longer than some 18 months, not only as European Banker of the Year 1996, butas central banker of Europe.BIS Review   27/1997
Mr. Tosovsky gives the Czech Republic’s perspective of transition in Centraland Eastern Europe   Text of eighth Gerhard de Kock Memorial Lecture given by theGovernor of the Czech National Bank, Mr. Josef Tosovsky, to an audience at the South AfricanReserve Bank in Pretoria on 17/2/97.It is a great honour and pleasure for me to be invited to give the eighth Gerhardde Kock Memorial Lecture, especially as this is probably (if I am not mistaken) the first timethat a governor from the reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been affordedthis privilege. The region of Central and Eastern Europe has undergone a profound re-shaping.More than 100 million people of Central and Eastern Europe got involved in a far-reachingprocess of political, economic and social change. Because of its unprecedented character andsize the impact of this multidimensional transformation has been in continent-wide Europe.Indeed, the political and economic map of the whole of Europe is nowadays rather differentfrom what it used to be throughout the postwar period till the 1990s.Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share with you some experience we haveacquired. At the beginning of my lecture I cannot avoid briefly mentioning options for economicand political reforms as opened up for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990sas well as the starting position of the former Czechoslovakia on the eve of the “velvetrevolution” which in November 1989 enabled us to start a process of radical economic reforms.Initial conditions for economic reformsThe task which confronted the countries after the fall of the communist regimewas enormous. It involved radical change of the whole political, institutional, and economicsystem. Along with the rejection of the communist one-party rule, the principles of the pasteconomic system, i.e. state ownership of the means of production and the central planning andmanagement of the entire field of economic activity, being entirely discredited, were rejectedtoo. The issue was thus substitution of the previous system and not its reform. The goal was atransition toward a democratic society - and toward a functioning market economy, based on thedominance of private ownership.The respective move from the Communist centrally planned economy backtowards a capitalist market economy implies a qualitative change in the entire economic andsocial regime. As such it is a unique process in modern economic development. The challenge isnot only to stabilise, deregulate and liberalise the economy, as was the case in countries withextensive interventions such as Spain or Chile several years ago. The transition in Central andEastern Europe required basic institutional, systemic as well as socio-political changes at thesame time; it is inevitably a multidimensional process. It follows that, while stabilisationprogrammes and reforms in the other parts of the world economy may provide useful lessonsfrom their experience, there are substantial differences implied both in the initial conditions andin the substance of the process. The implications of that fact should be remembered whenassessing the course of changes in the previously centrally planned economies. The transition inCentral and Eastern Europe is inevitably a much more complex and longer-term phenomenon,for which no generalised theory could be available to apply.Such radical transformation requires a feasible strategy implemented with widepolitical support of the population. Transformation requires some minimum speed, and muststart with some “critical mass” of change to secure sufficient impact on the behaviour ofeconomic agents. In individual Central European post-communist countries, the sequence, speed,BIS Review   25/1997
- 2 -and forms of individual steps necessarily differed; they had different starting conditions,different degrees of political support of the new governments, and they also applied differentstrategies.The Czechoslovak caseAt the start of transformation in 1990, Czechoslovakia had some economicadvantages over the other Central and East European post-communist countries. InCzechoslovakia, during the preceding decade, state budgets were mostly balanced, foreign debtwas low, and the balance of payments showed no big deficits or surpluses. Inflation wasrelatively low. Even if there was an inflationary potential (reflected not only in open inflationbut also in the forms of hidden and repressed inflation) and the monetary overhang wasincreasing in the 1980s, its dimensions continued to be considerably lower than in the othercountries of Central and Eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia, especially the Czech Republic, alsohad the advantage of a long industrial history, and of well-educated and skilled labour.On the other hand, there were some disadvantages, especially if compared withPoland or Hungary. The system of a command economy was very pervasive in Czechoslovakia.There was practically no private sector; prices were centrally controlled; enterprise managerswere operating within the limits of a rigid system of central planning, having little autonomy indecision-making. Market institutions were mostly lacking, particularly in the case of money,capital and labour markets. Czechoslovakia distinguished itself also as a country with anunfavourably biased size pattern of enterprises: big units, mostly administratively created,prevailed, while small enterprises were almost lacking. External economic ties were biased aswell, being monopolised by the state: exports were predominantly aimed at Soviet and othercommunist countries’ markets. Especially high was the share of foreign trade with the SovietUnion (more than 40%). Connected with this was the fact that Czechoslovakia maintained arather large proportion of heavy industries, an extensive but mostly obsolete stock of productivecapital, along with underdeveloped services, neglected infrastructure and inadequateenvironmental protection.In coping with the challenge of a system substitution the contraints and even thecounterproductiveness of the partial reform approach seemed to be recognised and accounted forin the Czechoslovak case. This was perhaps a lesson learned from the failures of reform attemptsin the past.There appeared to be a widely shared consensus that a system replacement couldhardly be achieved without a sufficient initial “shock”. Accordingly, the strategy followed aimedat a simultaneous implementation of the package of interrelated measures in order to securesufficient impact on the behaviour of economic agents.Given the above general consensus, there were, however, widely differentiatedstances as regards the contents of the respective “minimum packages”, their sequencing and thespeed of their implementation.In previous discussions two alternative options - “fast” and “slow” movers - usedto be identified as a shock therapy approach against a step-by-step, gradualistic or evolutionarytype of approach.BIS Review   25/1997
- 3 -The Czechoslovak scenario opted for a transition path which was implemented asquickly as feasible, implying some parallel features with the shock therapy approach, inparticular with reference to one stroke, simultaneous liberalisation of domestic prices, foreigntrade and foreign exchange, and the introduction of limited currency convertibility (on currentaccount for registered domestic businesses) at the very beginning of the transition process.The shock therapy approach was developed for the stabilisation programmes andfollowed in some countries of Latin America as well as in Poland and former Yugoslavia, wherethe dominant target of the economic policy was to cope with hyperinflation, to stabilise theeconomy as much and as fast as possible. The initial conditions in the CSFR differed, however,from those of the countries mentioned.Strategy of systemic and structural reformsThe programme of political and economic transformation was formed during1990, started in January 1991, and continued in the Czech Republic after the split ofCzechoslovakia. From the start, the program included five main parts:- Macroeconomic stabilisation policies: a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy toremove the monetary overhang and to reintroduce macroeconomic equilibrium.- Liberalisation of prices: after 40 years of central price fixing, the bulk of priceswere freed.- Liberalisation of external trade - and introduction of partial convertibility (forresident firms’ current account transactions). That required initial devaluation toward anexchange rate seen as viable from the point of view of the balance of payments.- Massive and rapid privatisation, including the use of the voucher scheme.- Social safety net to protect people whose standard of living dropped belowpoverty line. These adverse impacts of economic transformation were to be contained withintolerable limits.The programme aimed at re-establishing the role of prices and markets for anefficient allocation of resources. For the start, rationalisation of price relations implied a rise ofthe price level, owing to a monetary overhang, and to low downward price elasticity. In a smallopen economy, it made no sense to free internal prices without opening the economy to externalcompetition and to world price relations. And, there could be no meaningful liberalisation ofimports and exports without current account convertibility, introduced at least for resident firms.The short Polish and Hungarian experience showed, however, that free trade andpartial convertibility should not be attempted without a preceding macroeconomic stabilisation.The first year of transformation - 1990 - was practically devoted to the stabilisation goal; furthertransformation steps taken in 1991 were accompanied by continuing stabilising policy. Measuresseeking external stability were an indispensable part of the programme. It was understood thatthe exchange rate would have to be undervalued in relation to purchasing power parity to sustainthe liberalised trade and a partly convertible currency and to function as a stabilisation anchor.Compared to steps such as freeing of prices, freeing of external trade, andintroduction of partial convertibility, it was clear that privatisation would be a gradual, moretime-consuming process. First, steps were taken to stop state subsidies to firms (as well as toprices), and to let the firms face a hard budget constraint; that included also a stricter creditpolicy by commercial banks. A shift of property rights to private hands was the only way how toBIS Review   25/1997
- 4 -change fundamentally the behaviour of firms, expose them to the pressures of the market, andinitiate productivity increase and structural change.In 1989 the private sector was almost non-existent in the former Czechoslovakia,accounting just for 3 per cent of GDP. Domestic capital base was weak and institutions ofmarket economy such as stack exchange and developed financial sector were lacking. Therefore,a combination of standard privatisation methods (that means sales, including sales to foreigninvestors) with non-standard ones was used to speed up the process. So called small privatisation(small factories, real estate, retail stores, restaurants, hotels, repair shops etc.) was proceedingswiftly since early 1991 and was more or less accomplished by the end of 1992. It went byauctions, but also restitution of property to its former owners played a very important part andcontributed to the success of the programme.In large privatisation (large state-owned enterprises), one part of the property wassold, another part was distributed free of charge to the entire population, through so-calledinvestment vouchers. Standard methods such as direct sale, auctions, public tenders, andtransfers of property to municipalities were used along with the voucher scheme. Foreigninvestors were, and are, welcome; in fact, the program of rapid and mass privatisation in theCzech Republic offered foreign investors an opportunity which will not be repeated in future.Privatisation of an almost fully state-owned economy is a task which requiresyears rather than months. Now the bulk of privatisation has been accomplished, and it is startingto influence positively the performance of the economy. Within the last six years the share ofprivate sector jumped from 3 to 75 per cent. But the problem of behaviour of the new owners,and of effective corporate governance, is still rather acute in the Czech Republic. Specialproblems are posed by the large ownership of equity by investment funds which emerged duringthe voucher privatisation, as well as by large banks which themselves are still partly in statehands. Thus, one cannot say that privatisation has been as yet accomplished fully. What remains,however, is a more standard situation, posing similar problems as privatisation of state-ownedcompanies in the advanced market economies. As to the future prevailing model of corporategovernance, the Czech Republic can be expected to converge toward the practice which will bemost widely observed within the European Union countries.Macroeconomic stabilisationThe transformation strategy required a constant effort to achieve macroeconomicstabilisation. Tight fiscal policy, based on a balanced or surplus state budget, and prudentmonetary policy, were mutually supporting each other. These were supplemented by wagecontrols and overall income policy within the so-called heterodox concept of macroeconomicstabilisation.During transformation, Czech monetary policy used two basic tools to fightinflation: targeting monetary aggregates, and the nominal anchor of a fixed exchange rate. TheCzech experience with curbing inflation during a transformation period is successful, comparedto other transforming economies of Central Europe. When, in January 1991, the bulk of prices inthe Czech economy were freed after 40 years of central price fixing, the result was a yearlyincrease of the price level by almost 58%. However, no inflationary spiral evolved, and, since1992, inflation showed a falling long-term trend towards a single digit rate in 1995-1996.BIS Review   25/1997
- 5 -The initial jump of prices in 1991 was not accompanied by a similarly steepincrease of nominal wages. Instead, real wages fell. That created some room for subsequentincreases in real wages without serious inflationary consequences. In 1995 and 1996, however,the growth of real wages, which - if aggregated over all sectors - was faster than the increase inproductivity, became one of the potential inflationary dangers.The nominal anchor of the fixed exchange rate played an important role in therelatively good Czech results in fighting inflation. Instead of repeated smaller devaluations as inPoland or Hungary, the Czech Republic used a combination of a large initial devaluation and asubsequently fixed nominal exchange rate. In 1990 - before the start of the full transformationprogramme - the currency was devalued by more than 50%. That subsequently enabled us tokeep the nominal exchange rate stable for five years. After the introduction of a wider 7.5%fluctuation band in 1996, the exchange rate is within the band.Transformation involved so much fundamental change that its start inevitably ledto an initial fall of output and GDP. However, part of the former higher output level was simplyfeeding the enormous waste which went on throughout the command economy. In 1993, GDPstagnated partly due to the split-up of Czechoslovakia. Economic growth was resumed in theCzech Republic in 1994 and continued in 1995 and 1996 as a fast growth period.Unemployment has been kept low during the whole transformation period, thanksmainly to the rapid emergence of new private firms, and a large shift of labour into thepreviously underdeveloped service sector. Even with microeconomic restructuring going on,unemployment is not expected to exceed a 4 % level in the near future.Monetary policy toolsIn a command type economy, monetary policy reflected state plans expressedmainly in physical terms. Planned direct credit allocation was linked to the planned growth ofnational income. Credits to enterprises were directly allocated, with little attention paid to thecreditworthiness of the borrowing enterprise. Risk was socialised due to the existence ofa unitary banking system.The introduction of a new Central Bank Act and a new banking law in late 1989marked the beginning of the development of a market-oriented banking system. The Act laid thebasis for establishing a two-tier banking system through the separation of the central bank andcommercial banking functions and provided the central bank with the means for conductingmonetary policy and with regulatory authority over banks. The latter established the legal basisfor a universal banking system. The separation of central banking from commercial banking wasput into effect on January 1, 1990.The dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation into two independent republics onJanuary 1, 1993, meant the creation of the Czech National Bank (CNB). According to the Act,the CNB is independent of any instructions given by the government. The CNB is obliged tosubmit to the Parliament a report on monetary development at least two times a year and toinform the general public on monetary development at least once every three months.Further, under this Act the CNB has at its disposal practically all the tools knownto advanced market economies.BIS Review   25/1997
- 6 -At the beginning of the transformation process, the main tools of monetary policywere, quite naturally, direct ones. Credit limits, interest rate ceilings expressed as maximumdeviations from the discount rate and refinancing loans (in 1991 represented for small, newbanks on the average 60 per cent of total sources but for big banks 5-10 per cent only) wereused.Credit and interest rate ceilings were abolished in 1992 which can be regarded asa transition year towards indirect control of monetary developments. After credit ceilings on theminor banks were removed in April 1992 and on the major banks in October, central bankcontrol of monetary developments was effected through discount rates, minimum reserverequirements, auction refinancing credits and central bank bills.My predecessors behind this chair, the governors of the central banks fromGermany and Switzerland, underlined the role of money supply targets in the kit of tools. In thisrespect the Czechoslovak and the Czech practice can enrich the experience.Since 1990 the intermediate targets have been set in the form of planned changesin credits or money. For 1990 the target was “to keep the development of credits in total withinthe scope of -2 per cent to +1 per cent related to the level at the end of 1989”. In the followingyears the starting point for the monetary programme was the expected development of both realGDP and the inflation rate with the corrections for the envisaged changes in income velocity ofmoney (in the Czech terminology the relevant aggregate M2 consists of currency and demanddeposits, time and savings deposits and deposits in foreign currency). To be up-to-date, in 1997we are targeting the increase of money supply by 8-12 per cent.The philosophy behind money supply targeting is well known. Without a deepreflection upon this theme I recall the message of famous equation of exchange: Total monetaryexpenditures have to increase proportionally, if the velocity is constant, to nominally expressedGDP. Nothing more and nothing less is required from monetary policy. Monetary policy shouldserve one goal only: to repress high inflation and provide for a stable currency.As a rule of thumb this reasoning is both understandable and acceptable but amore profound discussion must draw our attention to several points:Neglecting at this moment the different versions of the equation of exchange whatcan we understand under the heading “total physical volume of transactions” on the right side ofthis equation? For the economies in transition the difference between the total volume oftransactions and transactions counted in national income accounting is important. A part of thetransactions is used for intermediate-good or inter-business expenditures and is not counted inthe GDP accounts. Some transactions are not registered at all, for example, those in theunderground economy, some imports and so forth.The decomposition of nominal GDP into a change in real output and a change inthe price level is not a trivial exercise even in advanced market economies. But in thesecountries, e.g. in Germany or USA, the prediction of real GDP rests on more solid grounds - oneknows approximately what is the “potential output” as the starting point for some guessing asconcerns the development in the medium term. In transition economies, in the period of deepstructural changes, the estimate of both real GDP and potential output is much more difficult.BIS Review   25/1997
- 7 -The traditional unidirectional link from money to income is blurred in advancedmarket economies by the existence of many forms of financial assets with different degrees ofliquidity.In transforming economies, the scope for reserve assets (Treasury bills) andinvestment assets (bonds, shares) is still limited but is widening step by step, thus weakeningalso the links between the money stock and expenditure flows. What is probably even moreimportant, at least in the Czech Republic, is the financing of receivables and current liabilitiesthrough quasi-commercial credits (inter-enterprise indebtedness). There is a scope, created byenterprises themselves, for offsetting the potential effects of monetary stringency on spendingplans. A version of the equation of exchange suitable for transforming economies shouldtherefore take into account on the left side not only money in the narrow and broader sense butalso estimates of different kinds of quasi-credit.Textbook knowledge says that the constancy, or at least the predictability ofvelocity either in income or in transaction terms, turns the equation of exchange into the quantitytheory of money. At this point, last year’s speaker, Dr Tietmeyer, had again a more favourableposition, because he could rely on the predictable and the longer-term change in the incomevelocity of the German mark. In the Czech Republic the velocity is neither constant nor reliablypredictable yet. In the first stage of economic transformation the income velocity declined in linewith the increasing transaction demand for money. Only later on did velocity start to stabiliseand recently we have observed some increase in velocity.Last but not least, one must point out that, even in the quantity theory applied inadvanced market economies, there is a certain “black box” connecting the quantity of money onthe one hand and its effect on prices and quantities on the other. Between a change in monetaryaggregates and offsetting changes in other variables, there is a transmission mechanism, with itsspecific features determined by the institutional framework in which it operates.On the top of it some prices, like housing rents and energy price, are still underthe control of the government and the process of deregulation cannot be perfectly anticipateddue to the political implications.To specify the transmission mechanism and to open the “black box” means bothto describe and analyse the ways in which money is created and how it influences real variables.These ways change through the evolution of new institutions in transforming economies.Besides money supply targeting, operative targets have been used.As the operative target the monetary base (currency plus minimum reserves plusfree reserves) was replaced in the second half of 1994 by bank reserves and a system wasimplemented for the daily prediction of liquidity management on the money market. Since thenthe monetary base has been used as an indicator.In order to reduce the fluctuation of free reserves in the banking system and thevolatility of interbank deposit market interest rates, the CNB shortened their maintenance cycleto 14 days commencing March 1st, 1994. Since then refinancing credits have been provided onlywhen fully covered by securities (repo operations). This CNB shift to daily operational monetarypolicy management based on repo operations and the gradual strengthening of the role of theseoperations in the sterilisation of foreign capital inflows, particularly in the second half of 1995,led to the repo market’s gradual development.BIS Review   25/1997
- 8 -As from the beginning of 1996 a one-week PRIBOR interest rate replaced bankreserves management as the operative target. The quantitative target has been replaced by aninterest rate target with the aim to efficiently affect, on a daily basis, the interest rate level at theshort end of the yield curve. This major change was facilitated by the gradual development ofthe money market and its cultivation by the CNB. The one-week PRIBOR rate is affectedthrough sales of securities with a date specified in advance of their repurchase (repos) with oneand two week maturities, for which a limited repo rate is announced.New challenge: monetary aggregates in a small open economyThe monetary survey of the CNB indicates the structure of the money supply(M2) on the liabilities side (corresponding to the demand side) and its sources on the assets side(corresponding to the supply side). By comparing the assets and liabilities, one can reveal thedifferent sources of the money supply.The main sources of money supply growth are particularly dependent on thespecific conditions of each economy, reflecting mainly the proportion of the influence ofdomestic and foreign sources of growth.In general, the main sources of money supply growth include money issued in theform of credits granted by banks to both households and enterprises in domestic currency, theconversion of foreign exchange inflows into domestic currency (net foreign assets), net credit tothe government and the net position of the National Property Fund and the residual called “otheritems net” (mainly own capital and bank reserves).Developments in the period 1993-1996 reveal some interesting features:Credits to enterprises and households in domestic currency, which are quitenaturally the main source of money supply, exhibited a relatively slower growth up to the end of1995, followed by a relatively quicker growth in 1996 when these credits became the mainimpetus of money supply growth.The most remarkable feature was the growing share of net foreign assets up toDecember 1995 which resulted especially in 1993-1995 in the deviations of the dynamics of M2out of the corridor laid down by monetary policy and which gave rise to the sterilisation effortsof the CNB.The influence of net credit to the government plus the net position of the NationalProperty Fund was negligible in the period under analysis, and in some periods it evendampened money supply growth. This fact is probably unique in the transforming countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe and reflects the prudent fiscal stance of Czech macroeconomicpolicy.A more detailed answer to the causes of changes in the degree of impact ofindividual factors on money supply growth can be found when studying their development indifferent periods of the transformation.In Czechoslovakia, during the first transformation years (1990-1992) moneysupply growth was based primarily on the relatively quickly increasing volume of creditsgranted to enterprises due to growing credit demand, which was very closely connected with theBIS Review   25/1997
- 9 -liberalisation of entrepreneurial activities in a newly created market environment (an increasingnumber of businesses in need of initial capital).Gradually, foreign money creation also expanded, affected by the development ofan improving balance of payments, particularly the current account.The gradual stabilisation of the macroeconomic and political environment(apparent mainly after the dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation in January, 1993, and therelatively rapid calming of price developments following the introduction of a new tax systembased on value added tax), the commencement of the activities of capital market institutions andthe stability of the exchange rate which significantly decreased the risks for foreign investors,led in the second half of 1993 to a significant strengthening of the influence of the inflow offoreign funds into the Czech Republic on money supply growth.The strong foreign capital inflows continued to influence money supply growth in1994 and 1995 when capital inflows reached 18 per cent of GDP. This growth was particularlygenerated by increasing foreign direct investments, portfolio investments and relatively cheaperforeign credits drawn by domestic enterprises.Because the increasing inflow of foreign money was accompanied by acontinuous demand for credits on the part of enterprises (financed partially also from foreignresources), this situation called for the sterilisation of excess funds, taking into account the goalsof monetary policy.Paradoxically, due to the government’s sound fiscal policy, we were confrontedwith an insufficient amount of government securities, and therefore the CNB had to issue itsown bills and sold them to commercial banks to weaken the impact on the volume of moneystock.A certain turnaround has occurred since the end of 1995. Contrary to previousyears, the foreign sector helped to weaken money supply growth due to an increasing balance oftrade deficit and the slower growth of foreign capital inflows into the country.Exchange rate policyThe above-mentioned development of the composition of the monetaryaggregates has influenced attitudes vis-à-vis exchange rate policy.At the beginning of the transformation we were faced with the difficult choice ofsetting an appropriate exchange rate.On the eve of the programme of price and trade liberalisation the governmenttook the decision to use the exchange rate as a nominal anchor because in a small, open economythe domestic price level is heavily affected by the exchange rate.Having taken into account various considerations in December 1990, we fixed thenew exchange rate at 28 Czechoslovak crowns per US dollar, which then was about the middleground between the parallel black market rate and the calculated cost of earning one dollar offoreign exchange.BIS Review   25/1997
- 10 -Since then the Czech crown has been pegged firstly to a basket of the currenciesof five major trading partners and since 1993, with a view to the development of the currencybreakdown of foreign payments, to a two-currency basket (65 per cent Deutsche Mark and 35per cent US dollar).The improvement in macroeconomic stability and relatively high foreignexchange reserves created good starting conditions for the gradual extension of the Czechcrown’s convertibility.Some additional measures were taken in 1994 by means of an amendment inAugust 1994 to the Foreign Exchange Act. This amendment made it possible to export securitiesdenominated in Czech currency; foreign exchange permits for direct investment outside theCzech Republic were provided to virtually all applicants and permit procedures for obtainingforeign exchange credits from abroad and for equity participation abroad were simplified.Effective October 1, 1995 the Czech currency became convertible in accordancewith Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement, and the country became a member of theOECD. Under the new Foreign Exchange Act the current account of the balance of paymentswas liberalised and the regulation of the capital account was substantially reduced. Only theestablishment of accounts abroad by residents, the outright purchase of securities by residents,the provision of financial credits to non-residents and real estate purchases by non-residentscontinue to be subject to regulation.Textbook analysis (the Mundell-Fleming model for an open economy)demonstrates that a nation under a fixed nominal exchange rate system cannot pursue anindependent monetary policy. Developments in the Czech Republic in 1993-1995 confirms thisstatement. The rapid increase in net foreign assets mentioned above had to be dampened by asmaller increase of domestic credits and in February 1996 gave rise to an important decision ofthe CNB’s Board.The Bank’s Board widened the band for the fluctuations of the crown’s exchangerate from 0.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, including the maintenance of a 0.25 per cent spread, i.e.the difference between the buying and selling rate used in transactions between the CNB andcommercial banks at the foreign exchange fixing.The CNB is prepared to intervene only in such a way that the exchange rate doesnot deviate from the announced fluctuation band. In January 1997 we witnessed an interestingand rather suprising development. In spite of the factors working in the medium run in thedirection of depreciation (the higher inflation rate in the Czech Republic than in the countries ofour major trading partners and the increasing trade deficit) the exchange rate as hovering around4 per cent in the revaluation band! The explanation is given by the theory of asset demand -there is still a high demand for Czech crowns by foreign entities.Inflation and monetary policyInstead of using money supply target as an intermediary target, some countries(New Zealand, the United Kingdom and others) aim directly at inflation goals because nosufficiently reliable relation exists between any conceivable intermediate target and inflation.BIS Review   25/1997
- 11 -This practice has not been adopted in the Czech Republic because in transformingeconomies the link between the money supply and the price level has some specific features.Everybody agrees with Friedman that inflation is always and everywhere amonetary phenomenon. It means that over the longer term, a general rise in prices is not possiblewithout an undue expansion of the money stock.One of my predecessors in this series of lectures, the former President of theSwiss National Bank, Dr. Markus Lusser, declared in his memorial lecture in 1994 that inSwitzerland the time lapse between the introduction of monetary policy measures and theirimpact on prices is two to three years.BIS Review   25/1997

The mandate to the South African Reserve BankThe South African Reserve Bank was established in 1921 in terms of a specialAct of Parliament. At that time, central banks existed mainly in Europe, and the SA ReserveBank was only the fourth central bank founded outside Europe. There already existed centralbanks in the United States of America, Japan and Java.Since its establishment, the Reserve Bank was always privately owned. Today,the Bank has more than 700 shareholders. The shares of the Bank are listed on the JohannesburgStock Exchange and, in terms of the Act, no individual shareholder is allowed to hold more thanone-half per cent of the capital of the Bank. The Bank may also never pay a dividend of morethan 10 per cent per annum on the nominal value of its capital. The market price of the sharetherefore behaves like a government bond with a 10 per cent coupon.The Bank is managed by a Board of 14 Directors, seven of whom are elected bythe shareholders to represent them on the Board. Without holding any shares in the Bank, theGovernment (President) has the right to appoint the other seven Board members. The sevenappointed by the President includes the Governor and three Deputy Governors, who are full-timeexecutive members, plus three part-time Directors.The functions of the Bank changed over time. When the Bank was originallyestablished in 1921, its main task was to develop money and capital markets and a bankingsystem in South Africa that would be independent of London. Today its main task, as defined interms of the South African Reserve Bank Act and in the Constitution of the Republic of SouthAfrica, is to defend the value of the rand, that is, to keep inflation as low as possible. This isvery much in line with contemporary central banking all over the world. Since 1980, mostcentral banks have accepted a similar mission. The latest example is perhaps the People’s Bankof China, whose mandate has been changed as from March 1995 to maintain the stability of theChinese yuan, and in this way to promote economic growth.The Board of the Reserve Bank has been given an important degree of autonomyfor the execution of its duties. In terms of the Constitution:“The South African Reserve Bank, in pursuit of its primary objective, mustperform its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice, butthere must be regular consultation between the Bank and the Cabinet memberresponsible for national financial matters”.In terms of Section 32 of the Reserve Bank Act, the Bank must submit a monthlystatement of its assets and liabilities and an annual report to Parliament. The Bank is thereforeaccountable to Parliament. The Governor of the Reserve Bank holds regular discussions with theMinister of Finance, and appears before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance fromtime to time.The Board of the Bank has delegated its powers on important monetary policydecisions to a sub-committee of the Board, known as the Governors’ Committee and comprisingthe Governor and three Deputy Governors. There is also an Audit Committee and a HumanBIS Review   24/1997
- 2 -Resources Committee of the Board that meet regularly on aspects of internal finance andadministration. The full Board meets four times a year.The Bank has a total staff of about 1900 people and operates from its Head Officein Pretoria and seven branches maintained in the major cities of South Africa.2. Why must inflation be controlled?The main task of the Reserve Bank is to protect the value of the currency. Thebusiness of a modern central bank is the business of money. Central banks are given the right toissue money by their governments. That is why the Reserve Bank is accountable to Parliamentand why its surplus profits are paid over to the Treasury. The right to issue money (bank notesand coin) makes the central bank a very powerful institution that can easily be misused forsectoral interests. That is why it must be able to act in the national interest -- what is good for thetotal economy is important, and not what any specific group or sector may desire.In modern sophisticated financial systems, surrogates for real money (bank notesand coin) developed, such as bank cheque accounts, credit cards and electronic transfers. Privatebanking institutions now create more money (means of payment) than the central bank. In orderto fulfil its task of protecting the value of the currency, the Reserve Bank must therefore alsohave some powers to control the money creation capacity of the banking sector. In South Africatoday, bank notes and coin in circulation account for less than 5 per cent of the money supply.The rest is money created by banking institutions over which the Reserve Bank has but anindirect control.Money serves the purpose of a means of payment. It is also a unit of account interms of which the value of goods and services are measured. It serves thirdly as a store of valuefor the savings of the community. These three functions of money make it essential that thevalue of money shall remain as stable as possible. No modern market-oriented economy canfunction well if the value of its currency is not kept stable.Inflation is a continuous decline in the value of money. This will be reflected in acontinuous rise in the prices of goods and services. In a market economy, certain prices ofspecific goods and services will always change to reflect changes in underlying forces ofdemand and supply. It is indeed essential that relative prices of goods and services will change ina market economy to bring about equilibrium and support maximum economic growth. Itbecomes a problem for the efficient functioning of the economy if all prices generally increaseover time, because this will confuse the signals emitted by the market system through themechanism of relative price changes. The many disadvantages of inflation therefore include: thedistortion of the efficient working of the market system through its disruptive effects on theprice mechanism; a reduction in the usefulness of money as a unit of account. You cannotproperly measure and compare values of goods and services if you have to use a variable orelastic yardstick; and an erosion of the value of money as a store of wealth. Savers will not beprepared to accumulate wealth in an asset that loses its value over time.Because of these effects of a decline in the value of money, high rates of inflationinevitably lead to a decline in the efficiency of the market economy, a decline in savings and, inthe longer term, a lower rate of growth for the economy as a whole. Other more directdisadvantages of inflation can be summarised as follows:BIS Review   24/1997
- 3 -People with fixed incomes, for example salaries or pensions, are affected more byinflation than the wealthy who can partly protect themselves against inflation, forexample by investing in property or equities. Inflation therefore leads to anincrease in the disparity between the “haves” and the “have-nots”. Inflation makesforward planning more difficult. A person may, for example, save for his wholeworking life for a pension, just to find at the end of his career that his savingshave been eroded by inflation. Inflation in one country at a level higher thaninflation in other countries create many difficulties for international financialrelations. The exchange rate of the country that becomes out of line because ofthis difference, must depreciate continuously to keep local industries and otherproducers (e.g. gold mines) competitive. Depreciation in itself can lead to moreinflation and a vicious circle of more-inflation-more-depreciation can easily getout of control and destroy the whole economy. Inflation is inclined to feed onitself. It is almost impossible to keep a little bit of inflation always just a little bit.As long as there is inflation in the economy, monetary authorities must remain ontheir guard. Even if relatively low inflation can be tolerated, there is always adanger that the rate of price rises will increase.Because of all these adverse characteristics of inflation, this illness of the marketeconomy often leads to serious social disruption which brings with it political instability. It istherefore in the interest of the economy, the social structure and the political system that agovernment and its people shall always be prepared and ready to fight inflation.3. The causes of inflationInflation is a rather complex phenomenon of the economy. There is no singlecause of inflation. It can find its origin in the rest of the world, and can therefore be importedfrom abroad. It can be caused by excess demand, that is, by a desire of an economy to absorbmore goods and services than it can afford to supply (from domestic production plus imports).The excessive demand can emanate from government expenditure, private sector consumptionexpenditure, or even fixed investment. It can be caused by wage increases in excess ofproductivity rises that will lead to an increase in the labour cost per unit of production. It can begenerated by monopolistic practices that can be misused to generate surplus profits forentrepreneurs.Whatever the basic causes of inflation might be, it is normally accompanied oraccommodated by excessive increases in the money supply. Indeed, inflation may often find itsorigin in excessive increases in the money supply when monetary policy is used as a deliberateinstrument to provide artificial stimulation to the economy. In any national programme to keepinflation down, the control of the money supply must be included as an indispensable componentof the total package. Restricting the growth in the money supply will make it impossible forinflationary impulses, even of a non-monetary origin, to escalate and permeate in continuousprice rises.In the South African economy, there are many inflationary forces at work at alltimes. The task of the South African Reserve Bank is therefore not an easy one. Because of thesemany inflationary forces, the Bank must apply a policy that at times seems to beover-restrictive -- an approach that is necessary in order to neutralise the inflationary effects ofmany non-monetary actions that are exerting upward pressure on prices all the time.BIS Review   24/1997
- 4 -4. The monetary policy model of the Reserve BankMost central banks in the world pursue the same prime objective of protecting thevalue of their currencies. Not all central banks, however, follow the same model in theimplementation of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank’s policy is a “monetarist” approach basedon the direct control of the money supply. Controlling the money supply is seen as anintermediate objective in reaching the ultimate objective of controlling inflation.Some countries target inflation directly in the monetary policy model. Takingaccount of the many causes of inflation, direct targeting of inflation requires broad co-ordinationof macroeconomic policies such as fiscal policy, trade and industrial policies, labour policies,and international economic relations policies. It should indeed be based on a broad accord of aconsistent macroeconomic policy framework that will support the need for keeping inflationdown. Low inflation is no guarantee for higher economic growth and development, but it is animportant precondition for attaining better standards of living for all the people of the country ona sustainable basis.In some other countries, monetary policy is anchored to a fixed or stableexchange rate formula, instead of to the money supply. This is perhaps good for countries with arelatively open economy (such as South Africa is now becoming). It is a precondition for thesuccessful implementation of this type of model that the country will be able to stabilise theexchange rate through regular intervention in the foreign exchange market. To begin with, thecentral bank must have access to a substantial amount of foreign reserves to enable it tointervene in the market for foreign exchange in a meaningful way.The South African model for monetary policy is, however, based on controllingthe money supply. Within the family of monetarists, there will always be differences of opinionon what the most appropriate definition is for the money supply, on how this money supplyshould best be controlled, on when and how actions by the central bank must be triggered,etcetera. The basic objective remains, however, to keep the rate of increase in the money supplywithin reasonable limits.The Reserve Bank’s policy is seen to be rather accommodative and does notcomply with the strict money rule of not tolerating any inflation. Guidelines for an acceptablerate of increase in the M3 money supply are announced at the beginning of each year on whatgrowth in the money supply will be good or tolerable in the South African economy. For 1996,guidelines were set at between 6 and 10 per cent, providing for real growth of 3 to 4 per cent,and inflation of 6 to 7 per cent. Pure monetarists would have required growth in the moneysupply of not more than 4 per cent (the growth in the real economy in a similar situation).The money supply guidelines set by the Reserve Bank should not be seen astargets that must be achieved at all cost. They only serve as guidelines and contribute towardsmaking monetary policy more transparent. As long as the actual growth in the money supplyexceeds the guidelines, monetary policy must remain restrictive. Scope for an easier monetarypolicy develops only as and when actual growth in the money supply moves to within theguideline range.As previously indicated, money is created in South Africa mainly through theactions of private banking institutions. When they give credit to their clients, they create money.The Reserve Bank’s obligation to control the money supply, therefore, extends to a control overthe total amount of new credit extended by banking institutions.BIS Review   24/1997
- 5 -The rate of increase in the total amount of bank credit outstanding is determinedby two sides of a market formula: the amount of credit that banks can supply at any time, andthe total demand of funds emanating from the borrowers of funds. The supply side of theformula depends on how much liquidity the banks have at their disposal for funding theirlending operations. The Reserve Bank therefore has a vested interest in influencing or managingthe amount of liquidity available to the banks. The Reserve Bank has a number of instruments atits disposal to influence the liquidity of the banking system, such as open-market operations,discount window facilities, and cash reserve requirements.The demand side of the formula is very much interest rate driven. Higher interestrates will depress the demand, and lower interest rates will increase demand. The level ofinterest rates is to an important extent determined by forces of demand and supply operatingthrough financial markets, but can also be influenced by the Reserve Bank’s own intervention inthe markets. To meet its obligation of controlling the money supply, the Reserve Bank mustensure that the amount of liquidity available in the banking system and the level of interest rateswill be such that there will be no excessive increase in the money supply. Excessive increases inthe money supply will eventually, after a time lag which can be as long as two years,accommodate rising, or cause higher, inflation with all the disadvantages thereof.Interest rates therefore play a vital role in the fight against inflation. It is one ofthe main operational instruments used by central banks to ensure an acceptable rate of growth inthe money supply.In summary, the monetary policy model followed by the Reserve Bank can beseen as follows:To support maximum sustainable economic growth and development; the rate ofinflation must be kept low (the value of the currency must be protected); toachieve this objective, the rate of growth in the money supply must be kept withinan acceptable range (the guidelines); as money is created, mainly through bankcredit extension, monetary policy must be directed towards some control overbank credit extension, which requires some management of the amount of fundsavailable in the banking system, and a consistent interest rate policy.If this model is applied consistently and with success, the rate of inflation will below, which will lead to a more stable exchange rate of the rand. The exchange rate thereforebecomes a result of the model and not a starting point.In such an environment of overall financial stability, it will be possible to achieveand sustain a maximum real rate of growth and development in the economy.5. Successes achieved in the pastThe present model of monetary policy was designed by the Commission ofInquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy (De Kock Commission) during thecourse of the 1980’s and was implemented in South Africa more vigorously since 1989. Theresults achieved since then can be summarised as follows:In 1988 total credit extended to the private sector increased by 28 per cent whichwas, of course, far out of line with growth in the nominal value of the total gross domesticBIS Review   24/1997
- 6 -production of South Africa. The M3 money supply increased by 27 per cent and releasedmassive inflationary pressures in the economy.Through a continuous and consistent restrictive monetary policy, the rate ofincrease in bank credit extension was gradually reduced, and in 1992 and 1993 it dropped below10 per cent per annum. The rate of increase in the money supply also declined to 8 per cent in1992 and 7 per cent in 1993. The rate of inflation followed and declined to below 10 per cent forthe first time in 20 years in 1993. For the past four years, the average annual rate of inflation hasnow stayed below the 10 per cent level, and last year inflation of 7.4 per cent (average for thetwelve months) represented the lowest annual average rate of inflation in South Africa for thepast 24 years.Ominous signs developed over the past two years, however, with the rate ofincrease in bank credit extension escalating again to 18.7 per cent in June 1996. The rate ofincrease in the M3 money supply also rose to 16 per cent in October 1996, while inflationgradually crept up from a low of 5.5 per cent over the twelve months up to April 1996, to 9.4per cent over the twelve months up to December 1996.The current stimulus for inflation emanated mainly from the depreciation of therand last year, but there is a danger that, if not checked at this stage, it could easily be convertedinto a new cycle of a continuous rise in the rate of inflation. The Reserve Bank was thereforeforced once again during the past year to pursue a more restrictive monetary policy that led to anincrease of approximately 3 percentage points in the level of interest rates.Towards the end of 1996, the more restrictive policies began to produce resultswhen both the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply slowed down.Over the twelve months up to December 1996, bank credit extension to the private sector rose by15.7 per cent, and the M3 money supply by 13.7 per cent, both marginally down from the peaksestablished earlier in the year.Inflation is, however, still creeping upwards and it will take some time before thefull effect of the depreciation of the rand will work itself out. In the meantime, it is of greatimportance that all other inflationary impulses in the economy, such as excessive rises ingovernment expenditure or real wage rises in excess of productivity increases, and of course, acontinuation of the excessive rates of increase in the monetary aggregates, must be avoided.The depreciation of the rand can bring many benefits for economic growth anddevelopment, provided the advantages for international competitiveness will not be dissipatedvery quickly by rising costs of production and a rising rate of inflation in the domestic economy.The year 1997 is indeed a testing period for the Reserve Bank and for the monetary policyapplied by the Bank. Should the Bank fail in its efforts to protect the value of the currency at thisstage, the goals set by Government for economic reconstruction and development, and theimplementation of the Government’s Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution willnot be attainable.BIS Review   24/1997
Mr. Davies reviews current debates on regulatory structures governing thefinancial system   Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. HowardDavies, held on 22/2/97 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Financial Markets Conferenceentitled ‘Market and Regulatory Structures in a Global Environment’.It is conventional, and polite to say, at the beginning of a speech of this kind, thatone is thrilled to have been asked to speak on the subject of the structure of financial regulationand that the topic is, of all the many preoccupations of human kind through the centuries, theone which generates the most enthusiasm and excitement in one’s breast.But I cannot bring myself to do it.  You may think me ill-brought up to say this -if so blame my parents - but I find the question of the structure of regulation to be quiteresistible.  I know that there are those who like nothing better than to draw new organigrams andto explore the manifold interfaces between regulatory agencies.  (There are also people who findself-fulfilment collecting airline sick bags, or watching synchronised swimming.  That is amatter for them.)But my lack of enthusiasm for the topic of regulatory structure is, I hope, not anemotional response.  It is rationally based on two prior beliefs.  First, that the relationshipbetween structure and effectiveness is loose.  I know of little evidence that structural reforms arequickly followed by an enhancement of the effectiveness of the activity in which those agenciesare engaged.  Secondly, my prejudice is to believe that regulatory structure should follow marketstructure, rather than the other way round.  Regulators should seek to respond to changingmarkets which, in turn, respond to changing customer demand and new product availability,rather than seeking to dictate either.  So we should always ask ourselves whether the regulatoryframework we adopt makes sense to market participants, rather than requiring them to structuretheir business to fit in with some governmentally imposed view of the way product deliveryshould be organised.But I recognise that, in practice, we cannot avoid constant attention to themaintenance of the regulatory framework.  Firstly, because while good structure will notnecessarily generate effectiveness, a faulty, out of date framework will certainly make it veryhard for regulators to do their jobs well.  And, of course, the market is not in an ‘originalcondition’.  The financial markets we have now are heavily conditioned by the legislative andregulatory framework within which they have grown up.  That is particularly true in the UnitedStates.  It is hard to imagine that, absent Glass-Steagall, regulation Q and all the rest, thefinancial landscape in North America would look as it does today.So I conclude that the debate on regulatory structure should be a constantdialogue between the markets and the regulators, but with a prejudice in favour of the former.Our ultimate task as regulators is to ensure that markets work efficiently, and in the interests ofconsumers.Against that background, how is this dialogue proceeding in the UK at present?For we too are addressing the questions which preoccupy you in the United States, in our quaint,olde worlde British fashion.But before I review the current debate on regulatory structure in the UK, I shouldsay a little about the way we define the objectives of financial regulation.  We think of five:  toBIS Review   21/1997
- 2 -protect the economy against systemic risk; to protect individual depositors, investors andinsurance policy holders against loss from the failure of their intermediary; to protect customersagainst business misconduct; to assist society at large in the fight against crime (for instance bymaking sure firms have in place systems to detect and report laundered drug money and otherproceeds of organised crime); and, last but not least, to create and sustain fair markets.Described bluntly, these objectives make the job of regulators look impossiblydaunting.  But of course they are not absolute aims.  Regulators cannot, and should not, offerblanket assurances to investors and depositors.  They cannot, because the tools and resources todo so are simply not available.  And they should not, because it would be quite wrong to removefrom investors and firms the responsibility for assessing, taking and monitoring financial risks.This is a very important point, which Alan Greenspan has helpfully underlined on a number ofoccasions recently.UK regulatory structure and proposals for changeAcross the world we see a lively debate on how the regulatory cake should be cut.There has been change in France.  The Australian Government has set up the WallisCommission to look at the institutional arrangements there.  Their first report has just beenpublished.  Reforms are in progress in Japan.  In the US the new legislative season is about toopen, with a number of runners and riders already saddled up in the financial regulationsteeplechase.  Similarly, in the UK, a variety of think tanks, and the opposition Labour Party,have produced proposals to amend, or in some cases fundamentally reorder, our regulatorystructure.  But, before describing these exciting proposals, perhaps a brief description of theBritish system would be in order.Responsibility for financial regulation in the UK is divided between twoGovernment Departments.Department of Trade and IndustryHM TreasurySecurities and Investments BoardBank of EnglandPersonal Investment AuthorityRetail RegulatorInvestment Management Regulatory OrganisationInsurance CompaniesBanksFinancialAdvisersSecurities And Futures AuthorityFund ManagersBankingAct 1987FinancialServicesAct 1986InsuranceCompaniesAct 1982Securities HousesSTRUCTURE OF UK FINANCIAL REGULATIONBIS Review   21/1997
- 3 -Most falls to the Treasury, but prudential supervision of insurance companies isthe responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).  The DTI carries out itssupervisory responsibilities using its own staff; the Treasury, on the other hand, while setting thelegal framework and policy directions for regulation, leaves most of the detailed regulatoryfunctions to others.  Under one piece of legislation - the 1987 Banking Act - the Bank ofEngland carries out prudential supervision of banks.  Under another, the 1986 Financial ServicesAct, the Treasury delegates its powers to the Securities and Investments Board, which in turnrecognises a number of front-line regulators.  These front-line regulators cover different sectionsof the market.  One, the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), is responsible for securitieshouses; another, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO), for fundmanagers.  These two regulators undertake both prudential supervision and conduct of businessregulation.  The third, the Personal Investments Authority (PIA), is responsible for the retailsector, and has principally a conduct of business remit although it is responsible for theprudential supervision of independent financial advisers (IFAs).  So, in effect, there is a layeredapproach to the regulation of financial services in the UK, with different powers held at eachlevel.(To complete the picture, the Building Societies Commission supervises buildingsocieties (Savings and Loans) - though the largest of them are now converting to bank status.And the Department of Social Security is responsible for the supervision of occupational pensionschemes.)This brief description of the legislative framework might lead one to suppose thatthe UK system is primarily statutory - yet the securities side is often described, at least bycomparison with the US system, as one of self-regulation.  Indeed, some argue that it isexcessively self-regulating and, therefore, unreasonably lax.We would reject that last charge.  And, in practice, the distinction betweenstatutory and self-regulation is not black and white.  The UK system has elements of both.Prudential supervision of insurance firms is carried out directly by a government ministry, whichis unambiguously Government regulation.  Banking supervision is carried out by the Bank ofEngland.  Constitutionally, this is not ‘Government’ regulation, but rather regulation by a publicbody which is authorised by specific Act of Parliament.  Certainly no one describes what we doas self-regulation, even though the Bank of England is a bank.On the investment side, the picture is more complicated.  The Government hasdelegated its powers to the Securities and Investments Board.  The SIB’s governing boardincludes people who are active in financial services, but they are appointed by the Treasury andthe Bank of England (indeed I am one of them) and are required to act in the public interest.Again, this does not look like self-regulation.  However, the various front-line regulators arecalled, in the Act itself, ‘self regulating organisations’ (SROs).  Their boards include a highproportion of active practitioners, elected by the industry to represent its views.  Practitioners arealso heavily involved in policy discussions, rule-making and enforcement functions.  But, likethe SIB, the SROs operate indirectly under statute, and have a duty to regulate in the publicinterest.We therefore have no self-regulation in the strict sense, rather a variety ofstatutory and statute-backed bodies with practitioner involvement, each with differentrelationships with the industry and with Government.  Effective regulation needs the input of allBIS Review   21/1997
- 4 -participants in the market if it is to offer appropriate protection without stifling innovation.Regulators can benefit greatly from effective practitioner input but to retain the confidence ofthe investing public they must persuade them that regulation puts their interests, and not those ofthe firms and their shareholders, first.The system we now have is undoubtedly capable of achieving an appropriatebalance between market sensitivity and consumer confidence; it has, in many respects, workedwell.  But it has been stress-tested in a number of difficult episodes:  the Maxwell affair, theprivate pension mis-selling saga, the collapse of BCCI, Barings Bank and Sumitomo.  Theseepisodes have taught us something about the strengths and weaknesses of our system, just as theS&L crisis and the Daiwa New York problem have done in the US.  Furthermore, marketsthemselves have moved on.  The financial landscape of today is almost unrecognisable from theone which informed legislators’ views in the early 1980s, before the Banking and FinancialServices Acts were put on the statute book.  It is therefore not surprising that over there, as wellas over here, there is criticism of the existing structure, and pressure for change.  Our ownsystem, with its monopolistic approach to the origination of legislation, does not generatecompeting draft bills.  But the marketplace for ideas on regulatory reform is, I can assure you,just as well contested.Critics of the existing British system object on three counts:1that the failures of the last decade demonstrate its inability to cope withstrains and crises;2that it is unnecessarily complex, with overlapping and sometimes evenconflicting responsibilities; and3that it has failed to keep pace with changes in institutional and marketstructures; the distinctions on which it was based no longer effectivelyapply.It is not my aim today to give a comprehensive assessment of the validity of allthese arguments.  And, in any event, just as in the US, there is a heavy political dimension to thisdebate.  But I would make a few observations on the arguments advanced for change.The UK system is complex, although it is no more complicated than theequivalent arrangements in some other countries with similarly sophisticated financial markets.(Indeed, were I not a guest here, I might say that the US system was rather more labyrinthinethan ours.)  Those who argue for simplification point to duplication of function and cost,especially between the SIB and the front-line financial services regulators.   There isundoubtedly a case to answer in that area, as both the SIB and the SROs would acknowledge.But the legislation we have explicitly dictates a two-tier structure.It is also true that institutions now tend to be involved in a variety of differentbusinesses.  Banks own securities houses, fund managers, and insurance companies.  Insurancecompanies are diversifying into banking, and so on.  So that even though there should always bea lead regulator, looking at the overall position of the business, institutions still face the costs ofcomplying with the requirements of several regulators.BIS Review   21/1997
- 5 -But the question underlying these arguments about complexity and overlap ismore fundamental.  Should regulation be based around institutions (it is institutions which fail,after all) or around functions or types of business which call for specialist regulatoryknowledge?The UK system is organised neither along wholly functional nor whollyinstitutional lines.  In today’s markets, where firms are a mass of subsidiaries and business units,no major market participant deals with a single regulator across all its businesses.  Similarly, noregulator has unique responsibility for regulating one function of each business.  The insuranceoperation of a firm, for example, is covered by separate prudential and conduct of businessregulators.Most people involved in financial regulation would recognise this description ofthe problem.  But determining how to resolve it is not straightforward, as evidenced by the widevariety of proposals for change which have been advanced.Some proponents of reorganisation would like to begin by making all financialregulation the responsibility of a single Government Department - the Treasury.  They suggestthat this would clear up accountability for the legislative framework, and for the powers andsanctions in the regulatory regime and create consistency of regulatory approach across sectors.Straightforward administrative tidiness may also be a factor.  While there may be merit in boththese arguments, such machinery of Government questions are for the Government to determine,and I happily leave such matters to them.Most of the discussion about regulatory structure in the UK has concentrated onthe area covered by the SIB and the front-line financial services regulators.  It is in this part ofthe system that the arguments about duplication of function, unnecessary cost and poorcommunication are most often heard.  The various alternative models all feature some degree ofconsolidation, and some would go as far as to fold all the main financial services regulators intoa single body.  Others propose two bodies, each reporting directly to the Treasury, with onecovering wholesale business and one covering retail, acknowledging the different regulatoryimperatives, especially in the conduct of business field, of the two sectors.  The aim would be toreduce the number of domestic regulators large institutions would have to deal with, and toimprove the match of regulation to function.Even more radical changes have been proposed, encompassing not only the SIBarea, but the prudential supervision of banks and insurance companies as well.  One model,colloquially known as ‘Twin Peaks’, would replace the whole of the present system with twoCommissions: a Financial Stability Commission, with responsibility for systemic risk, theprudential supervision of all major institutions, and conduct of business regulation of wholesaleactivities, and a Consumer Protection Commission, which would be in charge of conduct ofbusiness regulation in retail markets, as well as detecting market manipulation and insiderdealing.  It would also carry out prudential supervision of those stock brokers and fund managerswho deal with private clients, and of independent intermediaries.The advocates of this model argue that it would better match regulation with bothinstitutions and functions, in particular on the wholesale side.  The underlying contention is thatthe traditional separation between banking, securities and insurance is breaking down, so thatthere is now a less meaningful difference between institutions and functions.BIS Review   21/1997
- 6 -I am not persuaded of the merits of this case.  Although the activities of banks andsecurities firms do overlap at the margin, this is not true of the core activities.Banks in particular continue to have a number of distinctive characteristics.  First,there are the risks associated with the maturity transformation seen in their balance sheets.Banks experiencing a drain in their liquidity, perhaps because of a classic ‘run’, could be driveninto insolvency through the forced realisation of illiquid assets at ‘fire-sale’ prices.  Second,there is the risk of contagion - problems at one bank can spread to others - not just through directfinancial linkages but also because, in the absence of timely, transparent information on bankassets, depositors become concerned about other banks which they see as similar.  Finally, banksplay a central role in payments systems, including payment flows generated by FX trading.The conclusion I draw is that there is enough that is special about banks for theirprudential supervision to be retained as a separate activity in any new regulatory structure, andthat this argument at present outweighs the case for change.Whether prudential supervision of banks should be a function of the central bankis a separate question.  Some argue that other central banking responsibilities (such as theconduct of monetary policy) make for conflicts of interest and therefore that supervision shouldnot be carried out by the central bank.I am not persuaded by these arguments either.  Nor am I aware of many exampleswhere the suggested conflicts between a supervisory role for the central bank and its otherresponsibilities have arisen in practice. Indeed, there are important synergies between thesupervisory function and other central bank responsibilities.  It makes sense for the ‘micro’supervision of individual banks in the system to be carried out by the same body that carries outthe ‘macro’ function of maintaining the stability of the financial system as a whole, stabilitywhich is essential if monetary policy is to be executed effectively and efficiently.It is no accident that in all major countries the central bank has a significant rolein the supervision of banks, even if in some cases others have been given the legal powers tocarry out the front-line tasks.  Having as supervisors tried their best to limit the likelihood offailure, when faced with it central bankers are uniquely well placed to provide assistance,whether to the institution in trouble, to the market at large, or both.  Those who wish to separatebanking supervision from central banking must acknowledge that there are certain things thatonly the central bank can do, and that therefore there needs to be a strong link between thecentral bank and any new regulator.  In Germany, for instance, the Bundesaufsichtsamt is thesupervisor of commercial banks.  But the Bundesbank has an important role in the day-to-dayjob of collecting prudential returns, and must be consulted on liquidity and capital requirements,which bear most directly on its role in an emergency.The logic of these arguments might point instead to a ‘Holy Trinity’, rather than a‘Twin Peaks’ model, based on three agencies, focused respectively on financial services,banking and insurance.  That might allow the most sensible match - albeit not complete - ofregulation to function and institution.  It would also have the advantage of evolving fairlyreadily out of the present structure.BIS Review   21/1997
- 7 -HM TreasuryInsurance SupervisorBank of EnglandConsolidated Securitiesand Investments Supervisor(s)Insurance CompaniesInvestment Firms, Marketsand ExchangesBanksThis last is not a trivial point, since the cost and disruption caused byreorganisation would be considerable, and higher in proportion to the degree of change.  Theprocess would inevitably generate uncertainty among firms and the public, and make theregulatory system more difficult to manage in the meantime.  This argues for building on thepresent arrangements, if at all possible, rather than beginning again with an entirely newstructure that could take years to settle down.Furthermore, what matters to the financial system, and to the public, is thatregulators are effective.  Effectiveness necessitates good communication, consolidatedsupervision and close co-operation to maintain protection across the piece.  Whether structuralchange (including bringing functions together under one umbrella) would improvecommunication and co-operation and so increase effectiveness, is a key question, and the answeris far from clear.We have been making considerable efforts recently to enhance communicationbetween different supervisors in the UK.  That has involved, as you would expect, the usualparaphernalia of Memoranda of Understanding.  But, in addition, we have sought to achievecross-membership of some of our most important institutions.  For example, Sir Andrew Large,the Chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has become a member of the Bank ofEngland’s Board of Banking Supervision and, reciprocally, I have joined the SIB.  Of courseone should not exaggerate the importance of individual appointments of this kind.  But they dohelp to create a climate of co-operation, and give a signal to the respective staffs of the twoinstitutions that they are expected to work together as closely as possible, and a signal to theoutside that they can expect this to happen.The Approach to Regulation in the UKThe discussion of regulatory approaches is often phrased in terms of rules versusjudgement or, as academics tend to put it, rules versus discretion.  Should supervisors simply setBIS Review   21/1997
- 8 -the rules, and shoot those who break them?  Or does that create too rigid a framework, onewhich stifles initiative and imagination?There is no simple answer.  The Bank of England imposes an increasing numberof rules: it has, for example, implemented detailed regimes for capital adequacy introduced bythe Basle Committee and the European Union.  We set capital requirements to cover the morereadily quantifiable risks; we enforce limits on banks’ large exposures to individualcounterparties; we have rules on banks’ liquidity; and we seek to ensure that banks have robustsystems and controls, as well as management with the skill and integrity to ensure, in thatdelightful US phrase, that the bank is ‘safe and sound’.But our judgmental approach - allowing supervisors the discretion to exerciseinformed judgement within approved guidelines - still contrasts with that of many otherregulators.  This flexibility allows us to be tough where appropriate, but to avoid inappropriaterequirements - tailoring the requirements to the nature of the bank’s activities.  Mostfundamentally, perhaps, we can ask questions, and attempt to take advantage of all theinformation at our disposal to form a judgement of the risks facing depositors and investors, aswell as of the quality of a bank’s management.  So in addition to enforcing rules and looking forproblems, we can help management.  We can spread knowledge of best practice: asking banksabout the full range of risks they face (including those - like reputational and settlement risk -that they would often rather ignore); and pointing out to complex groups the extent to whichtheir managerial and organisational systems have moved away from their legal structure.It is true that, in addition to being less rule-bound than most other supervisors, theBank is commonly viewed as doing relatively little on-site supervision.  Of course, this dependson how you define the term.  Accountants are well aware that the Bank does, for example, makeextensive use of reports prepared by auditors - who, of course, operate on-site - in order to assessthe adequacy of internal controls.  In particular, the Bank regularly instructs banks to appointreporting accountants to report on systems and controls and on the accuracy of prudentialreturns.The Bank’s supervisors also spend a growing amount of time on-site.  Since1986, Review Teams have carried out focused visits to banks to evaluate the level of risk in aninstitution as well as the risk management systems in place to identify, monitor, and controlthese risks.  And in 1995 we introduced a Traded Markets Team to focus on banks’pre-processing models which can be recognised under the CAD (Capital Adequacy Directive) aswell as sophisticated risk modelling techniques used by the banks to manage treasury activities.These teams spend on average about three days on banks’ premises, which may seem short, butthe visits are highly focused, reflecting a great deal of work carried out in advance, not justbetween team members and the line supervisors of the bank in question but also by the bankitself in providing detailed answers to a series of questions.At the same time, the Bank has recognised the need to be more systematic in itsapproach to risk assessment and has announced its intention to introduce a more formal approachbased on a common approach, known as the RATE model, to identify - using a series ofqualitative and quantitative measures - the risks faced by the bank.  RATE is an acronym for thethree stages of the process: Risk Assessment, Tools of supervision and Evaluation.BIS Review   21/1997
- 9 -In the future, by performing periodic risk assessments, we aim to gain a betterunderstanding of the quality of management, the characteristics of the business and the risks thebanks face.  The greater degree of consistency across banks embodied in the new approach willallow the Bank to be more focused in performing its supervision.  The tools of supervision, suchas Review Team Visits and Reporting Accountants Reports on internal controls, will be targetedat the areas of greater risk and concern in individual banks.  We shall very shortly be issuing aconsultation paper setting out how we plan to implement the model in practice.  That paper willshow that we have tried to model parts of our approach on best practice in the US.  The City ofLondon may not always have been a preferred habitat for camels, but you may well see somegenetically modified examples on the streets there quite soon.A better understanding of the risk profile of each supervised institution will assistthe Bank in setting risk asset ratios.  As you all know, Basle sets a minimum capital ratio of 8percent of risk weighted assets.  The 8 percent ratio is sometimes interpreted as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ standard.  The Bank, however, sets the trigger capital ratio for each authorised bank at, orabove, the 8 percent floor and considers an adjustment to that trigger ratio whenever we see asubstantial change in that bank’s risk profile.Where does this all leave us in comparison with other regulators?  I suggestedearlier that our flexible, judgmental approach is somewhat distinctive.  But we are no longer, ifindeed we ever were, outliers on the supervisory spectrum.  While the Bank has decided toimplement a more systematic approach to risk assessment, other supervisors - who traditionallyoperate a rule book - are (in a fast moving marketplace characterised by rapid productinnovation) moving towards a regime that gives more scope for supervisory judgement.But the fact that regulators internationally are converging in their approach doesnot necessarily mean that they are right.  They may all be converging on an inappropriate model.Indeed some would argue that regulators do as much to create problems as to solve them:   thatregulators create perverse incentives - even as we speak bankers may be designing productswhose whole rationale is to exploit anomalies in our rules.  Perhaps we would all be far betteremployed elsewhere, leaving the market to regulate itself.  Why should we not facilitate thatprocess by concentrating on rules of disclosure, obliging banks to publish accurate informationon their capital adequacy and risk profiles, and leaving the rest up to the market - perhaps withsome safety net for small depositors and investors?  As you know, the New Zealanders havemade an interesting move in this direction in the last couple of years.Should we then get out of the business and leave it all to the markets?  To answerthat question, it may be helpful to go back to first principles.  Back in 1958, Modigliani andMiller demonstrated that in a frictionless world a firm’s capital structure cannot affect its value.In the real world, however, departures from the M&M assumptions - such as taxes, bankruptcycosts and agency costs - may influence the capital decision of any firm; capital may after all becostly.  But banks differ substantially from most other firms because their soundness and safetyis crucial to maintaining systemic stability; without capital requirements some will exploit thisfact by taking large risks with little of their money, in the hope that the taxpayer will bail themout.  In other words, some may believe that they are (partially) insulated from potential marketdiscipline.  From a regulatory perspective, banks must therefore be required to have capital toabsorb the possible losses that result from risk-taking and still remain solvent.BIS Review   21/1997
- 10 -What is our position in this debate?  It is tempting to conclude that the onlyproblem is a perception of a government-funded safety net for large banks; remove that and ourproblems will be solved.  But systemic risk cannot be wished away as easily as that, even thoughwe in the UK have demonstrated by our actions that we do not rescue every bank which gets intoproblems.  So, while we try to stay clear from ever more detailed rules, we do not believeeverything can be left to the market; certain minimum ‘regulatory’ capital standards are in ourview necessary.  Of course, we must aim for a credible and comprehensible regime which doesnot require constant updating and elaboration, is not immensely costly, and is reasonablyconsistent.  The value-at-risk approach is an attempt in that direction.  It recognises that there isa crucial role for judgement in supervision, and that one size really will not fit all.  It does notprescribe the key qualitative factors in legalistic detail.  But it does set out the parameters so asto ensure that there is a framework in place which will deliver broad consistency and also somedegree of prudence.Some have argued that regulators should go further than the value-at-riskapproach:  rather than defining the key parameters and endorsing particular model types, whynot leave it to the banks, and give them an incentive to improve their internal models as much aspossible?  Under this pre-commitment approach a bank would specify the maximum portfolioloss on its trading activities and this would become the institution’s market risk capitalrequirement.  Banks exceeding their pre-committed maximum loss (that is breaching theircapital commitment) would be penalised in one way or another.  Such penalties could befinancial, or could entail corrective supervisory action.In some ways pre-commitment can be seen as an extension of the model-approvalapproach we already adopt.  The aim, which we endorse, is to ensure that supervisors work withthe grain of the business, and monitor ratios which are seen as meaningful by those who runbanks themselves.  To that extent, we support it.  But there are potential drawbacks.  It couldamplify the moral hazard problem:  if the bank wins, its shareholders - as well as its tradersunder their bonus packages - pocket the profit, and if it loses, the regulator/tax-payer ends upwith the bill.  A penalty would not act as a deterrent to a bank prepared to gamble its capitalbecause that bank would not be affected by such a penalty when it was ‘down and out’.Furthermore, regulators could over time become less familiar with banks’ risk managementsystems, which might make them less effective in a crisis.  Early supervisory intervention ismore difficult if supervisors only become aware of problems ex-post, after the limit has beenbreached.It may be possible to devise an approach to pre-commitment which avoids thesepotential handicaps.  But for the time being our attitude remains somewhat hesitant.Finally, a discussion about rules is not complete without touching on the questionof a ‘level playing field’; an odd analogy, I think, since in field sports there is no such thing.  Ifthere were, why would teams change ends at half time?  (In American football, of course, teamschange ends three times - and in baseball they resolve the problem by running round in circles.)When banks and securities houses do similar business it seems only fair to applysimilar capital rules.  But while this is true at the margin, when we look at the total business ofbanks and securities houses, the picture is still vastly different.  A major part of a bank’sregulatory capital is held against credit risk.  By contrast, securities houses invest primarily inliquid, marketable assets which can be readily sold, with illiquid assets typically a smallBIS Review   21/1997
- 11 -proportion of the total, generally 2% or so, and the bulk of a securities firm’s regulatory capitaltends to be maintained for market risk purposes.  It is therefore not obvious that we need to setthe same detailed rules for banks and securities houses.  That is not to say that we should entirelyignore differences in supervisory regimes, but rather that we should focus on areas where thosedifferences are on a scale which seriously distorts competition.  In other words, we should spendrather less of our time discussing risk weights, and rather more discussing risks.Globalisation and the Regulatory ResponseHow far do these general principles, which I have discussed so far in relation tothe UK, apply to regulatory structures in a global environment?One issue for supervisors is increasing globalisation.  The biggest institutions nowspan 50 or more countries and may have 300 or more entities within the group.  This is not new;globalisation in this sense has been a feature of banking certainly since the 1970s.  What israther newer is the way in which the firms are centralising the controls for all these far flungentities.  With the recognition that similar risks are being run in different subsidiaries (forexample a Japanese bank might have exposure to US interest rate risk from its activities both inLondon and New York), there has been a move to consolidate these homogeneous risks andmanage them centrally within a group.  This means control lines which transcend or cross theentity structures and a matrix management structure.  It means that the head office can exercisemuch stronger control over the volume of a particular type of risk being run across the group.For example, for some UK banks, the management of their global foreign exchange book will bemanaged in London during London office hours, then it will switch to the US operation butunder strict limits set by London; after the US close it will move again, to the Far East, but stillunder the control of limits set by London.The increasing development of whole book value at risk models has alsoencouraged this centralisation of control.  In the foreign exchange example, the value at riskmodel used by the group will be maintained and run in London.  So the riskiness of positionsacross the world wide group will be assessed according to the London model.But centralisation of controls goes even further.  Oversight of credit and keycredit risk decisions may well also be centralised.   Oversight of FX settlement risk is sometimescentralised in London as well as control of the position risk.  Likewise various aspects of theinternal audit function may well be centralised.So for global groups, the control of the activities in the various legal entitiesscattered across the planet will hinge on the adequacy of controls located not in those particularcountries but centrally.  In a way it is simply an extension of the vulnerability of banking entitiesto problems arising elsewhere in the group.  But in this case solvency of the individual entitieswill depend on the adequacy of systems and controls located in another part of the group.Massive intra-group transactions to move risk between entities will also affect the position of thevarious subsidiaries.One obvious question is why firms do not dispense with such a plethora of legalentities and operate a simpler branch structure.  The answer seems to be that differences in taxstructures and even regulatory requirements in some countries still encourage the use of legalentities in different jurisdictions.  In that case should regulators try to lean against thisBIS Review   21/1997
- 12 -centralisation?  Here I think the answer must be that the regulators should not try to discouragegreater central control of risk.  Where a firm is running one type of risk in different locations itmust make sense for the total risk to be controlled centrally.  But this does create a problem forsupervisors because supervision has to be structured along legal entity lines (given that it is legalentities which fail).  Responsibility for legal entities cannot be transferred between supervisors.Each supervisor must therefore take a view about the soundness of the entity in its jurisdiction,even where this hinges on controls located elsewhere.How have regulators responded to these trends?  In summary, they haveincreasingly sought ways of increasing co-operation amongst themselves, including agreeingtheir respective responsibilities and setting up arrangements for information sharing.  In thebanking sector, at least, they have also supplemented solo supervision of individual entities withconsolidated supervision of groups as a whole.When the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision was established by thecentral bank governors of the G10 countries at the end of 1974, its initial focus was to define therole and responsibilities of home and host supervisors of internationally active banks.  Thesewere set out in the 1975 Concordat which established how supervisory responsibility for banks’foreign branches and subsidiaries should be shared between host and parent supervisors, andwhich has been updated on a number of occasions since.Securities supervisors too have a long tradition of international co-operation,including arrangements for information sharing and mutual assistance in enforcement, withIOSCO playing a key role in facilitating such co-operation internationally.  There is also a longhistory of discussion between Basle and IOSCO.Individual supervisors in both the banking and securities industries have chosen toreinforce co-operation arrangements with formal bilateral agreements with their overseascounterparts.  Partly as a consequence, there have been an increasing number of informalmeetings between line supervisors with operational responsibility for different parts of financialgroups.The importance of international regulatory co-operation is now widelyacknowledged and is on the agenda of inter-governmental meetings.  At last June’s G7 summitin Lyon, the heads of state called for maximum progress preceding the Denver summit in June1997 on “enhancing co-operation among the authorities responsible for supervision ofinternationally active institutions, importantly by clarifying their roles and responsibilities.”Ahead of the Lyon Summit, Basle and IOSCO had announced a joint initiative to strengthen co-operation in this area, referring to the work of the Joint Forum of banking, securities andinsurance supervisors, which was set up to promote information exchange on internationalfinancial conglomerates, and consider establishing for each a lead regulator.The need for the international regulatory community to address successfully thechallenge of supervising multi-functional global financial conglomerates is an issue of particularsignificance to the UK.  This is because of the international nature of the London markets -uniquely so amongst the world’s major financial centres.  The failure of one or more majoroverseas firms may cause systemic problems in London where at the end of last year, overseasbanks accounted for 57% of the total assets of the UK monetary sector, with US bankscontributing 8%.  Furthermore, almost three quarters of the 478 banks which take deposits in theBIS Review   21/1997
- 13 -UK are branches or subsidiaries of overseas financial institutions, including 37 from the US.  USfirms have, of course, particular importance in certain markets.  Our April 1995 derivativessurvey showed US firms (including securities houses) accounting for around 40% of turnover inboth foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives.We therefore attach particular importance to international regulatory co-operation; and as the trend towards globalisation and multi-functionality continues it isbecoming increasingly necessary.  The Barings and Daiwa cases have highlighted the difficultythat banks can experience in controlling operations which are far from their head offices.Barings, in particular, demonstrated that losses in a subsidiary in a remotelocation, in a unit which was not thought to be assuming any significant market risk, can be bigenough to bring about the failure of the parent.  So home and host supervisors have a mutualinterest in the health of the subsidiaries.  Regulators will rightly be blamed if any reluctance ontheir part to work together either exacerbates a crisis or fails to prevent one that could otherwisehave been avoided.It is possible to argue that an individual regulator can successfully meet his ownobjectives, by seeking to build firewalls between his entity and the rest of the group to which itbelongs.  These might include restrictions or even prohibitions on both financial exposures andoperational interlinkages.  In addition capital adequacy and other requirements might be set at amore onerous level than if the potential for parental support was taken into account.Such measures may be the best that can be achieved at present;  they certainlyprovide host supervisors with a measure of comfort.  But they are, and always will be, a secondbest.  There will always, for example, be a risk of reputational contagion.  Counterparties mightrefuse to deal with a member of a failed group because they are unwilling to take the risk thatthe firewalls may be flawed, or that cultural or control weaknesses which led to the failure arerepeated in that entity also.  This, of course, is a hypothetical risk but one which does concernsupervisors.  Secondly, as the firm will incur additional costs in order to comply with these ring-fencing arrangements, while possibly at the same time being denied the risk reducing benefits ofgroup wide controls, it is unlikely to provide the most efficient solution.  Concern about thesedeficiencies has heightened as we have learned more about the way in which many globalfinancial groups are managed.  The lack of overlap between legal entities and the managementof business lines means that the amount of true ring-fencing which is possible for a globallymanaged institution is open to debate.The creation of ring-fenced islands of activity seems to me contrary both to thetrend in markets and second-best in terms of regulatory efficiency.  The Bank of England hasalways believed that effective supervision of financial groups must involve consolidatedsupervision.  As Alan Greenspan said last week in his testimony to the Congressional Sub-Committee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, “Risks managed on a consolidatedbasis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors”.It is important to define the term “consolidated supervision”.  The underlyingphilosophy is that for, say, a bank operating in a large financial group, it is necessary to look notonly at the soundness of the bank itself but also of the group as a whole.  This will require both aquantitative and a qualitative assessment.  The quantitative element involves examining thefinancial strength of the whole group.  The basic measures here are capital adequacy and largeBIS Review   21/1997
- 14 -exposures.  In the Bank of England, we look at these against the minimum standards set out inthe EU Directives and against the more stringent criteria which we have developed ourselves andapply to individual banking groups in ways that take account of their particular circumstances.It is worth noting that both the EU Directives and the Basle Capital Accord set these minimumstandards on a consolidated basis only.The qualitative element involves assessing factors such as the group’s riskmanagement process, internal systems and controls, capability of key personnel, culture andbusiness strategy.  Any supervisor will hardly need reminding that, in the Barings case,weaknesses in a subsidiary in just these areas brought about the collapse of the parent.As the need for consolidated supervision is written into the Basle Concordat wecan be confident that all regulators of internationally active commercial banks, including ofcourse those in the US, subscribe to its principles.Consolidated supervision is a relatively widely understood concept involving therange of activities set out above.  Alan Greenspan last week talked of “umbrella supervision”,which he described as a “realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system”.  (Ofcourse we are not experts on umbrellas:  it rarely rains in London, as you know.)But I also referred earlier to a “lead regulator” - though the term ‘co-ordinatingsupervisor’ is gaining currency in some quarters.  As noted, one of the tasks of the Joint Forumis to define the role of such a person.  So far there have been extensive discussions of the role.Among the possibilities suggested have been: Carrying out a quantitative and qualitative assessment of thegroup as a whole.  (This is the consolidated supervisor’s role and, where there is alreadya consolidated supervisor, the lead regulator would normally be the same body);b)Taking a primary role in managing emergencies should they arise;c)Acting to facilitate the exchange of information between therelevant regulators in a group;d)(In the longer term) considering ways in which supervisors’ effortscould be better co-ordinated when looking at (e.g.) controls.It should be stressed that the existence of either a lead regulator or a consolidatedsupervisor in no way affects the legal responsibilities of the individual regulatory authoritieswhich are responsible for regulating the different entities within the group.  The objective is notto shift the balance of supervisory responsibility from host to home supervisors.  Rather, theintention is that each host authority should be able to carry out these responsibilities moreeffectively by relying to some extent on the work of others.  It cannot possibly make sense for,say, 30 different supervisors to crawl over the controls centralised and concentrated in onelocation?We are keen to examine the practicability of allowing one co-ordinator to carryout the role defined above.  Enthusiasm from the US has been more muted, although commercialBIS Review   21/1997
- 15 -banks are, of course, already subjected to consolidated supervision.  Here I know there arepolitical issues at stake too, and any foreigner is well advised to tread carefully.  I would hope,nevertheless, that these important issues can be considered carefully.More problematic is the position of the US investment banking groups who,uniquely amongst the banking and securities industries in major countries, are not subject tolegislation requiring consolidated supervision.  Some have banking subsidiaries in the UK,owned by companies established under Article XII of the New York State Banking Act.Accordingly these companies and their UK subsidiaries are subject to consolidated supervisionby the New York State Banking Department.  The involvement of a home country supervisor inthis way gives us a degree of comfort which allows the ring-fencing to be less stringent than itwould otherwise be.  However this clearly falls a long way short of comprehensive consolidatedsupervision of the entire investment banking group.There is a lively debate in the US at the moment about the most appropriateregulatory structure for all financial institutions, and particularly for investment banks.  Thistends to be regarded in the US largely as an internal matter.  But the fact that the large USfinancial institutions have a global reach inevitably makes that debate a matter of great interestand concern to the international financial community.  We are optimistic that legislation willsoon be enacted to address these concerns.  It would certainly be disappointing if it is not.ConclusionsThough I have attempted this morning to identify some features of regulation onwhich we might well agree, I doubt whether there is such a thing as an ‘optimal’ regulatorystructure.  Each country has its own legacy of supervisory structures and approaches.  But anappropriate international structure is one which works as seamlessly as possible and has clearlines of responsibility (at least, that is what we expect from international banking groups’controls).  One co-ordinating regulator for each institution could play a crucial role in such astructure.  The question of the number of regulators is, in my view, less important; no one hasyet suggested we set up one body world-wide to carry out all supervision, so whatever our ownvision of an optimal regulatory structure, it will have at its centre a requirement for supervisorsfrom different disciplines and in different countries to communicate effectively with oneanother.  This weekend’s conference is a good opportunity to do that.BIS Review   21/1997
Bank of France reports industrial output continued to grow in most sectors inFrance in January 1997   BANK OF FRANCE, MONTHLY BUSINESS SURVEY, 17/2/97.In January, according to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France,industrial output continued to grow in most sectors.  Activity was especially buoyant in theintermediate goods and consumer goods sectors.  The food processing sector was alone in recording acontraction in activity.The capacity utilization rate improved.Overall demand strengthened further.  French products were very competitive onforeign markets and this led to an increase in export orders.  Export sales increased in the UnitedKingdom, Italy and Germany, while demand remained firm in the United States and Asia.  On thedomestic market, inter-industry demand was strong, even though the orders received came with veryshort delivery times in most cases.Order books are now near to normal levels.  They are still considered to be low in thefood-processing and automobile industries, but are deemed to be satisfactory in the capital goods andconsumer goods sectors.  Inventories of finished products are gradually returning to normal overall,but they still exceed the desired levels in the consumer goods, food-processing and intermediategoods sectors.The outlook for the coming months is distinctly brighter.  Activity should increase inall sectors, with marked improvements in the intermediate goods and food-processing sectors.Commodity prices were stable overall, while finished product prices declinedslightly.  This fall stemmed mainly from substantial price cuts in the automobile industry, whileprices generally held up in the other sectors.Investment plans for 1997 appear to be less ambitious on the whole compared withcapital spending plans at the same period in 1996.  Nevertheless, the business leaders polled inJanuary were more confident about future activity than they were a few months earlier.  This couldmean that previously postponed investment plans may be implemented in the coming months.However, plans for increasing output capacity remained few and far between, owing to the sparecapacity currently available, and depend on stronger growth in demand.Retail sales in January were up markedly over December 1996, and only slightlydown on the exceptionally high level recorded a year earlier.Employment levels remained stable in nearly all industrial sectors.  They showedonly a slight change in the services and retail sectors, but there were further falls in the buildingindustry.BIS Review   23/1997
Mr. George conveys his reflections on the development of bond market yieldsover recent years   Remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at theEuromoney International Bond Congress held in London on 25/2/97.I’m honoured to have been invited to open this 3rd Euromoney InternationalBond Congress.  I remember with great pleasure launching your initial Congress in October1994 in the Barbican.  It is an even greater pleasure now to launch the QEII!  That first Congresswas an ambitious and imaginative venture.  But it immediately established itself as a major eventin the international financial calendar.  I congratulate Euromoney on that achievement, and, tojudge from the program, on organising an even bigger and better Congress on this thirdoccasion.  I am delighted to welcome you all here.I remember our debate at that first Congress particularly well, Mr. Chairman.  Iremember it because I looked up my notes over the weekend!  The context then was one inwhich yields had fallen very sharply, to unusually low levels, almost everywhere during 1993only to back up just as sharply during 1994.  We concluded, I think, that none of us reallyunderstood either the earlier strength of the market or its subsequent weakness!  But we had avery enjoyable two days of discussion.One concern at the time was that we were facing a global capital shortage, withincreasing demand from the emerging, transitioning and developing countries at a time ofstrengthening economic activity and large government deficits across the industrial world.Referring generally in my remarks this morning to 10 year maturities, real yields - measured byour own indexed gilts - had indeed risen in 1994 by ¾% or more to close to 4%.  But nominalyields had risen by substantially more - by something like 2% in the major markets - reflectingincreased uncertainty no doubt, but clearly also worsening inflationary expectations.In my remarks on that occasion, I ventured to suggest that bond markets mightjust be exaggerating at least the inflationary risks, by underestimating three factors in particular:First, the commitment of governments and central banks allaround the world to disciplined macro-economic policies.Secondly, the restraining effect of both the level of realyields and of structural unemployment particularly in Europe.And thirdly, the counter-inflationary effect of globalcompetition and technological innovation.Now I seem to recollect that this suggestion was met with a degree of scepticism.That was not at all surprising.  You had all heard that sort of optimism from the authoritiesbefore!But the fact is that since around the time of that first Euromoney Congress bondyields have nevertheless trended fairly consistently lower, and are now in many cases close to oreven below the low point they had reached around the end of 1993.  Real yields, again measuredby our own indexed gilts have fallen back to a little more than 3¼%;  and the first US indexedbond issue yields much the same.  And nominal yields have fallen by 200 basis points or more incontinental Europe and Japan - though rather less in the United States and the UK.  There hasbeen more excitement in the foreign exchange market, with the dollar in particular firstweakening against the yen and the major continental currencies until the spring of 1995 and thenprogressively recovering.BIS Review   22/1997
- 2 -These developments were certainly influenced by the factors which I mentioned amoment ago.  In particular they have been influenced by the continuing broadly-basedconsensus - in countries all around the world, and across a large part of the political spectrumwithin countries - on the importance of macro-economic policy discipline.Macro-economic policy is no longer seen as an instrument for short-term demandmanagement, which can be used to trade-off the conflicting demands of growth and stability inthe short run.  It is now much more widely understood and accepted that the rate of growth thatcan be sustained, or the level of employment that can be achieved and maintained in anythingother than the short run, depend fundamentally on the structural, supply-side, characteristics ofthe economy, and not just on the level of demand.  So today’s orthodoxy ascribes tomacro-economic policy the job of keeping demand in line with the capacity of the economy tomeet that demand in the medium and longer term.Within this overall framework, monetary policy is allocated the specific task ofachieving and maintaining effective price stability.  This is not, as some commentators still seemto suggest, simply some doctrinaire end in itself.  Inflation is seen rather as a symptom ofimbalance between demand and supply in the economy.  So what we are essentially aiming to dothrough monetary policy is to anticipate the emergence of that imbalance and head it off beforeit becomes entrenched.  If we are successful in that, inflation will be lower, there will be lessneed for violent interest rate movements than in the past, and the economy will grow at asteadier, and more sustainable and predictable, rate.  That, in turn, will encourage more rational,longer-term, economic decision-making and investment, which will help indirectly to improveunderlying, supply-side, performance.Similarly, today’s macro-economic orthodoxy requires fiscal policy to be directedto restricting government borrowing to levels that can be sustained into the medium and longerterm, without either forcing up real yields or implying the prospective need for progressivelyrising tax rates - which could otherwise damage the development of private sector economicactivity.Now in some respects we have made considerable progress over the past twoyears and more.  Inflation in many countries - including virtually all the industrial countries butnot confined to them - is now consistently lower than it has been for ages.  That in itself hascontributed to lower interest rates and to the lower nominal bond yields that I have described.But, in addition to that, fiscal consolidation, which has lowered the combined governmentdeficits of the G7 countries from around $600 billion in 1994 to around $540 billion last year,has helped to reduce real yields, notwithstanding the continuing demand for capital from thedeveloping world.  And the really good news is that this macro-economic discipline has beenaccompanied by sustained economic expansion, with world GDP as a whole growing at anannual rate of some 3½ - 4%.Now of course there have been quite marked differences in the performance ofindividual countries within this overall picture.  Some of the transition economies have seen abrutal contraction of output which is only now beginning to stabilise.  And there have beenmarked fluctuations in the growth rates of some of the emerging countries.  Growth in parts ofAsia, for example, is now moderating, cyclically, to a more sustainable pace, while parts ofLatin America continue to recover from the set-back they suffered two years ago.Among the industrial countries, too, economic developments have diverged overthe past two years.  In the United States and in this country, for example, inflation has beenBIS Review   22/1997
- 3 -contained to around 3% with continuing growth and low or falling unemployment.  And thispattern looks set to continue.  In Japan and on the Continent of Europe, on the other hand, whileinflation has been even lower, activity has been disappointingly weak, and unemployment on theContinent at least has risen to quite frightening levels.  And while there is now the prospect of amoderate pick-up in activity in these countries, that is not yet assured.  Japan, which is in manyrespects a unique case, faces substantial fiscal consolidation.  And in Europe, too, the prospectsare clouded by pressure to bring budget deficits down sufficiently to meet the Maastrichtconvergence criteria this year, notwithstanding the weakness of the domestic economies, and inan environment of longer term structural inflexibility.These divergent developments go a long way towards explaining recentdifferences in the behaviour of both bond markets and exchange rates.In both the United States and the United Kingdom the sustained expansion ofdomestic demand and of ouput has generated market expectations of an essentially cyclical risein short-term interest rates.  Sluggish economic activity elsewhere, on the other hand, means notonly that short-term interest rates are significantly lower in Japan and the core Europeancountries;  but it also means that they are thought, by the market, to be less immediately likely torise.  This cyclical difference in the short-term interest rate prospect largely explains thepronounced yield differential between the US and the UK and the other countries at the veryshort end of the curve.  Out to 2 years, for example, whereas yields in the US and UK are within½% either side of 6%, yields in Germany and France are below 3½%, and they are below ½% inJapan.  These differences in the short-term interest rate prospects feed through into yielddifferentials on longer term bonds, and changes in them also help to explain the recentmovements in exchange rates.But rather more interesting is the relative slopes of the yield curves further ahead,US and UK yields are only about 1% above present short-term yields,  at +/-7%;  but they are3% or more above present short term yields in Germany and France, also at +/-7%;  and they are3% higher than short-term yields even in Japan, at 3¾%.  The implication is that, if you abstractfrom immediate cyclical influences, longer-term economic performance - and particularlyperformance with respect to inflation - is not expected to be very different between the majorcountries, though Japan remains an outlier.It is difficult to know what interpretation to put on this observation.  The fact thatthe yield curves in Germany and France are practically identical is consistent at least with EMUgoing ahead - at least with a narrow membership.  But the steep rise in implied future yields fiveyears ahead suggests that inflation is expected to be higher in the medium term.  That could beassociated with expectations of softer macro-economic discipline, perhaps more specificallyreflecting market uncertainty about EMU in the light of the ongoing debate about prospectivemembership and about how far the ECB will in practice be free to pursue its statutory task ofmaintaining price stability.  It may, on the other hand, simply reflect some kind of marketimperfection.The same analysis can be applied to Italy and Spain, for example, to try to assessmarket expectations about their possible membership of EMU as part of the first wave.  It showsthat notwithstanding the recent falls in short-term interest rates in those countries - which canlargely be explained by their improved economic performance - 5 years forward yields remainsignificantly higher than those in Germany and France suggesting that early EMU membershipis not at all certain in the eyes of the markets.BIS Review   22/1997
- 4 -What can we conclude from all this, Mr. Chairman?  Well, the conclusions that Idraw are essentially threefold and hardly very surprising.I conclude, first, that markets at present are reasonably persuaded that the worldeconomy as a whole will remain relatively stable at least by comparison with much of the postwar period.  Excluding short-term influences, bond yields in the major countries - apart from thespecial case of Japan - are converging around a level of around 7% which suggests that relativemacro-economic, monetary and fiscal discipline will be sustained, though it will stop short ofeffective price stability.I conclude, secondly, that the markets see current developments in the US and theUK as essentially cyclical;  and that they anticipate a pick-up in activity elsewhere somewhatfurther ahead.And I conclude, thirdly, that there remains some considerable uncertainty aboutthe prospect for European Monetary Union, in particular about its initial membership but alsoabout the extent of the discipline it will involve.Now, of course, these conclusions are based on the bond markets as they currentlyare, which is a bit like forecasting the past!  What you really need to know is how the marketswill evolve in the future.  Happily it is not my task to venture down that path.  It is during ournext session that the market experts will seek to “forecast the future”.  But I do hope they willtell us whether they agree that relative stability will indeed persist, in the medium and longerterm, how they see the different national situations evolving in the more immediate future, andwhat prospects they see for EMU.  These seem to me to be the key issues for the future and Ilook forward to listening to what they have to say.BIS Review   22/1997
Bank of Japan’s February review of monetary and economic trends in JapanBANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 18/2/97.A moderate economic recovery continues in Japan as private demand showsincreasing firmness.  With respect to final demand, public-sector investment has decreased whilenet exports are on an increasing trend.  Housing investment has remained at a high level andbusiness fixed investment is increasing steadily.  While growth in personal consumption hasbeen moderate on the whole, passenger car sales, which have a strong influence on production,have accelerated significantly.  Meanwhile, inventories on the whole are at appropriate levels.In these circumstances, industrial production has recently increased at a somewhat fast pace andlabor market conditions have continued to improve moderately.  Meanwhile, prices have stoppeddeclining, and monetary aggregates continue to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent.With regard to personal consumption, sales at department stores and supermarketsare improving moderately, albeit with some fluctuations.  Outlays for travel have remained firm.Growth in sales of electrical appliances has become somewhat moderate as the pace ofexpansion in personal computers and cellular telephones decelerated.  Passenger car sales haverecorded buoyant two-digit growth year-to-year for four consecutive months since October1996.Among leading indicators of business fixed investment, machinery orders areincreasing steadily on average, although they are expected to show a decline in the first quarterof 1997 as a reaction to the large increase recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996 in both themanufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.  Construction floor area has also continued topick up moderately.With respect to housing investment, housing starts have remained strongreflecting low interest rates and reasonable housing prices.  They recorded a highseasonally-adjusted annual rate of over 1.7 million starts in the fourth quarter of 1996, partlyreflecting the rise in orders ahead of the consumption tax rate hike.Regarding public-sector investment, public works contracted showingdevelopments in orders have decreased significantly since autumn 1996 compared to the highlevel recorded in the previous year which reflected the large economic stimulus package.  As foractual implementation of public works, with a time lag after orders, the seasonally adjusted levelof shipments of related goods has been decreasing since autumn 1996 after having increaseduntil the summer.Real exports have recently shown an increasing trend as the effects of the yen’sdepreciation since summer 1995 have gradually permeated.  Meanwhile, the increase in realimports has slowed, also reflecting the depreciation of the yen.  As a result, the real trade surplusturned to an increase in autumn 1996.  The nominal current account surplus is also beginning torise, although the pace of increase is slower than that of the real trade surplus, partly because therise in oil prices is pushing up import volume.Industrial production has increased significantly by an annual rate of over 10 percent quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter of 1996.  This increase was caused by the rise infinal demand, particularly in demand conducive to production, such as passenger car sales,machinery orders, and net exports, in addition to the completion of inventory adjustments.Industrial production is expected to continue increasing significantly in January and February1997, reflecting the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate hike.BIS Review   20/1997
- 2 -Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately on the whole.Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth has beenmoderate, overtime working hours have significantly exceeded the level of the previous year inline with production growth, and the ratio of job offers to job applications has continued its rise.With respect to price developments, domestic wholesale prices (adjusted forseasonal electricity rates) have stopped declining, although downward pressures such as fromcompetition with imports and technological innovation in, e.g., electrical machinery, remainstrong.  This development has been supported by the yen’s depreciation to date, the rise in crudeoil prices and the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions.  Corporateservice prices have declined, particularly in rents and leasing charges, but the year-to-yeardecrease has become smaller.  Consumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables) haveexceeded the level of the previous year, as the decline in commodity prices has slowed againstthe background of the yen’ depreciation and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices.Growth in monetary aggregates, measured in terms of the year-to-year growthrate of M2 + CDs average outstanding, has remained stable on the whole at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent.Although lending by private financial institutions has been weak, that by public financialinstitutions has been firm.Regarding money market rates, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) on thewhole has stayed somewhat below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent.  The 3-month CDrate has moved at 0.50 - 0.55 per cent.  Meanwhile, with regard to the market ’s interest rateexpectations, 3-month Euro-yen futures are showing relatively minor movements after decliningat a brisk pace between summer and autumn 1996.  In these circumstances, the long-termgovernment bond yield had been declining since summer 1996, and has recently moved ataround 2.4 per cent.With respect to bank lending rates, the short-term prime lending rate hasremained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995.  The long-term primelending rate was lowered three times by a total of 0.8 percentage points since September 1996 inresponse to the developments in the long-term interest rates, and has been moving at the recordlow of 2.5 per cent since December.  In these circumstances, short-term and long-term averagecontracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at around record low levels.On the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average plummeted between the endof 1996 and early 1997 reflecting market’s uncertainties about Japan’s economic outlook andbalance-sheet problems.  It became stable in late January 1997 and has recently stayed around¥18,000 - 19,000.In the foreign exchange market, the yen depreciated moderately on the wholeagainst the U.S. dollar in 1996, but the pace of depreciation has accelerated since the end of1996.  The yen has recently moved at around ¥123 - 124 to the U.S. dollar.  Meanwhile, the yenhas been relatively stable against the deutsche mark at around ¥73 - 74.BIS Review   20/1997
Mr. McDonough assesses the role of the central bank in ensuring a stableprice and financial environment and fostering sustainable growth   Remarks by thePresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. William J. McDonough, at the Societyof Investment Analysts in Dublin on 11/2/97.I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the Society of InvestmentAnalysts here in Ireland, home of my forebears. In my remarks this evening, I want to say a fewwords on a topic of great importance to both our professions: the role of central banks inensuring a stable price and financial environment, and fostering sustainable growth. I would alsolike to offer some thoughts on the importance of a safe and sound banking system for the well-being of the economy.As members of the financial community, we all recognize the importance of pricestability to the successful long-run performance of the economy. Indeed, there now seems to bea worldwide convergence of views among central bankers and investors alike on the importanceof price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. For me personally, stable prices havealways been the prism for making monetary policy decisions.As I see it, price stability must be viewed in a long-run context as an ongoinggoal, not a one-time objective. That goal requires monetary policy to be oriented beyond thehorizon of its immediate or near-term impact on inflation and the economy. The primarypurpose of near-term policy actions should be to set the economy on a long-term, permanentpath to price stability and sound economic growth.This orientation puts the focus of policy on inflation expectations over the longterm -- the time horizon that is appropriate for most saving and investment decisions. Businessesand households are understandably concerned about the long-term consequences of inflation andprice level uncertainty. This is the frame of reference reflected in the conceptual definition ofprice stability offered by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan -- that pricestability is achieved when people do not consider inflation a factor in their business andeconomic decisions.Long-term inflation expectations must be anchored to a transparent and rigorouscommitment by the central bank to a well-defined standard of price stability, and unavoidabledeviations from the goal of price stability must be explained with reference to that standard.In my view, price stability is a means to an end -- the promotion of sustainableeconomic growth. Only with long-term price stability can the economy expect to achieve themaximum levels of productivity and living standards.Price stability is both important and desirable because a rising price level, even atmoderate rates, imposes substantial economic costs on society. These costs emanate from avariety of sources, including:-increased uncertainty about the outcome of business decisions andprofitability;-adverse effects on the cost of capital resulting from the interaction ofinflation with the tax system;-reduced effectiveness of the price and market systems; and-distortions that create perverse incentives to engage in nonproductiveactivities.BIS Review   17/1997
- 2 -As a former commercial banker, I am especially aware of the negative effects ofone particular type of nonproductive activity induced by inflation’s distortion of incentives -- theoverinvestment of resources in the financial sector. It is well known that, in high-inflationeconomies, the resources diverted from productive activities to nonproductive financialtransactions are enormous. But even moderate inflation rates can cause substantial diversion tononproductive financial activities, and this diversion deserves greater attention than it oftenreceives in economists’ list of the costs of inflation.As I look back over the last ten years or so, I am pleased that the Federal Reserveand many other central banks have been successful in controlling price pressures and puttinginflation on a long-run downward track. Success in dealing with inflation clearly enhances thecredibility of monetary policy and policy makers.From my perspective, the continuing challenge for central banks is to ensurelong-term credibility for monetary policy by sustaining low inflation environments. Centralbanks are generally better able to meet this challenge if they are substantially immunized fromshort-term political pressures, and are firmly committed to price stability as the overriding goalof monetary policy.Empirical research in recent years has shown that both the average rate ofinflation and its variability tend to decline in tandem with increased independence for centralbanks. This is why so many governments, including those among the emerging marketeconomies, have been providing their central banks with increased autonomy. Of course, it ispossible to have low inflation or price stability even with a limited degree of legal central bankindependence, but the record clearly shows that a country is more likely to have low inflation ifits central bank is independent. One important reason for this is that the fiscal authorities inmany countries have not proven to be highly disciplined.Of course, some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goalof monetary policy means that central banks would no longer be concerned about output or jobgrowth. I believe this view simply is wrong. A stable price and financial environment almostcertainly enhances the capacity of monetary policy to fight occasions of cyclical weakness in theeconomy.A central bank’s commitment to price stability over the longer term does notmean that monetary policy can ignore the short-term impact of economic events. It is importantto recognize that, even when an economy is set on the path to price stability, and priceexpectations are contained, it does not necessarily mean that all potential sources of inflationaryshocks have been eliminated.Moreover, while there is no long-run trade-off between unemployment, or output,and inflation, both formal evidence and common sense observation on wage and price rigiditiesattest to the existence of such a trade-off in the short run. In the long run, however, monetarypolicy’s impact is only on inflation; potential output primarily is determined by advances intechnology, growth in human and physical capital and other real resources.Because of the uncertainty about the timing and significance of short-termmonetary policy effects on economic activity, as well as all other uncertainties concerning theeconomy, there are always differences of view about the speed with which policy should beadjusted, and on the balance of risks in dealing with ongoing economic developments. Theseconflicts become more marked when an economy confronts supply shocks that drive up pricesBIS Review   17/1997
- 3 -sharply and suddenly -- such as the two oil shocks of the 1970s. In those circumstances, frommy perspective, the appropriate course, consistent with maintaining longer term price stability,should be to bring inflation down somewhat gradually, as the economy adjusts to the shift inrelative prices.As I see it, monetary policy must be formulated cautiously, and cannot ignorebusiness cycle developments. In establishing price stability as the primary goal of monetarypolicy, therefore, it is best to recognize that monetary policy does affect output in the short run.A central bank can appropriately be assigned the task of promoting sustainable economicgrowth, while maintaining long-term price stability and ensuring the health of the financialsystem. This way of articulating policy goals has the advantage of meeting the public’s need tounderstand the basis for monetary policy decisions, and may help, therefore, to enhance thedemocratic accountability of monetary policy.Once monetary policy is firmly committed to price stability, how can a centralbank best reach that goal? Clearly, at an operational level, no single formula or implementationstrategy can be expected to succeed in all countries and under all circumstances; possibleapproaches can take many different forms. The choices depend on a country’s history, economicconditions, traditions and institutions. But all successful approaches share two importantfeatures: first, they focus on a long-term time horizon and, second, they provide a clear andpublic standard for the assessment of policy.What is most significant is not the specific way a central bank chooses to seekprice stability, but rather the underlying commitment to that goal.While monetary policy aimed at long-run price stability is critical to fosteringsustainable economic growth, central banks’ role in promoting growth and, more generally, ahealthy economy goes beyond the conduct of monetary policy. Through involvement infinancial regulation and supervision, as well as in the oversight of payments system operations,central banks play a key role in preserving and enhancing the safety and soundness of thebanking and financial system.All of these central bank functions are mutually dependent and, together,highlight the fact that the structure and workings of the banking system are integral to acountry’s financial stability and economic growth. Clearly, monetary policy cannot succeed inits mission if the underlying financial system is unstable.The importance of an efficient, safe and sound banking and financial system for acountry’s long-term economic prospects cannot be overstated. In any market economy, thebanking and financial system plays a central role in mobilizing a society’s savings and inchanneling these savings into investment and other productive uses. This intermediation processis one of the core determinants of the pace of a country’s economic development. Moreover, thebanking and financial system must facilitate transactions in an economy by ensuring that theycan be effected safely and swiftly on an ongoing basis. Both buyers and sellers of goods andservices must have confidence that instruments used to make payments will be honored andaccepted by all parties.These crucial functions of transforming savings into productive uses and makingpayments are often taken for granted. But, in fact, it can be difficult to ensure that the legal andinstitutional framework within which these functions are performed is consistent with the oftenconflicting goals of free choice, economic efficiency, safety and financial market stability.BIS Review   17/1997
- 4 -Experience has proven that there is no easy way to shape financial institutions in a manner thatappropriately balances these goals under changing economic conditions.Today, numerous countries -- including Ireland and the United States -- areconsidering which paths to follow in reforming and modernizing their banking industries. Thesedeliberations are of great importance, because a well-functioning and stable banking andfinancial system is a critical foundation for long-run growth and prosperity of an economy. Andsuch reform is inevitably difficult, for reasons which are a classic blend of political andeconomic considerations rooted in the crucial functions the banking system must perform in amarket economy.Moreover, banking system reform is made all the more challenging by the factthat such reforms cannot be viewed in isolation from reforms in the central bank, or independentof those in the capital markets. In fact, the greatest challenge may lie in forging these individualpieces in such a way that they fit together in a cohesive whole that serves the dictates of stability,growth, and public confidence.For a financial system to mobilize and allocate a society’s savings successfullyand facilitate day-to-day transactions, there must be a class of financial institutions andinstruments that the public views as safe and convenient outlets for its savings. Of course, thesingle dominant class of institution that performs this crucial dual role as repository of a largepart of society’s liquid savings, and the entity through which payments are made is thecommercial bank. This is true even in countries with highly developed capital markets,especially when it is kept in mind that participants in the capital markets rely heavily on thebanking system for their financing facilities.Banks cannot play an effective role in the financial intermediation process unlessthe public has the utmost confidence in the banking system. This confidence is a key reason whybanking institutions and banking instruments are crucial to a country’s economic growth anddevelopment. The combination of functions typically provided by commercial banks, however,also carries with it the risk that a loss of confidence in an individual institution can spread to thesystem as a whole, the so-called systemic risk phenomenon.Instances in which a country experiences a loss of confidence in its financialinstitutions usually result in major damage to the economy. Given the indispensable role thatfinancial institutions play in the success of a country’s economy, governments clearly have aresponsibility to subject financial institutions to some form of regulation or oversight.But here again, there is need for balance. Restrictions placed on banks by thefinancial oversight apparatus cannot be allowed to discourage risk-taking per se, becauserisk-taking is an inherent part of banking and finance in market economies. To performsuccessfully, a commercial banking system requires a delicate balance between risk-taking andmaintaining public confidence. Because of the importance and the difficulties inherent in thebalancing act, banking systems are generally subject to a higher degree of official oversight andregulation than are most other forms of private enterprise, and supported by some form of abroad safety net.While the specifics can differ appreciably across countries, these safety nets areusually constructed along similar lines. They generally include oversight of the affairs ofbanking institutions in the form of inspection and examination of the institutions for compliancewith a broad set of safety and soundness standards; some type of protection against losses forBIS Review   17/1997
- 5 -small depositors and investors; and some form of emergency liquidity facility for bankinginstitutions and, occasionally, for other financial institutions as well. Finally, the paymentssystem, a crucial link in any financial system, generally includes some form of officialregulation of or participation in its operations.These important aspects of the safety net often feed into one or more of thefunctions performed by central banks. For this reason, the central bank usually plays a majorrole in the operation of one or more of these facets of the safety net. For example, the emergencyliquidity facility is almost always the discount window of the central bank. In many countries --including Ireland and the United States -- the central bank also plays an important role in thesupervision of banking institutions and in the oversight of payments system operations.The important role played by the central bank in helping to build and maintainconfidence in the underlying stability of the financial system in turn implies that there must be ahigh degree of public confidence in the central bank itself. This brings me back full circle:achieving and maintaining that public confidence depends first and foremost on the success ofthe central bank in discharging its monetary policy responsibilities. A sound economy and soundmoney are virtually synonymous, which is why monetary policy stands at the center of centralbank functions.The importance of monetary policy is also the reason why central banks needspecial independent status within the governments they serve. In my view, it is particularlycritical that the central bank not be directly responsible for financing government budgetdeficits; such a responsibility can, over time, compromise the financial integrity of the centralbank, and thereby, public confidence in it. Note, however, that even without any involvement indirect financing of government budget deficits, central banks have a major stake in thedevelopment and maintenance of a smoothly-functioning government securities market, whichcan provide substantial benefits to the economy beyond those emanating from private sectorfinancing of government budget deficits.In closing, I want to stress that the commitment to price stability as the primarygoal of monetary policy in no way implies that the health of the economy or of the financialsystem should be sacrificed. On the contrary, what is important to bear in mind is that byensuring a stable price and financial environment, the central bank helps foster economicgrowth.I believe that no central bank can maintain price stability over the longer termwithout public support for the necessary policies. Only with the confidence of the public in theirpolicies and their own lasting dedication to non-inflationary growth together with awell-functioning financial system can central banks succeed in achieving and maintaining priceand financial stability.BIS Review   17/1997
Dr. Stals looks at the options and strategies for monetary policy in SouthAfrica   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. C.S. Stals, at theTwentieth Annual Investment Conference of Société Générale Frankel Pollak (Pty) Ltd. inJohannesburg on 18/2/97.1. A sharp decline in the net capital inflow from abroad set the financial scene for 1996The most important change in the financial situation in South Africa last year wasthe sudden decline in the net inflow of capital from abroad that occurred in the first quarter. Anumber of adverse developments at the time combined to trigger an outflow of short-termcapital. Coming after three years of rather strong rises in total domestic expenditure and agrowing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, the deterioration in the capitalaccount led to an overall balance of payments deficit that created immediate shortages in themarket for foreign exchange.After a record net capital inflow of more than R6 billion occurred in the fourthquarter of 1995, to bring the total net inflow for the year close to R20 billion, there was a smallnet outflow in the first quarter of 1996. The current account deficit was no longer covered by anet capital inflow and the exchange rate of the rand came under immediate pressure. With a lowlevel of official foreign reserves, a growing deficit in the current account of the balance ofpayments and deteriorating prospects for a renewed inflow of capital into the country,participants in the market for foreign exchange became very nervous and reacted wildly torumours, adverse political developments and negative news about the balance of payments, theforeign reserves, and domestic economic developments.The initial depreciation of the rand created negative expectations which becameself-fulfilling, particularly as leads and lags in short-term trade financing also moved stronglyagainst South Africa, and South Africans became more reluctant to enter into new foreigncurrency denominated commitments.The exchange rate of the rand, which in nominal terms showed an effectiveappreciation of 4.4 per cent from May 1995 up to the end of December 1995, then depreciatedby 8 per cent in the first quarter of 1996, by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter, and by a further9.5 per cent in the four months up to the end of October 1996. Over the first ten months of 1996,the effective depreciation of the rand in nominal terms exceeded 22 per cent. In real terms, thisrepresented a depreciation of about 15 per cent.An ex post analysis of the composition of the capital in- and outflows of last yearprovides interesting information for a better understanding of the changes that took place.Initially, it was mainly a sudden reversal in the inflow of short-term capital in the form ofinter-bank and trade related financing arrangements that triggered the shortages in the market forforeign exchange. As the exchange rate depreciated and South African residents became moreconcerned about possible losses on foreign currency exposures, long-term foreign loans wererepaid without replacement or extensions. South Africans with existing short- and long-termforeign currency commitments covered their positions forward, and the Reserve Bank’s forwardexchange book showed a sharp increase of the net oversold position. In the fourth quarter of lastyear, when short-term capital began to flow back again, there was a net outflow from the privatesector of R6 billion in the form of longer-term capital, mostly for the repayment of maturingloans.BIS Review   19/1997
- 2 -Another interesting feature of the international capital flows last year was thatforeigners remained important net portfolio investors in South African securities. Non-residentsincreased their holdings of South African equities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange byR5.3 billion, and added a net amount of R3.4 billion to their holdings of South African bondsacquired through the South African bond market. This ostensibly “volatile” element of thecapital flows was therefore not responsible for the problems that developed in the South Africanbalance of payments last year.2. Monetary policy faced with new challenges in a situation of a deteriorating balance ofpaymentsThe abrupt decline in the capital inflows from abroad in the first quarter of 1996confronted the monetary policy authorities with an unexpected new challenge. Since 1994, theReserve Bank’s policy on international financial relations was to rebuild the country’s depletedofficial foreign reserves gradually, to relax the exchange controls on a step-by-step basis, and torestructure the market in foreign exchange gradually with the objective of enabling a moreefficient market to determine not only the spot foreign exchange rate of the rand, but also theforward rate.Good progress was made on this road during 1994 and 1995, but the country wassurely not yet in a position to withstand the adverse developments of early 1996, or to protectthe exchange rate of the rand against a series of determined attacks in a rather vulnerablesituation. The Reserve Bank realised that it was not in a position to defend the exchange rate ofthe rand by providing large amounts of foreign exchange from the official foreign reserves. Atthe time of the dramatic decline in the net capital inflow in February 1996, the Reserve Bankheld about R15 billion in official foreign reserves, while the private banking sector held anadditional amount of about R4 billion in liquid foreign assets. The total of R19 billion was theequivalent of about 8 weeks’ imports. Taking account of the growing deficit in the currentaccount of the balance of payments, the Bank could only make limited amounts of foreignexchange available to ensure that no serious shortage of liquidity would develop that couldcreate a panic on its own.The longer-term objectives of building up the foreign reserves to a morecomfortable level, of reducing the role of the Reserve Bank in the forward foreign exchangemarket, and of phasing out the remaining foreign exchange controls were temporarily forced onthe backburner, whilst monetary policy had to be directed more decisively towards anadjustment programme that would gradually restore stability in the market for foreign exchange.3. The monetary policy adjustment programmeThree basic deficiencies in the underlying economic fundamentals were identifiedat the time that contributed to the lack of confidence in the South African economy, and in theability of the South African authorities to restore stability in the market for foreign exchange.Firstly, the growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments hadto be reversed, particularly after it became evident that the country could not rely on apermanent and sustainable large capital inflow from the rest of the world to cover an ever-increasing current deficit.Secondly, the imminent danger of escalating inflation, particularly after somedepreciation in the exchange rate of the rand, had to be avoided.

- 3 -danger that South Africa was destined for a new vicious circle of depreciation-inflation-depreciation that would unavoidably lead to a further erosion of the country’s competitiveposition in the world markets.Thirdly, the escalating growth rates in the domestic monetary aggregates, such asthe money supply and bank credit extension, had to be reversed. By accommodating the newinflationary pressures emanating from the depreciation of the rand on a continuous basis,monetary policy would obviously aggravate the situation.With only limited means at its disposal to finance the external deficit, SouthAfrica had no alternative but to adjust the disequilibrium, mainly by reducing or eliminating thecurrent account deficit. To achieve this objective, the following monetary policy strategy wasfollowed:Not being in a position to fix the exchange rate at any predetermined level, adepreciation of the rand was unavoidable and had to be accepted as part of the solution to theproblem. The Bank sold some foreign exchange from its official reserves, not with the intentionto fix the exchange rate, but rather to provide liquidity to the market and to smooth theadjustment process.  As the Reserve Bank sold foreign exchange to the market to partly financethe overall balance of payments deficit, domestic rand liquidity was drained from the bankingsystem. It was imperative for the effective working of the adjustment process that the ReserveBank would not replace the lost liquidity through, for example, purchases of financial assetsfrom the banks through more active open-market operations.  The decline in the domesticliquidity had to be reflected in the level of interest rates. Higher interest rates would not onlyserve to discourage the outflow of capital, but would also reduce the domestic demand for bankcredit. The market trend for interest rates to rise could not be resisted.Monetary policy was therefore directed towards a reinforcement of and activesupport for a market adjustment process that would eventually restore equilibrium to the balanceof payments. It was well understood that this process would not be painless, that the depreciationof the currency, the drainage of liquidity and the rising interest rates would all demand costs andsacrifices that would not be popular, and that the monetary authorities would be blamed by someill-disposed observers for the dilemma. Any country that had established a good economicperformance in one year on the basis of net capital inflow of R20 billion, and is then in the nextyear forced to perform on a net inflow of only R4 billion, is bound to go through some painfuladjustment. South Africa was no exception.4. The success of the monetary adjustment programmeImportant changes took place towards the end of last year, and particularly afterOctober, in the underlying economic conditions that contributed to the financial disturbances ofthe preceding nine months.There was a marked slow-down in the rate of increase in real gross domesticexpenditure. Official national accounts statistics for the fourth quarter are not yet available, butpreliminary indications are that all the major components of gross domestic expenditureincreased at lower rates in the second half than in the first half of last year. Total real grossdomestic expenditure indeed declined somewhat from the first half to bring the rate of increasefor the year more or less in line with the established growth rate of about 3 per cent in grossdomestic product.  The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments progressivelyBIS Review   19/1997
- 4 -declined from a seasonally adjusted annualised peak of R13 billion in the second quarter toabout R9 billion in the third, and R5 billion in the fourth quarter of the year.  The rates ofincrease in both bank credit extension to the private sector and in the money supply peaked inOctober 1996, before declining marginally in both November and December. Thequarter-to-quarter growth in credit extension to the private sector (at seasonally adjusted andannualised rates), decelerated from 22.4 per cent in the second quarter of 1996 to 16.6 per centin the third quarter, and 11.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. In the case of the M3 money supply,the deceleration was from 21.2 per cent in the second, to 18.6 per cent in the third, and a mere7.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Not only the current account of the balance of paymentsimproved, but also the capital account. In the first nine months of the year, capital inflows andoutflows almost cancelled out, to leave a small net inflow of less than R1 billion for the ninemonths’ period. In the fourth quarter, however, the net capital inflow increased again to anestimated R3 billion. This capital inflow once again exceeded the unadjusted current accountdeficit with the result that the country’s net foreign reserves recovered some of the losses of thefirst nine months of the year.  The pressure in the foreign exchange market receded slightly andthe rand started appreciating in November last year. Over the two months November andDecember 1996, the effective nominal exchange rate of the rand appreciated by 1 per cent, andduring the first six weeks of 1997 by a further 9.2 per cent. This appreciation therefore partlyneutralised the adverse effects of the sharp depreciation of last year.It will, of course, not only be premature but also preposterous to claim thesuccesses achieved in this process so far for monetary policy alone. Many other changes alsotook place in South Africa over the past year. There is now more political stability than a yearago; much progress has been made with the framing and implementation of the Government’sMacroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR); the Minister ofFinance has confirmed and showed his determination to continue with the required policy offinancial discipline that will gradually reduce the deficit in the Budget as a percentage of grossdomestic product.There is, however, still the danger of escalating inflation that cannot be sweptunder the carpet at this juncture. After reaching an acceptable low level of only 5.5 per cent overthe twelve months up to April 1996, the rate of increase in the consumer price index escalated to9.4 per cent in December 1996. Inflation, however, lags behind changes in the monetaryaggregates and is, at this stage, still stimulated by the depreciation of the rand last year, and therelatively large increases in the money supply during the 1995/96 period. It is of the utmostimportance, however, that a restrictive monetary policy shall now be retained to make sure thatthe rate of inflation will also gradually be tamed again.5. Monetary policy options for 1997It remains the main task and priority of monetary policy in South Africa to fightagainst inflation. During 1996, the disturbances in the foreign exchange market temporarilydiverted the attention from this prime objective of monetary policy. Indeed, in the longer term,greater stability in the foreign exchange market will only become sustainable once the rate ofinflation has been brought more or less in line with the average rate of inflation in the economiesof our major trading partners and international competitors.Despite the periodic efforts of media reporters to extort a commitment from theauthorities to a certain pre-defined exchange rate for the rand, it remains our view that in thecontemporary complex market for foreign exchange, it is not possible to define an equilibriumexchange rate a priori, or, in the case of the South African Reserve Bank, with the limitedBIS Review   19/1997
- 5 -amount of foreign exchange at its disposal, to manipulate the exchange rate of the randpermanently in any direction against market forces.As far as the Bank’s policy on foreign exchange is concerned, it is hoped that themore favourable conditions now experienced in the market will continue throughout 1997, andwill enable us to pursue the longer-term objectives of:building up the total foreign reserves to a more comfortable level;  reducing theReserve Bank’s role in the forward foreign exchange market; and  gradually phasing out theremaining exchange controls.To the extent that these three objectives provide conflicts within themselves,important policy decisions will have to be taken between the Bank and the Minister of Financeon the relative importance that should be attached to each one of the objectives in an appropriatepolicy matrix.With the attention now being refocused on domestic policy objectives, the risingrate of inflation has become a matter of major concern. In this situation, the Reserve Bankregards it as a minimum precondition for arresting this imminent threat to financial stability thatthe rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply will be reduced soon tomore acceptable levels.With the prospects for real growth in the economy at a rate of between 2 and 3per cent, and the desire to keep inflation to below 10 per cent, the money supply shouldobviously not increase by more than about 10 per cent during the current calendar year. This willrequire the Reserve Bank to persist with a relatively restrictive monetary policy for the timebeing.BIS Review   19/1997
Mr. Lamfalussy looks at the progress achieved by the Hungarian economy inrecent years   Address by the President of the European Monetary Institute, Mr. AlexandreLamfalussy, at a conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association on the occasion ofthe 10th anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system and held inBudapest on 7/2/97.For at least three reasons, I have accepted with pleasure the invitation to sharesome thoughts with you on the occasion of these tenth anniversary celebrations.First, for obvious personal reasons, I enjoy spending some time in Hungary - evenif it is only for less than a day.Second, I am absolutely convinced that an efficient financial system in general,and an efficient banking system in particular, together comprise an indispensable preconditionfor the proper functioning of a market economy and, indeed, for economic growth. Not asufficient condition, but a necessary one.Third, I note that Hungary has made substantial progress in this direction in fourkey areas. The larger part of the Hungarian banking system is now in genuinely private hands;the financial health of most banks (which, not so long ago, was - to put it mildly - precarious)has improved; the legal, accounting and regulatory framework has been consolidated, and, lastbut not least, there is now an interbank payment system in place which can no longer bequalified as prehistoric. Admittedly, in all these areas progress is still possible and desirable, butwhat has been achieved so far now enables you to address a number of institutional issues for thesolution of which Western experience is fast becoming increasingly and directly relevant.But before considering some of these issues, allow me to make some remarksabout the macroeconomic situation of the Hungarian economy and about the new frameworkwithin which the National Bank of Hungary will be operating. Both these areas are of keyimportance for the management of your banks. At the same time, both have a bearing onHungary’s declared intention to join the European Union (and within this, probably at a laterstage, also EMU). Last but not least, both are important areas in themselves, irrespective ofconsiderations relating to European integration.THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATIONThat there has been a significant improvement since mid-1995 in Hungary’smacroeconomic situation is beyond doubt. Here are a few facts and comments on some of thefeatures of this improvement.1. The current account deficit reached $3.5 billion in 1993 and almost $4 billionin 1994, i.e. more than 10% of GDP - an obviously unsustainable situation by any standards, buteven more so for a country with a high debt ratio. Some of this deficit was covered by directforeign investment, but the greater part of it was financed by borrowing, as a result of which bythe end of 1994 the net external debt had reached 46% of GDP and the exceptionally high levelof more than 160% of exports of goods and services and unrequited transfers.2. I have not yet seen the full 1996 figures, but estimates based on the first elevenmonths suggest a current account deficit of around (or even less than) $1.5 billion. This looksmuch more reasonable, not only because it was more than covered by foreign direct investmentbut also because of what lies behind this improvement. The $2.5 billion drop in the currentBIS Review   16/1997
- 2 -account deficit between 1994 and 1996 was made possible (a) by a 35% increase in exports,accompanied by a modest increase in imports of about 14%, and (b) by the steady and rapidincrease in services income, mainly (but not exclusively) derived from tourism.3. Since there was also a sizable inflow of foreign direct investment in 1995 and1996, the country’s net external debt dropped from $18.9 billion at end-1994 to about $13.3billion at end-1996. Net external debt declined to 31.2 expressed as a percentage of GDP, and to71.6 as a percentage of exports of goods, services and unrequited transfers. I have also noted thatby 1996 net interest payments on the external debt had dropped to 6.7 as a percentage of exportsof goods and services. The comparable figures were 12% in 1994 and as high as 17% in 1990. Itis useful to point out that the sizeable decline of the net external debt was made possible by thesubstantial decline of the public sector  deficit from 8.2% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 1996, whileat the same time the share of public sector expenditure in GDP declined from 62% to a morebearable 51%. “Growing out” of the debt service burden is no longer wishful thinking. It isbeginning to become a reality.4. The fact I find most noteworthy is that the $2.5 billion switch of resourcestowards external use, amounting to some 7% of GDP, took place without a recession, which isunusual for such a large switch. It was even accompanied by a small increase in GDP. Thiswould not have been possible without the fast growth of exports. The remarkable growth oflabour productivity in industry - of close to 60% between 1992 and 1996 - played a major role inthis respect. This growth, together with the changing composition of exports, suggests that thestructural transformation of the Hungarian economy has gone quite far. The growth of netservices exports points in the same direction.5. So much for the bright side of the picture, which is a good thing but should notbe overstated.First, these are improvements in comparison with the unsustainable imbalanceswhich characterised both the situation prevailing in 1988-89 and that of the years 1993-94.Second, the price paid by the majority of Hungarians was very heavy indeed: adrop in net real earnings of 12% in 1995, followed by another of 4% last year. Even if this wasarguably unavoidable, given the size of the imbalances which had to be corrected (and whichthemselves had been caused, to some extent at least, by the premature rise in real earnings in1994), the size of the sacrifices remains a fact. Against this background, any further erosion ofaverage living standards would be just as unsustainable as were the macroeconomic imbalancesin 1993-94.Third, the rate of inflation is still far too high. Admittedly, since the post-devaluation peak reached in the late spring of 1995 - of more than 30% - the rate has beendeclining steadily, to stand by December last year at a shade below 20%. But I am seriouslyworried by the fact that the Hungarian rate of inflation, while never moving towards three digits,has remained stuck within the 18-35% range over the past seven years. The worst was avoidedby maintaining positive real interest rates during the greater part of this period, but the distortingeffects of such inflation rates on the economy remain substantial, not to mention their sociallyunacceptable impact on those people whose earnings cannot be adjusted to inflation.6. Looking ahead, I hope that you will bear with me if I become a littlephilosophical. All knowledgeable observers of Hungarian history, ancient as well ascontemporary, agree that Hungarians possess the very rare ability to pull back at the last minuteBIS Review   16/1997
- 3 -from the brink of disaster or at least to extricate themselves from a seemingly hopeless situation.They unfortunately also note that once the Hungarians have done so, they miss the opportunityoffered by their own success to carry out policies with a long-term perspective in mind. I dohope that history will not repeat itself.Admittedly, any further decline in the average living standard would beunacceptable. The standard of living should be allowed to begin to rise - but only to the extentthat this does not upset the basic balance of the economy again. At the same time, the reductionin inflation must continue at a pace which puts the attainment of single-digit inflation in sight.You must break out - downwards - of the 18 to 35% range. And, last but not least, the countrywill have to begin to tackle earnestly the major structural problems related to the pension, healthcare, education and social security systems. These are daunting challenges. Two reminders mayhelp when tackling them. The first is that Hungary has managed major breakthroughs in therecent past which were just as difficult as these future challenges: over the past five years, realprivatisation accompanied by a fundamental shift in the structure of industry and services; and,more recently, the handling of a macroeconomic crisis situation. The second is that most of thesechallenges are akin to those encountered by modern Western societies. For these challengesHungary is in good company.THE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENTTwo recent changes have occurred regarding the institutional environment inwhich the National Bank of Hungary is operating. I welcome both of them.1. The possibility of the direct financing of the budget deficit by the NBH hasbeen eliminated. This is in conformity with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, and is ameasure which has already been implemented by all fifteen member countries of the EuropeanUnion and which the EMI closely monitors. To remind you, this provision of the Treaty appliesto the member countries at this stage, prior to effectively entering EMU. It would seem to meimpossible for Hungary to join the European Union without this change in the law governing theoperations of the NBH, even if Hungary’s participation in the euro area were to come at a laterstage.But this is only an institutional or political argument. There is more to it.Maastricht or no Maastricht, eliminating the direct monetary financing of budget deficits issimply economic common sense. In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon: it cannothappen without an (at least) accommodating expansion of the money supply. And we know fromhistorical experience that more often than not the major source of any such inflationary increasein the money supply has been the direct financing of government by the central bank. Hungaryhas not been an exception to this general rule - rather its confirmation. And once inflation isestablished, interest rates go up. Except for very short periods, it is impossible to keep marketinterest rates below the rate of inflation: who would be ready to undertake financial savings theremuneration of which would imply a loss in real financial wealth? To try to keep interest rateslow by monetary financing of the government is a self-defeating device. It may work for a fewmonths, but would end up producing more inflation and higher, not lower, interest rates -certainly higher nominal interest rates, but very likely also higher real rates. The simple reasonfor this is that people are not fools - at least not for a long time. Monetary financing of thegovernment is therefore likely to combine two evils at the same time: inflation and high interestrates.BIS Review   16/1997
- 4 -2. The accumulated and potential future losses of the NBH on account of itsborrowings in foreign currency have been taken over by the government. This is a salutarycleaning-up operation which ought to have been carried out long ago. It has no consequences forthe “real” economy. These borrowings have been undertaken in the past on governmentinstruction and with government approval, with the NBH acting solely as an intermediary. TheNBH’s only shareholder is the Hungarian State; the real burden of the State’s direct or indirectexternal borrowing has to be borne by the present or future taxpayers. This real burden was tosome extent hidden by the “seigniorage” profits of the NBH, which had two consequences: theyhid the size of this burden from public view; and they distorted the NBH’s accounts. As allexperts know, the size of this double distortion was proportional to the rate of inflation, and wasaggravated by the NBH’s sterilisation policy of large capital inflows, without which, however,inflation would not have been brought down from 30 to 20% within the past eighteen months.Sterilisation was therefore a wise policy; the real culprit is the rate of inflation, which is muchhigher in Hungary than in the countries whose currencies were used for borrowing. In asentence: this long overdue measure serves both public transparency and democraticaccountability (of both the government and the NBH) - even if the general public, or politicians,may be excused for not fully understanding the intricate interconnection between accountingprocedures in a country with high inflation and the processes of the real economy. This is a goodexample of the generalised mess created by inflation.CHALLENGES FOR THE HUNGARIAN BANKSAs I said right at the outset, it is now time to look ahead and begin to addresssome major issues for the Hungarian banks - issues which, thanks to the progress made over thepast few years, are no longer totally dissimilar from those facing banks in western Europe. Iintend to make a few comments on these, since they are issues on which I can possibly throwsome light on the basis of my own professional experience.1. The first is about the specificity of banking, i.e. about the possibility ordesirability of clearly distinguishing banks, through rules and regulations, from other financialintermediaries. I noted that the recent changes in Hungarian banking law have implied amovement towards the de-specialisation of banks, notably in the field of securities transactions. Ibelieve that a development towards the universal banking model is justified - on certainconditions. It is justified for two groups of reasons.First, because financial innovation in general, and securitisation in particular, arebreaking down the traditionally neat distinction between banks and other financialintermediaries, indeed even between financial intermediation and financial markets, all over theworld. Some time ago, banks were defined as financial intermediaries whose liabilities (mainlysight and short-term deposits) were equivalent to the money supply, and the money supply wasdefined as the total sum of bank liabilities. This nice circular definition kept academics, bankregulators and central bankers equally happy until the moment when financial innovation startedblurring the distinction between money and other financial assets, and securitisation beganblurring the distinction between financial intermediation and financial market operations. Theproliferation of derivatives, financial futures and the like added to the confusion betweenbalance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The result is that it is becoming increasingly difficultto identify banking on the basis of the old equivalence of “banking liabilities = money supply”.This has now been recognised in the sweeping deregulation of banking activities affecting thewhole of western Europe and, though more cautiously, also the United States. In some cases thishas gone so far as to allow the emergence of consolidated banking and insurance activities.BIS Review   16/1997
- 5 -Second, in a shorter Hungarian perspective, banks in Hungary have a head starton other financial intermediaries in collecting the financial savings of households and of theenterprise sector. Admittedly, Hungary badly needs the large-scale development of lifeassurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and the like, i.e. all those institutionalinvestors which can channel savings towards equity investment. But this takes time, sinceexperience and human resources are rare and the reform of the pension system and of healthservices takes time. Banks should be allowed to fill the gap for the time being, by putting at thedisposal of savers a wide variety of financial instruments.2. Now let me come to the risks that a generalised move towards universalbanking could entail, and the ways and means of containing them.The main risk, of course, is the emergence of conflicts of interest. One suchpotential conflict of interest may arise within any bank, between the bank’s own risk-takingactivity and risk-taking for its customers. The classic example of this is the potential conflict ofinterest between credit-granting and securities underwriting, but this is only one example. Thetraditional way of avoiding the misuse of such conflict-creating situations is (a) to devise anorganisational structure with clearly distinguishable lines of responsibility, (b) to avoid flows of“inside” information between the various activities, (c) to attribute to each activity costs, incomeand profits, and (d) to entrust external auditors with the surveillance of the systems put in place.The end-result will, of course, never be entirely safe. Moreover, the building of “Chinese walls”inside a multi-polar banking organisation may weaken, or even destroy, the synergy betweenthose poles, i.e. it may undermine the rationale of a multi-polar organisation. I would not want,however, to overstate the internal conflict of interest argument. In the long run, the kind ofconflict to which I have referred is unlikely to be very strong. In a longer-term perspective, nobank can afford to favour its own risk-taking activity at the expense of its customers - especiallyif auditing makes it certain that any misuse of the bank’s powers would come to light.3. Another much more dangerous conflict of interest could arise where the bank iscapable of exercising a decisive shareholding power in another non-banking firm, of which it isat the same time a major creditor. This could have unacceptable consequences not only for thefirm’s other shareholders but, if the practice became widespread, could even lead to structuraldistortions for entire industries. To avoid this happening, I would favour rather strict regulations.For instance, mutual funds managed by banks should either have limits on the equityparticipation in individual firms or not have access to the firm’s Board. The same should apply,a fortiori, to any bank’s direct and permanent equity participation in a non-banking firm - unless,perhaps, the bank remains just a shareholder (as if it were, say, a pension fund), without directbanking operations with the firm in question.4. Under the last point, I already touched on one particular aspect of corporategovernance, namely when a bank can play a decisive role in a non-banking firm’s life. But youwill also have to face up to the reverse problem: when a non-banking firm becomes a bank’s keyshareholder and could therefore potentially induce risk-taking by the bank in its favour, at theexpense of the bank’s other shareholders or of its depositors or customers. This is a particularlyacute danger in countries where there are not many non-bank institutional shareholders, wherethe defence of minority shareholders has no tradition and where depositors are not properlyprotected. Such problems have been encountered in Western market economies. It is clearly inHungary’s interest to build up, or consolidate, the appropriate defences against the emergence ofsuch problems.BIS Review   16/1997
- 6 -5. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I am not launching any appeal infavour of overregulation. In a market economy, the best regulator is the market itself. And whenspontaneous market regulation fails - which does happen - the second-best solution is to useregulatory techniques which favour the emergence of market-led self-regulation. I am simplytrying to make two points. First, that banking and finance have broader and more generalimplications for the economy as a whole than any other kind of activity. A crisis in, say, the steelindustry creates hardship, but it does not create a general crisis. A banking crisis may well do so.Second, banking and finance are evolving at a very fast pace under the combined influence oftechnological progress, innovation and globalisation. This needs a careful adjustment of theregulatory framework, not its general weakening.6. In a very different area, may I call your attention to the need to develop bothretail banking in the narrow sense of the term and also banking services to the dynamic sector ofsmall and medium-sized enterprises. In these fields, Hungarian banking is vastlyunderdeveloped, both in the number of consumer-friendly local offices and, even moreimportantly, in the range of high-quality banking services offered to these two groups ofcustomers. This underdevelopment is particularly striking when it is compared with thesophistication of some of the wholesale banking activities being offered.This is most regrettable and goes against the long-term interests of the banksthemselves, not to mention those of the country. Households are, and will remain, the majorsource of the country’s financial savings. They deserve to be supplied with appropriate, safe anddiversified vehicles which allow them to find an outlet for their financial wealth. Some smalland medium-sized firms are net savers; others desperately need financing for developmentpurposes, which financial markets will not be able to provide for a very long time indeed. I haveknown of a number of western European and even North American banks which derived greatstrength from their solid retail banking basis, which helped them considerably in situations inwhich some, if not many, of their cherished wholesale customers went bust.You will also need the retail banking basis for another reason. Satisfied householdand small enterprise customers provide you with the greatest public support. And I can assureyou that you will need this support in a democratic society. Banking has never been, and isunlikely to become, a popular activity, especially when it relies exclusively on customersrecruited from among large corporations and very wealthy individuals. Beware of the danger ofpolitical backlash.In developing your retail activities, you will have to monitor western Europeanexperiences carefully. Many western European countries are overbanked in this field, and a gooddeal of discussion is focusing on the merits of customer proximity versus home-computerbanking. My feeling is that you will be able to avoid some of the earlier western Europeanexcesses, and rely directly on the most recent communications and information systemstechnology. But for a long time to come, most of your customers will need close, humanproximity. The comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of these two approaches will bea very great challenge for the Hungarian banking system.I hope that in ten years’ time, if I am still around, I shall be able to congratulateyou on having been able to successfully meet this challenge. Meanwhile, I wish you good luck -and the ability to help the emergence of good luck by hard work, skilful management and goodstrategic choices.BIS Review   16/1997
Dott. Fazio examines the progress of the Italian economy in terms of stabilityand recovery   Address by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, at theAnnual Meeting of AIOTE/ASSOBAT/ATIC/FOREX held in Milan on 25/1/97.Yesterday the effective exchange rate of the lira was 5 per cent higher than inDecember 1994. Compared with the low point reached in the March 1995 currency crisis, thelira has appreciated by 25 per cent. To find a period in which the lira recovered to such an extentand so fast, it is necessary to go back fifty years to 1947.Inflation, measured on the basis of the cost-of-living index, fell to less than 4 percent on average in 1996; between June and December it was around 2 per cent on an annualbasis. According to preliminary figures, inflation in January of this year was less than 2 per cent.The net external position of the Bank of Italy, excluding gold reserves, improvedfrom $28 billion at 31 December 1993 to $45 billion at the end of last year.In 1994 purchases of foreign currency in the market, primarily in the first half ofthe year, amounted to $7 billion; in 1995 there were net sales totalling $7 billion. In 1996purchases were renewed, at an accelerating pace from March onwards. Yesterday the foreigncurrency reserves of the Bank of Italy and the UIC amounted to $35 billion, after using $21billion to repurchase official ecus and redeem foreign currency swaps and other short-termliabilities.Foreign exchange interventions have been carried out in such a way as to avoidinterrupting the appreciation of the lira. Between 1 March and 22 November 1996 the effectiveexchange rate rose by 4.7 per cent; the lire needed to buy one German mark decreased from1,056 to 998.The lira’s re-entry in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 25 November1996 was at the central rate of 990 against the mark and 1,906 against the ecu. The new ratecorresponds to a depreciation of 19 per cent compared with that obtaining before the September1992 currency crisis.The lira re-entered the ERM after the performance of the economy and anappropriate combination of policies had re-equilibrated Italy’s external position, brought a sharpslowdown in inflation and improved the outlook for the public finances.The surplus on the current account of Italy’s balance of payments and the returnto external equilibrium provide a solid foundation for the maintenance of the internal andexternal stability of the lira.1. The balance of paymentsThe actions to reduce the budget deficit, the new level of the exchange rate, wagemoderation and the stabilisation of prices have produced a shift in the composition of demandsince 1993 that has permitted growing surpluses on the external current account after a longseries of deficits.The surplus in 1996 is estimated to have been around 70 trillion lire, or 3.7 percent of GDP. The surplus on goods and services was on the order of 90 trillion and in absoluteterms was the largest recorded by the leading industrial countries. The increase of 18 trillion lirecompared with 1995 was due to the improvement in the terms of trade, estimated at 4.7percentage points.BIS Review   15/1997
- 2 -Exports of goods and services, after rising in volume by 10 per cent on average ineach of the three previous years, remained basically unchanged. Sales of goods and services tothe other EU countries diminished-as a result of the weakness of demand, whereas exports to theemerging countries continued to increase at a good pace.The share of Italian exports in world trade declined compared with the previousyear, partly owing to a loss of competitiveness but mainly because of the unfavourable cyclicalsituation in Europe, where more than half of Italy’s exports are directed.Imports dropped by 2 per cent in volume, compared with increases of 9 per centin both 1994 and 1995 and a decrease of 8 per cent in 1993; they were affected by the weaknessof domestic demand for consumer and investment goods.The competitiveness of Italian products has diminished compared with 1995, butstill shows a large improvement on the period before the September 1992 currency crisis.Measured in terms of producer prices, the real exchange rate of the lira shows a gain ofcompetitiveness of 10 per cent compared with the first half of 1992. In terms of labour costs, thegain is on the order of 18 per cent (Figure 1).The marked appreciation of the lira in 1996 made a decisive contribution to thestabilisation of domestic costs and prices.The effect of the good trade performance on the exchange rate and market interestrates was reinforced by that of the surplus on capital movements. Portfolio investment abroadcontinued regularly, generating an outflow of 53 trillion lire; foreign investment in Italyincreased substantially to 122 trillion (Table 1).2. Italy’s external position. The exchange rate of the liraAt the end of 1992 the country’s net liabilities amounted to 11 per cent of GDP;at the end of 1996 the ratio was well below 4 per cent (Figure 2).The current account surpluses that are forecast will bring the net external positionroughly into balance by the end of this year and then make Italy a net creditor. Part of the item“errors and omissions” consists of capital outflows that are not recorded in the capital account;accordingly, the country’s external position is almost certainly already in balance.In September 1996 non-residents’ holdings of Italian government securitiesdenominated in lire and foreign currency totalled 350 trillion lire, as against 290 trillion at theend of 1995 and 100 trillion in December 1992.This progression is evidence of foreign investors’ growing interest in the Italiansecurities market, but it is also the result of a policy aimed at diversifying the sources ofTreasury finance. It exposes the domestic market, albeit deep and efficient, and governmentfunding to interest rate movements in international markets and to the evaluations and decisionsof international investors.The growing volume of public debt placed abroad is matched by the steady andsubstantial improvement in the external balance of the private sector. Starting from a netexternal debtor position of around 90 trillion lire at the end of 1992, by September of last yearhouseholds and enterprises had built up a net creditor position of around 200 trillion (Table 2).The 1992 currency crisis caught Italian households and enterprises severely offbalance; the latter, in particular, had built up substantial foreign currency liabilities, trusting inthe stability of the exchange rate, even though this confidence was at odds with the expectationsimplicit in the significantly lower cost of borrowing in foreign currency compared with that inlire.BIS Review   15/1997
- 3 -The depreciation of the lira resulted in Italian firms incurring heavy losses. In thelast few months of 1992 they began to reduce their foreign currency liabilities and build up theirforeign currency assets and continued to do so on a major scale in the following years. Theprivate sector’s gross external liabilities, about three quarters of which consisted of borrowingsby non-financial enterprises, remained virtually unchanged at around 450 trillion lire; theircomposition changed, however, as the foreign currency share fell sharply.On the other hand, the external assets of enterprises, households and other non-bank operators rose from 370 trillion lire at the end of 1992 to 650 trillion in September 1996,with a significant increase in the proportion denominated in foreign currency.The recovery of the lira began in the spring of 1995, partly in response todomestic agents’ perception of the return to a balanced external position in foreign currency(Figure 3).Compared with a net external debtor position in foreign currency of 52 trillionlire in 1992, at the end of 1995 households and enterprises had already built up a net creditorposition of 118 trillion. In September 1996 this had risen to 126 trillion (Table 3).In 1996 a major contribution to the improvement in the exchange rate came fromthe net sales of foreign currency against lire by non-residents for portfolio investment purposes.In the 1992 currency crisis the official reserves, acquired in connection withshort-term capital inflows, proved evanescent in defending the exchange rate.The central bank’s foreign currency reserves are now part of an external positionthat is balanced overall and in surplus for the private sector.The domestic savings accumulated in Italy over the years is now again equal to,and in prospect will exceed, the sum of the country’s capital stock, created through public andprivate investment, and its huge public debt, contracted principally to finance the currentspending of the public sector.3. The global marketThe growing international integration of the Italian economy has profoundlyaffected the composition of financial assets and liabilities.The share of foreign assets, which accounted for 9.7 per cent of internal sectors’total assets at the end of 1989, has risen in the nineties and was equal to 14 per cent at the end ofthe second quarter of 1996 (Table 4).The proportion in Italy is now similar to that in France; in Germany it is higher, ataround 20 per cent. Neither in these two countries nor in the other leading industrial countrieshas it changed significantly in the nineties.The ratio of residents’ foreign financial assets to GDP is around 50 per cent inItaly, 90 per cent in France and 80 per cent in Germany.The diversification of Italian saving through investment abroad will continue inline with the development of the financial system.The growth in Italy’s foreign assets in the last few years has been accompanied bya rapid increase in its foreign liabilities.The total financial assets of the leading industrial countries rose from 510 to 550per cent of GDP between 1989 and 1994. Most saving and investment in these countries still hasa domestic counterpart; the share of total financial assets with a foreign counterpart is around 10per cent and equal to around 50 per cent of GDP (Table 5).BIS Review   15/1997
- 4 -The total of the six leading countries’ holdings of foreign bonds and shares isequal to some $4 trillion, or roughly one quarter of their GDP.International financial integration has led, especially in the nineties, to theemergence of a single, world market for currencies and securities linking all the leading nationalmarkets.In this global market the pricing and trading of financial instruments are affectedby the underlying performance of the international economy as a whole. The pattern appears todepend above all on the tendency prevailing among instruments denominated in dollars.The influence exerted by US financial markets, and to an even greater extent bydollar-denominated instruments, predominates in the world economy.The financial assets and liabilities of the United States, including those with bothdomestic and foreign counterparts, account for nearly 40 per cent of the corresponding totals forthe six leading industrial countries. Japan’s share is only slightly smaller, while Germanyaccounts for around 8 per cent of the total and Italy 4 per cent (Table 6).The close links with the dollar of the currencies of Latin America and many of theemerging South-East Asian countries increase the importance of the US currency in determiningthe international financial cycle.The correlation between the yields on medium and long-term securities acrossnational markets appears to be close. Differentials tend to be larger during currency crises; whenconditions are calmer and inflation rates converge, yields become more closely correlated anddifferentials smaller.The yields on short-term assets are controlled by national monetary policies. Inrecent years there has been a notable reduction in the power of central banks to control long-term yields directly.Superimposed on the underlying pattern of long-term rates in internationalmarkets there is a set of differentials that reflect the inflation expectations present in eachcountry and the related medium-term expectations concerning the exchange rate.The response of long-term yields to a change in official rates depends on theconditions in the economy, the economic policies in force and, in particular, on the stance andfirmness of monetary policy.The experience of the last few years in financially open economies with exchangerate flexibility between the major areas confirms the effectiveness of monetary policy incontrolling inflation. This, in turn, exerts an influence on expectations and yield differentials,and thereby on the level of long-term interest rates.The mechanism is well known in monetary theory. To the extent that monetarycontrol is effective, it is able to influence inflation expectations and thereby interest ratedifferentials and hence the nominal yields on long-term securities.At the beginning of 1995 we announced our intention of raising short-term rateswith the aim of curbing, reversing, the increase in the very high yields on long-term securities(Figure 4).In the currency crisis of spring 1995 the yield differential between long-termItalian and German securities widened to 660 basis points. The budget adjustment measuresadopted, the performance of the external accounts and the improvement in inflation expectationscaused the gap to narrow over the rest of the year (Figure 5).BIS Review   15/1997
- 5 -In January of last year the yield differential with respect to Germany was stillaround 450 basis points; the more stable political climate and the further improvement ininflation expectations resulted in its narrowing to around 300 basis points at the end of May. Thesubstantial budget adjustment announced in the autumn of last year, the approval of the FinanceLaw for 1997 and the further slowdown in inflation have reduced the differential to around 150basis points.As things stand today a reduction in official rates by a country’s central bank iseffective if it is ratification of more favourable inflation expectations. These, in turn, must berooted in the performance of the public finances and costs. History shows many cases where theinconsistency of other policies with the objectives has resulted in longer-term rates rising insteadof falling in the wake of an easing of monetary policy.4. Market participants and the allocation of funds in the international marketThe growing openness of national financial systems has accelerated thedevelopment of the market for Eurocurrencies, especially that for cross-border deposits andloans. Institutional investors, banks and the other participants in the global market need liquidfunds to carry out their financial transactions.Dollar deposits outside the United States are equal to 70 per cent of the USmoney stock. The ratio for the mark is slightly lower at 63 per cent; for the pound sterling andthe French franc it is 13 and 16 per cent respectively.Following the complete liberalisation of Italian short-term capital movements, inthe spring of 1990 the Eurolira market also began to expand rapidly. It is now larger than thecorresponding markets for the Swiss franc, the French franc and the pound sterling (Table 7).At the end of the second quarter of 1996 the stock of Eurolire amounted to 340trillion lire, or 30 per cent of the Italian money stock. London accounts for a major part of thismarket.The mass of lire traded in the international financial market reflects a demand forfinancial transactions that focuses mainly on the secondary market for Italian governmentsecurities, though the demand for Eurolira bonds and derivatives is growing. The rapidexpansion of this market and the size it has grown to, despite the reduction in yield differentials,are evidence of market participants’ increased confidence in the lira.The last few years have seen the activity of institutional investors in the globalmarket grow at a rapid pace. At the end of 1995 such intermediaries in the United States,Europe, Asia and Oceania with balance sheets of at least $10 billion had total assets of $21trillion (Figure 6).These intermediated funds are equal to about one fifth of the estimated value ofthe six leading industrial countries’ total financial assets with domestic and foreign counterparts,and equal to three times the GDP of the United States and twenty times that of Italy.Institutional investors place the bulk of the funds they raise in their nationalmarkets; they are nonetheless of considerable importance in the international allocation of fundsin view of how they make their investment choices and the scale of their investments.In Italy, as in other leading countries, a large part of the funds invested abroad byenterprises and especially households is channelled through such intermediaries. They reallocatetheir resources according to the importance of the various economies, taking account ofexchange rate expectations, yields and risks.BIS Review   15/1997
- 6 -The proportion invested in each country is determined on the basis of portfoliooptimisation criteria; the amounts involved are large enough to affect securities prices even inmedium-sized financial marketsAt the end of 1995 European institutional investors had raised $7.5 trillion. Theyare estimated to have invested 78 per cent of their resources, or $6 trillion, in shares and bonds.Around $2 trillion, or roughly a quarter of the total volume of intermediated funds, was investedoutside the intermediary’s home country (Figure 7).The funds raised by US institutional investors amounted to $8 trillion at the samedate and they had invested 80 per cent of the total in shares and bonds, a figure close to that forEuropean institutional investors. In view of the depth and diversification of the US market, thegreater part of these intermediaries’ resources was invested in domestic securities; nonetheless,11 per cent, or around $900 billion, was invested in shares and bonds in foreign markets.Although institutional investors in Asia and Oceania had also investeddomestically most of the nearly $5 trillion of funds they had raised at the end of 1995, theirinternational investments in shares and bonds are nonetheless estimated to have amounted to$400 billion.Taken together, these institutional investors held more than $15 trillion ofdomestic and foreign shares and bonds at the end of 1995, corresponding to around 35 per centof the stocks of such instruments issued by the leading industrial countries.These intermediaries’ investments in shares and bonds issued outside their homecountries exceeded $3 trillion.The configuration of exchange rates and interest rates generated in internationalmarkets interacts with the financial variables of national markets In addition to the fundamentalsof each economy, an important role is played by all the information permitting the assessment ofthe authorities’ ability to implement policies aimed at achieving growth in conditions ofstability.5. The 1995 currency crisis and the control of inflationIn the early months of 1995 the Mexican crisis and the weakening of the USdollar prompted substantial and sudden shifts of funds, out of the weaker currencies into thoseconsidered to be stronger. In addition to the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling,the Swedish krona and the Spanish peseta also weakened considerably. The lira was hit hard:between mid-February and mid-March it depreciated by 15 per cent.The identification of a currency as weak or strong is linked to the generalconditions in the economy, notably as regards the state of the public finances, the externalposition and the solidity of the country’s institutions. In the background there are the stability ofthe currency’s purchasing power, competitiveness, the outlook for economic growth and theavailability of saving and the uses to which it is put.In Italy wage moderation made it possible to avoid a cost-price spiral, but theincrease in consumer prices and the depreciation of the lira caused a marked deterioration inexpectations. Opinion surveys revealed that a surge in inflation was expected (Figure 8a).At the same time as supplementary budget measures were adopted in February1995, we raised the official discount rate and the rate on fixed-term advances; in May we raisedthem again.Monetary growth was drastically curbed.BIS Review   15/1997
- 7 -At the General Meeting of the Bank’s shareholders on 31 May 1995 weannounced the objective of slowing inflation in the second half of the year; we pointed out that itwas both possible and essential to reduce inflation to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996.Towards the middle of the year inflation expectations began to improvesignificantly (Figure 8a).Market yields on government securities started to come down, especially forlonger maturities; the lira strengthened, partly owing to the appreciation of the dollar.On 31 May 1996, in addition to confirming that the conditions existed forinflation to fall below 4 per cent in 1996, we stated that it would be possible to achieve a moreambitious target in 1997: an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent.Between May and December of last year the average monthly rate of inflation onan annual basis was close to 2 per cent.The survey of consumer price expectations carried out last September indicated arate of inflation of between 3 and 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. The survey carried outin December indicated a rate of between 2.5 and 3 per cent for the first half of this year (Figure8a).6. The outlookAfter the breakdown of the gold exchange standard all countries’ currenciesbecame of a purely fiat nature. This is a new epoch in monetary history.International capital movements tend to expand, with a multiplication of moneyand credit at the global level that makes it increasingly difficult for authorities to exercisequantitative control.The volume of funds traded, the rapidity with which they can be shifted and thesensitiveness of market participants to economic and metaeconomic information can generatetensions in financial markets and influence the quotations of currencies and securities, withsignificant effects on economic activity and prices, even in medium-sized economies.Greater monetary stability in Europe not only benefits individual economies butalso contributes to the solidity of the international financial system.The weakness of the economic cycle and the curbing of inflation have led to a fallin interest rates. Easier monetary conditions have been a major factor underlying the rise in bondand share prices.Monetary stability, public finances in order and flexible productive structures andfactor markets are necessary to protect individual economies from destabilising speculativemovements, to enable them to share in the benefits of the global market and economic andfinancial integration in Europe.This is the context in which policies must be implemented to permit the fullemployment of all the available resources of labour, saving and physical capital.In the last four years Italy has made significant progress in re equilibrating itsexternal position, curbing the budget deficit and controlling inflation.In 1996 the slowdown in inflation permitted a substantial fall in interest rates; theTreasury’s spending on this item declined in absolute terms, despite the increase of 6 per cent inthe stock of debt. The improvement in the budget deficit suffered a setback, however. Theoverall borrowing requirement grew in absolute terms and remained unchanged in relation toGDP at 7.4 per cent. The supplementary budget measures adopted in the middle of the yearBIS Review   15/1997
- 8 -failed to prevent a large overshoot on the order of 30 trillion lire compared with the originaltarget set in September 1995.In the Forecasting and Planning Report published last September the Governmentincreased the 1997 budget adjustment to 62.5 trillion lire, compared with 37.5 trillion envisagedin the Economic and Financial Planning Document. This is a demanding commitment that isalready having beneficial effects on government securities prices and the financial markets.As I pointed out in my Parliamentary hearing on the Finance Law, the forecasts ofthe borrowing requirement in 1997 reflect highly favourable assessments concerning the primarysurplus; these are only compensated for in part by the significantly better-than-forecastbehaviour of interest rates.The lower level of the primary surplus in 1996, with a shortfall of around 20trillion lire compared with last September’s estimates, will have repercussions on the results in1997; these will also be affected by the cyclical slowdown that started at the beginning of 1996and became more pronounced in the last part of the year.The adjustment of the budget deficit will have to be pursued by curbing thegrowth in expenditure. On the revenue side it will be necessary to reduce tax avoidance andevasion. Further fiscal tightening would have adverse effects on domestic demand and prices.In order to create confidence in a return to equilibrium in the medium term,budget adjustment measures will have to be of a structural nature.There is an urgent need to revive growth.Italy, like many other leading European countries, is far from making full use ofits resources of saving, labour and entrepreneurial ability, with consequent economic and socialcosts.In cyclical terms the level of economic activity remains unsatisfactory.According to the latest forecasts, the growth in GDP in 1997 will be just over 1per cent.The trade surplus will remain large, as will the surplus on the current account ofthe balance of payments, thereby contributing to a further improvement in the country’s externalposition and providing support for the lira.It will be necessary to modify the composition of public expenditure, by reducingthat on current account, in order to release the resources needed to return public investment to anormal level. In the last few years this component has fallen by around one percentage point ofGDP. Investment will need to be directed to the areas and sectors where the shortfall in publicinfrastructure is greatest, to the benefit of productivity and, above all, of employment.The latest reduction in official rates, following that enacted in 1996, was madepossible by the improvement in both actual and expected inflation. Together with the ampleavailability of saving, it also creates the conditions for a higher level of private investment.The fall in market interest rates will be locked in only if permanent price stabilityis achieved.Monetary stability, consolidation of the public finances and economic growth arethree closely interrelated objectives. The experience of recent years shows that failing to achieveeven one of them necessarily jeopardises the other two.The establishment and maintenance of the virtuous circle is likely to beinterrupted by the reappearance of inflationary pressures, which can be engendered by labourBIS Review   15/1997
- 9 -costs, pricing policies that are short-sighted and unresponsive to competitive stimuli, by aninsufficient reduction or excessive expansion of the budget deficit.Monetary policy will remain firmly directed towards producing an expansion ofmoney and credit that will permit balanced growth of the economy in conditions of broadlystable prices.The rise in the incomes of those already working must not hinder the creation ofemployment. A smaller absorption of saving by the public sector will make resources availablefor investment. These are the conditions for removing the most acute, most sociallyunacceptable, forms of unemployment, which have been aggravated by the events of the last fewyears. They will allow a host of young people with qualifications and a desire to contribute tothe development of our economy and society to become active members of the labour force.BIS Review   15/1997

Mr. Kelley looks at the extent to which banks are still special   Remarks byMr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of GlobalCapital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on29/1/97.I would like to say first that it is a pleasure for me to be here today to participatein this conference and to have the opportunity to exchange views on the important issuesaddressed by this session in particular. I also want to thank Governor George for his fine surveyon the question of whether banks remain special; his paper makes many good points and I agreewith virtually all of what he has to say. As a consequence, my comments will be more in thenature of expanding upon his remarks, rather than in taking issue with any of his main points.As Governor George noted, the degree to which each of us regards banks as“special” is bound to be colored by the history and development of banking in our respectivecountries. Of course, the U.S. banking is quite unique in many respects. Relative to the U.K., forexample, we have many more depositories (on the order of 25,000 or so) and they operate withmore regulatory restrictions on their activities than in the U.K. and many other countries. Also,our system of deposit insurance is more generous than in the U.K. Bearing these differences inmind, I will attempt to address aspects of our subject today that apply more or less generically inall countries, but I will draw on U.S. experiences for illustrations.To begin, let me say that I found the seemingly simple question “Are banks stillspecial?” to be deceptively difficult. In reading Mr. George’s paper and organizing my ownthoughts on the subject, I was compelled to answer for myself a series of even more basicquestions such as: “How do we define a ‘bank’?”, “What do we mean by ‘special’?”, and “Ifbanks are indeed special, what does this imply about the proper stance of government vis-à-visthe banking industry and other types of financial services providers?”For the purposes of this discussion, I will define a bank rather broadly as anyfinancial intermediary that accepts deposits and extends loans to households or businesses. In theUnited States, this definition encompasses domestic commercial banks, branches of foreignbanks operating in the United States, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.Defining what constitutes “specialness” is more difficult. In general terms,analogous to Governor George’s definition, I will define a “special” aspect of banking as one inwhich there is a clear and pronounced public interest exceeding that present in other types ofbusiness and commerce. As I will note more fully in the following, my definition of “special”does not necessarily imply that the special aspect of banking in question should be isolated orinsulated from competition with other financial service providers. There are at least three generalaspects of banks and banking that have been deemed special by many observers -- the liquiditytransformation function of banks, the provision of basic financial services such as creditextension, deposits-taking, and payments processing, and the linkage between the bankingsystem and the conduct of monetary policy. In the following, I will take up each of these“special” aspects of banking in turn.So, is the liquidity transformation function of banks still special? By the term“liquidity transformation function” of banks, I refer to the typical balance sheet structure ofbanks that often features a sizable volume of highly liquid liabilities -- those that can bewithdrawn at par on demand such as balances in checking accounts -- in combination with aBIS Review   13/1997
- 2 -portfolio of generally longer-term assets that often are difficult to sell or borrow against on shortnotice.It is probably fair to say that there is considerable agreement among centralbankers and other economic policymakers that this unique balance sheet structure creates aninherent potential instability in the banking system. Rumors concerning an individual bank’sfinancial condition -- even if ill-founded -- can spark a run by depositors and other creditors thatmay force the bank to unload assets at firesale prices and, in extreme situations, suspendpayment on withdrawal requests. Especially if the distressed institution is large or prominent, thepanic can spread to other banks, with potentially debilitating consequences for the economy as awhole. Most countries with private banking systems have experienced episodes of bank panics tosome degree, and in the United States, such panics occurred with some frequency in the latenineteenth century and were a major factor exacerbating the Great Depression of the 1930s.While institutional regimes differ, most countries have established safeguards against bankingpanics that rest on three basic pillars -- some form of deposit insurance (explicit or implicit), aprogram of banking supervision and regulation, and an institution that can act as lender of lastresort.To come back to our basic question of whether the liquidity transformationfunction of banks and the associated instability remains “special,” I would say that there issimply no doubt about it. Wherever banking panics have occurred, their effects on economicperformance have been crippling. Thus, developing institutions and mechanisms that can preventor short-circuit bank panics remains an important and “special” goal for economic policymakers.Having said this, however, recent experiences in the United States and elsewhere haveunderscored the importance of going about this task in a way that does not overextend thebanking “safety net.” In the United States, this lesson was painfully conveyed during the 1980sand early 1990s by the hundreds and hundreds of bank and thrift failures that occurred in theseyears. While this phenomenon was extraordinarily complex, many have argued that underpriceddeposit insurance and relatively lax supervision contributed to the problem by distorting theincentives banks and thrifts faced in assessing the risks of their business decisions.In response, U.S. federal banking agencies have implemented changes that trimthe banking safety net somewhat -- for example, by requiring prompt closure of troubledinstitutions, by applying stricter rules governing the payoffs of depositors and other creditors inbank failures, and by curtailing the practice of allowing regulatory “goodwill.” In addition, newbank capital regulations such as the Basle risk-based capital standards, which have beenimplemented in the G-10 and have served as a blueprint for capital regulation in many othercountries, have helped to provide better incentives for banks in their business decisions.To summarize, I would argue that banks remain quite special in theirsusceptibility to runs and in the severe consequences that a large-scale banking panic wouldinvolve today. Balancing the need for a banking “safety net” to defuse potential bank runs withthe need to create the right incentives for banks in assessing and assuming risk is one of the mostdifficult challenges we face as central bankers.A second way in which banks have been deemed to be “special” is in theprovision of basic banking services such as credit extension, deposit-taking, and paymentsprocessing. There is little question that these functions are critically important throughoutsociety. Consumers turn to banks for safe investments such as time and savings deposits, fortransactions deposits, for processing payments, and for short- and long-term credit. Large andsmall businesses rely on banks for payment processing, short-term credit, and backup creditBIS Review   13/1997
- 3 -lines. And governments rely on the banking system to conduct payments, distribute currency,safeguard tax receipts, and to serve as a conduit for monetary policy. In short, the basic businessfunctions of banks are at the heart of the financial system and the economy overall. By thedefinition I put forward earlier, I would have to say that these basic functions performed bybanks are and will remain special. However, it is far from clear that these functions can only beperformed by banks or that there is always a “special” public purpose in ensuring that banks’role in performing such functions is protected.Indeed, as Governor George noted, nonbanks have made impressive inroads inmarkets that previously had been largely banks’ domain. For example, money market mutualfunds and stock and bond mutual funds have lured billions of dollars that formerly had beenplaced in staid bank investments such as certificates of deposits. Most mutual funds now alsooffer some “banking” services such as checkwriting privileges. The advent of asset securitizationhas allowed nonbank mortgage companies to compete successfully with banks in the homemortgage market, and nonbanks have also been important players in the explosion of newfinancial instruments such as derivatives and structured notes.For the most part, this blurring of the traditional lines between banks andnonbanks seems to be a positive development. New competitive forces have been unleashed,financial innovation has accelerated, and businesses and households now enjoy a far greaterrange of choices on their menu of financial services than they did only a decade ago. Banks haveresponded vigorously -- and I would say successfully, given recent trends in profitability -- tothe challenges posed by nonbank competitors. To be sure, such rapid changes have also posednew risks. It is critical in this environment that policymakers stay abreast of marketdevelopments to ensure that banks and nonbanks face the right incentives in assessing the risksof their business decisions, and likewise to ensure that consumers and investors have the bestpossible information available to them when choosing among financial services and products.Thus, while I agree that the basic functions of banks in making credit available, in providingsafe investment choices (deposits) for households, and in processing payments are special, I seelittle to be gained by insisting that banks always be the only type of entity that can provide suchservices.The case of electronic money helps to illustrate the point I am trying to make. Itremains to be seen how popular this form of payment will become in the United States, but thequestion of whether nonbank institutions should be allowed to issue electronic money is activelybeing debated in many countries. Some argue that issuing money is a special bank function andthat electronic money should properly remain exclusively a bank product. For the time being,however, I along with other policymakers at the Federal Reserve have concluded that anydecision to reserve the nascent market for smart cards and other forms of electronic money as aprovince for banks alone might well stifle both competition and technological innovation in thisarea. Thus, while most would agree that providing efficient payment media for small dollartransactions is a “special” function that banks currently perform, it does not follow that onlybanks should be allowed to perform the function.As a corollary, I would also say that there is not a “special” public purpose inconstraining banks from competing in many other markets traditionally dominated by nonbankfinancial institutions. This is a subject which is especially topical in the United States becauseour domestic banks are more restricted in the business activities in which they can engage thanare banks in many other countries. As you know, the Federal Reserve has pushed to expandbanks’ ability to compete with investment houses in underwriting securities, and the scope forU.S. banks to sell insurance-related products has also expanded recently.BIS Review   13/1997
- 4 -The third general aspect of banking that is often deemed special is the linkagebetween the banking system and monetary policy. Of course, this is a topic that has spawned atruly vast economic literature. Without venturing into this thicket, I would simply like to note asfact that through much of the 1990-1994 period, growth of the broad U.S. monetary aggregatessuch as M2 was quite at odds with historical relationships to nominal income growth. Perhapsthe most important factor underlying this development has been a fundamental realignment ofhousehold financial assets away from bank deposits in favor of bond and stock mutual funds andother capital market investments. This “decoupling” of banking system deposit liabilities andnominal GDP became so pronounced during the first half of the 1990s that the Federal OpenMarket Committee downgraded the status of M2 as a policy variable. Today M2 remains onlyone of the many variables reviewed by the FOMC in the course of its policy deliberations.I raise this example because financial innovations and shifts in financial structureaffecting the monetary aggregates in other countries have similarly created complications intheir implementation of monetary policy. Indeed, the difficulties in guiding monetary policyduring periods of rapid financial innovation have been a factor contributing to greaterexperimentation among central banks with alternative targets such as inflation or nominal GDPgrowth. Thus, I believe one could argue that the growth of aggregate bank deposits or money isprobably less “special” today as a policy variable in many countries than in the past.Ironically, while the growth of bank deposits may be less special as a policyguide, the special role of the banking sector as the primary vehicle in implementing monetarypolicy in most countries remains unchallenged. Most central banks seek to achieve theirobjectives through some form of interest rate management. Control over short-term interest ratesis achieved in every case I am aware of by manipulating the supply of central bank reservesavailable to satisfy banks’ demand for reserves. Banks’ demand for reserves is similarlyinfluenced by central banks either directly by setting reserve requirements or indirectly byallowing only banks to access the payment system and then setting the rules regarding themanagement of their central bank accounts.To conclude, I would like to return to one of the questions posed at the outset ofthese remarks: If banks are special, what does this imply about the proper stance of governmentvis-à-vis the banking industry? As I hope my previous comments make clear, regulatory andsupervisory policies must recognize the dynamic forces at play in the financial sector. Suchpolicies must promote and exploit the competitive process in order to foster efficient delivery ofservices while encouraging financial and economic stability. These objectives are not likely to beachieved by regulations that arbitrarily identify and rigidly segment bank and nonbank financialmarkets. Rather, our goal as policymakers should be to establish rules of the game that provideproper incentives for financial institutions to accurately assess and manage the risks inherent intheir business decisions. Likewise, we should foster reporting standards and information flowsso that the consumers of financial services and products are as well informed as possible aboutthe risks and returns of the financial services and products they buy. To the maximum extentpossible, market forces should determine which bundles of financial services and products areprovided by banks and other types of financial service providers.As a final comment, I would note that sound macroeconomic policies are one ofthe most important ways to encourage the efficient delivery of financial services and the safetyand soundness of financial institutions. Conversely, policies that result in significantmacroeconomic imbalances frequently have serious adverse implications for financialinstitutions and banks in particular. In reviewing the past two decades in the United States, forexample, one cannot help but notice that the most severe problems in our banking and thriftBIS Review   13/1997
- 5 -industries during the 1980s stemmed from serious macroeconomic imbalances -- including theaccelerating inflation of the late 1970s and the costly but necessary steps to reverse that trend inthe 1980s. By contrast, macroeconomic policies that encourage sustainable economic growthwith low inflation -- like those in recent years -- have a strong positive influence on the overallhealth of the banking sector and other financial institutions as well.BIS Review   13/1997
Mr. George weighs up the pros and cons of European Monetary UnionSpeech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Bankers ClubAnnual Banquet held in London on 3/2/97.I’ve been a follower of Jim Wolfensohn for the past 20 years, and it is a greatpleasure to follow him again this evening.I first came across him when he was an extraordinary investment banker -reputedly flying the world with his cello strapped securely in the adjacent seat.  His eventualappointment to the Presidency of the World Bank was inspired.  He brings to it an outstandingprofessionalism.  But - as you have heard this evening - he brings to it also a broad humanitarianvision and total commitment to the World Bank’s task of improving the lives of people in thoseparts of the world that still need outside official  help with their reconstruction and development.President Wolfensohn’s canvas tonight has been global.  My own focus will be onEurope, and in particular on European monetary union - though it’s fair to say that EMU couldwell have significant consequences for the global economy.This country is widely regarded elsewhere in Europe as being bloody-minded andeven obstructive about monetary union, largely because there is indeed an intense, and oftenimpassioned, debate going on here about the pros and cons.  And so there should be.  It’s amomentous enterprise, with potentially enormous implications for Europe’s political andeconomic future.  The simple fact is that there are real risks as well as real potential benefits inmonetary union;  and it would be foolhardy just to assume that the enterprise, if it is embarkedupon, will inevitably bring about the political harmony and economic prosperity across Europethat anyone in their right mind wants to see.  It is hugely important to all of us that Europe’spolitical leaders stand back and weigh the risks as well as the potential benefits, dispassionately,before any irrevocable step is taken.  If the debate in this country encourages open debateelsewhere then we will be doing a service to Europe as a whole.It is something of a fashion these days to describe economic conditions in termsof fairy stories.  I have heard the steady expansion in the United States, and more recently in thiscountry, described as the “Goldilocks” condition - with the economic temperature not too hot,not too cold, but just right.In the same vein I might describe European monetary union as Beauty and theBeast.  The Beauty of it lies in intra-European exchange rate certainty.  And if you don’t findthat instantly seductive I suggest you speak, as I have, to some of Britain’s exporters.  They haveseen, over the past six months or so, an erratically sharp appreciation of sterling, against the coreEuropean currencies in particular, which can’t be adequately explained in terms of economicfundamentals.But Beauty comes in a package along with the Beast, and the Beast in this case isthe single monetary policy - the single, one-size-fits-all, interest rate.  The trouble is that it maynot in the event suit the domestic monetary policy needs of the different individual Euro-areacountries.  And if you don’t find that instantly repulsive I suggest you ask yourself how, at thisparticular juncture, we could keep the economic porridge - if I may mix my fairy stories - at justthe right temperature if we were obliged now to have German-level interest rates.Now you can’t just hope the Beast will never appear.  I don’t know of any seriousanalysis that doesn’t acknowledge that tensions could arise between the domestic policy needs ofBIS Review   14/1997
- 2 -the different member countries - as a result of different cyclical positions, or different fiscalpolicies, or as a result of external shocks which affect some member countries more than others,or as a result of structural changes in one member country as against another.  The risks, like thepotential benefits, are, as I say, real.You might more reasonably hope that Beauty’s Beast will turn into PrinceCharming - and that all their problems turn out to be little ones.  But I have to tell you that it wasalways at this point in the story that I began to wonder if my mother was making it all up!  Inany event, you need to be rather confident that the potential tensions are indeed likely to beminor, or at least short-lived, because, if they do turn out to be serious, then you could be stuckeither with a weak Euro - and more rather than less inflation, higher rather than lower interestrates over the medium-term, and exchange rate instability against outside currencies - or, if theEuropean central bank is allowed to do its job in accordance with its statutes, you could be stuckwith persistent stagnation and unemployment across the economically weaker parts of theEuro-area.  It’s not enough, it seems to me, to shrug one’s shoulders and say “well, that’s whathappens now anyway within individual countries”;  at least within individual countries there arealternative adjustment mechanisms, in the form of labour mobility and fiscal redistribution, tomoderate the tensions, which will be much less effective within the Euro-area.The architects of the Maastricht Treaty clearly knew all about the Beast, and theyevidently shared my scepticism about it turning naturally into Prince Charming.  The famousconvergence criteria are there precisely in order to reduce the risks of tensions emerging afterthe start of the Euro.  One can argue about how far they do in fact reduce the risks.  But it wouldbe a reckless gamble to charge ahead if even those criteria were not met - sustainably, and insubstance rather than just in form.So there needs to be a serious debate.  But it would be disappointing if that debatedegenerates into recrimination and antagonism.  That would be to obscure the remarkableconsensus that now exists - throughout the European Union and indeed more widely, and acrossa broad spectrum of political opinion within the countries of Europe, including this country, onthe broad approach to macro-economic management.  This unforced consensus extends tomonetary policy directed to price stability, and it extends to budgetary policy directed tomedium and longer-term fiscal sustainability.  There is growing recognition, too, across thecontinent, of the importance of structural policy directed to supply-side flexibility.  Thisstrengthening consensus is fundamentally important - more fundamentally important, in terms ofthe economics of it at least, than whether these common objectives are pursued inside or outsidethe framework of monetary union.Pulling these thoughts together, it would be a mistake in my view for monetaryunion to go ahead without reasonable confidence of genuine, sustainable, convergence betweenits members;  and it would be a mistake for any individual country to seek to join, or to bepermitted to join, unless it had achieved genuine, sustainable, convergence.  If there are seriousdoubts - generally or in any particular case - it would be in no-one’s interest to proceed.But it would be just as big a mistake, if monetary union does not go ahead, or forcountries on the outside, if individual governments saw that as an opportunity to seek to takeshort-term advantage of the apparent macro-economic freedom that that gave.  It would beagainst their longer-term national economic interest;  and countries behaving in this way shouldnot be at all surprised if other European Union countries sought to protect themselves againstdisruptive behaviour.  With or without monetary union, within it or outside, it is of overridingimportance that we all continue to pursue stability-orientated macro-economic policies.  On thatBIS Review   14/1997
- 3 -basis I can see no reason, and certainly no right under the Treaty of Rome, for distinctions to bemade among the member states of the European Union whatever the outcome on monetaryunion.  Indeed we would all suffer if they were, because it would reduce the potential benefits ofthe single market to Europe as a whole.  Whatever the surrounding noise, we must surely besmart enough to avoid cutting off our nose to spite our face in that way.  Our national andcollective economic interests are too closely aligned for that to be allowed to happen.So I am not particularly impressed either by the fears sometimes expressed aboutthe economic penalties that will be visited on countries outside monetary union, or by theoccasional rattling of the cage to try to bully them into it.  Unless we are convinced, as I say, ingeneral or in any particular case, that Beauty will in fact end up with Prince Charming, and notbe condemned to long-term cohabitation with the Beast, then it would be better for Europe as awhole to delay until we were more confident of a happy ending.Investment will continue to flow to this country so long as we succeed inmaintaining an environment offering attractive returns, and our macro-economic and supply-sidepolicies are a much bigger factor in that than the exchange rate.Similarly the City will continue to flourish as Europe’s international financialcapital so long as the strongest financial firms from all around the world continue to find itattractive to conduct their business here.  I see no signs of that changing:  indeed theinternational business of the City continues to increase;  and that has very little to do with ournational currency, or with an expectation that we will be among the first to merge it into theEuro.So long as we are properly prepared, as we will be, and so long as we have inplace efficient infra-structure, including for payments and settlements, as I assure you we willhave - in or out, then the Euro, if it comes, will be more of an opportunity than a threat to theCity.  There are those who sometimes give the impression that they think the Euro could - byregulation or restrictions - be confined to within the territory of the Euro area, and that thiswould be “a good thing”.  That I have to say is not our experience.  In practice unnecessary orineffective domestic regulations or restrictions have often been the cause of financial activitygrowing up elsewhere.  In any event we live in a global financial world and the Euro is bound tobecome a widely-used and actively-traded currency internationally.  Its liquidity is likely to be akey attraction to domestic and foreign users alike.  The City of London both contributes to, andthrives upon, liquid markets, and the Euro-market, or the euro-Euro-market if we are an “out”,will be no exception.  That can only be good for the development of financial activity - theprovision of competitive financial services - across Europe as a whole, because we are nottalking here about a zero-sum game.  Euro-activity in London is likely to stimulate financialactivity in other centres and vice versa;  and much of that activity will be undertaken bybranches or affiliates of the same major financial firms.  The first ecu-Euro bond raised lastweek by a European borrower and managed from London by a Swiss/British and a French bankand by another French bank in Paris, is a good example not just of London’s international role asit is today, but of how it is likely to continue.  In this area, too, therefore I see our nationalinterests coinciding rather than conflicting with the collective European interest.  That is why theBank of England, at all levels, is playing a full, active, and constructive, part in both thepreparatory work of the EMI, and in the technical preparation of London’s great financialmarkets.  If monetary union goes ahead, with or without the UK, we have a vital interest in itssuccess, and we will do all that we can to ensure that outcome.BIS Review   14/1997

And, come what may in relation toEMU, I confidently look forward to seeing you all at this great banquet again next year, and formany years to come - looking just as prosperous.  It is in that context that I ask you to rise andjoin me in a toast to the Bankers Club - coupled with the name of its President, Sir WilliamPurves.BIS Review   14/1997
Mr. Dai looks at the possibilities of strengthening financial co-operationbetween China and Hong Kong in order to promote economic prosperity and stabilitySpeech by the Governor of the People’s Bank of China, Mr. Dai Xianglong, at the Hong KongAssociation of Banks’ Dinner on 13/11/96.I would like to thank the Hong Kong Association of Banks for inviting me to HongKong to meet with you and to attend this dinner function. Although this is my first visit to HongKong since taking up my post in the central bank, we follow closely the economic developmentsof Hong Kong. All of you have contributed to the prosperity of Hong Kong. I greatly appreciatethe wisdom and the spirit of the people of Hong Kong. They are industrious and always strivingfor the better. Hong Kong’s success is partly attributable to the characteristics of its people. Wehave good reasons to believe that through our joint efforts, Hong Kong will have an even betterfuture.I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief description of the currentsituation of the economic and financial reforms in the mainland as well as the basic principles andpolicies towards the financial relationship between China and Hong Kong after 1997. In addition,I would also say something on co-operation and joint development between the financial sectorsof China and Hong Kong.I. Mainland China’s economy is experiencing a stable developmentFirst of all, I would like to talk about the financial and economic conditions ofChina which is a hot topic for discussion among professionals from the Hong Kong financialsector. This is because Hong Kong’s future is closely linked with the economic and financialdevelopments of China.China’s economy began to pick up in 1992 with a dynamic national economy.However, there was also hyper-inflation. During the latter half of 1993, the Chinese Governmentbegan to adopt an appropriately tight monetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly,price increases should be kept at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly, thegrowth of money supply should be slightly above the sum of the rate of economic growth and thetarget rate of the price increase. Thirdly, indirect monetary instruments should be used morefrequently for relating money supply so that the economy will not be too volatile. Our efforts inthe past three years are beginning to pay off. We have successfully curbed inflation by makingmacro-economic adjustments.Firstly, the growth of the money supply has slowed down. It is expected that thetotal money supply at the end of this year will be 26% higher than the previous year. This growthrate is 3.7% lower than the average annual growth rate during the period under the “Eighth Five-Year Plan”.Secondly, price increases have slackened noticeably. During the period fromJanuary to October, retail prices have risen by 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. It isexpected that the growth rate for the whole year will be around 6.5%.Thirdly, the economy continues to grow at a relatively high rate. During the periodfrom January to September, GDP rose by 9.6%. It is anticipated that the annual growth rate willexceed 9.5%.BIS Review   12/1997
- 2 -Fourthly, our foreign reserves continue to grow. As at the end of October, ourforeign reserves reached US$ 98.8 billion. We are certain that our reserves will exceed US$ 100billion by the end of the year. The trade surplus is estimated to be over US$ 100 billion this year.There is also US$ 40 billion of foreign direct investment. The supply of foreign exchange exceedsdemand and the exchange rate of the renminbi remains stable. Moreover, the renminbi hasbecome fully convertible in the current account. Our experience proves that we are right inadopting an appropriately tight financial and economic policy. Our ability in performingmacro-economic operations has improved greatly and our achievements are recognisedinternationally.Despite the foregoing, several major problems remain to be solved. The percentageof financial revenues in GDP is still falling. The asset quality of banks still needs to be improved.The basic elements of the agricultural sector remain relatively weak and it is unlikely to have anyimprovement in the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises in the short run.In view of the current economic situation, the focus of economic and financialreforms in the coming year will be placed on promoting the reform of the economic system andchanging the pattern of economic growth. We will continue to adopt an appropriately tightfinancial and monetary policy. Further efforts will be made to adjust the structure of the economyso as to foster new areas of economic growth. In order to ensure steady growth of the nationaleconomy, efforts will also be made to develop domestic as well as overseas markets. Based on theabove considerations, it is desirable that next year’s target annual GNP growth rate should be setat 8-9% while the retail price increase be contained at a level below 6%. In order to achieve thesetargets, the People’s Bank of China is prepared to:1. Control money supply. Our preliminary proposal is to contain the increase ofnext year’s total money supply (M2) within the range of 23% to 25%.2. Adjust the credit structure. The total amount of loans to the agricultural sectorwill be increased. Economic integration and the setting up of conglomerates will be encouraged.Efforts will also be made to promote the development and sale of residential property.3. Conduct monetary operations. Employ more frequently monetary policyinstruments such as interest rate policy, reserve requirements and open market operations toregulate the money supply.4. Deepen financial reforms. Reforms of state banks should be stepped up. Newcommercial banks will be set up. The policy of transforming rural credit co-operatives intoco-operative financial institutions will be maintained. Direct financing will be developed in aprudent way with better management. In addition, the financial sector will continue to open up.5. Foster risk management. Continue the rationalisation of financial order andprevent and eliminate financial risks.It is envisaged that China’s economy and society will continue to develop steadilyin the coming years and objectives embodied in the “Ninth Five-Year Plan” can be achieved.China will enter the 21st century with a dynamic economy and society.II. Basic principles and policies governing the financial relationship between mainland China andHong Kong after 1997BIS Review   12/1997
- 3 -As China and Hong Kong have different currencies and financial systems, peoplefrom Hong Kong as well as the international community are very much concerned with how theprinciple of “one country, two systems” can be implemented as regards financial issues. It isbecause the implementation of this principle has direct bearings on the prosperity and stability ofHong Kong as well as the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.“The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’sRepublic of China” lays down specific provisions relating to Hong Kong’s status as aninternational financial centre, its monetary and financial policies, the status of the Hong Kongdollar and the issuing arrangements, capital flows and the role of the Exchange Fund. Our nationalleaders have reiterated on different occasions that the People’s Bank of China, which is the centralbank of the People’s Republic of China, should insist on implementing the “Basic Law” and theprinciple of “one country, two systems”. We should also protect the financial relationship betweenHong Kong and the mainland which can be summarised as “one country, two currencies, twomonetary systems and two monetary authorities” within a sovereign state and deal with issuesrelating to this relationship in an appropriate manner.At the IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting which was held in late September thisyear, I stated in my speech our principles governing the financial relationship between themainland and Hong Kong. Mr Chen Yuan, the Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China,also presented these principles in a systematic manner at the Bank of England seminar which washeld in September this year. Both the People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority (HKMA) have been offered membership in the Bank for International Settlements. Thisis a clear demonstration of the above principles and shows that the mutually independent financialrelationship between the mainland and Hong Kong are widely accepted by international financialorganisations.Now I am going to give an outline of the main issues relating to the financialrelationship between the mainland and Hong Kong after 1997.Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own system of currency issuance andmanagement after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender inHong Kong and the mainland respectively. Hong Kong’s existing note-issuing arrangements willremain unchanged. Moreover, China supports Hong Kong’s commitment to the maintenance ofthe linked exchange rate system.It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainlandand Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities, i.e. the People’s Bank of China and theHKMA, will also be mutually independent. The HKMA will be accountable solely to the HongKong Government. The People’s Bank of China will not take the place of the HKMA and will notset up any office in Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China will strengthen further its presentsound co-operation with the HKMA. The HKMA has made great contributions to the stability ofthe local currency and the supervision of financial institutions. Such efforts by the HKMA helppromote the prosperity and smooth transition of Hong Kong.The Hong Kong Government will continue to supervise local financial institutions.The supervision will continue to be undertaken in accordance with Hong Kong’s laws andinternational rules and practices. mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy anyprivileges. They shall be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong.BIS Review   12/1997
- 4 -The Exchange Fund of Hong Kong shall be managed and controlled by the HongKong Government. The financial revenues of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shallbe used exclusively for its own purposes and the Chinese Government shall not levy taxes inHong Kong. Moreover, China will not draw on or resort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or otherassets in any way and for any reason.All financial transactions between the mainland and Hong Kong will be conductedin accordance with the rules and practices of international financial activities. Claims andliabilities between institutions from the mainland and those from Hong Kong will continue to beregarded as external claims and liabilities. When participating in the Hong Kong market, Chineseentities will have equal treatment as other international and local market participants.Apart from the above, it is also important for Hong Kong as an internationalfinancial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations and participate in theactivities of international and regional financial institutions. There are therefore provisions in theJoint Declaration and the Basic Law that Hong Kong may, on its own, maintain and developfinancial relations with other countries, regions and relevant international organisations after1997. The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meeting will be held in Hong Kong just a few monthsafter China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is a magnificent financialevent and I am confident that it will be successful.III The strengthening of financial co-operation and the promotion of economic prosperity andstability between the mainland and Hong KongMainland China and Hong Kong have close financial links with each other. Sincethe implementation of financial reforms and the open-door policy, such links have beenstrengthened further. It is necessary to further enhance such a mutually beneficial relationshipbetween the two places.First of all, the mainland and Hong Kong should work together for the prosperity,stability and smooth transition of Hong Kong. China’s commitment to the implementation of the“one country, two systems” principle is increasingly accepted and appreciated by the people ofHong Kong and the international community. Worries and doubts about the future of Hong Kongwhich emerged in the early 1980’s have largely subsided. We are pleased to note that the financialsituation in Hong Kong is heading towards a smooth transition. We are confident that Hong Kongwill enjoy financial stability before and after 1997. Even though there may be some fluctuationsin Hong Kong’s financial market, we believe that the HKMA is fully capable of handling thesesituations satisfactorily. If necessary, the People’s Bank of China will, at the request of theHKMA and in accordance with the Basic Law and market practices, offer support to the HKMA.Financial stability in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is not only essential to the prosperity ofHong Kong and China but also to financial stability in the Asia-Pacific Region. We are confidentthat the international financial community, including the central banks in the Asia-Pacific Region,will be actively involved in the efforts to maintain Hong Kong’s financial stability.Secondly, the two places should work closely together to maintain and enhanceHong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. Hong Kong has some unique competitiveadvantages in being an international financial centre in a number of aspects such as opportunities,geographic location and people. I have made it clear to the international financial community onmany occasions that after China’s resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the status of HongKong as an international financial centre will not be undermined but, rather, it will be furtherstrengthened. This is because the many unique advantages which Hong Kong enjoys now willBIS Review   12/1997
- 5 -continue to exist after 1997. There is also the Basic Law which guarantees that Hong Kong willremain unchanged. More importantly, with the sustained, rapid and healthy growth of theeconomy in China - the vast hinterland at the back of Hong Kong - numerous opportunities willbe created for Hong Kong’s financial sector. All these are favourable conditions for themaintenance and strengthening of Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.Economic developments in the mainland have given rise to strong demand for funds and HongKong will continue to be our major funding centre. We will strengthen our coordination and co-operation with Hong Kong in areas such as the development of markets and infrastructures inresponse to the needs of financial developments in both places. I have met with many centralbankers and major international bankers and they all agreed that Hong Kong should be able tomaintain its status as an international financial centre as regards the future relationship betweenHong Kong and Shanghai. I think as a national economic centre, Shanghai’s financial status willbecome increasingly important. However, it will not be possible for Shanghai to become aninternational financial centre in the longer term and it will not replace Hong Kong.Thirdly, the mainland and Hong Kong should co-operate fully with each other so asto promote prosperity and stability. Since the implementation of economic reforms and the open-door policy, financial co-operation between the two places has been strengthened which, in turn,helps to develop economic and trading ties. At present, China and Hong Kong are each other’smajor investment and trading partner. As at the end of 1995, Hong Kong’s total cumulativeinvestment in China reached US$ 78.6 billion, accounting for 58% of total foreign investment inChina. In 1995, 90% of the syndicated loans to China were arranged in Hong Kong and 90% ofthe Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets have their primary listing in Hong Kong.The volume of import and export trade between the two places amounted to US$ 44.6 billion lastyear, accounting for 15.9% of China’s total external trade. If Hong Kong’s entrepôt trade whichcame from China is also taken into account, the figure reached US$ 124.1 billion, accounting for34.1% of Hong Kong’s total external trade in that year. The number of mainland financialinstitutions in Hong Kong is on the rise and vice versa. These institutions are going to provide awhole range of financial services which are conducive to the continuous and stable developmentof the economic relationship between the two places.China will further open up its financial markets. This includes the opening up ofmore districts, the gradual relaxation of renminbi business and the gradual introduction of theinvestment banking mechanism. The Hong Kong financial sector will directly benefit from thesemoves since they will offer numerous business opportunities. In the course of stepping up ourpace of financial reforms, we have to keep on learning from advanced international managementexperience and to provide training to outstanding personnel. We hope that the financialcommunity in Hong Kong will provide us with assistance and support in these areas.Before ending my speech, I would like to point out that the Hong Kong Associationof Banks has contributed a lot in assisting the HKMA to ensure the financial stability of HongKong. I hope all of you will continue to give your support to the HKMA and play a more activerole in promoting economic and financial developments in Hong Kong and its smooth transition. Iwould also like to announce that an association of mainland banks will be formed this year. I hopethat the two banking associations will strengthen their exchanges and co-operation and worktogether for a more prosperous future.A delegation from the Hong Kong Association of Banks will visit Beijing in a fewdays. I would like to welcome the delegation on behalf of the People’s Bank of China. I will meetwith some of you again on that occasion. We can further exchange views on the strengthening ofco-operation between the banking sectors on the mainland and in Hong Kong.BIS Review   12/1997
Mr. Kent examines the challenges facing the UK commercial propertymarket as it moves towards the 21st century   Speech by Mr. Pen Kent, an Executive Directorof the Bank of England, to The Investment Property Forum Annual Lunch in London on15/1/97.Introduction1  The IPF has built up a significant and diverse membership in recent years andhas deservedly become one of the most prominent and respected trade associations within yourindustry. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address you all this afternoon.2  When Mark Burton suggested that I might look back at developments in thecommercial property market during the eight years that I have been doing my present job, thatappealed to me because I shall be retiring from the Bank next month. But I also like to look tothe future and to identify coming issues and challenges. With that in mind, I will also pick outsome of the factors relevant to the industry as it moves forward.The Past3  My involvement with commercial property began in 1985, when plans forCanary Wharf were beginning to materialise. One of the questions put to the Bank by thedevelopers was whether we would change our policy encouraging banks to have their officesclose to the Bank. We recognised that our policy was distorting the market and we decided tomake the change. I have followed the property story ever since. But, for today’s purposes, I shalltake as my starting point a speech given by the previous Governor to the RICS in Paris inOctober 1989. You will recall that everything in the garden then seemed rosy. Cranes wereeverywhere on the horizon; there was an expectation that rents and capital values could onlymove upwards. Banks were developing innovative financing techniques and competing fiercelywith one another to finance all this activity. Income returns were not out of the ordinary but themarket was underpinned by the prospect of capital gain.4  Yet some participants and commentators were beginning to have concernsabout the scale of development. The Governor questioned whether there would be sufficientdemand for the supply coming on stream. He noted too the banks’ rapidly growing exposure tothe sector. The sector was quite simply heading for overcapacity and overgearing. Why did thelenders not see it coming? Perhaps inability or unwillingness to see the big picture was onereason - but more of that later. We have been asked quite often why we as the supervisor ofbanks did not stop them overlending. The answer remains the same. The banks have to beresponsible for their own commercial decisions. We are there to protect their depositors, nottheir shareholders. But we can usefully draw their attention to gathering clouds - and that is whatwe did.5  As we all know, the required level of demand did not materialise. The resultantoversupply of space contributed to one of the most severe downturns that the commercialproperty industry has ever seen. Since then, other asset classes have outperformed commercialproperty in most years. Many institutional investors have responded by continuing to reducetheir property holdings. Property companies have suffered; we have seen some high profilefailures and reschedulings. The banks have suffered very sizeable losses on commercialproperty. Construction companies and associated professions such as architects and designershave suffered from the reduced workload on commercial property. And we must not forget theBIS Review   11/1997
- 2 -valuing and surveying professions; the upturn in insolvency-related work was not sufficient tooffset lower turnover and the corresponding heavy pressure on fees.6  Possibly the only ones to benefit from the downturn were tenants fortunateenough to sign new leases in an environment of falling rents. The modest extent of subsequentdevelopment has probably meant that even these ‘beneficiaries’ have had a more limited choiceof accommodation.7  Other factors have also made the market very challenging, especially forinvestors and lenders. These have included the speed of building obsolescence and growingpressure on companies to manage property resources more effectively. Several initiatives aimedat enhancing the market’s efficiency and attractiveness made little headway in the first half ofthe 1990s. These included efforts to enhance liquidity, to develop property derivatives, and toimprove information on the very sizeable part of the market that is not ‘prime’. In addition,efforts to enhance transparency have not progressed as well as I myself and many marketparticipants had hoped.8  There have of course been some positive developments, such as thedevelopment by BZW of Property Investment Certificates, the growing importance of dataproduced by the Investment Property Databank, and the development by RICS of new valuationstandards in the revised Red Book. Some of the trade associations, such as the IPF and theAssociation of Property Bankers, have also developed well and have begun to play a veryimportant role. I believe the Bank of England’s Property Forum, set up in 1993 to bring all sidesof the industry together, has also made a positive contribution. But these developments cannotobscure the fact that, on the whole, this period has been one of disappointment. Property’s poorperformance in the past few years has undoubtedly caused some to consider very carefullywhether or not they wish to remain in property.The Present9  Are we turning a corner? The commercial property market is important to theUK economy in many ways. Property and related activities such as construction make asignificant contribution to GDP. The availability of property of the right standards at the rightprice is very important to UK competitiveness. This puts some onus on landlords to providewhat is wanted. It is equally important that the planning authorities should continue to provide aconsistent and flexible planning framework in which developers and landlords can operate andearn a satisfactory return. It is pleasing that the market is at last beginning to show signs ofstrengthening. Indeed there is some evidence of incipient overheating.10  Many institutional investors are taking the view that commercial property willbe one of the better performing asset classes over the next couple of years and there is significantbuying activity both from UK and overseas. There are increasing signs of development,involving both institutional investors and, on quite a large scale, property companies. And thebanks too have been showing strong interest in the sector, with many new entrants joining thelarge number of more established participants.11  Finally, there are encouraging signs of progress on several initiatives. The IPFhas made its case to the Treasury for a change in the tax status of securitised vehicles, and othersare looking to develop existing routes. Many investors are telling us that progress onsecuritisation will be crucial if they are to remain in property at all, so the better tone is not avalid excuse to give up on structural improvements to the market. There is welcome progress onBIS Review   11/1997
- 3 -the derivatives front, through BZW’s Property Index Forward instrument and the REIMinitiative. Some participants are showing interest in improving the quality of marketinformation. The Incorporated Society of Valuers and the RICS are funding research by IPDinto the performance of the secondary market and, although this project is still in its infancy, Ihope very much that you will support these efforts as the project develops. Indeed, on the basisthat transparency generally improves the performance of markets, I would, personally, supportJohn Ritblat’s opinion that commercial transaction prices should be made public through theland register. Some of you would lose proprietorial advantage as a result in the short term, but inthe long run a more liquid market benefits the most professional more than the free riders.12  It would, however, be rash to conclude that the market is now unambiguouslyhealthy in all respects. There are still several factors which will continue to pose challenges tothe investment, banking and valuing communities. For example, while lease lengths may havetemporarily stabilised, break clauses exercisable by tenants are becoming more common. Anddespite the positive tone of the recent CBI/Grimley survey, it is clear too that many occupierswill continue over the long-term to reduce their needs for space and to demand greaterflexibility. Privity of contract has disappeared on new leases. All of these factors are making itless straightforward to form a view of the quality of cashflow likely to stem from a particularbuilding.13  There is a sizeable overhang of unlet secondary property. The pool of suchproperty increases every time that a major user of space moves into new offices and releases itsformer premises. While some of the better quality secondary property can be refurbished at aneconomic price and relet, much of this stock may never again be relet for its present use and maynot lend itself readily to conversion for alternative uses. This will continue to exert a dampeninginfluence on the market, and imaginative solutions will be needed.The Future14  So, the market may be improving but it is still not easy. How is the marketlikely to develop over the next eight years? What will I be saying if you invite me back in theyear 2005?15  As we all know, the property market has, historically, moved in cycles. Some,notably RICS, have done work to develop our understanding of these cycles. The economiccycle itself is clearly one of the driving factors, though it is clear too that property is subject toits own fluctuations and its own step changes. Contributing factors include the strength of tenantdemand, the activities of developers and the willingness of lenders to finance investment anddevelopment.16  My story in the future could be similar - perhaps depressingly similar - to myreview of the recent past. Many of the ‘ingredients’ that contributed to the last cycle arecertainly present now. Institutional investors are attracted to the sector in the short-term but theycould easily resume their longer-term departure from property in a couple of years. This couldhappen if property’s performance runs out of steam as the economic cycle progresses and otherasset classes begin to look more attractive. It is conceivable that the banks might becomedisillusioned with property again, particularly if they relax their lending criteria too far in thecurrent exceptionally competitive lending market. This could also happen if they are seduced bythe outlook for the better properties into taking excessive risks on the secondary and tertiarysectors, for which the outlook generally appears rather less bright. We are in favour of healthycompetition among lenders but history suggests that the seeds of tomorrow’s losses are sownBIS Review   11/1997
- 4 -when lenders relax the basics such as loan to value ratios and income cover; or when they takevery bullish views on the likely strength of cashflows. We hear that some lenders are seeking topressurise valuers into higher valuations. This is not a healthy practise and we hope both thelenders and the valuing profession will be strong enough to resist and will stick to the principlesof the new Red Book.17  There are undoubtedly differences between 1989 and this stage of the presentcycle, perhaps the most notable of which are the comparatively limited scale of speculativedevelopment and more realistic expectations. And notwithstanding my rather jaundiced remarksabove about forgotten lessons, some of the risks involved in commercial property are now betterunderstood. This could simply mean that this cycle will repeat history but in a less pronouncedway than last time. Perhaps I should at this point recognise the VAT changes announced in thelast budget. These have caused a strong reaction from the property industry. They have caused ahalt to a number of major deals. I do not know how the matter will be resolved and will notspeculate whether the impact will be lasting. More of that no doubt in coming weeks. But arethere any other new influences which could bring about a different - and better - outcome thanthe last cycle? There are at least four other important factors which arguably did not exist in1989. They may all make the market less volatile in the years ahead. Let me be a bit visionary.18  The first of these is a low inflationary environment. The political constituencyfor low inflation is now almost certainly stronger than at any time in living memory. There is areal prospect that a low inflation environment can be sustained into the future. This is a profoundchange and should help to smooth the path of future economic cycles. This environment is likelyto mean slower growth in nominal rents and also less volatile capital values. The emphasis willcontinue to change from capital gain to running yield. Poor investment or loan decisions will notbe forgiven by inflation. This environment will alter attitudes to property, especially amongusers who will increasingly regard it purely as a factor of production subject to the fulldisciplines of cost controls. But lower nominal rents need not mean lower real income.19  The second fundamental difference lies in the role, and potential, of thePrivate Finance Initiative. In many ways, the PFI simply reflects processes already underway inthe private sector whereby occupiers are seeking more flexible arrangements and are prepared topay a price for changing the traditional relationship between landlord and tenant. It opens up thepossibilities for more imaginative use of property, and the principles are applicable both topublic and private sector users of property. The providers of services, whether public sector orprivate, no longer want automatically to own the productive assets needed to provide them. Theyprefer to rent them instead with a higher level of service as part of the deal. Landlords withproperty expertise are well placed to provide this wider type of service and have a competitiveadvantage in doing so compared with less experienced operators. And maybe the word“property” will itself imply something too narrow. Owners will provide a working environment.They may move from “core and shell” to “finish and facilitate”. Indeed in some PFI cases theowners will go even further and operate as well, “provide and process” you might say. Thiswould give outsourcing a new meaning. Perhaps from your point of view it should be calledinsourcing. If risks are properly identified and priced, the PFI potentially can provide the longer-term bond-type investments that many of you are seeking. It offers great opportunities to all ofyou. This revolution has only just begun.20 A third issue that is particularly relevant now is technology. It has undoubtedlycontributed to property obsolescence. But technology is potentially an important ally, and inmore senses than one. Developments in building and construction techniques, as well as smallerand more powerful machinery and computer technology, facilitate the construction of buildingsBIS Review   11/1997
- 5 -that meet occupiers’ needs. Information technology enhances the usability and efficiency ofproperty as an asset class. Just as Mr. Otis made skyscrapers possible, one of you will createcompletely new configurations of site exploitation - or develop new and integrated relationshipsbetween different buildings. The automobile and advertising have entirely altered the shape,size, appearance and location of shops in the USA - and to a lesser extent here. But today’soffices still look pretty much to me like those designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Is there scopefor an IT driven revolution in the next eight years in which the working environment istransformed into a virtual reality? I do not know but I am convinced we ain’t seen nothing yet.21  The fourth factor could make an important difference - greater marketliquidity and instruments such as derivatives which will facilitate short-term tactical position-taking or investment. The enthusiasm and momentum for them is apparent both from what themarket tells us and from recent surveys. A clear message from our wide range of propertycontacts is that greater liquidity is essential if commercial property is to remain attractive as anasset class. There is equally a clear message that successful development of securitisation andderivatives will not on its own be the saviour of commercial property. But without it propertywill not turn in a performance which can stand comparison with competing assets. We need amature, liquid cash market in property with a healthy derivative market to permit successfulmanagement of risk. These are essential characteristics of efficient markets which are necessaryfor efficient use of property by users as a factor of production. Without such a developmentthere is a risk that the costs of doing business in the UK will be uncompetitively high. I do notknow how, or indeed whether, the obstacles to the development of such markets can be easilyfound. But I regard these issues as nationally important.Conclusion22  So, what is likely to happen in the next eight years? Let me sum up my vision.23  The current strong commitment to keeping inflation in check will createconditions more conducive to rational long-term decisions. Commercial property is still to alarge extent a longer-term asset and should benefit from this environment. The market willrequire property investors and owners to recognise and adapt to changing requirements from theusers, particularly their increasing wish to manage the risks of property occupation moreefficiently. It will require a willingness to work in partnership with tenants and to exploit thebenefits of technology to the full. Lenders and other property professionals will need tounderstand and embrace these changes. I know that some of you already recognise this. Some ofyou are not afraid of the PFI. We have recently had the end of history, the end of politics. Willthe end of distance be next? Will “location, location, location” be replaced by “communications,communications, communications”?24  This environment offers opportunities which you may - or may not - wish totake. Those who take these opportunities will be the survivors and thrivers. I leave you with myold refrain ringing in your ears: transparency; liquidity; intelligent investment; revenue notcapital gain; innovation - all the qualities of a deep, high quality market place.BIS Review   11/1997
Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve Board on thesupervision of US banks if they are authorized to widen their activities   Testimony ofChairman of th Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan,before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government-Sponsored Enterprisesof the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on19/3/97.Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me topresent the views of the Federal Reserve Board on the supervision of our nation’s bankingorganizations should they be authorized by the Congress to engage in a wider range of activities.As you know, the Board has supported financial modernization for many years and hopes thatthe Congress will act to facilitate reforms that, by enhancing competition within the financialservices industry, would benefit the consumers of financial products in the United States.Financial modernization may well mean that future banking organizations will besufficiently different from today as to require perhaps substantial changes in the supervisoryprocess for the entire organization. Just how much modification may be needed will depend onthe kinds of reforms the Congress adopts. In evaluating those modifications, I would like tounderline the significant supervisory role required by the Federal Reserve to carry out its centralbank responsibilities. I also would like briefly to discuss the continued importance of umbrellasupervision and the implications of a wider role for bank subsidiaries in the modernizationprocess.Supervision and Central BankingThere are compelling reasons why the central bank of the United States -- theFederal Reserve -- should continue to be involved in the supervision of banks. The supervisoryactivities of the Federal Reserve, for example, have benefited from its economic stabilizationresponsibilities and its recognition that safety and soundness goals for banks must be evaluatedjointly with its responsibilities for the stability and growth of the economy. The Board believesthat these joint responsibilities make for better supervisory and monetary policies than wouldresult from either a supervisor divorced from economic responsibilities or a macroeconomicpolicymaker with no practical experience in the review of individual bank operations.To carry out its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve has been required to developextensive, detailed knowledge of the intricacies of the U.S., and indeed the world, financialsystem. That expertise is the result of dealing constantly over many decades with changingfinancial markets and institutions and their relationships with each other and with the economy,and from exercising supervisory responsibilities. It comes as well from ongoing interactions withcentral banks and financial institutions abroad. These international contacts are critical becausetoday crises can spread more rapidly than in earlier times -- in large part reflecting newtechnologies -- and require a coordinated international response.Crisis Management and Systemic RiskSecond only to its macrostability responsibilities is the central bank’sresponsibility to use its authority and expertise to forestall financial crises (including systemicdisturbances in the banking system) and to manage such crises once they occur. In a crisis, theFederal Reserve, to be sure, could always flood the market with liquidity through open marketoperations and discount window loans; at times it has stood ready to do so, and it does not needsupervisory and regulatory responsibilities to exercise that power. But while sometimesBIS Review   31/1997
necessary in times of crises, such an approach may be costly and distortive to economicincentives and long-term growth, as well as an insufficient remedy. Supervisory and regulatoryresponsibilities give the Federal Reserve both the insight and the authority to use techniques thatare less blunt and more precisely calibrated to the problem at hand. Such tools improve ourability to manage crises and, more importantly, to avoid them. The use of such techniquesrequires both the authority that comes with supervision and regulation and the understanding ofthe linkages among supervision and regulation, prudential standards, risk taking, relationshipsamong banks and other financial market participants, and macroeconomic stability.Our financial system -- market oriented and characterized by innovation and rapidchange -- imparts significant benefits to our economy. But one of the consequences of such adynamic system is that it is subject to episodes of stress. In the 1980s and early 1990s we faced aseries of international debt crises, a major stock market crash, the collapse of the most importantplayer in the junk bond market, the virtual failure of the S&L industry, and extensive losses atmany banking institutions. More recently, we faced another Mexican crisis and, while in theevent less disruptive, the failure of a large British merchant bank. In such situations the FederalReserve stands ready to provide liquidity, if necessary, and monitors continuously the conditionof depository institutions to contain the secondary consequences of any problem. The objectivesof the central bank in crisis management are to contain financial losses and prevent a contagiousloss of confidence so that difficulties at one institution do not spread more widely to others. Thefocus of its concern is not to avoid the failure of entities that have made poor decisions or havehad bad luck, but rather to see that such failures -- or threats of failures -- do not have broad andserious impacts on financial markets and the national, and indeed the global, economy.The Federal Reserve’s ability to respond expeditiously to any particular incidentdoes not necessitate comprehensive information on each banking institution. But it does requirethat the Federal Reserve have in-depth knowledge of how institutions of various sizes and othercharacteristics are likely to behave, and what resources are available to them in the event ofsevere financial stress. Even for those events that might, but do not, precipitate financial crises,the authorities turn first to the Federal Reserve, not only because, as former Chairman Volckernoted last month, we have the money, but also because we have the expertise and the experience.We currently gain the necessary insight by having a broad sample of banks subject to oursupervision and through our authority over bank holding companies.Payment and Settlement SystemsVirtually all of the U.S. dollar transactions made worldwide -- for securitiestransfers, foreign exchange and other international capital flows, and for payment for goods andservices -- are settled in the United States banking system. A small number of transactions thatcomprise the vast proportion of the total value of transactions are transferred over large-dollarpayment systems. Banks use two of these systems -- Fedwire, operated by the Federal Reserve,and CHIPS, operated by the New York Clearing House -- currently to transfer $1.6 trillion and$1.3 trillion a day, respectively. CHIPS settles its members’ net positions on Fedwire.These interbank transfers, for banks’ own accounts and for those of theircustomers, occur and are settled over a network and structure that is the backbone of the U.S.financial system. Indeed, it is arguably the linchpin of the international system of payments thatrelies on the dollar as the major international currency for trade and finance. Disruptions anddisturbances in the U.S. payment system thus can easily have global implications. Fedwire,CHIPS, and the specialized depositories and clearinghouses for securities and other financialinstruments, are crucial to the integrity and stability not only of our financial markets andBIS Review   31/1997
- 3 -economy, but those of the world. Similarly, adverse developments in transfers in London,Tokyo, Singapore, and a host of other centers could rapidly be transferred here, given thefinancial interrelationships among the individual trading nations.In all these payment and settlement systems, commercial banks play a centralrole, both as participants and providers of credit to nonbank participants. Day-in and day-out, thesettlement of payment obligations and securities trades requires significant amounts of bankcredit. In periods of stress, such credit demands surge just at the time when some banks are leastwilling or able to meet them. These demands, if unmet, could produce gridlock in payment andsettlement systems, halting activity in financial markets. Indeed, it is in the cauldron of thepayments and settlement systems, where decisions involving large sums must be made quickly,that all of the risks and uncertainties associated with problems at a single participant becomefocussed as participants seek to protect themselves from uncertainty. Better solvent than sorry,they might well decide, and refuse to honor a payment request. Observing that, others mightfollow suit. And that is how crises often begin.Limiting, if not avoiding, such disruptions and ensuring the continued operationof the payment system requires broad and indepth knowledge of banking and markets, as well asdetailed knowledge and authority with respect to the payment and settlement arrangements andtheir linkages to banking operations. This type of understanding and authority -- as well asknowledge about the behavior of key participants -- cannot be created on an ad hoc basis. Itrequires broad and sustained involvement in both the payment infrastructure and the operation ofthe banking system. Supervisory authority over the major bank participants is a necessaryelement.Monetary PolicyWhile financial crises and payment systems disruptions arise only sporadically,the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy on an ongoing basis. In this area, too, the FederalReserve’s role in supervision and regulation provides an important perspective to the policyprocess. Monetary policy works through financial institutions and markets to affect theeconomy, and depository institutions are a key element in those markets. Indeed, banks andthrifts are more important in this regard than might be suggested by a simple arithmeticcalculation of their share of total credit flows. While diverse securities markets handle the lion’sshare of credit flows these days, banks are the backup source of liquidity to many of thesecurities firms and large borrowers participating in these markets. Moreover, banks at all timesare the most important source of credit to most small and intermediate-sized firms that do nothave ready access to securities markets. These firms are the catalyst for U.S. economic growthand the prime source of new employment opportunities for our citizens. The Federal Reservemust make its monetary policy with a view to how banks are responding to the economicenvironment. This was especially important during the “credit crunch” of 1990. Our supervisoryresponsibilities give us important qualitative and quantitative information that not only helps usin the design of monetary policy, but provides important feedback on how our policy stance isaffecting bank actions.The macroeconomic stabilization responsibilities of the Federal Reserve make usparticularly sensitive to how regulatory and supervisory postures can influence bank behaviorand hence how banks respond to monetary policy actions. For example, capital, liquidity, loanloss reserve, and asset quality evaluation policies of supervisors will directly influence themanner and speed with which monetary policy actions work. In the development of interagencyrules and policies, the Federal Reserve brings to the table its unique concerns about the impact ofBIS Review   31/1997
these rules on credit availability, potential responses to changes in interest rates, and theconsequences for the economy. We believe that, as a result, supervisory policy is improved.Federal Reserve’s Supervisory RoleFor all of these reasons, the Board believes the Federal Reserve needs to retain asignificant supervisory role in the banking system. Just exactly how that is achieved dependscritically on the types of reforms the Congress enacts and the direction the banking industrytakes in structuring and conducting its activities. In the Board’s view, its current authority isadequate for the current structure. For today’s financial system, we are able to meet ourobligations by the intelligence we gain from, and the authorities we have over the modestnumber of large banks we directly supervise and the holding companies of these and other largebanks over which we have a direct umbrella supervisory role. Our information is importantlysupplemented by our supervision of a number of other banks of all sizes, namely state memberbanks. Currently, the latter group gives us a good representative sample of organizations of allsizes outside the largest entities.The large entities are essential if we are to address the Federal Reserve’s crisismanagement and systemic risk responsibilities, deal with international financial issues involvingforeign central banks, manage risk exposures in payment systems, and retain our practicalknowledge and skill base in rapidly changing financial markets. Large bank holding companiesare typically at the forefront in financial innovation and in developing sophisticated techniquesfor managing risks. It is crucial that the Federal Reserve stay informed of these events andunderstand directly how they work in practice. Directly supervising both these largeorganizations and a sample of others is also critical to our ability to conduct monetary policy bypermitting us to gain first-hand on-the-spot intelligence on how changes in financial markets --including those induced by monetary policy -- are affecting money and credit flows.If in the future the holding company becomes a less clear window into thebanking system, the Board believes that the Congress would need to change the supervisorystructure if the central bank is to carry out the responsibilities I have discussed today.Umbrella SupervisionThe Congress, in its review of financial modernization, must consider legal entitysupervision alone versus legal entity supervision supplemented by umbrella supervision. TheBoard believes that umbrella supervision is a realistic necessity for the protection of ourfinancial system and to limit any misuse of the sovereign credit, that is, the government’sguarantees that support the banking system through the safety net.The bank holding company organization increasingly is being managed so as totake advantage of the synergies between its component parts in order to deliver better productsto the market and higher returns to stockholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the model of theholding company is one in which the parent is just, in effect, a portfolio investor in itssubsidiary. Indeed, virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated unitsand are managed as such, especially in their management of risk.One could argue that regulators should be interested only in the entities theyregulate and, hence, review the risk evaluation process only as it relates to their regulated entity.Presumably each regulator of each entity -- the bank regulators, the SEC, the state insurance andany state finance company authorities -- would look only at how the risk management processBIS Review   31/1997
- 5 -affected their units. It is our belief that this simply will not be adequate. Risks managed on aconsolidated basis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by differentsupervisors.The latter logic motivated the congressional decision just five years ago to requirethat foreign banks could enter the United States if, and only if, they were subject to consolidatedsupervision. This decision, which is consistent with the international standards for consolidatedsupervision of banking organizations, was a good decision then. It is a good decision today,especially for those banking organizations whose disruption could cause major financialdisturbances in United States and foreign markets. For foreign and for U.S. bankingorganizations, retreat from consolidated supervision would, the Board believes, be a significantstep backward.We have to be careful, however, that consolidated umbrella supervision does notinadvertently so hamper the decisionmaking process of banking organizations as to render themineffectual. The Federal Reserve Board is accordingly in the process of reviewing its supervisorystructure and other procedures in order to reflect a market-directed shift from conventionalbalance sheet auditing to evaluation of the internal risk management process. Although focussedon the key risk management processes, it would sharply reduce routine supervisory umbrellapresence in holding companies. As the Committee knows, the Board has recently published forcomment proposals to expedite the applications process, and the legislation Congress enactedlast year eased such procedures as well. Nonetheless, the Board requests even greatermodification to its existing statutory mandate so that the required applications process could besharply cut back, particularly in the area of nonbank financial services.In the Board’s view, those entities interested in banks are really interested inaccess to the safety net, since it is far easier to engage in the nonsafety net activities of bankswithout acquiring a bank. If an organization chooses to deliver some of its services with the aidof the sovereign credit by acquiring a bank, it should not be excused from efforts of thegovernment to look out for the stability of the overall financial system. For bank holdingcompanies, this implies umbrella supervision. Although that process will increasingly bedesigned to reduce supervisory presence and be as nonintrusive as possible, umbrella supervisionshould not be eliminated, but recognized for what it is: the cost of obtaining a subsidy.Nonetheless, we would hope that should the Congress authorize wider activitiesfor financial services holding companies that it recognize that a bank which is a minor part ofsuch an organization (and its associated safety net) can be protected through adequate bankcapital requirements and the application of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.The case is weak, in our judgment, for umbrella supervision of a holding company in which thebank is not the dominant unit and is not large enough to induce systemic problems should it fail.Subsidiaries, Subsidies, and Safety NetsThe members of this Subcommittee are, I think, aware of the Board’s concernsthat the safety net constructed for banks inherently contains a subsidy, that conducting newactivities in subsidiaries of banks will inadvertently extend that subsidy, and that extension ofany subsidy is undesirable. The Subcommittee recently heard testimony that there is no netsubsidy and, therefore, the authorization of nonbank activities in bank subsidiaries would neitherinadvertently extend this undesirable side effect of the safety net nor reduce the importance ofthe holding company as a consequence of the increased incentives to shift activities from theholding company to the bank.BIS Review   31/1997
Mr. Chairman, I would like briefly to comment on these latter views.Subsidy values -- net or gross -- vary from bank to bank; riskier banks clearly geta larger subsidy from the safety net than safer banks. In addition, the value of the subsidy variesover time; in good times, markets incorporate a low risk premium and when markets turn weak,financial asset holders demand to be compensated by higher yields for holding claims on riskierentities. It is at this time that subsidy values are the most noticeable. What was it worth in thelate 1980s and early 1990s for a bank with a troubled loan portfolio to have deposit liabilitiesguaranteed by the FDIC, to be assured that it could turn illiquid to liquid assets at once throughthe Federal Reserve discount window, and to tell its customers that payment transfers would besettled on a riskless Federal Reserve Bank? For many, it was worth not basis points butpercentage points. For some, it meant the difference between survival and failure.It is argued by some that the cost of regulation exceeds the subsidy. I have nodoubt that the costs of regulation are large, too large in my judgment. But no bank has turned inits charter in order to operate without the cost of banking regulation, which would require that itoperate also without deposit insurance or access to the discount window or payments system. Todo so would require both higher deposit costs and higher capital. Indeed, it is a measure of thesize of banks’ net subsidy that most nonbank financial institutions are required by the market tooperate with significantly higher capital-to-asset ratios than banks. Most finance companies, forexample, with credit ratings and debenture interest costs equal to banks are forced by today’smarket to hold six or seven percentage points higher capital-to-asset ratios than those of banks.It is instructive that there are no private deposit insurers competing with theFDIC. For the same product offered by the FDIC, private insurers would have to chargepremiums far higher than those of government insurance, and still not be able to match thecertainty of payments in the event of default, the hallmark of a government insurer backed bythe sovereign credit of the United States.The Federal Reserve has a similar status with respect to the availability of thediscount window and riskless final settlement during a period of national economic stress.Providing such services is out of the reach of all private institutions. The markets placesubstantial values on these safety net subsidies, clearly in excess of the cost of regulation. Torepeat, were it otherwise, some banks would be dropping their charters if there were not a netsubsidy.In fact it is apparently the lower funding costs at banks that benefit directly fromthe subsidy of the safety net that has created the tendency for banking organizations to return tothe bank and its subsidiaries many activities that are authorized to banks. These activitiespreviously had been conducted in nonbank affiliates for reasons such as geographic and otherinflexibilities, which have gradually eased. Indeed, over the last decade the share of consolidatedassets of bank holding companies associated with nonbank affiliates -- other than Section 20securities affiliates -- has declined almost half to just 5.2 percent. This tendency reflects the factthat asset growth that earlier had been associated with nonbank affiliates of bank holdingcompanies -- consumer and commercial finance, leasing, and mortgage banking -- has mostrecently occurred largely in the bank or in a subsidiary of the bank. To be sure, as ChairmanHelfer indicated to the Subcommittee earlier this month, many banking organizations still retainnonbank subsidiaries. Our discussions with bank holding companies, however, suggest that insome cases, these affiliates were acquired in the past and have established names and aninterstate network whose value would be reduced if subsumed within a bank. There are alsoBIS Review   31/1997
- 7 -often adverse tax implications for the shift. And, finally, some of these activities may not beasset intensive and hence may not benefit significantly from bank funding.Clearly, the authorization of new activities in bank subsidiaries that are not nowpermitted either to banks or their affiliates would tend to accelerate the trend to reduce holdingcompany activity, even if these activities were also permitted to holding company subsidiaries.The subsidy inherent in the safety net would assure that result, extending the spread of the safetynet and requiring that the Federal Reserve’s authority and ability to meet its responsibilities beshifted to a different paradigm.Such a result is reason enough for our concern about the spreading of the safetynet subsidy. But we should also be concerned because of the distortions subsidies bring to thefinancial system more generally. After all, the broad premise underlying financialmodernization -- with its removal of legislative and regulatory restrictions -- is that free andoften intense competition will create the most efficient and customer-oriented business system.This principle has proved itself, generation by generation, with ever higherstandards of living.In financial, as well as most other, markets the principle is rooted in anotherpremise -- that the interaction of private competitive forces will, with rare exceptions, create astable error self-correcting system. This premise is very seriously called into question ifgovernment subsidies are supplied at key balancing points. By their nature, subsidies distort theestablishment of competitive market prices, and create incentives that misalign private risks withprivate gains. Such distortions undermine the error self-correcting mechanisms that supportstrong financial markets.We must be very careful that in the name of free market efficiency we do notcountenance greater powers and profits subsidized directly or indirectly by government.ConclusionMr. Chairman, in conclusion, the Board believes that as the Congress movestoward financial modernization the newly created structure of financial organizations shouldlimit, in so far as possible, the real and perceived transfer of the subsidy inherent in the safetynet to nonbank activities. To maintain a level playing field for all competitors, nonbankactivities must be financed at market, not subsidized, rates.The Board also believes that financial modernization should not undermine theability and authority of the central bank of the United States to manage crises, assure an efficientand safe payment system, and conduct monetary policy. We believe all of these require that theFederal Reserve retain a significant and important role as a bank supervisor. In today’s structure,we have adequate authority and coverage to meet our responsibilities. But should erosion occur,as would likely be the case if new activities are authorized in bank subsidiaries, the Congresswould have to consider what changes would be required in the Board’s supervisory authority toassure that it continues to be able to meet its central bank responsibilities.BIS Review   31/1997
Prof. Tietmeyer discusses the relationship between economic convergenceand EMU   Speech by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer,delivered to the Boersen Executive Club in Copenhagen on 14/3/97.IThe Boersen Executive Club has asked me to speak about “EconomicConvergence and EMU”. I shall be pleased to do so, especially as I can well imagine that youhere in Denmark are able to adopt a somewhat more relaxed and calmer approach to the subjectof “Convergence and EMU”.There are two obvious reasons for that. Firstly, Denmark itself has made distinctprogress in economic convergence during the past few years. That progress was documented inthe European Monetary Institute’s recently published Convergence Report.-The Danish krone has been stable internally for a good number of years.-It is unlikely that Denmark will have any problem with the exchange ratecriterion either. Happily, participation in the ERM - as in Germany - hasnever been at issue here.-And there has been notable progress in consolidating public finance.The assessment of Denmark in the European Monetary Institute’s ConvergenceReport was therefore decidedly more positive than that of Germany.The second reason why you in Denmark can be rather more relaxed on the subjectof “Convergence and EMU” is, of course, self-evident. Denmark has announced that, for thetime being, it is not going to participate in the third stage of monetary union.Naturally, we in Germany respect Denmark’s sovereign decision, even if we atthe Bundesbank are not unreservedly happy about that decision. That is because it is precisely inthe initial phase that we shall need stable partners in EMU. But the door is open. The terms ofentry are known on all sides. What has not happened yet can, of course, take place at some pointin the future. It goes without saying, however, that this is a matter for the Danes themselves todecide. Whatever decision Denmark ultimately takes on participating in the third stage, I hopethat exchange rate stability is maintained as before.It is likely that the Danish krone will belong at least to the exchange ratemechanism of “EMS II” from the outset. That would, at any rate, imply the existence of closebilateral links between the Danish krone and the euro. For the rest, it is precisely the economicand stability record of countries not wishing to belong from the outset which represents achallenge to and a commitment for the euro area. In this way, Denmark can play a part, at leastindirectly, in the anti-inflationary orientation of the euro, even if it does not join EMU at once.Naturally enough, the setting-up of an “EMS II” will, at the same time, enhancethe responsibility of the European Central Bank. A stable euro is an essential precondition forthe operation of an intra-European exchange rate system. I am convinced that the EuropeanCentral Bank will be fully aware of precisely that international responsibility for the euro as theanchor currency.BIS Review   30/1997
- 2 -There will also be other links between the Danish central bank and the EuropeanCentral Bank:-The Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank will be a member of theenlarged Governing Council of the ECB.-And the central banks of the countries with a derogation are also invited toparticipate in TARGET, the planned large-value payment system for theeuro.In saying that, I would ask you to understand why there has to be a minimum ofdivergence in the terms of participation in TARGET. Those terms have to take account of thediffering commitments of the central banks inside and outside the euro area.IIIn order to explain the relationship between economic convergence and EMU,there is, in the first place, a fairly simple textbook answer. By definition, a monetary unionabolishes, once and for all, the instrument of exchange rate adjustment between the participatingeconomies. The countries taking part must be able to do without that instrument for ever - evenif structural changes occur. That calls for the ability on the part of each participant to keep upwith the others in terms of economic and anti-inflationary performance, or - if it does fall behind- the ability to remedy a worsening of its competitive position by its own domestic efforts.These general requirements of a single currency area apply to the euro to a quitespecial degree. There are three reasons for this: Firstly, in the supranational euro area - incontrast to the usual national environment of a currency - there will be hardly any fiscal policymechanisms that would be able to counterbalance regional disequilibria. There will not be adominant central budget. At the Community level, there will be no network comparable to aninternal, national system of income redistribution. The public financial systems and socialsecurity will remain in the national domain.Secondly, any regional disequilibria in the euro area would scarcely be mitigatedby high labour mobility. Linguistic and cultural barriers will continue to exist. Furthermore,high labour mobility within Europe might even provoke opposition. In Germany, we havewitnessed something of that kind in the construction industry, owing to the fact that it depresseswages.And thirdly, the increased need for internal flexibility resulting from theirrevocably fixed exchange rates must be seen against the backdrop of current economicconditions in Europe. Most countries in Europe are faced with an enormous need for adjustmentanyway-as a result of the fiercer competition in the single market and in a globaleconomy-and as a result of a number of domestic problems which are probablyhome-grown: on the labour market, in public finance, in provision for oldage.The setting prefigured for the next decade is therefore a highly dynamic one. Thatwill, of course, not make it easier for any country to perform the task of holding its owneconomically in a monetary union.Bearing that in mind, it will be extremely important for the euro area to restrictentry to those countries which are ready in terms of their economic and anti-inflation policies.BIS Review   30/1997
- 3 -That is to prevent a lack of anti-inflationary convergence from being transformed into realeconomic divergence. Any split in real economic trends would, naturally, exert pressure in thedirection of a transfer and social union, or even of a European “super-state”, which you inDenmark - if I understand it correctly - do not want, and which we in Germany - I can assureyou - do not want either.Adequate and lasting convergence is in the individual countries’ own interests,however. That is because a country which is unable durably to pursue the same course as theothers in the euro area will itself get into difficulties - all the more so if the other countries arenot prepared to enter into a permanent burden-sharing arrangement, with all its attendantpolitical implications.IIIBesides that textbook answer to the question of the relationship betweenconvergence and EMU, there is another aspect. What a monetary union needs is not justconvergence in terms of the hard economic data. It also needs a convergence in terms ofthinking. That implies convergence in objectives and in how we interpret and explain theinteraction of economic forces. Monetary union will not just abolish the exchange rateinstrument domestically. It will of necessity also call for a single domestic and externalmonetary policy, and thus a common stance in a key policy area.For the euro area, however, achieving and maintaining a common stance of thiskind will undoubtedly be more difficult than for a traditional national currency area. Whereasthe currency will be supranational, it will generally remain the individual governments that willbe taking the decisions on economic and social policy. That is all the more reason why the euroneeds dominant patterns of preference which are common to all participants. That likewiseimplies the affirmation of major fundamental positions.Firstly, maintaining the value of money is the best contribution that monetarypolicy can make to economic growth and employment. Price stability is the foundation on whichsociety and policy-makers can and must carry out the necessary adjustments. Secondly, in theevent of conflict, internal price stability must have priority over external exchange rate stability.Thirdly, experience has shown that a central bank which is independent of the vagaries of day-to-day politics, and committed solely to the goal of price stability, helps to safeguard thatindispensable price stability. By the way, that might be even more important in a supranationalunion than in a purely national context.These three basic convictions are essential to a durably stable currency. That iswhy they have rightly been enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.-Article 107 lays down the European Central Bank’s independence ofinstructions.-The Statute of the European Central Bank requires it “to maintain pricestability” as its primary objective.-And Article 109 (1) and (2) require the EU Council to pursue externalexchange-rate policy without prejudice to the objective of maintainingprice stability.Any calls for the political control of the European Central Bank or for differentobjectives were thus firmly rejected five years ago, when the Treaty was signed.BIS Review   30/1997
- 4 -But it is, of course, not only the legal position created by the Maastricht Treatywhich argues in favour of the primacy of price stability and its safeguarding by means ofindependent monetary policy. Past experience and economic reason argue in its favour, too. It isimportant that this is perceived - and lastingly perceived - to be the case in all the participatingcountries. Otherwise, political conflicts might impose a heavy burden on monetary union at alater date.The task of preserving a durably stable currency is, however, one which has to befaced in other policy areas, too. It cannot be a matter for the monetary policy of the EuropeanCentral Bank alone - particularly since the ECB still has to establish its reputation and credibilityin the first place. However great a contribution an independent central bank can make to a stablecurrency, monetary policy is never conducted in a political vacuum or under laboratoryconditions. And, in the long run, a currency’s fate can never be divorced from the political andeconomic trends in the area in which it is used. That is why there is yet another item on the listof common features needed for a durably stable monetary union.The Euro requires, fourthly, a sense of and a willingness for shared responsibilityfor the currency in all the participating countries and in the various policy areas. That applies towage rate policy, for example. Above all, however, it applies to fiscal policy. It is the resoluteand lasting pursuit of sound policies that will be of crucial importance in that respect - and notany one-off measures.An effective stability pact is extremely important, too, for the same reason - astability pact being, incidentally, precisely in the interests of the smaller countries. After all, anyundisciplined behaviour on the part of a large partner country of substantial economic weightcould have a severe adverse impact on interest rates and on confidence in long-term stability,thus hampering the economic growth of its partners. The pact on stability and growth agreed inDublin is an important reminder and assertion of the need for that shared responsibility. Itsdetails are to be set down in legal texts during the next few weeks. What will be absolutelycrucial at this juncture is for the requirements laid down in Dublin to be spelled out in preciseterms. Failing this, there might easily be unnecessary conflict later on. And, of course, at a laterdate it will be necessary to apply those provisions consistently if excessive budget deficits areincurred.IVEMU being able to build on sufficient convergence in economic performance aswell as on sufficient convergence in the thinking of all the participating countries, wouldundoubtedly open up major opportunities for Europe. The economic advantages are obvious:-Exchange costs will cease to exist in trade within the euro area.-Exchange rates against the US dollar and the yen could become morestable.-The financial markets could expand and intensify, to the benefit ofcreditors and debtors.But, above all - and this is the key factor - overall competition will increase. Astable common currency will give the single market a new dimension. Admittedly, that does notby any means imply that the euro will solve the structural problems besetting a large number ofEuropean countries at present or in future. On the contrary, the pressure to adjust deriving fromthe single market and from globalisation will, if anything, tend to grow stronger rather thanweaker.BIS Review   30/1997
- 5 -Incidentally, the increasing competitive pressure by no means implies that allcountries have to pursue the same economic and social policies. Under the conditions obtainingnow and in the future, policy-makers will, in fact, have different options available to them tosatisfy their own preferences. But there is one precept that holds true for everyone, whether theylike it or not. Whatever policy a country may pursue, the economy must be viable, and compete,in an international setting on a durable basis.One gains the impression that, at the moment, the smaller countries in continentalEurope are having slightly less difficulty in adapting to changed competitive conditions. Perhapsthat is because it has always been more necessary for smaller countries to be flexible and provethemselves in foreign markets. Obviously, it is a case of “small is beautiful”. At any rate, boththe Netherlands and Denmark appear to be already a little way ahead of the larger countries onthe continent. Hence Germany is looking here towards Denmark with growing interest. TheGerman press reports on the “job miracle in the north” - especially as the fall in unemploymentand resilient growth is being accompanied by a marked course of consolidation in publicfinance.Last autumn, for example, the present Governor of the Dutch central bank andfuture President of the European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, was in a position to say:“I do not believe that there is a contradiction between fiscalconsolidation and creation of employment and economic growth.Evidence from ... Denmark supports my view. In Denmark, thegeneral government’s net borrowing will be reduced to almost abalanced budget in 1997, while the unemployment rate isexpected to decline to almost 9 % of the working population,compared with the all-time high of more than 12 % in 1994.”Admittedly, public finance is precisely the area in which Denmark has to beambitious. The provisional “no” to entry into the third stage of monetary union may be playing acertain role in the international financial markets. At least, that was how the OECD saw it in its1996 Economic Survey:“... the increase in Danish risk premiums seems high comparedwith other ERM members. Since the main feature that separatesDenmark from those countries is the discussion not to participatein stage III of ERM.”Denmark can now point to a positive interrelationship between higheremployment and sound public finance. In that respect, Denmark is a model for us in Germany.Our country is at present in the process of rethinking, and facing up to thesedifficult challenges. That is not a simple matter, especially as the structural inflexibilitiesexisting in Germany have arisen over a long period. Our own adjustments are all the moreimportant, seeing that we shall have to cope with the economic implications of Germanreunification for some considerable time to come.It is my hope and wish that we shall soon be able to make the progress that isneeded, and achieve positive results. That will undoubtedly be the case if we follow the pathtaken by our neighbours in the north and north-west. At all events, the Netherlands and Denmarkare setting important signposts, not only for us in Germany, but also for the road to EMU andbeyond.BIS Review   30/1997
Mr. George looks at the prospects for the UK economy and developmentstowards European Monetary Union   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England,Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Liverpool and District Bankers’ Institute Bi-Annual Dinner inLiverpool on 12/3/97.It is a very enjoyable - and vital - part of our job at the Bank of England to keepin touch with what is going on around the country. And we work quite hard at it - through visitslike this one; through our non-executive directors who have business interests in the regions andthrough our network of regional agents.Now the purpose of these contacts is to help us understand the reality behind ourprecious monetary and economic statistics, and to help us understand what is pre-occupying you.The economic reality I would say is not at all bad. Looking back over the longerterm, I detect an important change in attitudes in this country: where before people - bothemployers and employees - tended to look inwards and backwards, seeking to protect what theyhad had, now, it seems to me, they are increasingly looking outwards and forwards to newopportunities. It is a fundamental change. And over the past four years or so it has beencomplemented by a more stable macro-economic environment than most of us can remember inour professional life time. Putting these together has brought us consistently low inflation;steady and sustained growth; and gradually falling unemployment. And interest rates have beenlower and less volatile over this period than they have been for more than thirty years.Some people, it’s true, still say to me that all this has not had much effect onthem - it’s not like it was in the boom times! And I recognise, of course, that economicconditions do vary across regions and sectors and between individual companies. More than everbefore it’s a tough competitive world.But what most people say to me these days is that steady growth and low inflationis exactly what they want so that they can make rational, long-term, decisions in their ownbusinesses, which is what enables them to face the global competition. The majorpreoccupations that I hear are about whether our recent, more stable, economic environment willcontinue, and about the implications - good or bad - for that environment of a move to a singleEuropean currency.Let me say a word first about our domestic economic prospects before turning toEurope.In fact, Mr. Chairman, we set out the Bank’s views on the domestic economy atsome length in our quarterly Inflation Report only last month. But in summary we have seen agradual pick-up in the pace of activity over the past year, driven by domestic demand - notablyconsumer spending - so that the money supply and both demand and output are now growing atabove-trend rates. Other things equal we would expect that to continue.The picture is, however, complicated by the exaggerated strengthening of sterlingsince last summer - particularly against the European currencies - which probably reflectsuncertainties affecting the Continental countries at least as much as developments in our owneconomy. This strength of sterling poses, for the time being, a genuine monetary policydilemma. It will lead to a fall in inflation in the short run - over the rest of this year - as importprices fall. And it makes life very difficult for UK manufacturers exposed to internationalcompetition, so that our external trade position is likely to deteriorate - and that may have aBIS Review   29/1997
- 2 -longer-lasting effect on inflation. But these effects may not be enough to offset the gradualemergence of inflationary pressure looking forward to next year, stemming from continuingabove-trend growth of domestic demand.On that basis we advocated a moderate tightening of policy in order to slow thedomestic expansion to a pace that can be sustained in the medium and longer term.Let me be quite clear, for those who insist on over-dramatising these things, wewere not calling in the Inflation Report for “an immediate interest rate hike to bring an incipientboom to a juddering halt!” I should like to think that in the present more stable environment thatkind of language is anachronistic. What we in fact expected over the next couple of years iscontinuing growth somewhat above trend with inflation picking up towards 3%, though rising -which by our own past standards is a relatively benign outlook. What we are seeking to do is tomoderate the pace of expansion before inflationary pressures begin to build in order to ensurethat the outlook remains benign next year, and a year after, and well into the future. And that,Mr. Chairman, is precisely what most business people - whether in industry or commerce orfinancial businesses - tell us they would want us to do. It is also the purpose of theGovernment’s Inflation Target.Let me then turn to Europe and the question of monetary union.I do not think anyone questions that economic prosperity in Europe is crucial toeconomic prosperity in this country. Our fundamental interests are the same. And not manypeople question that the effective functioning of the European single market can make a majorcontribution to our collective prosperity - it is a positive sum game in our mutual interest. It isclear I think too that the single market in Europe will function more effectively if each membercountry pursues disciplined macro-economic policies in a context of structural, supply-side,flexibility - again as a matter of national as well as collective interest. So much it seems to me iscommon ground in all 15 EU member countries - and indeed beyond. Whatever happens inrelation to monetary union it is vital, it seems to me, that we hold on to this fundamentallyimportant consensus.Moving on from there to the narrower question of monetary union, the potentialeconomic benefits and risks have now become much clearer, and are rather well illustrated byour own present monetary policy dilemma. On the one hand, any manufacturer will tell you -after his experience since last summer - about the great advantage of intra-European exchangerate certainty. On the other hand, with the single currency comes the single monetary policy -the single, one-size-fits-all interest rate throughout the euro-area. The risk very simply is that thesingle interest rate may not in the event suit the domestic monetary policy needs of all theeuromember countries - just as the present level of German interest rates of around 3%,reflecting the disappointing weakness of the German economy, would not at this point suit theUK - where, as I have said, we need to moderate the pace of our economic expansion.The potential economic risks, as well as the potential benefits, were recognisedwhen the Maastricht Treaty was signed - and the famous “convergence criteria” were put intothe Treaty precisely in order to limit the risks. Looked at from an economic perspective it wouldbe a considerable mistake for monetary union to go ahead without reasonable confidence ofgenuine, sustainable, convergence between its members; and it would be a mistake for anyindividual country to apply to join - or to be allowed to join - unless it had achieved genuine,sustainable, convergence. But at the end of the day it is a political process - and no-one shouldunderestimate the political determination on the Continent to proceed according to the TreatyBIS Review   29/1997
- 3 -timetable. I only hope that those who will make the decision really appreciate that if theeconomics of monetary union were to turn out badly - resulting in policy tension between theeuro-member states - then it is unlikely to have its intended effect of advancing politicalharmony either.I would not at this stage care to put much money on the outcome - central bankersare a naturally cautious breed. But the prudent planning assumption is that monetary unionprobably will go ahead on time - at least among a limited group of countries. The question thenis what would that mean for you.Let me start with the timetable. A final decision on whether to go ahead, and whoshould participate, will need to be taken next spring. That would open the way to the immediatesetting up of the European Central Bank so that it could complete its preparations for theirrevocable fixing of exchange rates with effect from 1st January 1999.It is important to be clear what the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates means. Itdoes not mean that the participating national currencies would instantly disappear. They wouldcontinue to exist initially as separate denominations, or sub-units, of the euro, which would havebecome a currency in its own right. The DM or French franc or whatever would in effect relateto the euro just as pence relate to the pound - except that the fixed conversion rate would be agreat deal more complicated, extending to six significant figures!There would be no euro banknotes or coins at that stage, only book entries ineuro-denominated bank accounts for those who wished to use them. No-one would be compelledto use the euro; but equally no-one would be prohibited from using it or offeringeuro-denominated facilities. The European Central Bank and the National Central Bankmembers of the European System of Central Banks would denominate their transactions infinancial markets in euro, although euro-denominated amounts would be convertible intonational currency denominated amounts and vice versa through the payments system for thosethat wished. To provide added impetus, national governments will denominate new debt issuesin euros, and some at least may also convert their outstanding debt to the euro-denomination.Our working assumption is that banks and others active in the wholesale financialmarkets will in fact choose to transact most of their wholesale business in the euro-denominationmore or less from the start. And we assume that they will wish to offer euro-denominatedfacilities to major business customers that wished to use them. So, for example, non-financialcompanies, including large retailing companies, with an active business in other euro-areacountries may wish to be able to quote prices or undertake transactions in euros from an earlystage, although they would certainly still need to transact most of their local business in nationalcurrencies for some considerable period.On the other hand, we would not expect there to be much demand for bankingfacilities denominated in euros either for individuals or for the vast majority of smaller localbusinesses much before euro banknotes and coins become available in late 2001 or early 2002.At that point, the conversion of retail facilities into euros might proceed quite rapidly during thesubsequent six-month period when national currency notes and coin are to be withdrawn - butagain the principle of no compulsion and no prohibition would apply. Retail conversion is ofcourse a massive undertaking. But the timetable does at least provide some 4-5 years from nowfor people to prepare.BIS Review   29/1997
- 4 -The bottom line in all this is that if EMU goes ahead on time and whether the UKis in or out, the impact on your business will depend very much upon the nature of the businessyou are in.Up to now, we at the Bank have concentrated mainly on ensuring that the bankingsystem and the wholesale financial markets will be ready to operate in euros from Day 1,because they will be affected first, and they will be affected whether or not the UK is a part ofthe “first wave”. But we are conscious of the developing thirst for information from the rest ofthe business community. With this in mind, we have co-operated with the CBI and the BritishChambers of Commerce in organising regional workshops - including one to be held here inLiverpool on 23 April. We are participating too in seminars organised by the Forum of PrivateBusiness - and I am sure that if you are interested you will be able to prevail upon StanMendham, who I am delighted to see here this evening, to organise such a seminar here too! Ifyou are really lucky, 007 might even provide you with a short Bank of England guide:“Introduction of the Euro - what does it mean for business?” which, for reasons that I can’t quiteunderstand, in this case comes absolutely free.The picture is rather different if the UK were to opt out of monetary union - atleast for the time being. In that case the euro will be a foreign currency in the UK, andbusinesses, where appropriate, will need to cope with it from the 1 January 1999 just as theycope now with transactions and contracts denominated in deutschemarks, dollars, yen and thelike. But the huge difference between the ‘in’ and the ‘out’ scenario will be that notes and coinswould not be introduced in this country if we are an ‘out’, so that for most of us life would go onvery much as normal.Mr. Chairman, I have dwelt on the practical side of monetary union very brieflythis evening, because I fear that the practicalities may be overlooked in the passion of the debateabout the principle. But in my youth - which seems a very long time ago now - I was a boyscout, brought up with the motto “Be Prepared”. It is vital in this context that we are indeedprepared, whatever the outcome, and the Bank is determined to do all that we can to ensure thatwe are.And provided we have properly prepared ourselves I do not believe that monetaryunion need hold great terrors for this country whichever way the decision goes when the timecomes. If it is decided that EMU is a safe club for the UK to join then I think this country is aswell placed as any to live with its disciplines. If on the other hand, we remain on the outside butcontinue to behave responsibly - in our national interest, but also as a member of the EU - then Ithink the fears for inward investment, or for the future of the financial services industry in thiscountry, will prove to be exaggerated. The economic reality is that businesses - whetherfinancial or non-financial - will expand their activities in this country so long as it is profitablefor them to do so. They would be answerable to their shareholders if they behaved in any otherway.The key to economic prosperity in this country, Mr. Chairman, lies in continuedmacro-economic discipline in a context of structural, supply-side, flexibility, and that is trueregardless of monetary union. Provided - in or out - we persist in that, then we can continue todeliver a business climate of steady growth with low inflation for as far ahead as we can see.That is the best possible prospect for the bankers here this evening - and the best possibleprospect for their customers.BIS Review   29/1997

Mr. Greenspan looks at some important issues arising from new informationand communications technologies   Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors ofthe US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Conference on Privacy in theInformation Age held in Salt Lake City on 7/3/97.It is a pleasure to be with you this afternoon as you discuss some of the mostfundamental issues raised by our new information and communications technologies.The topic Senator Bennett has asked us all to address is privacy in the informationage. The central dilemma in these discussions almost always involves fundamental choices abouthow to strike prudent balances among the needs of individuals for privacy in their financial andcommercial transactions, as well as their personal communications; the needs of commerce tobring us new products and new means to communicate; and the needs of the authorities toprovide for the effective administration of government and to ensure the public safety. These arenot easy choices. I think we all need to have a healthy respect for all sides of the debate. Evenfurther, we need to be aware that the balances we strike in one era may need to be reexamined astechnology and circumstances change.The dictionary defines privacy as the state of being free from unsanctionedintrusion. This concept, to which Americans feel a very deep-seated attachment, is reflected inthe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which assures “The right of the people to be securein their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures....” Forthe government to intrude on one’s privacy is in a very fundamental sense a deprivation offreedom. It is one of those deeply sensed issues that transcends people’s constitutional or legalviews and delves into the realm of one’s sense of person.This is why the perceived threat to privacy from burgeoning technologicaladvance, coupled with an increasing sense of inefficacy in the face of sophisticated newtechnologies, has created such a stir. The fears of invasion of privacy, as a consequence ofinexorable forces seemingly out of the control of the average American, has risen to a majorpublic policy issue.A half century ago a number of writers expressed concern at a perceived everwidening intrusion of government into the lives of individuals. They feared the ultimatecollectivization of our society where individualism would be significantly diminished orexpunged, and the emergence of “Big Brother” would come to define and dominate our lives.1984, the year, as well as the book made famous by George Orwell in 1949, have come andgone. The outreach of government, if anything, has receded, especially with respect to the issuesof personal liberty, and its concomitant, personal privacy.I suspect that the fear of “Big Technology” when it arrives will travel the lessthreatening route of “Big Brother” before it.In preparation for addressing that issue, I believe it would be useful to examinesome of the interesting dimensions of the concept of privacy and its application to how humansociety arranges itself. Indeed, when it comes to the issue of privacy, humans are distinctlyambivalent. Greta Garbo made an institution of wanting to be alone. Yet, at the same time,human beings have always sought and presumably needed the presence of others in organizingtheir societies, even before we economists came on the scene to inform them about the benefitsof the division of labor.BIS Review   28/1997
- 2 -But the various paradigms by which we have chosen to organize ourselves wereclosely tied to how we viewed the relative value of individualism and its precondition, theimplicit need for privacy. In recent generations, the major competing forms of government, ofcourse, have been (1) a system based on individual rights with the role of the state largelydirected at protecting those rights (the United States being the most prominent example of thatform of government) and (2) the now defunct Soviet Union, and its eastern European satellites,which were the model of communist collectivization. In the latter, the individual wastheoretically subject to the will of the collective but, in reality, subjugated by an elite autocratichierarchy.In the Soviet system, rights inhered in the collective, which immediatelydismisses by definition any right to privacy. State intrusiveness in the form of the KGB or theStasi eviscerated any wall of personal separation that citizens may have sought.But, in the end, that form of government did not, probably could not, succeed.The human need for personal expression, property, and privacy, doubtless were significant inundermining those collectivist states. Indeed, since the end of World War II, we have had asclose as one can come to a controlled experiment in the comparative effectiveness of alternateforms of government organization. I refer to the extraordinary divergence in post-war recoverypatterns observed between West and East Germany. Both were rooted in the same historicculture and institutions, differing virtually only in the form of political and economicorganization, which were adopted by those societies at war’s end. Almost a half-century later,when the Berlin Wall was torn down, the results of this remarkable experiment vividly andunqualifiedly attested to the superiority of the West German free market system based onindividual rights, a system where people lived with minimum fear of the state’s intrusion intotheir daily lives. In East Germany, in contrast, to assure that society was appropriatelycollectivized, it was necessary to probe into the private lives of all individuals and suppressindividual freedoms. Human beings had to be molded by force to achieve the East Germanleaders’ distorted view of societal organization. Privacy was scarcely the goal or purpose of theEast German state. Indeed, intrusiveness into the lives of all of the citizens was perceived to bean essential ingredient in its organization.The political and economic results of the post-war competition between East andWest generally have been unequivocal. The free market capitalism of West Germany has beenjudged superior in all relevant respects, with very few dissenting from that conclusion. Thehuman need for privacy surely was a major factor in that outcome.To be sure, our newer information technologies can scarcely be perceived as thetype of threat to privacy as that of the Soviet state. Nonetheless, the same pressing need forprivacy, which helped upend the Soviet Union, can be expected to address and overcomeconcerns that our newer technologies will intrude on our cherished need for privacy.Communism fell because its practice eliminated personal incentives to work and to acquireproperty, except in a very limited sense. The existence of such incentives requires the broadfreedoms we enjoy to pursue our myriad personal goals. It was the deprivation of theseincentives and the suppressing of competition among individuals, the hallmark of a growingeconomy, which brought Communism down.Since privacy is such an evident value in our society, where technology threatensthat value, entrepreneurs can be counted on to seek means to defend it. The major resources theyhave devoted to encryption in the development of new communication systems attest to theeconomic value they place on privacy in communications. Moreover the pressures to enact legalBIS Review   28/1997
- 3 -prohibitions on the dissemination of personal records will also create incentives to producetechnologies that protect them. Indeed, the most effective means to counter technology’s erosionof privacy is technology itself.The marketplace is burgeoning with new devices to this end. These devices, ofcourse, include the many advances for encrypting and filtering information. We may even seethe deployment of technologies that permit individuals to make choices calibrating their degreeof privacy in conducting individual transactions.With some irony, even some of the ability of the government to pursue protectionof individual rights is being impaired by effective encryption. This leads to the importantquestion of how to balance the legitimate expectations of individuals for privacy with the needsof government for information to effectively administer the laws and provide for the publicsafety. The most delicate care is needed in this regard to prevent unnecessary intrusion whenspecific government decisions are implemented and to avoid the risk of a gradual, long-termerosion of privacy.Beyond these issues are immediate questions about privacy in the delivery ofprofessional, commercial, and financial services over open computer networks as well aspersonal communications through devices such as e-mail. For example, there are typically strongassumptions about privacy surrounding medical, legal, and financial communications andrecords. These assumptions are designed to safeguard the autonomy of the individual and tofacilitate a society where special expertise can be developed and called upon, when necessary, topromote the individual’s welfare. It would be a strange outcome, indeed, if traditional notions ofprivacy applied only at the physical office of the doctor, lawyer, or banker, but not when moderncomputer technologies were employed to make professional services available at lower cost andwith greater convenience.It may be that some services and communications channels will be usedregardless of what privacy guarantees are provided. Providing medical advice by computernetwork to rural areas with no resident doctors may be one example. More common services,however, such as certain cellular telephone technologies and the use of e-mail over the Internet,are subject to less privacy than some other modes of communication, although extensive effortsare currently being directed to address that. The growing use of credit cards without securitymeasures to pay for goods and services over open networks is another example.Clearly, as these examples demonstrate, privacy concerns may be outweighed, ifonly for the moment, by other factors such as cost and convenience. However, given choices inthe marketplace that include price, quality and differing degrees of privacy, I have little doubtthat privacy would be valued and sought after.In the financial sphere, the payment systems of the United States present aparadox. Our systems, and banking arrangements, for handling high-value dollar payments areall electronic and have been for many years. Banking records, including those for loans anddeposits, have been computerized since the 1960s. Securities markets also now rely on highlyautomated records and systems, born out of necessity following the paperwork crisis of the1970s.Thus, it might seem strange that in transactions initiated by consumers, paper --currency and checks -- remains the payment system of choice. Debit and ATM cards, along withautomated clearing house payments, account for a very small percentage of transactions. EvenBIS Review   28/1997
- 4 -the use of popular credit cards has only recently begun to challenge paper’s dominance. Whilethere are many other factors involved in this anomaly, the value of privacy of transaction hasclearly been a significant determinant.Paper currency is, of course, the ultimate protector of anonymity, for makingordinary payments at the retail level. It is, thus, a measure of how valued is privacy in oursystem that inroads into the use of currency have been slow, and halting, in the face oftechnologies one would assume would have quickly buried the presumed inefficiency of papertransactions.To be sure, checks leave a paper trail which can compromise privacy, but it is aless efficient and accessible trail than when available newer technologies are used. Clearly, then,the value of privacy of transactions that currency -- and to a somewhat lesser extent, checks --provide is a measure of the economic cost individuals are willing to expend when far superiorefficiencies are at hand.Nonetheless, the marketplace is currently investing large sums to develop newmeans to automate payments as well as other retail banking and financial transactions. Projectsfor creating stored value cards and Internet-based payment systems, for example, are beingdiscussed around the world. Again, as in the 1970s, articles are being written and conferencesare being held to pronounce the end of paper. They may again prove premature.It is clear, however, that security and privacy will be very important if confidenceis to be established in these new systems. Indeed, in many, privacy of communication is anecessary requirement. Many projects are evolving daily to meet the business requirements ofpotential operators and the potential service needs of businesses and consumers.There is a significant need for flexibility in allowing these technologies to adaptand grow in response to pressures in the marketplace. There is also a need to avoid buildingformal or burdensome regulatory systems on the shifting sands of project proposals. If we wishto foster innovation, we must be careful not to impose rules that inhibit it. I am especiallyconcerned that we not attempt to impede unduly our newest innovation, electronic money, ormore generally, our increasingly broad electronic payments system. To develop new forms ofpayment, the private sector will need the flexibility to experiment, without broad interference bythe government.Our most intriguing challenge is whether new technologies can provide improvedfinancial services and, at the same time, provide greater privacy and related benefits. Flexibilityby industry, consumers, and government may help make such overall advances possible.Finally, I want to emphasize that the information age is not something to befeared, but may well be a vast opportunity. Personal computers, an array of software, and newcommunications channels have placed powerful and creative technologies directly into the handsof individuals. The current enthusiasm of society for science and technology, particularly amongyoung people, holds great promise for the future. If history is any guide, it is from thisenthusiasm that the future will be born.BIS Review   28/1997
Dr. Duisenberg responds to being made European Banker of the Year   Briefspeech by the President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for International Settlements,Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, on receiving the European Banker of the Year award in Frankfurt on3/3/97.First of all I would like to thank you for presenting me with the European Bankerof the Year award. I must confess that apart from feeling highly honoured at having such a prizebestowed on me, I feel slightly surprised as well. It is not until 1st July of this year that I will betaking over the leadership of the EMI to become a veritable European Banker.There is something symbolic about this prize being presented in Frankfurt, whichis not just the vibrant financial heart of Germany, but also the city where the monetary policy ofthe Economic and Monetary Union will be made. And it is about EMU that I wish to speaktoday.With the moment of deciding which Member States meet the criteria foraccession to EMU creeping up on us, the discussion on EMU is increasingly centring on thequestion of how EMU is to be achieved rather than on whether EMU will be achieved. Andrightly so, because the completion of EMU became a certainty when it was laid down in theMaastricht Treaty in 1992. EMU is to start off on 1st January 1999. In the spring of 1998 theHeads of Government of the European Union will decide which Member States meet the criteriafor entry. By signing and ratifying the Treaty, Member States opted to join EMU as soon as theyfulfil the criteria. Only the United Kingdom and Denmark insisted on an opt-out clause,releasing them from the obligation to introduce the euro upon qualifying for EMU. Thecompletion of EMU is irreversible, the introduction of the euro definitive.When EMU takes off, all Member States participating in the euro area will beconfronted with a fundamental change of environment. A proper start is of the utmostimportance, with the euro being just as hard as the guilder or, if you will, the Deutsche mark. Ineed not explain to you the importance of low inflation, and hence of a strong currency. If wewant the euro to be strong, there is nothing for it but to comply strictly with the convergencecriteria. A weak euro and the attending high interest rate level would be of no benefit toanybody, and that includes the potential derogation countries. Please keep in mind that amonetary union with ill-converging Member States would be incapable of absorbing economicshocks. Ultimately the tensions attending a malfunctioning EMU would jeopardise theachievements of the Single Market. In my view, potential derogation countries should not evenwish to take part in an EMU which allows insufficiently converged Member States to join.That brings me to the position of Member States with a derogation. At presentmany Member States are making desperate attempts to meet the convergence criteria forintroduction of the euro. Nevertheless we must make allowance for the fact that a number ofthem will not be able to participate when EMU takes off on 1st January 1999. We should notmake too much of their predicament. After all, a Member State with a derogation is notexcommunicated, but will be allowed to join at a later date. If they succeed in meeting theconvergence criteria within the near future, some of these countries will be able to join the coregroup when the euro banknotes and coins are introduced in 2002.Moreover, an exchange rate mechanism is presently being designed which seeksto ensure that the derogation countries retain close links with the core group. The mechanismwill support their exchange rate policies. It aims to prevent unduly large exchange ratemovements within the European Union which might impede the workings of the Single Market.At the same time, efforts will have to be made to reinforce convergence between the so-calledBIS Review   27/1997
- 2 -ins and outs in Stage Three in order to promote the accession of the derogation countries. Herethe pact for stability and growth can make a major contribution. Under the pact, the EU MemberStates, whether in or outside the euro area, commit themselves to strive for a near-balancedbudget or even a budget surplus. In fact, the pact would bring about a return to the budgetarydiscipline adhered to before the deficits of many countries began to get out of hand in the 1970sand 1980s.A strong monetary union creates the right climate for low inflation. Lowinflation, i.e. price stability, is the overriding objective of the ECB. Internal stability, meaningstable prices, is the principal aim. External stability, though not a primary objective, may ensue.There is after all a clear connection between a strong EMU with low inflation and the externalvalue of the euro; it is in fact a precondition for a strong and stable euro. When the three largetrade blocks, the US, Japan and Europe all pursue policies aiming for internal stability, they willnot only reap the fruits domestically, but they will also contribute to a global climate ofexchange rate stability. One of the main reasons for exchange rate disturbances, viz. aninconsistent and insufficiently confidence-inspiring policy, would thus be removed.The importance of reasonably stable exchange rates all over the world brings meto the international position of the euro. Let me conclude with a few remarks on that score.Obviously an economy stands to benefit materially when its currency evolves into aninternational key currency. A country whose currency figures in large numbers of transactionselsewhere faces far fewer exchange rate risks, while its financial sector is given a major boost. Acurrency circulating within private sectors outside its own country brings in income for itsissuer, the so-called seigniorage. The euro is well placed to play an important role as aninternational currency. Such a position is, however, not acquired overnight, but will have to bewon gradually. However, several major conditions for such a position in the longer term arealready fulfilled. The European single market, encompassing 350 million inhabitants, offers asolid foundation for the euro. Another condition is the existence of sophisticated financialmarkets. Building up on the position attained by the Deutsche mark, the euro’s prospects aregood in this respect. And last but not least, the euro will have to be a strong and stable currency.Only a hard currency will make it in the international financial markets. With the euro’s futurerole as an international currency in mind, let us make sure that EMU starts off with reallyconverged economies, so that the ECB will be able to realise its objective of price stabilitywithout having to resort to overly painful policy measures. That will enable the euro to become aprominent international currency.BIS Review   27/1997
Dr. Brash looks at banking soundness and the role of the market withrespect to New Zealand's banking industry   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank ofNew Zealand, Dr. Donald T. Brash, to the IMF conference on banking soundness and monetarypolicy in a world of global capital markets held in Washington on 30/1/97.My address this morning is on “Banking Soundness and the Role of the Market”.As most of you will already know, this is a subject of particular relevance to New Zealand,given that we have adopted a banking supervision approach which places considerable emphasison the role of the market in promoting a sound financial system. In my speech today I will beoutlining the key features of our new approach to banking supervision and the reasons why wehave gone in this direction. Although much of my address will focus on the New Zealandexperience, I will attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role market disciplinescan play in promoting a sound and efficient financial system - conclusions that may haverelevance for the design of banking supervision arrangements in other countries. Before I outlinethe new approach to banking supervision in New Zealand, I think it would be useful to give youa little background on the supervisory structure which operated at the time that the Reserve Bankof New Zealand conducted its review of banking supervision.Background to New Zealand’s Banking Supervision ArrangementsNew Zealand first adopted a formalised approach to banking supervision in 1987.For most of the period from then until the end of 1995 New Zealand’s approach to bankingsupervision was relatively orthodox. It involved:minimum capital requirements (based on the Basle Capital Accord);limits on the amount which banks could lend to individual customers and relatedparties;a limit on banks’ open foreign exchange positions;off-site monitoring of banks, using information provided privately to the ReserveBank;annual consultations with the senior management of banks; anda range of powers to enable the Reserve Bank to respond to bank distress orfailure.However, the former system of banking supervision differed in some importantrespects from the approaches adopted in many other countries. In particular, New Zealand’ssupervisory framework:did not involve the licensing or supervision of deposit-taking or the business ofbanking - only those entities wishing to use the word “bank” in their name weresubject to supervision;did not feature deposit insurance;did not seek to protect depositors per se - instead, it sought to protect the financialsystem as a whole; andBIS Review   /1997
- 2 -did not involve any form of on-site examination of banks.These distinguishing features continue to apply under the new supervisoryframework.In late 1991 we commenced a major review of our banking supervisionarrangements. The review was motivated by a number of concerns.Probably the main reason for commencing the review was a concern thatconventional approaches to banking supervision generally make insufficient use of marketdisciplines as a means of promoting a sound and efficient financial system. We believed thatthere was considerable scope to use market disciplines to promote systemic stability. Inparticular, we wished to provide the market with a greater capacity to hold the directors andmanagement to account for the sound management of their bank. And we wanted to improve themarket’s ability to make well informed decisions as to which banks they would do businesswith. As I note later in this address, we concluded that the introduction of a well focused andcomprehensive disclosure regime would go a long way towards achieving these objectives.Another factor which led us to review our banking supervision arrangements wasa concern at the compliance costs and regulatory distortions which can be associated withconventional approaches to banking supervision. This concern reflects our view that bankingsupervisors tend to have strong incentives to promote a stable financial system, without alwayshaving appropriate regard to the compliance costs and regulatory distortions to whichsupervision and prudential regulation can give rise.We were also concerned at the taxpayer risk involved in the traditional approachto banking supervision. Although this risk is present regardless of the form banking supervisiontakes, it is likely to be greater where the banking supervisor, and only the banking supervisor,has regular access to financial information on a bank. It is also likely to be greater the moreintensive the supervision process is. We wanted to explore ways of reducing the risk of thegovernment being called upon to rescue a bank in distress. Finally, we recognised that conventional banking supervision can only go so farin promoting a sound banking system. There are inherent limitations in the extent to whichprudential regulation and supervision, even supervision which includes on-site examinations, canminimise the incidence of bank distress and failure. This is evidenced by the fact that countrieswith intensive supervisory regimes have not been immune from serious episodes of financialdistress. Indeed, we were concerned that banking supervision could even be increasing the riskof bank failure or distress, by potentially reducing the incentives for bank directors andmanagers to make their own considered judgements about what constitutes prudent behaviour.The New Approach to Banking Supervision in New ZealandIn the light of these concerns, and following a lengthy period of review, weconcluded that the concerns we had identified could be substantially addressed by placinggreater reliance on market disciplines through public disclosure by banks, increasing theaccountability of bank directors and management, and reducing the extent of prudentialregulation. The new banking supervision arrangements, which came into force on 1 January1996, reflect these conclusions.BIS Review   /1997
- 3 -The new approach differs from the former regime in two main areas. First, a newdisclosure regime applicable to all banks operating in New Zealand has been introduced. Thedisclosure regime is designed to substantially strengthen the market disciplines on banks andsharpen the incentives for the directors and management of banks to manage their banks’ affairsin a sound and responsible manner. I will outline the main features of the disclosurearrangements shortly.The second major change involved a reduction in the extent of prudentialregulation of banks. The main changes included:the removal of the former limit on the amount which banks may lend to theircustomers;the removal of the limit on banks’ open foreign exchange exposures;the removal of the Reserve Bank’s guidelines on internal controls and theassociated audit requirements; andthe removal of the need for banks to privately report their financial position andrisk exposures to the Reserve Bank.We were satisfied that the introduction of the new disclosure regime obviated theneed for many of the former prudential controls on banks.Undoubtedly the feature of the new approach that has attracted most attention isthe disclosure regime. Let me briefly outline its main features.Under the new arrangements, all banks operating in New Zealand must publish adisclosure statement each quarter. The disclosure statements are in two forms: a brief KeyInformation Summary, which is aimed at the ordinary depositor; and a more comprehensiveGeneral Disclosure Statement, which is aimed principally at the professional analyst.The Key Information Summary contains a short summary of key information on abank, including:the bank’s credit rating (or a statement that the bank has no credit rating); thebank’s capital ratios, measured using the Basle framework; and information onpeak exposure concentration, peak exposures to related parties, asset quality,shareholder guarantees (if any) and profitability.The Key Information Summary must be displayed prominently in, and beavailable on demand from, every bank branch.The General Disclosure Statement contains wider-ranging and much moredetailed information on a bank and its banking group, including:corporate information and some information on parent banks (where applicable);comprehensive financial statements (including a five year summary of keyfinancial data); credit rating information (including any changes to the rating inthe two years preceding a bank’s most recent disclosure statement balance date);detailed information on capital adequacy, asset quality and various risk exposuresBIS Review   /1997
- 4 -(including exposure concentration and related party exposures); information onfunds management and securitisation activities, risk management systems, and asummary of the prudential regulations imposed on the bank in question by theReserve Bank of New Zealand; information on the bank’s exposure to marketrisk, both peak and end of period (and in respect of the full banking book).The disclosure statements issued by banks are subject to full external audit at theend of year and a limited scope audit review at the half year. Disclosure statements issued at theother quarters in the year are not required to be audited.One of the most important features of the disclosure framework is the role itaccords bank directors. Each director is required to sign their bank’s disclosure statements (orauthorise someone to sign on his or her behalf) and to make certain attestations in the disclosurestatements, including:whether the bank is complying with the prudential requirements imposed on it bythe Reserve Bank; whether the bank has systems in place to adequately monitorand control its banking risks and whether those systems are being properlyapplied; whether the bank’s exposure to related parties is contrary to the interestsof the bank; and whether the disclosure statement contains all the requireddisclosures and is not false or misleading.Directors face severe criminal and civil penalties (including up to three years’ jailand personal liability for creditors’ losses) if a disclosure statement is held to be false ormisleading.The disclosure arrangements are expected to bring a number of important benefitsto the New Zealand financial system:We are confident that the disclosure arrangements are playing an important role instrengthening market disciplines on banks. Under the new arrangements the market hasconsiderably greater information on a bank’s financial performance and risk positions than waspreviously the case. And the information is available more frequently and in a more timelymanner. The market therefore has greater scope to react to developments affecting a bank’sfinancial condition - rewarding those banks which are well managed and penalising those whichappear to be less well managed. The strongest banks are likely to benefit from that strength byoperating at lower costs; weaker banks are likely to be under pressure to strengthen theirposition. Over the longer term we believe that stronger market disciplines will make a majorcontribution to the soundness of New Zealand’s financial system.Another benefit which we expect to see from the disclosure regime is a growingemphasis on the important role which bank directors play in overseeing the prudent managementof their banks. The disclosure framework reinforces and provides a sharper focus on the dutiesof bank directors. In particular, it sharpens the focus on directors’ duties to ensure that their bankhas the necessary systems in place to identify, monitor and manage adequately the bank’svarious business risks, and to ensure that those systems are being properly applied at all times.The disclosure requirements are also likely to increase the accountability of bankdirectors and, indirectly, the accountability of various levels of management within the banks.As a result of the disclosure arrangements, we would expect to see directors taking greater carethan might otherwise have been the case to ensure that they are adequately discharging theirBIS Review   /1997
- 5 -obligations. In so doing, it is likely that directors will take steps to ensure that there areappropriate accountability mechanisms within the management hierarchy.Over time, we expect that the increased accountability of bank directors will leadto an improvement in the quality of bank boards. Shareholders now face stronger incentives toensure that the directors of their banks have the appropriate skills, experience, integrity andjudgement to fulfil the duties expected of them.Another important benefit which we hope will flow from the disclosure regime isa reduction in the risk that the taxpayer will be called upon to rescue a bank. As a result of thedisclosure arrangements we hope that there will be a stronger public perception that themanagement and directors of a bank have the sole responsibility for the management of theirbank’s affairs. Moreover, the public now has access to much the same information on banks asdoes the Reserve Bank, thereby eliminating the monopoly of information which supervisorsgenerally tend to have in respect of a bank’s financial condition. Both of these factors shouldassist in enabling future governments to resist the inevitable pressures to rescue a bank indistress or to insulate creditors from losses - at least to some extent.Although the new supervisory framework places great emphasis on the role thatmarket disciplines can play in promoting systemic stability, it is important to note that theReserve Bank of New Zealand has not abandoned its responsibilities for the financial system.We recognise that, for the time being at least, systemic stability is best served by a combinationof market disciplines and banking supervision. In particular, we see value in:retaining some control over which entities may call themselves banks in NewZealand;the Reserve Bank maintaining a sound understanding of the state of the financialsystem; andthe Reserve Bank retaining a capacity to respond to financial distress or bankfailure, where this threatens financial system stability.In this context, a number of the Reserve Bank’s core functions have beenretained.The Reserve Bank continues to have responsibility for registering new banks.Banks continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements (in line with theBasle Capital Accord) and a limit on lending to related parties. Although we believe thatdisclosure alone would ensure that banks would maintain capital at least equivalent to the 8%minimum, we consider that retention of the minimum capital requirements reinforces thecredibility of the new supervisory framework, at no additional cost to banks.The Reserve Bank continues to monitor banks on a quarterly basis. However,monitoring is now conducted principally using banks’ public disclosure statements, in contrast tothe former system of monitoring on the basis of information provided privately to the ReserveBank. In most respects, banks’ disclosure statements contain information which is morecomprehensive and more reliable than the information previously provided privately to theReserve Bank.BIS Review   /1997
- 6 -The Reserve Bank also continues to consult with the senior management of banks.Formal prudential consultations are held annually, and generally focus on the strategic directionof the banks, major changes in their operations and other high level issues. In addition, asGovernor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, I meet with the chief executives of the largerbanks on a regular basis to discuss a broad range of issues, including issues relating to thebanking industry and to the wider economy.And, importantly, the Reserve Bank retains a wide-ranging capacity to respond tofinancial distress or bank failure where a bank’s financial condition poses a serious threat to thestability of the banking system.As with the former supervision arrangements, the objective underlying the aboveresponsibilities is the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. Depositor protectiondoes not feature in the Reserve Bank’s objectives.Reactions to the New Approach to Banking SupervisionAll in all, I believe that the new approach has been relatively well accepted. But ithas taken time for that acceptance to be achieved. It is fair to say that, during the review process,reservations about the new approach were expressed from a number of quarters, both at homeand abroad. I think it would be useful to mention some of these.One of the observations made has been that New Zealand is “free riding” on theefforts of the home supervisors. We firmly reject this notion. We believe that the newsupervisory framework is at least as effective at promoting prudent banking practices as are themore traditional approaches to banking supervision. And we are satisfied that the newframework enables the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to fulfil its duties as a host supervisorwithin the terms of the Basle Concordat. In that regard, under the new approach to bankingsupervision, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand remains well informed about the activities andfinancial condition of all banks operating in New Zealand, and well placed to respond toincipient financial distress where appropriate. Indeed, as I have already noted, the disclosureregime provides the Reserve Bank (and the public) with information which is generally morecomprehensive than the information previously received by the Reserve Bank.But it is certainly true that any host supervisor will - inevitably - rely to someextent on the global supervision of the home supervisor. After all, this is an intrinsic part of theBasle Concordat. The most a host supervisor can realistically achieve is to promote prudentbanking practices in the local operations of the banks within its jurisdiction.In the context of the above point, some commentators have suggested that theReserve Bank of New Zealand is not well placed to anticipate emerging financial distress in theabsence of conducting on-site examinations of banks or otherwise obtaining private informationfrom banks. Although I acknowledge that on-site examinations do increase the informationavailable to banking supervisors, I am not at all convinced that the information obtained fromsuch examinations enables the supervisors to reliably anticipate incipient financial distress. Inmodern banking, risk positions can and do change rapidly. A week in politics might be a longtime, but in banking it is a very long time indeed! This is becoming increasingly the case. Theinformation obtained from on-site examinations, or from any other sources for that matter, canonly provide a snapshot of a bank’s risk positions at a particular point in time, and even thengenerally only in respect of a subset of the bank’s business. For these reasons I believe any suchBIS Review   /1997
- 7 -information is of limited usefulness in assessing the dynamics of a bank’s risk positions or inanticipating financial distress.I acknowledge, of course, that publicly disclosed information also has theselimitations. But at least public disclosure brings with it the incentives for the sound managementof banking risks. I am not at all sure that the private disclosure of information to a bankingsupervisor - whether on-site or off-site - creates these types of incentives.A further concern we have with on-site examinations or the off-site collection ofdetailed private information on banks, at least in the New Zealand context, is the risk that theseapproaches can blur the lines of responsibility for the management of banks. If the bankingsupervisor has responsibility for regular on-site examinations, it presumably follows that thesupervisor also has responsibility for encouraging or requiring a bank to modify its risk positionsor make other adjustments to its balance sheet where the supervisor has concerns in relation tothe bank’s risk profile. This has the potential to erode the incentives for the directors andmanagement of banks to take ultimate responsibility for the management of banking risks,effectively passing some of this responsibility to the banking supervisor. It also has the potentialto create public perceptions that the responsibility for managing banking risks is effectivelyshared between a bank’s directors and the banking supervisors. In turn, this makes it verydifficult indeed for a government to eschew responsibility for rescuing a bank in difficulty.I acknowledge that any system of banking supervision - even one that reliesprincipally on public disclosure - will inevitably create public expectations that the supervisoryauthority takes some responsibility for the management of banking risks. And I acknowledgethat any system of banking supervision creates a risk for the taxpayer in the event that a bankgets into difficulty. However, in order to minimise these risks, the Reserve Bank of NewZealand prefers to keep the spotlight clearly focused on the directors and management of a bank,rather than risk a further blurring of their accountability. We believe that the avoidance ofhaving an on-site examination role or otherwise regularly obtaining private information frombanks assists in this regard and reinforces market disciplines on banks.Another observation frequently made is that New Zealand would not haveadopted the new framework had a substantial part of its banking system been domesticallyowned. It is my firmly-held conviction that we would have adopted this approach even if all ormost of our banks had been locally-owned. I say this because we believe that the regime isactually more likely to promote prudent banking behaviour than do the more traditionalapproaches, but with a lower likelihood of moral hazard and regulatory distortion. In thiscontext, I should note that, at the time we commenced our review of banking supervision, in late1991, a significant part of the New Zealand banking system was still domestically owned.Indeed, as I see it, many of the changes we have implemented in New Zealand would be of equalrelevance to those jurisdictions in which the core of the banking system is domestically owned.Another criticism made of the New Zealand approach is that comprehensive andfrequent disclosure can, in some circumstances, exacerbate financial system distress, rather thanpromote systemic stability. I acknowledge that, in some circumstances, disclosure couldexacerbate a bank’s difficulties. For example, where a bank is required to disclose a loss or asevere deterioration in asset quality, this could lead to a sharp adverse reaction by the market,possibly causing the bank in question to come under liquidity pressure. Of course, thispossibility exists with even the barest disclosure requirements - such as with the release of anannual report or a six monthly interim disclosure. And the risks of adverse market reaction arepresent even in the absence of disclosure requirements - for example, as a result of marketBIS Review   /1997
- 8 -speculation as to a bank’s financial condition. Indeed, in some circumstances the disclosure ofcomprehensive information might actually reduce the risk of the market reacting adversely tomisinformation or to an absence of information. In any case, where a bank knows in advancethat it will be making adverse disclosures, it would generally have the opportunity to take stepsto reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction. These steps would include the disclosure of theremedial measures being taken to address the bank’s difficulties.Of course, the risk of a severe market reaction to an adverse disclosure creates thevery incentives for banks to ensure that they manage their affairs in such a way that there will beno adverse developments to disclose. In the longer term, therefore, the risk of adverse marketreaction could be expected to promote a sounder financial system.One of the criticisms often made of public disclosure by banks is that the vastmajority of depositors will not read banks’ disclosure statements. On this assumption, someobservers suggest that disclosure is of very limited effectiveness. We do not agree. It is certainlytrue that most depositors are unlikely to read the disclosure statements. But the disclosure regimein New Zealand is not predicated on the assumption of wide readership by the ordinarydepositor. The source of market disciplines does not lie in wide public readership. Rather, theefficacy of the disclosure regime rests on the assumption that the disclosure statements will beread by the agents of depositors, such as the financial news media, financial analysts andinvestment advisers, and by wholesale creditors and fellow bankers. It is the risk of adversereactions by these types of disclosure users that creates the incentives for bank directors andmanagement to manage their banks’ affairs in such a way as to avoid the need to make adversedisclosures.Although the disclosure regime does not rely on the mass readership of disclosurestatements by depositors, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is encouraging depositors to take agreater interest in their banks’ disclosures. Over much of last year we actively promotedpublicity about the new disclosure arrangements. And we prepared a “user’s guide” to assistdepositors (and their agents) to understand the disclosures being made by banks. The user’sguide is now available in every bank branch in the country. While it is unlikely to be a “bestseller”, it is encouraging to note that there has, in fact, been a surprising degree of interest in itfrom the public. We hope that, over time, an increasing proportion of depositors will take akeener interest in their banks’ financial condition.Another observation made about the new framework is that our approach placesan excessive emphasis on the role of bank directors - that we are asking too much of them. Toillustrate this point, during the review process, I had a visit from the chief executive of onemajor international bank with an operation in New Zealand. He had come to protest strongly atthe requirement that bank directors would have to sign the disclosure statements every quarterand attest to the appropriateness of their risk management systems. When I asked why, he said“... bank directors understand absolutely nothing about banking...”. This comment is quite unfairabout many bank directors, of course, but there is an uncomfortable element of truth in it insome cases. The blame for this situation almost certainly lies, in part, on a supervision regimewhich had assumed too much of the responsibility for the viability of banks. We very much hopethat a regime which will continue to have some key regulations, but which is based primarily onmarket disclosure and director attestations, will improve that situation.BIS Review   /1997
- 9 -Early Indications of the Effects of the Disclosure RegimeAlthough it is far too early to make conclusive assessments of the success orotherwise of the new supervisory approach, there have been some encouraging signs that thedisclosure requirements are meeting a number of their objectives. I will briefly highlight a fewof these.We have been encouraged by the fact that the financial news media in NewZealand have taken a close interest in the new bank disclosure regime. The quarterly disclosurestatements have received quite detailed scrutiny from the news media, resulting in greater andmore focused public exposure of banks’ financial results and risk positions. We hope that thistype of media attention will sharpen the incentives for banks’ directors and management tomanage their banks’ affairs prudently.A good example of the news media’s interest in banks’ disclosure statements wasthe media’s interest in one bank’s disclosure of its non-compliance with a Reserve Bankprudential requirement. We were surprised at the intensity of the media’s interest in thisdisclosure - as, I suspect, were the management and directors of the bank in question. Hopefully,this type of media attention, and the attendant adverse publicity to which it inevitably gives rise,will encourage banks to ensure that they comply with Reserve Bank requirements in the future. Iam inclined to think that the threat of adverse publicity is likely to be a more effective disciplineon banks than are many of the standard supervisory sanctions for breaches of regulatoryrequirements.Interestingly, the disclosure regime seems to be strengthening the extent to whichbanks scrutinise each other’s financial performance and risk positions. We are aware that banksare making considerable use of the disclosure statements to monitor each other. The additionaland more frequent information now available could be expected to assist banks in managingtheir inter-bank exposure positions and in assessing the extent and nature of the business theyconduct with each other. We believe that the banking industry itself is one of the most potentsources of market disciplines on individual banks.Anecdotal feedback suggests that the obligations now placed on bank directors arecausing the directors of some banks to exercise greater scrutiny of their banks’ risk positions. Inturn, this seems to be focusing greater attention on the systems they have in place for identifyingand managing risks. Moreover, it seems that some banks are taking steps to increase theaccountability of various levels of management within their banks. We are also aware that somebanks have engaged external consultants to review aspects of their risk management systems. Itseems that part of the motivation for conducting these reviews lies in the disclosure requirements- particularly the director attestation as to the adequacy of a bank’s risk management systems.These are all pleasing developments. We hope that they auger well for the successof the new arrangements. I am confident they will. But we are under no illusion that the newarrangements provide guarantees of financial system stability. Of course they do not. No systemof banking supervision can do that. The most we are entitled to believe is that the disclosureregime will significantly reduce the likelihood of financial system instability in the future - atlower regulatory, compliance and taxpayer costs than other supervisory options might beexpected to achieve.BIS Review   /1997
- 10 -General Observations on Incorporating Market Disciplines into Banking SupervisionBefore I conclude this address, I should probably make some comments about theextent to which market disciplines could be better incorporated into the supervisory frameworksin other countries.I should first of all make it clear that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is notpromoting the New Zealand supervisory model as the ideal model for other countries to adopt.We make no such claims. The model we have adopted meets our particular needs, but it mightnot necessarily be suitable for other countries. Clearly, each country needs to make its ownjudgement as to what type of supervisory framework is best suited to its unique requirements.That judgement will inevitably depend on many considerations, including:the objectives which banking supervision is expected to meet, and whether thoseobjectives include depositor protection;the existence or otherwise of deposit insurance arrangements;the structure of the banking system; andthe infrastructure within which banking operates, such as banking law andaccounting standards.Having said this, I do believe that market disciplines can play a substantial role inmost financial systems. In particular, I think policy makers in many countries could usefullygive careful thought to the merits of introducing comprehensive and well focused disclosurerequirements for banks. Similarly, I believe there would be much to gain from the adoption ofpolicies designed to strengthen the responsibilities of bank directors, so that the ultimateresponsibility for the management of banking risks lies squarely in the boardroom, rather thanbeing awkwardly balanced between the banking supervisor and the bank director.But it is fair to say that the effectiveness of market disciplines will much dependon the structure of the regulatory arrangements in place and the nature of the infrastructurewithin which the banking system operates. In particular, the following factors would seem toplay an important role in determining the effectiveness of using disclosure as a mechanism forpromoting systemic stability.Market disciplines are more likely to be effective where governments do notinsulate depositors from losses - whether explicitly in the form of deposit insurance or throughimplicit depositor protection. Understandably, depositors and other creditors are less likely totake an interest in a bank’s financial condition where they know, or have good cause to surmise,that they will be insulated from losses should a bank get into difficulty. In such circumstances,banks which are performing poorly are less likely to face adverse market reaction than in anenvironment where creditors operate under the expectation that they are likely to lose money inthe event of a bank failure. In part, this is why, in New Zealand, we have eschewed depositinsurance or depositor protection, and have sought to make it clear to depositors, among others,that they should not expect the government to insulate them from losses in the event of a bankfailure.It is also fair to say that market disciplines are more likely to be effective wherethe supervisory requirements applied to banks are kept to a minimum. I say this for two reasons.BIS Review   /1997
- 11 -First, the greater the supervisory requirements, the more likely it is that the market will perceivethat the government is underwriting individual banks. And second, the greater the supervisoryrequirements, the less likely it is that bank directors and management will view themselves ashaving ultimate responsibility for the management of their banks.The effectiveness of market disciplines will also depend on the structure of thefinancial system. In particular, it seems likely that market disciplines would be more effectivewhere a bank is domestically owned - that is, where no other bank stands behind it. Where abank is owned by another bank, the market would naturally have regard to the financialcondition of the parent bank when assessing how it should react to disclosures made by the localbank. Market disciplines might therefore be somewhat more subdued in a financial systemcharacterised by foreign ownership than in one dominated by locally owned banks. Having saidthis, I am fully satisfied that even in a financial system which is largely foreign owned, such asin the New Zealand financial system, there is very considerable scope to use market disciplinesto promote improved risk management by the subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks.Indeed, it is possible that New Zealand’s disclosure regime might well be adding to theincentives on overseas parent banks to more vigilantly supervise their New Zealand operationsand to give greater attention to their own financial condition.The extent of government ownership of the banking system is also likely toinfluence the effectiveness of market disciplines. I think we would all agree that the market isless likely to impose meaningful disciplines on a bank which is state owned than would be thecase with a privately owned bank - assuming, of course, that the market has faith in the financialsoundness and political stability of the government in question. However, even where a bank isstate owned, a robust disclosure regime might well strengthen the accountability of the directorsand management of the bank, leading to improved risk management within the bank.It will come as no surprise to you that I believe that market disciplines are morelikely to be effective where banks are required to make comprehensive disclosures on a frequentand timely basis. The disclosure requirements should focus on the key aspects of a bank’sfinancial performance and risk profile, and should be made with sufficient frequency andtimeliness as to provide the market with a meaningful basis for assessing a bank’s financialcondition and comparing one bank with another. Disclosure is likely to be more meaningful andeffective if it is supported by robust accounting standards which have the force of law. Certainly,in the case of New Zealand, we have found that our disclosure regime has been assisted greatlyby the introduction of legally binding and more rigorously drafted accounting standards.Moreover, disclosure requirements should ideally be coupled with an appropriate legalframework governing bank directors - a framework designed to focus directors’ attention ontheir duties to manage the affairs of their bank in a sound manner, and to hold them to accountfor any breaches of those duties.However, as they say, there is a time and a place for everything. And so it is withdisclosure. I think we would all agree that it would not be helpful to introduce new disclosurerequirements at a time when the banking system is in a fragile state. Doing so could wellexacerbate the situation. That is why, in New Zealand, we introduced the disclosure regime at atime when the financial system was in a strong position and therefore when disclosure wouldassist in maintaining confidence in the banking system, rather than detracting from it.Finally, the effectiveness of market disciplines through public disclosure willobviously be influenced by the infrastructure within which banking operates. By“infrastructure”, I refer to such matters as: the nature and adequacy of corporate law; theBIS Review   /1997
- 12 -adequacy of accounting standards and auditing requirements; the sophistication and integrity ofthe accounting profession; and the adequacy of the financial news media and financialprofessionals.All else being equal, the more well developed the infrastructure, the more likely itis that market disciplines will be effective. This suggests that, in the case of some developingcountries, where perhaps the infrastructure is not well developed, the scope for using disclosureto promote market disciplines is somewhat more limited than would otherwise be the case. Buteven in such cases, I would not dismiss the potential merits of developing relatively simpledisclosure requirements, drawing on international accounting and auditing standards asappropriate, as a means of promoting some rudimentary market disciplines.ConclusionLet me conclude by reiterating my view that market disciplines can play apowerful role in promoting systemic stability, in conjunction with some degree of bankingsupervision. I think there is considerable scope for policy makers to give further thought to howmarket disciplines could be better used to reinforce the efforts of banking supervisors in thequest for systemic stability. However, in giving thought to this matter, it may well be necessaryfor policy makers to re-assess some fundamental aspects of the conventional approaches tobanking supervision and their relationship to the promotion of market disciplines. These includesuch issues as depositor protection, deposit insurance, the extent of prudential regulation ofbanks, and the intensity with which banking supervision is conducted. These are all substantialissues of course, and I have little doubt that there will be continuing international debate as towhere the appropriate balance should lie. I very much hope that the approach which we in NewZealand have adopted will assist in promoting international debate on supervisory options.BIS Review   /1997
Summary of an article entitled Risk Disclosure by Financial Institutionspublished in the Bank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin of February 1997   BANK OF JAPAN,COMMUNICATION, 28/2/97.IntroductionPublic disclosure by financial institutions has long provided information aboutbusiness performance through the publication of financial statements. In recent years, however, anumber of financial institutions have come to focus on disclosure of a wider range ofinformation, including their management policies. This is partly attributable to the expansion ofderivatives transactions, which has made risk management techniques increasingly important inthe management of financial institutions, and which has thereby encouraged financial institutionsto improve such techniques. Accordingly, individual financial institutions have been motivatedto reveal voluntarily their risk exposures and risk management methods in order to win afavorable assessment from market participants. Disclosure thus brings into play a checkmechanism inherent in financial markets (hereafter referred to as the market check mechanism)that disciplines management of financial institutions, and thereby helps to enhance the efficiencyand transparency of the markets and to stabilize the financial system.This report examines the disclosure of information on risks of financialinstitutions, with an overview of the current practices and future issues. It is intended to servemarket participants, the beneficiaries of the information disclosed.BIS Review   25/1997
Ms. Phillips discusses recent developments in supervision and regulation andhow they affect the debate on financial modernization   Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, amember of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the AnnualWashington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers on 3/3/97.I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this group at a time whendevelopments in global financial markets are presenting particular challenges for marketparticipants and market regulators alike.I was asked to talk with you today about both developments in Federal Reservesupervision and regulation, as well as the approaches to financial modernization being debated inthe Congress. I won’t try to cover the full waterfront on these topics, but would like to sharewith you some of the Board’s considerable rethinking about the way we supervise and regulatebank holding companies. I will also describe how I believe the recent Board initiatives comingout of this process may well alter the debate about the structure and supervision of financialservices in the United States -- a topic I believe has received insufficient attention in thelegislative debate so far.I will focus my discussion of recent Board actions on the supervisory process andon three regulatory changes made or proposed by the Board: changes to the application andnonbanking provisions of Regulation Y, changes and proposed changes to the Board-imposed“firewalls” between a bank and a securities affiliate, and changes to the Board’s anti-tying rules.I stress these three not necessarily because they are the most important undertaken by the Board,but because I believe that they most directly affect the debate about how financial servicesshould be supervised.Supervisory ChangesThe cornerstone of the bank supervisory process is the verification of prudentpractices and financial condition through on-site examinations, coupled with off-sitesurveillance. Traditionally, on-site examinations of bank holding companies and their nonbanksubsidiaries have focused on verifying compliance and determining the financial condition of aninstitution at the time of the examination by reviewing their loans and by testing othertransactions. This process is changing.The Federal Reserve’s supervisory oversight at the bank holding company level isincreasingly directed at evaluating risk management, internal controls, and decision makingprocesses that are shared between a bank and its parent, rather than focusing on transactions andpositions at nonbank affiliates. This focus is necessary given the continuing trend towardintegrated management of financial activities on a consolidated basis. Testing the adequacy ofrisk management and internal control helps us understand the financial condition of theconsolidated organization and the potential impact of consolidated risk management policies andinternal controls on the operations of the insured depository institution. To implement thisapproach, the Federal Reserve last year began assigning a formal rating to risk management inour holding company and bank examination reports.Changes have come not just in what we examine, but also in how we examine.We are making greater use of internal risk management reports, the results of internal riskmodels, and the work of internal and external auditors. For example, the Federal Reserve is nowcollecting internal loan classification reports prepared by most of our larger banks, as well asBIS Review   24/1997
- 2 -other information generated by their internal risk management systems. This approach has afurther advantage in that it can generally be conducted off-site, at less burden to the firm.Our examinations are also becoming more efficient through pre-visitationplanning that better identifies those areas of a company’s activities that pose the greatest risk.We are also making greater use of computer technology in the examination process and usingautomated systems that permit examiners to analyze data on their personal computers. And, ofcourse, whenever possible we rely upon examination and inspection reports prepared byregulators of the individual entities within the bank holding company.Like examinations, disclosure practices of the past also focused narrowly on thefinancial condition of an institution at a point in time, using conventional accounting andregulatory measures. Today, however, disclosures are expanding to reveal not only the currentrisks of the balance sheet, but also management’s philosophy for managing and controlling risk.Disclosure is an important aid to us as supervisors and, we hope, to market analysts. Improveddisclosure has already been put into practice for derivatives and market risks, and we willcontinue to urge better and more broadly based disclosure of all major activities and exposures.The Effect of Supervisory Changes on LegislationAs the issue of consolidated or “umbrella” supervision is debated in the legislativeprocess, I believe it is important to examine how these supervisory developments alter thatdebate. There are those who argue that umbrella supervision of a diverse financial servicesholding company would either be an impossible task or an intolerable burden. But therisk-analysis and surveillance techniques that we have decided are the most effective for bankholding companies should also be adaptable to more diverse financial organizations that includebanking operations. Clearly, we must all give additional thought to how such an adaptationwould work so that we minimize the intrusion into new activities. Perhaps there should be somekind of carve-out for firms whose banking operations are a small part of the organization or ifthe firm is otherwise regulated. Nevertheless, to be successful, a financial services companyshould reap synergy gains not only by marketing a variety of products to customers but also bypooling and jointly managing diverse financial risks. Thus, the movement toward use of onetreasury, one risk management policy, and one set of exposure limits would continue. It is thosepolicies and risks that an umbrella supervisor must understand in order to gauge the risks to theinsured institution.In fact, as I am sure this group will recall in the wake of BCCI, the Congress alsobecame convinced of the importance of consolidated supervision of any banking organization.Through the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act, the United States not only recognizedthe importance of consolidated supervision, but strongly encouraged it as an internationalprinciple of banking supervision by requiring that any foreign bank seeking to enter the UnitedStates be subject to consolidated home country supervision.Subsequent history has confirmed that judgment. As I’ve noted, virtually all ofthe large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such. Thus, theFederal Reserve remains convinced that one supervisor must have the task of evaluating theorganization as a whole.BIS Review   24/1997
- 3 -This view is now commonly accepted around the world. The idea has for sometime been endorsed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, and many countries areadopting similar approaches.Still, I can certainly understand why some advocates of a more diversifiedfinancial services holding company would wish to abandon consolidated supervision.Consolidated supervision raises hard questions -- the kind of questions that can bog downlegislation and splinter coalitions -- and questions that engage us even now. What authorityshould a consolidated supervisor have over non-financial activities, if they are allowed? Howshould the consolidated supervisor work with the primary supervisor of a bank, or abroker-dealer, or an insurance company? How much burden must consolidated supervisionentail?As we all pursue the answers to these questions, perhaps the Federal Reserve’srisk-based approach to supervision can provide insights into how umbrella supervision of anexpanded organization could work.Regulatory ChangesJust as with supervision, the regulatory side of the Federal Reserve has undergoneprofound changes of late.Just a few weeks ago, the Board approved a comprehensive streamlining ofRegulation Y that should substantially diminish the regulatory burden on bank holdingcompanies and foreign banks wishing to expand or innovate in the United States.First, the Board concluded that review of an application should focus on how theproposed acquisition or activity would affect the organization. The application should notbecome a vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and complianceissues at the applicant organization. This principle is also the basis for recent Congressionalaction to eliminate the prior approval requirement for engaging in Board-approved nonbankingactivities under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, provided the company meetsspecified standards for capital and management at the time of its last examination. As a result,the Board has significantly streamlined the process for well-capitalized, well-run companies toacquire a bank or nonbank and eliminated the prior approval process for such companies toengage de novo in Board-approved nonbanking activities.Second, the Board concluded that bank holding companies should be permitted toconduct nonbanking activities to the fullest extent permissible under the Bank Holding CompanyAct, and that Regulation Y should be sufficiently flexible to allow for industry changes inpermissible activities without requiring additional regulatory filings. Accordingly, the Boardremoved restrictions on investment advisory activities, derivatives trading activities, leasing, andother activities whenever those restrictions impeded efficiency or imposed costs withoutconferring corresponding benefits to safety and soundness. The Board also permitted a dataprocessing or management consulting subsidiary to derive up to 30 percent of its revenue fromnonfinancial data processing or nonfinancial management consulting. And the Board hasindicated that it will be pro-active in approving new activities.The next area where the Board has been particularly active concerns firewallsbetween a bank and an affiliated securities firm, better known as a section 20 affiliate.BIS Review   24/1997
- 4 -Experience with these section 20 affiliates, and other affiliates engaging in similar activitieswithout such restrictions, led the Board to conduct a comprehensive review of the firewalls.Much of the potential for conflicts of interest between a bank and a securities firm is addressedby other laws such as the registration and disclosure requirements and the anti-fraud provisionsof the securities laws. Legislative and regulatory enactments, many adopted since the Board’sinitial 1987 section 20 order, also provide important insulation between a bank and a section 20affiliate by imposing qualitative and quantitative limits on inter-affiliate transactions andrequiring that a customer receive disclosures detailing the identity of its counterparty and theproduct being purchased.Accordingly, the Board has repealed its restriction on cross-marketing between abank and a section 20 affiliate, eliminated a blanket restriction on employee interlocks, andscaled back a blanket restriction on officer interlocks to include only a chief executive officer.The Board has also proposed to eliminate a firewall prohibiting a bank from providing anyfunding to a section 20 affiliate and three restrictions on a bank’s extending credit or offeringcredit enhancements in support of securities being underwritten by its section 20 affiliate.The Board’s proposal recognized that as financial intermediation has evolved,corporate customers frequently seek to obtain a variety of funding mechanisms from one source.By prohibiting banks from providing routine credit enhancements in tandem with a section 20affiliate, the existing firewalls hamper the ability of bank holding companies to operate asone-stop financial services providers, thereby reducing options for customers. Instead, the Boardhas proposed to require that internal controls and operating standards ensure that a bank useindependent credit judgment whenever it is acting in tandem with its section 20 affiliate.Finally, the Board has taken action to allow greater packaging of products bybank holding companies. Since the 1970s, banks and bank holding companies have beenprohibited from packaging their products unless the arrangement involved a traditional bankproduct. While this exception softened the impact of the statute, bank holding companies werenonetheless at a considerable disadvantage to their competitors, particularly as bundling ofservices has become a marketing imperative on both the retail and wholesale side of thebusiness.After reviewing its experience with the statute, the Board recently repealed aregulation that had extended to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries thestatutory prohibition on tying arrangements by banks. Experience taught us that these non-banksdid not have the type of market power that Congress presumed banks possessed when it enactedan anti-tying statute. The Board has also created exceptions to the statute to allow packagearrangements between bank holding company affiliates to the same extent as the statute allowsthem within the bank.Lastly, and perhaps of greatest interest to you, the Board created a safe harbor toclarify that any transaction with a foreign customer was not covered by the statute. Thus, forexample, a U.S. branch of a foreign bank can participate in a syndicated loan to a Europeanfirm, even if the loan is offered only as part of a package of services that would otherwise runafoul of the anti-tying law.The Effect of the Regulatory Climate on LegislationI think it worth noting how all these reforms may affect the debate about theBIS Review   24/1997
- 5 -corporate structure of bank holding companies -- specifically whether bank holding companiesshould be granted the option of moving activities prohibited to the bank into a subsidiary of thebank, and thereby funding those activities with subsidized funds.Descriptions of how the subsidy works and examples of the funding advantages itconfers are plentiful. But I believe that it is so ingrained in our thinking that we sometimes takeit for granted. Think how obvious the subsidy would be if it involved another industry -- forexample, if the government guaranteed that commercial paper holders of the automobile industrywould be repaid in full. To complete the other strands of the safety net -- the discount windowand the payment system -- let us assume that automobile companies experiencing liquidityproblems could borrow from the Federal Reserve for the purpose of repaying commercial paper,and that they are able to achieve risk-free settlement. The effects of extending such a subsidy arenot difficult to imagine. Automakers would find it very easy to place their commercial paper,and would be able to pay a below-market yield. And, to the extent the hypothetical allowed, Iwould not be surprised to see automakers use this funding advantage to enter other businesses.So it is with banks -- and with subsidiaries of banks. Regulators can limit a bank’sability to subsidize its subsidiary through loans by capping their amount or regulating the ratesthe subsidiary must pay. But although one can limit the aggregate investment a bank can make inits subsidiary by requiring that such injections be deducted from the capital of the bank, theequity investment in the subsidiary is still funded from subsidized resources, and that subsidytransfer cannot be eliminated.Thus, both analytically and practically, I think it difficult to deny that banks andtheir subsidiaries benefit from a federal subsidy, and benefit in ways that an affiliate of the bankdoes not. Nevertheless, some argue that a parent-subsidiary structure is more efficient than asibling structure, and must be allowed for a broader range of activities. But in light of the recentregulatory changes that I have described, I believe that this argument is now questionable. Abank and an affiliate can now avoid a redundant work force and duplication of effort by havingemployees serve in a dual capacity, or by allowing reporting lines to cross. For example, acommon back office or treasury can be maintained. Furthermore, the two companies can markettheir products jointly to both retail and corporate customers. With these regulatory changes,banks and bank holding companies have opportunities to make considerable adjustments to theirorganizational structures and operating procedures as well as to offer new products to customersin new ways.ConclusionLet me conclude by pointing out that the legislative debate has only just begun.Opinions are still developing, new ideas are still being presented, and positions are not yet castin concrete. But even as new legislation is being debated, those of us who must try to interpretand administer existing laws recognize that we must do so in a developing global marketplace. Ibelieve that the steps the Board has taken to make its regulatory and supervisory systems lessburdensome and more risk focused will stand us in good stead in this changing financialenvironment. Nevertheless, comprehensive financial reform legislation is still needed to allowbanking and other financial institutions to compete internationally and to offer the full range offinancial services needed and demanded by their customers.BIS Review   24/1997
Dr. Brash explains the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s new inflation target, andNew Zealander’s expectations about inflation and growth   Address by the Governor of theReserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. Donald T. Brash, to the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber ofCommerce in Christchurch on 23/1/97.IntroductionAs perhaps you know, this is the fourth time on which I have been invited to addressthe Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce at your first luncheon meeting of the New Yearand I want to use the occasion to talk about two issues.First, I want to talk about the new Policy Targets Agreement, amending the inflationtarget from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent, signed last month. And secondly, I want to talk about theexpectations which we New Zealanders have about both inflation and economic growth. In someThe new inflation targetFirst, the new Policy Targets Agreement. There have been two changes made in thenew PTA, but I suspect that to the general public the only difference between the new Agreement andall of the earlier ones is that the new Agreement has changed the ‘definition’ of price stability from 0to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent, while making it clear that delivering that price stability remains thesingle objective of monetary policy and constitutes the best way in which the Reserve Bank cancontribute to New Zealand’s economic development.Some will ask in anger why the inflation target is still so low, and why the Bank willcontinue to focus monetary policy on delivering that target, when there are other objectives - such aseconomic growth, employment, and export competitiveness - which are at least as important and inmany respects more so. Others will feel betrayed that the ceiling of the inflation target has been raisedfrom 2 to 3 percent, or that the mid-point of the target has been raised from 1 percent to 1.5 percent,particularly given the fact that the two largest parties in Parliament were both strong advocates of amid-point of 1 percent during the last election campaign. I want to try to respond to both groups ofcritics.In many ways the easiest critics to respond to are those who feel that the inflationtarget is still too low, or that, given the extent to which the economy has been slowing in recentmonths and the extent of the pressures on the export sector, the Bank’s objectives should have beenwidened to include those other objectives. For there is in fact no evidence that monetary policy can,by tolerating a little more inflation, engineer a sustainably higher rate of growth, or a sustainablyhigher level of employment, or a sustainable improvement in export competitiveness. To be sure,monetary policy can engineer faster growth, higher employment and improved exportercompetitiveness in the short term - by tolerating a bit more inflation right now, there is not muchdoubt that growth and employment would be a little higher in 1997 than otherwise, and that exporterswould enjoy the benefits of a lower exchange rate. Most of that faster growth and higher employmentwould be bought at the cost of tricking working New Zealanders into accepting a reduction in theirreal wages, as prices rose ahead of wages. However, it would not last. Before too long, people wouldrecognise the deception and would demand compensation in the form of higher wages and salaries.Within a very short time, inflation would be rising, growth would be back to its previous, lower, leveland we would be left contemplating the cost of reducing inflation again - and nobody should forgetthe very substantial one-off costs, in terms of unemployment and lost output, incurred in reducinginflation from levels above 15 percent in the mid-1980s to our current situation of price stability inthe early and mid-1990s.BIS Review   23/1997
- 2 -Not only is there no evidence that tolerating more inflation can engineer sustainablyfaster real growth, there is now overwhelming evidence that high inflation positively damages theway in which the economy works - reduces the capacity for sustainable growth and higheremployment, and of course also does huge social damage, through the arbitrary redistribution ofincome and wealth which it creates.There is also very considerable evidence that even quite low rates of inflation dodamage to growth and employment, and virtually no evidence that inflation actually helps thoseobjectives. This is why the second of the two changes in the Policy Targets Agreement makes clearthat it is precisely in order to enable monetary policy to make its maximum contribution tosustainable ‘growth, employment and development opportunities’ that the Bank is directed to focuson maintaining a stable general level of prices.But isn’t there some concern, fostered in the popular media by the Americaneconomist Paul Krugman, that if inflation is too low it may actually damage growth? In other words,even if we accept that high or even moderate inflation is damaging, isn’t it possible that central bankswhich are excessively obsessive about achieving no inflation might actually be harming the economyand the society they claim to be helping?This brings me to the second group of critics, who are concerned that in changingfrom 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent we have betrayed the intention of the Reserve Bank Act,requiring that monetary policy focus exclusively on delivering ‘stability in the general level ofprices’.There is quite intense debate going on at the moment around the world among centralbankers and academic economists about what the best specification of a low inflation target shouldbe. There are two broad schools.The first school accepts that monetary policy should be focused on deliveringpredictably low inflation but argues that for several reasons that target is best expressed as inflation ina range of 1 to 3 percent. The best known advocate of this ‘low positive inflation’ school is probablyStanley Fischer, formerly of MIT and now Senior Deputy Managing Director of the InternationalMonetary Fund. He is visiting New Zealand next month, and it is likely that his views will receiveappropriately wide media coverage at that time. He argues for this ‘low positive’ inflation target forvarious reasons, of which three are particularly important: The way in which inflation is measuredresults in quite a significant over-statement of actual inflation. Estimates of this over-statement in theUnited States have suggested that, in that country, the ‘bias’ in the measurement of inflation isbetween 0.7 and 2.0 percent, with bias of 1.1 percent very recently estimated by a group chaired byMichael Boskin on behalf of the United States Senate Finance Committee. For this reason, centralbanks should target measured inflation of at least 1 percent, because to target anything lower than thatwould be to target de facto deflation.Because at some stage in the cycles through which all economies go it may benecessary in the interests of maintaining a high level of employment for there to be some reduction ininflation-adjusted (or real) wages, having a low positive level of inflation is more desirable thanhaving absolutely no inflation. This is because, with some inflation, real wages can be slightlyreduced by simply giving no increase in nominal wages, whereas with no inflation reducing realwages involves having to actually reduce nominal wages. Real wages can still be reduced, even withno inflation, but only at the expense of higher unemployment.Similarly, it is argued that at some stage in the economic cycle it may be desirable forinflation-adjusted interest rates to fall below zero to provide a strong stimulus to demand and, since itBIS Review   23/1997
- 3 -is not generally practical for nominal interest rates to fall below zero, it is helpful if inflation is somelow positive number to make negative real interest rates possible.The second school of thought argues for a lower inflation target, often characterisedby 0 to 2 percent but sometimes expressed as the level of average prices remaining stable over time.Those who favour this view discount the arguments advanced by the ‘low positive’ school. Theyacknowledge that there is an upward bias in the way in which inflation is measured, but argue that inmost countries outside the United States that bias is almost certainly less than 1 percent and certainlycould not justify a target with a mid-point of 2 percent. (The New Zealand Government Statistician isstrongly convinced that there is less bias in the measurement of the New Zealand CPI than there is inthe measurement of the US CPI.) They acknowledge that it has not been easy to adjust nominalwages downwards in recent years, but argue that in substantial part that is a result of the persistentlyhigh inflation most countries have experienced in recent decades, so that that should be no more thana transitional problem. Moreover, even though it may be difficult to reduce the wages of an individualemployee, that does not prevent a significant reduction in unit labour costs as a result both ofunchanged wages and positive productivity, and of natural turnover in the labour force. Critics of the‘low positive’ school challenge the assertion that monetary policy occasionally needs to reduce realinterest rates below zero, and note other ways in which monetary policy can stimulate demand,particularly in very open economies where movements in the exchange rate play an important role ininfluencing aggregate demand in the short term.Those favouring very low inflation (0 to 2 percent) argue that not only are there noadvantages in tolerating a ‘low positive’ rate of inflation there are also significant disadvantages ofeven quite low rates of inflation. Thus for example Martin Feldstein of Harvard University (andcurrent president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US) argues strongly that evenvery low levels of inflation significantly exacerbate the biases in the tax system which encourageconsumption, discourage saving, and encourage excessive investment in residential property. In arecent paper he argued that reducing measured inflation from 3 percent to 1 percent in the UnitedStates would result in a permanent increase in the level of US GDP of 1 percent, a very large gain ineconomic well-being even if there is some temporary loss of output required to reduce inflation tothat level. Others have also argued that the interaction between inflation on the one hand and tax andfinancial reporting systems geared to historical cost accounting on the other creates a significant biasagainst capital-intensive investment projects and all investment with a long pay-back period, and abias in favour of highly-geared companies and investments with a short pay-back period.This debate is by no means concluded. At a major conference I attended last Augustin the United States, it seemed to me that a majority of those who expressed an opinion favoured a 0to 2 percent target, and that has been my own clear predilection. But given that there are veryexperienced central bankers and monetary economists in both schools, it is at this stage quiteinappropriate to be dogmatic, and in my own view a target which involves doing our utmost to keepmeasured inflation between 0 and 3 percent is certainly consistent with the intention of the legislationwithin which monetary policy is operated.Indeed, irrespective of where the mid-point of the target range should be, there maybe some advantage in having a slightly wider inflation target than the original 0 to 2 percent target. Anumber of observers have suggested that a target with a width of only 2 percentage points requires anexcessive degree of activism on the part of the central bank, and that a slightly wider band, whateverits mid-point, would be sensible. This has been argued, for example, by David Turner, an OECDeconomist. The tension is between, on the one hand, choosing a target range which effectivelyanchors inflation expectations at a low level but which is so narrow that it provokes excessive policyactivism and risks loss of credibility by being frequently exceeded; and on the other, a target rangewhich does a less effective job of anchoring inflation expectations, but which requires less policyBIS Review   23/1997
- 4 -activism and protects credibility by being rarely breached. A 0 to 3 percent range seems a reasonablecompromise.But whether there is any benefit at all from a wider target band depends significantlyon how a wider band, with a higher ‘ceiling’, affects the public’s expectations of future inflation. Ifpeople understand the new target as meaning that the Bank, under Government instructions, is nowwilling to accept 1 percent more inflation than previously, then nothing positive will have beenachieved at all - and indeed there will almost certainly be net cost involved in the change. This isbecause any increase in inflationary expectations would tend to feed into slightly higher pricingdecisions, slightly higher wage settlements, slightly greater eagerness to borrow, slightly lessenthusiasm for saving. If the Bank were willing to accept this behaviour, ‘accommodate’ it in thejargon, we would end up with somewhat higher inflation but no other result (though of course thehigher inflation would have all the negative consequences for the real economy referred to earlier). Ifthe Bank were in fact not prepared to accommodate this increase in inflationary expectations - whichit would not be I hasten to emphasise - then the end result of increased inflationary expectationswould simply be higher real interest rates, somewhat lower economic growth, and somewhat higherunemployment. If that were the end result, the widening of the inflation target would not only provideno benefit it would be positively damaging.So I think it is crucially important that nobody misunderstand what the Reserve Bankis doing. Let me be absolutely clear. The Reserve Bank has not gone soft on inflation. We will not betargeting an inflation rate of 3 percent, or even an inflation rate close to 3 percent. The Reserve Bankwill be striving to keep inflation well inside the 0 to 3 percent range, and we best do that by trying tohave inflation as close to the middle part of the range as possible.That does not mean, of course, that we will always hit the target, any more than wealways hit 0 to 2 percent. But it does mean that we will be constantly implementing monetary policywith the intention of having inflation as defined around the middle part of the target. If we do this, thenumber of occasions on which we miss the target should be minimised. Indeed, given the wider targetrange, there should be fewer breaches than in the past.Inflation and growth expectationsAnd this leads naturally into the second major theme of my address today, about NewZealanders’ expectations about inflation and growth. It is my contention that expectations about bothneed to become a lot more realistic.First, let’s look at expectations of inflation. Yes, there are some encouraging signsthat New Zealanders’ expectations of future inflation have fallen substantially over the last decade asactual inflation has fallen. Surveys of inflation expectations currently suggest that, on average,householders now expect year-ahead inflation to be around 3.9 percent, well down on the levels ofthe late 1980s (year-ahead inflation expectations were 12.5 percent on average towards the end of1987, and were still 8.3 percent near the end of 1989), while 10 year bond yields are slightly lowerthan 10 year bond yields in Australia and less than 1 percent higher than 10 year yields in the US.Wage settlements in recent years have also been one of the areas where inflation expectations seem tohave been subdued, with a great many wage settlements concluded at levels which have, untilrecently at least, put little upward pressure on prices.However, other indications are not nearly as encouraging and suggest that NewZealanders’ inflation expectations are still showing the effects of the two decades of high inflation weendured in the 1970s and 1980s.BIS Review   23/1997
- 5 -Look at New Zealanders’ saving behaviour for example. Among those with financialassets, how many are locking in the high real interest rates they purport to see by investing inlong-term fixed interest instruments, such as term bank deposits or government bonds? The shortanswer is ‘very few’. To be sure, our bond yields are now comparable to international bond yields,and I used to deduce from that that the new monetary policy framework had produced a profoundreduction in inflationary expectations. I now believe that I was unjustifiably optimistic, because it isforeign savers who have bought our bonds in huge volumes, thereby reducing bond yields tointernational levels. More than half the New Zealand government bonds on issue are now heldoverseas, and the proportion of some of the longer-dated bonds held overseas is even higher. (Inrecent months, for example, more than 70 percent of the longest-dated nominal bond held by themarket has been held by overseas investors.) If we look at the term structure of the New Zealand-sourced deposits of any major bank, we will see that overwhelmingly New Zealanders are holdingtheir cash and fixed interest investments at very short term, the great bulk with a maturity of less than12 months. Indeed, most banks have close to 90 percent of their total deposits maturing within sixmonths, and very few have more than 5 percent of their deposits maturing beyond 12 months. By andlarge, most New Zealanders do not invest their savings in long-term fixed interest securities at all,despite what are, on the face of it, very attractive inflation-adjusted interest rates.What are we doing with our savings? Though the data on saving behaviour in NewZealand is not very good, anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that New Zealanders invest anyavailable saving in some form of equity investment, most typically property: a bigger house to live in,another house to rent out, a bigger farm, another piece of farmland, perhaps a block of flats, abeach-side section, an industrial property, a commercial building, perhaps a forest block, anythingwhich, the best-selling books and advertisements constantly tell us, will protect us against inflation.Protect us against inflation? But we’ve hardly had any inflation for the last six years and, despite thebiggest change in New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements this century, we have just had the newCoalition Government re-affirm the strong commitment to price stability. True, but we’ve certainlyhad two decades of high inflation in the memory of all adult New Zealanders and we all know ofpeople who lost most of their life’s savings over that period by ‘making the mistake’ of investing in‘secure’ fixed-interest investments.I’ve told the true story of my uncle so many times that I am almost embarrassed to tellit again, but in my view it contains the explanation of much of the current approach to saving in NewZealand, so I will tell it again. After a life-time of orcharding in the Nelson area, he sold his orchardin 1971 and invested the sale proceeds ‘safely’ to provide income and security for his retirement. Tobe absolutely safe, he invested the entire proceeds in 18-year government stock, at the then-interestrate of 5.4 percent. Perhaps fortunately, he did not live until those bonds matured in 1989, but if hehad done the $30,000 he received from selling his orchard in 1971 and which matured in 1989 wouldhave bought him by that time just one Toyota Corolla car (with a little change). In 1971, $30,000would have bought him 11 Toyota Corollas. In the space of just 18 years, he had lost some 90 percentof his retirement nest egg, all by making the mistake of assuming that inflation would stay at therelatively low level of 1971.As I say, most adult New Zealanders know stories similar to that one. Or they knowstories which tell the same message in another way. Stories about people who bought a property withborrowed money in the early 1970s and watched the price of the house increase perhaps eight- or ten-fold over the next 20 years, with the value of the equity actually invested in the house (after allowingfor the money borrowed to help finance the purchase) increasing perhaps 30 times. Perhaps we havehad an experience like that ourselves. Even if we have not, we are assailed by books andadvertisements on all sides which assure us that property investment is the best way of ‘protectingyou against inflation’, to say nothing of making the most effective use of the tax system. Even if weare not familiar with the detail of the statistics, we know that in recent years residential propertyprices have risen hugely in much of the country, most obviously in Auckland. According to REINZBIS Review   23/1997
- 6 -data, the median price of house sales in the Auckland district rose by 53 percent over the three yearsto December 1996, by 36 percent in the Southland district (including Queenstown), and by 29 percentin the Waikato/Bay of Plenty district. Even rural land prices, which have come back markedly insome areas in recent months, rose by 45 percent over the three years to the first half of 1996,according to Valuation New Zealand data. Is it any wonder therefore that New Zealanders who claimto believe that consumer price inflation is more or less under control continue to borrow moneyenthusiastically at 9, 10, and 11 percent to acquire property?Lest there be any misunderstanding, I am assuredly not against investing in property,let alone against home ownership. I own a home and a small amount of other property myself. I ammerely saying that inflationary expectations are alive and well in the minds of most New Zealandersand that, until that situation changes, we will inevitably be looking at interest rates which look high incomparison to current consumer price inflation. Conversely, of course, as inflationary expectationsabate, and particularly as expectations of property price inflation abate, the overall level of interestrates will tend to be lower also.Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US central bank, has on several occasions suggestedthat price stability obtains when economic agents - businesses and private individuals - no longer takeaccount of the prospective change in the general price level in their economic decision-making. It isclear that we still have a little way to go.What about New Zealanders’ expectations for economic growth? Are these too quiteunrealistic? I believe that they are, at least based on current policies and attitudes.In the early 1990s, New Zealand achieved real economic growth of more than 5percent per annum for two years in succession. We were told that we were growing faster than anyother OECD economy, and at growth rates comparable to those achieved by the East Asian ‘tiger’economies. We began to believe that, as a result of the economic reforms of the last decade, we toowere capable of 5 or 6 percent growth indefinitely and all of us wanted to believe that. Sadly, we cannot, or at least there is no evidence yet that we can. The very fast growth of 1993 and 1994 was theresult in part of the one-off productivity gains resulting from the micro-economic reforms of the late1980s and early 1990s, and in a greater part of the economy having available a large number ofunemployed and underemployed people, and unutilised industrial capacity, as a result of the recessionof 1991 and early 1992. As these people and this capacity were brought back into productive work,the rate of growth of real output jumped well above its sustainable rate. The rate of unemploymentfell very sharply from almost 11 percent to just over 6 percent in little more than three years and,while everybody hopes that unemployment falls further, it is clearly impossible to reduce the rate ofunemployment by 5 percentage points every three years indefinitely.As I told the members of the Auckland Chamber last year, economic growth dependsprimarily not on monetary policy but on real factors - on how fast the labour force is growing, onhow skilled the labour force is, on how much capital that labour force has to work with, on thetechnology embodied in the capital, on the efficiency of the price system in signalling where capitalcan be most productively invested, on the nature of regulations and restrictions which inhibit theeffective working of the price system, and a host of other factors. Prices which are, on average, stableassist the pricing system to work effectively, and thereby help to ensure that investment takes place inthe most economically sensible places. Prices which are, on average, stable tend to encourage saving,and thereby help to finance additional investment. But stable prices won’t make the labour force growmore quickly, or make the labour force more skilled, or improve the technology embodied in thecapital equipment which the labour force uses, let alone make public sector enterprises more efficient;or improve the quality of the education system; or move resources out of highly protected sectors intothose which can be competitive on international markets; or improve the marketing of commodityexports; or even give us East-Asian-type savings rates.BIS Review   23/1997
- 7 -I would argue strongly that price stability has been helpful to the improvedperformance of the New Zealand economy in recent years, but I have never claimed for a momentthat price stability has been the sole reason for our better performance, nor that price stabilityguarantees us strong growth in the future. In addition to our ability to bring back into productivework people and capital equipment that had become unemployed during the recession, our very muchimproved growth performance in recent years has been the result of a whole range of policy changes- of reduced protection and regulation in the private sector, of corporatisation and privatisation ofmany formerly inefficient public sector enterprises, of a vastly less distorting tax structure, of portreform, of labour market reform, and all the rest.If we want to build on that achievement in the years ahead, we must constantly beseeking areas where productivity can be further improved. At this stage, the aggregate numbers forthe economy as a whole have led the Reserve Bank to base its economic projections on trend labourproductivity growth of no more than 1.25 percent per annum. If that turns out to be the case (and 1.25percent is close to productivity growth in other mature economies, such as the United States1 andAustralia), total growth in GDP could well be around 3 percent per annum because of growth in thelabour force. But growth in real income per head, which must surely be the real objective ofeconomic policy, will not exceed 1.25 percent annually. If we want faster growth in spending thanthat, we can in the short term borrow to supplement our income but, as we learned in the 1970s and1980s, that is ultimately futile. In the longer term, higher incomes per head, and the higher spendingthat that can bring, can only come from finding ways to accelerate productivity growth.And how do we do that? Certainly not by debasing the currency through toleratinginflation. The very rapid growth of the countries of East Asia is in part simply the result of their beingable to pick up ‘off the shelf’ modern technologies, which have taken decades to develop elsewhere.In other words, there is a substantial element of ‘catch-up’ in the fast growth of East Asia. But thegrowth which has occasioned so much envy on the part of some New Zealanders has also beenachieved in a particular cultural environment - a cultural environment which places enormousemphasis on family self-reliance, which abjures reliance on the state, which as a consequencegenerates a savings rate roughly double the New Zealand rate, which pursues education and trainingwith a passion, which regards material affluence as a highly desirable goal. New Zealanders have,implicitly at least, chosen a slower growth path, by placing little emphasis on saving, by placing amore modest value on education and training, by valuing other goals more highly than affluence.I recall seeing a television programme three or four years ago about Asian students inour schools. The programme included comments from two New Zealand children that they resentedthe fact that the Asian children worked much harder than they did. I don’t think New Zealandchildren should be forced to work as hard as Asian children do, but I think it is important for ourchildren to realise that they live in a world where those who work hard will end up with higherincomes and more wealth than those who choose to work less hard. If we are only prepared to pay forbeer, we won’t be drinking a lot of champagne. The sooner we acknowledge that reality the better forall concerned. By not doing so, the risk is not only that private spending will constantly be running upagainst income constraints, but also that successive governments will be under considerable andunreasonable pressure to satisfy demands for increased public expenditure. Both will have seriousimplications for our ability to finance development from our own savings.                                                  1Indeed, over the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the second quarter of 1996 overall businesssector productivity in the United States grew by only 0.3 percent per annum.BIS Review   23/1997
- 8 -ConclusionMr. Chairman, let me conclude by summarising my main points.First, I am confident that the new inflation target set me by Government is consistentwith the legislation under which the Bank operates and consistent with monetary policy continuing tomake the best contribution of which it is capable to New Zealand society and the development of theNew Zealand economy.Secondly, whether the slightly wider target band enables the economy to operate withslightly less central bank activism depends heavily on how the change affects the expectations whichpeople have of future inflation. If people assume that, on average, inflation will be 1 percent higherthan they assumed previously, there is a real danger that, far from providing additional flexibility, thewider target will actually harm the way in which the economy works. Let it be clearly understood,therefore, that the Bank will be implementing monetary policy with the intention of having inflationas defined in my agreement with the Minister around the middle part of the 0 to 3 percent target. Ifwe do this, the number of occasions on which we miss the target should be minimised. It wouldclearly be very damaging if the impression were created that we might be content with inflationoutcomes near the top of the target.Thirdly, we still have some work to do in convincing New Zealanders that our moneyis a predictably safe store of value for the relevant future. Until that is achieved, the interest rate atwhich the willingness to save in the form of financial assets is matched by the willingness to borrowwill continue to look high by international standards, and our companies will continue to seekunrealistically high rates of return on investment projects. That will tend to mean that investment islower than it might otherwise be, and that the exchange rate will be higher than otherwise.Fourthly, it is important that, while constantly aspiring to improve our nationalgrowth performance, we all have realistic expectations about the speed at which the NewZealand economy can actually grow. Recent reforms have undoubtedly increased our sustainablegrowth rate above that which was possible in the past: after several decades of growing muchmore slowly than other developed economies, we now seem capable of growth comparable to,and probably a little higher than, growth in many other mature economies, such as the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom. But we will probably never be able to equal the growth ratesachieved recently by the ‘catch-up economies’, while growing faster than we currently can willdepend not on the central bank being a little more tolerant of inflation but on continuingimprovement in many other policy areas and on sustained productivity growth.The Reserve Bank makes its greatest contribution to New Zealand society byachieving and maintaining public confidence in the stability of the unit of value, predictably,dependably, reliably.BIS Review   23/1997
Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve in its semi-annualreport on monetary policy   Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Banking Committee on26/2/97.I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this Committee to present theFederal Reserve’s semiannual report on monetary policy.The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quitefavorable.  Real GDP growth has picked up to more than three percent over the four quarters of1996, as the economy progressed through its sixth year of expansion. Employers added morethan two-and-a-half million workers to their payrolls in 1996, and the unemployment rate fellfurther. Nominal wages and salaries have increased faster than prices, meaning workers havegained ground in real terms, reflecting the benefits of rising productivity. Outside the food andenergy sectors, increases in consumer prices actually have continued to edge lower, with coreCPI inflation only 2½ percent over the past twelve months.Low inflation last year was both a symptom and a cause of the good economy. Itwas symptomatic of the balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident absence of majorstrains on resources. At the same time, continued low levels of inflation and inflationexpectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. They have helped tocreate a financial and economic environment conducive to strong capital spending andlonger-range planning generally, and so to sustained economic expansion. Consequently, theFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is crucial to keep inflation contained in thenear term and ultimately to move toward price stability.Looking ahead, the members of the FOMC expect inflation to remain low and theeconomy to grow appreciably further. However, as I shall be discussing, the unusually goodinflation performance of recent years seems to owe in large part to some temporary factors, ofuncertain longevity. Thus, the FOMC continues to see the distribution of inflation risks skewedto the upside and must remain especially alert to the possible emergence of imbalances infinancial and product markets that ultimately could endanger the maintenance of thelow-inflation environment. Sustainable economic expansion for 1997 and beyond depends on it.For some, the benign inflation outcome of 1996 might be considered surprising,as resource utilization rates -- particularly of labor -- were in the neighborhood of those thathistorically have been associated with building inflation pressures. To be sure, an acceleration innominal labor compensation, especially its wage component, became evident over the past year.But the rate of pay increase still was markedly less than historical relationships with labormarket conditions would have predicted. A typical restraint on compensation increases has beenevident for a few years now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater workerinsecurity. In 1991, at the bottom of the recession, a survey of workers at large firms byInternational Survey Research Corporation indicated that 25 percent feared being laid off. In1996, despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market, the same surveyorganization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff.The reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other employment as thelabor market tightened has provided further evidence of such concern, as has the tendencytoward longer labor union contracts. For many decades, contracts rarely exceeded three years.Today, one can point to five- and six-year contracts -- contracts that are commonly characterizedBIS Review   22/1997
- 2 -by an emphasis on job security and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level ofwork stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security.Thus, the willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases inwages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unansweredquestion is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures,tightened considerably. One possibility may lie in the rapid evolution of technologies in use inthe work place. Technological change almost surely has been an important impetus behindcorporate restructuring and downsizing. Also, it contributes to the concern of workers that theirjob skills may become inadequate. No longer can one expect to obtain all of one’s lifetime jobskills with a high-school or college diploma. Indeed, continuing education is perceived to beincreasingly necessary to retain a job. The more pressing need to update job skills is doubtlessalso a factor in the marked expansion of on-the-job training programs, especially in technicalareas, in many of the nation’s corporations.Certainly, other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growthin the past few years. The sharp deceleration in health care costs, of course, is cited frequently.Another is the heightened pressure on firms and their workers in industries that competeinternationally. Domestic deregulation has had similar effects on the intensity of competitiveforces in some industries. In any event, although I do not doubt that all these factors are relevant,I would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity.If heightened job insecurity is the most significant explanation of the break withthe past in recent years, then it is important to recognize that, as I indicated in last February’sHumphrey-Hawkins testimony, suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecuritycan be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job securityhas to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced area temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additionaljob security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards.Even if real wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward track than otherwise as aresult of the greater sense of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert at some pointto a normal relationship with inflation. The unknown is when this transition period will end.Indeed, some recent evidence suggests that the labor markets bear especiallycareful watching for signs that the return to more normal patterns may be in process. The Bureauof Labor Statistics reports that people were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to seekother employment in January than previously. The possibility that this reflects greaterconfidence by workers accords with a recent further rise in the percent of households respondingto a Conference Board survey who perceive that job availability is plentiful. Of course, the jobmarket has continued to be quite good recently; employment in January registered robust growthand initial claims for unemployment insurance have been at a relatively low level of late. Wagesrose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures, perhaps also raising questions about whetherthe transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close.To be sure, the pickup in wage gains has not shown through to underlying priceinflation. Increases in the core CPI, as well as in several broader measures of prices, have stayedsubdued or even edged off further in recent months. As best we can judge, faster productivitygrowth last year meant that rising compensation gains did not cause labor costs per unit ofoutput to increase any more rapidly. Non-labor costs, which are roughly a quarter of totalconsolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate sector, were little changed in 1996.BIS Review   22/1997
- 3 -Owing in part to this subdued behavior of unit costs, profits and rates of return oncapital have risen to high levels. As a consequence, businesses believe that, were they to raiseprices to boost profits further, competitors with already ample profit margins would not followsuit; instead, they would use the occasion to capture a greater market share. This interplay isdoubtless a significant factor in the evident loss of pricing power in American business.Intensifying global competition also may be further restraining domestic firms’ability to hike prices as well as wages. Clearly, the appreciation of the dollar on balance over thepast eighteen months or so, together with low inflation in many of our trading partners, hasresulted in a marked decline in non-oil import prices that has helped to damp domestic inflationpressures. Yet it is important to emphasize that these influences, too, would be holding downinflation only temporarily; they represent a transition to a lower price level than would otherwiseprevail, not to a permanently lower rate of inflation.Against the background of all these considerations, the FOMC has recognized theneed to remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary imbalances that might, if notcorrected promptly, undermine our economic expansion. The FOMC in fact has signaled a stateof heightened alert for possible policy tightening since last July in its policy directives. But, wehave also taken care not to act prematurely. The FOMC refrained from changing policy lastsummer, despite expectations of a near-term policy firming by many financial marketparticipants. In light of the developments I’ve just discussed affecting wages and prices, wethought inflation might well remain damped, and in any case was unlikely to pick up veryrapidly, in part because the economic expansion appeared likely to slow to a more sustainablepace. In the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then.Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, however, wecannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may become appropriatebefore any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident. If the FOMC were to implement suchan action, it would be judging that the risks to the economic expansion of waiting longer hadincreased unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of waiting for uncertainties to bereduced by the accumulation of more information about economic trends. Indeed, the hallmarkof a successful policy to foster sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not rise. I findit ironic that our actions in 1994-95 were criticized by some because inflation did not turnupward. That outcome, of course, was the intent of the tightening, and I am satisfied that ouractions then were both necessary and effective, and helped to foster the continued economicexpansion.To be sure, 1997 is not 1994. The real federal funds rate today is significantlyhigher than it was three years ago. Then we had just completed an extended period of monetaryease which addressed the credit stringencies of the early 1990s, and with the abatement of thecredit crunch, the low real funds rate of early 1994 was clearly incompatible with containinginflation and sustaining growth going forward. In February 1997, in contrast, our concern is amatter of relative risks rather than of expected outcomes. The real funds rate, judging by coreinflation, is only slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and might be at a level that willpromote continued non-inflationary growth, especially considering the recent rise in theexchange value of the dollar. Nonetheless, we cannot be sure. And the risks of being wrong areclearly tilted to the upside.I wish it were possible to lay out in advance exactly what conditions have toprevail to portend a buildup of inflation pressures or inflationary psychology. However, thecircumstances that have been associated with increasing inflation in the past have not followed aBIS Review   22/1997
- 4 -single pattern. The processes have differed from cycle to cycle, and what may have been a usefulleading indicator in one instance has given off misleading signals in another.I have already discussed the key role of labor market developments in restraininginflation in the current cycle and our careful monitoring of signs that the transition phase oftrading off lower real wages for greater job security might be coming to a close. As always, withresource utilization rates high, we would need to watch closely a situation in which demand wasclearly unsustainable because it was producing escalating pressures on resources, which coulddestabilize the economy. And we would need to be watchful that the progress we have made inkeeping inflation expectations damped was not eroding. In general, though, our analysis willneed to encompass all potentially relevant information, from financial markets as well as theeconomy, especially when some signals, like those in the labor market, have not been followingtheir established patterns.The ongoing economic expansion to date has reinforced our conviction about theimportance of low inflation -- and the public’s confidence in continued low inflation. Theeconomic expansion almost surely would not have lasted nearly so long had monetary policysupported an unsustainable acceleration of spending that induced a buildup of inflationaryimbalances. The Federal Reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in inflation, for acceding tohigher inflation would countenance an insidious weakening of our chances for sustaininglong-run economic growth. Inflation interferes with the efficient allocation of resources byconfusing price signals, undercutting a focus on the longer run, and distorting incentives.This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained. The central tendencyof the forecasts made by the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents has the increase in thetotal CPI slipping back into a range of 2¾ to 3 percent over the four quarters of the year. Thisslight falloff from last year’s pace is expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices assome of last year’s supply limitations ease. More importantly, world oil supplies are projectedby most analysts to increase relative to world oil demand, and futures markets project a furtherdecline in prices, at least in the near term. The recent and prospective declines in crude oil pricesnot only should affect retail gasoline and home heating oil prices but also should relieveinflation pressures through lower prices for other petroleum products, which are imbedded in theeconomy’s underlying cost structure. Nonetheless, the trend in inflation rates in the core CPI andin broader price measures may be somewhat less favorable than in recent years. A continuedtight labor market, whose influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled increase inthe minimum wage later in the year and perhaps by higher growth of benefits now thatconsiderable health-care savings already have been realized, could put upward pressure on coreinflation. Moreover, the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar over the last eighteen months inpushing down import prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters.The unemployment rate, according to Board members and Bank presidents,should stay around 5¼ to 5½ percent through the fourth quarter, consistent with their projectionsof measured real GDP growth of 2 to 2¼ percent over the four quarters of the year. Such agrowth rate would represent some downshifting in output expansion from that of last year. Theprojected moderation of growth likely would reflect several influences: (1) declines in realfederal government purchases should be exerting a modest degree of restraint on overalldemand; (2) the lagged effects of the increase in the exchange value of the dollar in recentmonths likely will damp U.S. net exports somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction isunlikely to repeat the gains of 1996. On the other hand, we do not see evidence of widespreadimbalances either in business inventories or in stocks of equipment and consumer durables thatwould lead to a substantial cutback in spending. And financial conditions overall remainBIS Review   22/1997
- 5 -supportive; real interest rates are not high by historical standards and credit is readily availablefrom intermediaries and in the market.The usual uncertainties in the overall outlook are especially focused on thebehavior of consumers. Consumption should rise roughly in line with the projected moderateexpansion of disposable income, but both upside and downside risks are present. According tovarious surveys, sentiment is decidedly upbeat. Consumers have enjoyed healthy gains in theirreal incomes along with the extraordinary stock-market driven rise in their financial wealth overthe last couple of years. Indeed, econometric models suggest that the more than $4 trillion rise inequity values since late 1994 should have had a larger positive influence on consumer spendingthan seems to have actually occurred.It is possible, however, that households have been reluctant to spend much oftheir added wealth because they see a greater need to keep it to support spending in retirement.Many households have expressed heightened concern about their financial security in old age,which reportedly has led to increased provision for retirement. The results of a survey conductedannually by the Roper Organization, which asks individuals about their confidence in the SocialSecurity system, shows that between 1992 and 1996 the percent of respondents expressing littleor no confidence in the system jumped from about 45 percent to more than 60 percent.Moreover, consumer debt burdens are near historical highs, while credit carddelinquencies and personal bankruptcies have risen sharply over the past year. Thesecircumstances may make both borrowers and lenders a bit more cautious, damping spending. Infact, we may be seeing both wealth and debt effects already at work for different segments of thepopulation, to an approximately offsetting extent. Saving out of current income by households inthe upper income quintile, who own nearly three-fourths of all non-pension equities held byhouseholds, evidently has declined in recent years. At the same time, the use of credit forpurchases appears to have leveled off after a sharp runup from 1993 to 1996, perhaps becausesome households are becoming debt constrained and, as a result, are curtailing their spending.The Federal Reserve will be weighing these influences as it endeavors to helpextend the current period of sustained growth. Participants in financial markets seem to believethat in the current benign environment the FOMC will succeed indefinitely. There is noevidence, however, that the business cycle has been repealed. Another recession will doubtlessoccur some day owing to circumstances that could not be, or at least were not, perceived bypolicymakers and financial market participants alike. History demonstrates that participants infinancial markets are susceptible to waves of optimism, which can in turn foster a generalprocess of asset-price inflation that can feed through into markets for goods and services.Excessive optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal in the form of imbalances that tend togrow over time. When unwarranted expectations ultimately are not realized, the unwinding ofthese financial excesses can act to amplify a downturn in economic activity, much as they canamplify the upswing. As you know, last December I put the question this way: “...how do weknow when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subjectto unexpected and prolonged contractions ...?”We have not been able, as yet, to provide a satisfying answer to this question, butthere are reasons in the current environment to keep this question on the table. Clearly, whenpeople are exposed to long periods of relative economic tranquility, they seem inevitably proneto complacency about the future. This is understandable. We have had fifteen years of economicexpansion interrupted by only one recession -- and that was six years ago. As the memory ofsuch past events fades, it naturally seems ever less sensible to keep up one’s guard against anBIS Review   22/1997
- 6 -adverse event in the future. Thus, it should come as no surprise that, after such a long period ofbalanced expansion, risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses in virtually all financialmarkets have declined to near-record lows.Is it possible that there is something fundamentally new about this current periodthat would warrant such complacency? Yes, it is possible. Markets may have become moreefficient, competition is more global, and information technology has doubtless enhanced thestability of business operations. But, regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such “neweras” that, in the end, have proven to be a mirage. In short, history counsels caution.Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equityprices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability.Analytically, current stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest rates could bejustified by very strong earnings growth expectations. In fact, the long-term earnings projectionsof financial analysts have been marked up noticeably over the last year and seem to imply veryhigh earnings growth and continued rising profit margins, at a time when such margins arealready up appreciably from their depressed levels of five years ago. It could be argued that,although margins are the highest in a generation, they are still below those that prevailed in the1960s. Nonetheless, further increases in these margins would evidently require continuedrestraint on costs: labor compensation continuing to grow at its current pace and productivitygrowth picking up. Neither, of course, can be ruled out. But we should keep in mind that, atthese relatively low long-term interest rates, small changes in long-term earnings expectationscould have outsized impacts on equity prices.Caution also seems warranted by the narrow yield spreads that suggestperceptions of low risk, possibly unrealistically low risk. Considerable optimism about theability of businesses to sustain this current healthy financial condition seems, as I indicatedearlier, to be influencing the setting of risk premiums, not just in the stock market butthroughout the financial system. This optimistic attitude has become especially evident in qualityspreads on high-yield corporate bonds -- what we used to call “junk bonds.” In addition, bankshave continued to ease terms and standards on business loans, and margins on many of theseloans are now quite thin. Many banks are pulling back a little from consumer credit card lendingas losses exceed expectations. Nonetheless, some bank and nonbank lenders have beenexpanding aggressively into the home equity loan market and so-called “subprime” auto lending,although recent problems in the latter may already be introducing a sense of caution.Why should the central bank be concerned about the possibility that financialmarkets may be overestimating returns or mispricing risk? It is not that we have a firm view thatequity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low. Our goal is tocontribute as best we can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth over time, and wewould be pleased if the favorable economic environment projected in markets actually comes topass. Rather, the FOMC has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances,whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures, would ultimatelythreaten healthy economic expansion.Unfortunately, because the monetary aggregates were subject to an episode ofaberrant behavioral patterns in the early 1990s, they are likely to be of only limited help inmaking this judgment. For three decades starting in the early 1960s, the public’s demand for thebroader monetary aggregates, especially M2, was reasonably predictable. In the intermediateterm, M2 velocity -- nominal income divided by the stock of M2 -- tended to vary directly withthe difference between money market yields and the return on M2 assets -- that is, with itsBIS Review   22/1997
- 7 -short-term opportunity cost. In the long run, as adjustments in deposit rates caused theopportunity cost to revert to an equilibrium, M2 velocity also tended to return to an associatedstable equilibrium level. For several years in the early 1990s, however, the velocities of M2 andM3 exhibited persisting upward shifts that departed markedly from these historical patterns.In the last two to three years, velocity patterns seem to have returned to thosehistorical relationships, after allowing for a presumed permanent upward shift in the levels ofvelocity. Even so, given the abnormal velocity behavior during the early 1990s, FOMC memberscontinue to see considerable uncertainty in the relationship of broad money to opportunity costsand nominal income. Concern about the possibility of aberrant behavior has made the FOMChesitant to upgrade the role of these measures in monetary policy.Against this background, at its February meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed theprovisional ranges set last July for money and debt growth this year: 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors. The M2 andM3 ranges again are designed to be consistent with the FOMC’s long-run goal of price stability:For, if the velocities of the broader monetary aggregates were to continue behaving as they didbefore 1990, then money growth around the middle portions of the ranges would be consistentwith noninflationary, sustainable economic expansion. But, even with such velocity behaviorthis year, when inflation is expected to still be higher than is consistent with our long-runobjective of reasonable price stability, the broader aggregates could well grow around the upperbounds of these ranges. The debt aggregate probably will expand around the middle of its rangethis year.I will conclude on the same upbeat note about the U.S. economy with which Ibegan. Although a central banker’s occupational responsibility is to stay on the lookout fortrouble, even I must admit that our economic prospects in general are quite favorable. Theflexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of our private sector remain examples for thewhole world to emulate. The Federal Reserve will endeavor to do its part by continuing to fostera monetary framework under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest possible extent.BIS Review   22/1997
Mr. Macfarlane discusses the economics of nostalgia   Talk by the Governor ofthe Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to The Sydney Institute on 11/2/97.1.  IntroductionIt is a great pleasure to be speaking at The Sydney Institute, which has done somuch over recent years to keep alive informed discussion of public affairs and the arts. Inkeeping with this tradition, I have chosen to speak on a subject with a historical, economic andpolitical theme. I would like to look back at the 1950s and 1960s, and evaluate some of thelessons that people take from this period. The further my professional life proceeds, the morevalue I see in a good knowledge of economic history, even if it is so recent that most of us havelived and worked through it. As you will gather, my views on history are much closer to GeorgeSantayana’s than to Henry Ford’s.There can be no quibble with the proposition that macro-economic performancein the immediate post-war period, which for present purposes I will refer to as the 1950s and1960s, was far superior to any period before or after. This has led a lot of people to use it as abasis for proposing economic policies for today. They look back at how things were done in the1950s and 1960s, and say “if only we did it the same way today, our macro-economicperformance would be as good as it was then”. This approach has some merit but, if we are touse it, it is very important that we get our facts straight about what the policies actually were inthe 1950s and 1960s.There are two propositions of policy relevance that are frequently made about thisperiod. The first one is that the macro-economic success at that time was due to the use ofactivist and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The second is that the world economywas moving along very smoothly in the post-war period, with everything under control, until hitby the external shock of the OPEC-induced oil price rise in late 1973 (and again in 1979). Iwould like to analyse these two propositions with particular reference to Australia, but in doingso it will be necessary to bring in a lot of international economic and political events,particularly those occurring in the United States.2.  Macro-economic  performance  in  the  1950s  and  1960sIt is not necessary to spend much time demonstrating how successful this periodwas in terms of macro-economic performance because no-one disputes it. Table 1 shows that thereal growth rate for the world economy was more than twice as high in the 1950-1973 periodthan in the previous 80 years. In Australia there was also a major improvement, although lessthan a doubling. Inflation, which had been negligible on average until the Second World War,rose to about 4 per cent in the 1950-1973 period, with the average being pushed up by theKorean War period and the early 1970s. At other times it was a good deal lower, and even withthese periods included, it was moderate enough to permit economic expansion for most of theperiod. Unemployment remained low throughout the period, although there was some cyclicalmovement at times. Overall, macro-economic performance was considerably better in this periodthan in any time before or since, which has prompted economic historians such as Maddison(1991) to refer to this period as the “Golden Age”.BIS Review   20/1997

The four most important, I believe, are asfollows:(i)There was a big gap to be made up following the Depression andthe Second World War. The 1950s and 1960s was a period of post-war reconstructionor “catch-up” for most countries. The largest growth pick-up occurred in the countriesmost devastated by the war, such as Germany, Italy, Japan and Austria, and the leastpronounced (although still significant) were in the United States, Canada, Switzerland,Sweden and Australia.(ii)Although populations and governments were eager for economicgrowth, there was widespread restraint in economic behaviour. The privations enduredduring the Depression and the War meant that as incomes rose, a high proportion wassaved. Inflationary expectations too had been conditioned by decades of nearly zeroinflation, which showed up in modest pricing and wage setting behaviour for much ofthe period. Some commentators also stress the political cohesion among westerncountries as a result of the ever-present influence of the Cold War.(iii)International trade was liberalised and exports and imports grewrapidly. This was a sharp contrast with the inter-war period. Maddison says “perhapsthe least controversial assertion one can make about the Golden Age is that it involveda remarkable revival of liberalism in international transactions. Trade and paymentbarriers erected in the 1930s and during the War were removed. The new-styleliberalism was buttressed by effective arrangements for regular consultation betweenWestern Countries and for mutual financial assistance” (IMF, OECD and GATT (nowWTO).)(iv)Governments conducted good macro-economic policies with agreater emphasis on economic growth than in previous decades. In a number ofcountries the new-found commitment to growth and low unemployment wasenshrined in legislation. In others it was less formal, but in nearly every country thefirst decades after the Second World War were characterised by well-balanced andsuccessful macro-economic policies. A more detailed examination of thesemacro-economic policies, particularly in Australia, is the subject of my next section.BIS Review   20/1997
- 3 -3.  The  role  of  macro-economic  policiesThere is no doubt that the dominant principle behind macro-economic policychanged after the Second World War in line with Keynesian teaching, but the change occurredmore quickly in some countries than others.The main change was that fiscal policy was to be used actively to promoteeconomic growth by deliberately incurring budget deficits at times of weak economic activity.Fiscal policy and monetary policy together were termed demand management policy, and theywere to be adjusted to smooth the business cycle, to increase growth and to achieve fullemployment. In Australia’s case, this approach was enshrined in a document - the 1945 WhitePaper, “Full Employment in Australia”.This approach to policy was very successful in that it achieved its aims of highgrowth rates and low unemployment for several decades, and it did so with generally low ratesof inflation. The achievement was all the greater, given that the 1950s contained a major shockin the form of the Korean War commodity price boom. This high level of success has led manypeople to assume that policy must have been operated with a high degree of activism, i.e. bychoosing very expansionary settings of policy. But this was not the case. For most of the periodwe are considering, demand management policy was quite restrained and, where necessary,restrictive. Certainly its guiding principle was Keynesian, but it was operated in a very balancedway and was, in any case, subject to an important constraint, which I will come to later.That this was the case should not be a surprise to people who remember theperiod. For example, the Fadden “Horror Budget” of 1951/52 and the “Credit Squeeze” of 1961,which nearly cost the Menzies Government office, have gone into folklore. Of course, therewere also periods where policy was expansionary, but on average the result was relativelybalanced. While growth was high, on average, there was also a business cycle operating duringthis period, with a couple of reasonably clearly defined recessions and booms.The fact that policy was well balanced can be shown for fiscal policy by a coupleof graphs.  Unfortunately, comparable data do not go back earlier than 1961/62, so we will haveto lose the 1950s from our comparisons. Diagram 1 shows the best general measure of theunderlying budget deficit. In the 12 years from 1961/62 to 1973/74 the budget was, on average, Diagram 1Budget Balance*-6.0-4.5-3.0-1.50.01.5-6.0-4.5-3.0-1.50.01.5Average1974/75 to 1995/96Average1961/62 to 1973/74%%Per cent of GDP* General government on an underlying basis.95/9690/9185/8680/8175/7670/7165/66BIS Review   20/1997
- 4 -in surplus to the extent of ½ per cent of GDP, and the fluctuations around the average were notvery large. In the period since then, the budget has nearly always been in deficit, with an averagedeficit of nearly 2 per cent of GDP. You can see the three attempts made to bring it backtowards surplus - the first one when Mr. Howard was Treasurer, the second one under Mr.Keating as Treasurer, and the third one which is being continued at the moment by Mr. Costello.In summary, it is the more recent period that could be characterised as activist and expansionaryin that there are bigger swings in the budgetary position and, on average, it tends to show amuch bigger deficit.Diagram 2General Government Outlays2428323624283236%%Per cent of GDPAverage1961/62 to 1973/74Average1974/75 to 1995/9695/9690/9185/8680/8175/7670/7165/6600Another measure of fiscal activism is the size of government expenditure relativeto the economy. It will come as no surprise to see that general government outlays relative toGDP were much lower in the 1960s than they are now (Diagram 2); in the earlier period theyaccounted for about 25 per cent of GDP, but over the last two decades they have averaged 34 percent of GDP.The stance of monetary policy is more difficult to analyse because interest ratescannot be used as the measure of comparison. This is because before the early 1980s thefinancial system was heavily regulated, with the Government imposing interest rate ceilings onmost forms of lending. Tightenings and easings in monetary policy showed up largely throughcredit rationing - the ease or difficulty in obtaining a loan at a given interest rate. This would befamiliar to people who can remember the difficulty of obtaining a housing mortgage at that time.The best way of judging whether monetary policy was tight or loose in such a system was to seehow fast it allowed money and credit to grow.  The growth of the money supply is shown inDiagram 3, and again we see relatively low and stable expansion during the 1950s and 1960s(except for the Korean War boom), before the turmoil starts in the 1970s (in this case, the veryearly 1970s).I referred earlier to the fact that monetary and fiscal policy had to operate underan important constraint during the 1950s and 1960s. The constraint to which I am referring is thegold exchange standard, whereby virtually all OECD countries fixed their exchange rate to theUS dollar, which in turn fixed to gold. In Australia’s case, our exchange rate to the US dollar didnot change between 1949 and 1971. This was in a way the centrepiece of our economic policy.BIS Review   20/1997
- 5 -Monetary policy and fiscal policy could not get too expansionary without either inflation or thebalance of payments threatening the exchange rate. This mechanism effectively meant that ourmacro-economic policies (and those of most OECD economies) could not get too far out of linewith the policies pursued by the US Government. A recognition of this link means that if wewish to fully understand what happened in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, we have to lookmore closely at the trends in US economic policy. This also means that we will have to stoplooking at the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s as a whole, and instead divide it into two quitedifferent sub-periods.Diagram 31951195619611966197119761981198619911996-50510152025-50510152025%% Money Supply*Year-ended percentage change* M34.  The  end  of  the  Golden  AgeThe role of the United States is crucial here. Despite its having enacted theEmployment Act of 1946, the United States continued to run reasonably conservative demandmanagement policies through the Truman and Eisenhower years and even in the early part of theKennedy Presidency. In this period US economic policy came in for a fair bit of criticism fromeconomists, particularly outside the United States, for being too cautious. There was some basisto this criticism in that US policy makers did seem to be less keen to expand than theircounterparts in other countries, particularly in Europe.American attitudes changed in the early 1960s, but nothing concrete occurreduntil the Johnson years. The turning point was the tax cuts introduced in 1964 and 1965 whichwere described by one of their architects - Arthur Okun - as “The largest stimulative fiscal actionever undertaken by the federal government in peacetime ... the first major stimulative measureadopted in the post-war era at a time when the economy was neither in, nor threatenedimminently by, recession. And, unlike earlier tax reductions, they were taken in a budgetarysituation marked by the twin facts that the federal budget was in deficit and federal expenditureswere rising.” This certainly got the United States moving and was soon followed by increaseddefence expenditure occasioned by the Vietnam War, and other government expenditureassociated with the Great Society programs. Some of the proponents of the original tax cuts thenargued for tax increases but, not surprisingly, they found these were harder to put into place thanwere the earlier tax cuts.BIS Review   20/1997
- 6 -In the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s the US economy grew veryquickly and inflation began to rise. For a time it was held in check by the Fed’s willingness torun a tight monetary policy, but with the appointment of Arthur Burns as Fed Chairman,monetary policy became more accommodating. President Nixon found that expansionarypolicies were popular, and continued in the same vein as his predecessor. By 1971, with theUnited States running a large current account deficit, it could no longer hold its commitment togold and the US dollar was effectively devalued against gold and against other major currencies.

- 7 -There was now no longer an anchor to the international financial system. Thus, the post-warperiod should really be divided into two sub-periods, with the US tax cuts of 1965 marking aconvenient dividing line. Thereafter, US policy became expansionary, and it ceased to provide aconstraint on the actions of other countries.It is instructive to see what happened in a range of countries during this secondperiod, that is between the turning point in US policy in 1965 and the OPEC shock at the end of1973. The story is very similar for all OECD countries. Their economies continued to growstrongly, but they were not able to get their unemployment any lower than the already lowstarting point (see Table 2).The main effect of these expansionary policies was to push inflationto levels that were not consistent with sustainable economic growth. As a general rule, mostcountries’ unemployment rates rose slightly, but their inflation rates doubled (see Table 3). By1972 and 1973 the world economy was in an inflationary boom. How did Australia fare in thisperiod?Our story was very similar to the general pattern, although the deterioration ininflation was more marked here. Our inflation rate, which had been about 4 per cent in themid-1960s, reached 10.4 per cent in the year to the September quarter of 1973. That means thatwe had already got our inflation rate into double digits before OPEC came along to deliver afurther inflationary impulse (see Diagram 4). Our problems were compounded by theinflationary boom that the world found itself in 1972 and 1973. Commodity prices were risingrapidly, as were our export receipts. With the monetary policy instruments then available, andwith the fixed exchange rate, it was not possible to quarantine the monetary effects, and themoney supply was soon growing at more than 20 per cent per annum. We did not help ourselvesvery much either with the way we set wages. The National Wage Case of December 1970resulted in a 6 per cent increase in awards, and the metals industry award of July 1971 added 9per cent to award wages through that year (when inflation was 5.1 per cent).Diagram 4Consumer Prices 03690369%%Year-ended percentage changeSep73Sep72Sep71Sep70Sep69Sep68Sep67Sep66Sep65The point of all this analysis is to answer the second proposition that waspresented in the Introduction. Was the world achieving good macro-economic performance untilhit by the OPEC shocks? The answer is clearly no. In the period after 1965, policies became tooambitious and too expansionary. In colloquial terms, we all lost the plot. Of course, it is easy forBIS Review   20/1997
- 8 -me to say these things now because I have the benefit of hindsight - it was much harder at thetime to see that we were overstretching ourselves.By 1973, the world economy already had an entrenched inflationary problem, notjust a temporary one as in the Korean War period. Whether OPEC had come along or not, itwould still have been necessary to re-examine demand management policies and do somethingabout restoring the sort of conditions that existed in the 1945-65 period. History shows that whatwe got instead was an oil price shock to add to our already considerable self-imposed troubles,and so spent the next decade-and-a-half trying to return to some sort of reasonable equilibrium. Ido not want to say anything about that period because that is another story.5.  ConclusionThe period that is loosely described as the 1950s and 1960s really covers thenearly three decades between the end of the Second World War and the first oil price shockknown as OPEC I. Macro-economic policies were successful for most of this time in that theyavoided the deflation that had characterised the 1930s, and yet did not move too far in theinflationary direction.However, a closer examination of the whole period suggests that there were twoquite distinct sub-periods. The first, from 1945 to 1965 or thereabouts, was the true Golden Agein that sustainable growth with low inflation was achieved against a background of macro-economic policies that did not try to be too ambitious in the short run. The second period, from1965 to 1973, looked promising for a time, but was ultimately a period of policy failure. Macro-economic policy tried to achieve too much and forgot about the need for sustainability. It endedup with the world economy in an inflationary boom, which set the scene for oil prices to risesharply, as had all other commodity prices during the boom. A policy reversal aimed at restoringthe more balanced approach of the 1945-65 period would have been needed even without theshock of OPEC.***************BibliographyAustralian Bureau of Statistics, Government Financial Statistics, Cat.

Mr. Patrikis discusses the monetary policy and regulatory implications ofbanking on the Internet   Address by the Vice-President of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, Mr. Ernest T. Patrikis, at the Queen Mary & Westfield College University of London &UNISYS International Management Centre held in Saint Paul de Vence, France from22-24/1/97.A. IntroductionI want to share with you today some observations and speculations gathered thisand last year about banking and the Internet. I will be speaking in my capacity as a centralbanker -- which includes monetary policy, banking services, bank supervision, and paymentssystem oversight -- and as a surfer of the ’Net. Let me state, at the outset, that, while the FederalReserve Bank of New York does not conduct “Internet banking” as such, we do have a homepage (http://www.ny.frb.org) with much useful information about our institution, with over threemillion recorded hits to date. Finally, let me add that some of what I say here today could, veryeasily, be obsolete in two months’ or even two weeks’ time. But I will try to point out thoseareas in advance.The title of this portion of the program gives rise to two issues of definition. Thefirst is “What is the Internet?” The second is “What is banking?” As I am sure you are wellaware, in the United States we are a litigious sort. We even have a legal definition of theInternet. According to one recent case, the “Internet” is “an international computer’supernetwork’ of over 15,000 computer networks used by about 30 million individuals,corporations, organizations, and educational institutions worldwide.”1 Another case describedthe “Internet” as “a global communications network linked principally by modems whichtransmit electronic data over telephone lines [with] approximately 20 million to 30 millionusers.”2“Banking” raises a host of issues in the United States. There is commercialbanking and investment banking. The products offered by “banking” firms range from deposittaking (including payment services), investment advisory and management services, trading infinancial instruments, brokering and underwriting financial instruments, lending, and trustservices. A bank can offer all of these services on the Internet. For the purposes of thisdiscussion, I will basically confine myself to deposit taking (including payment services) andlending.A Central Banker’s ViewFrom a United States central bank perspective, the most fundamental question ofbanking and the Internet is: What are the monetary-policy implications, especially were we toassume the enormous, widespread scale that some have been predicting? From this perspective,the answer appears to be: probably not much. If the Internet is used merely to facilitate existingbanking and payment transactions, such as executing electronic bill payments or transferringfunds from one bank account to another (which more or less describes what electronic billpayment really is anyway), the combination of banking and the Internet should have few, if any,implications for the conduct of United States monetary policy, or the measurement of the UnitedStates money supply. “Money,” as defined by M1, M2, or M3, would still be held in accounts at                                                  1Panavision Int’l, L.P. v.

- 2 -banks that would be reported to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System throughthe existing mechanisms that such funds are reported today.If, however, Internet banking evolved to the point where digital “coins,”account-based cards and PCs, or other private-sector initiatives produced electronicrepresentations of money that began to be used and circulated like currency, the potentialimplications for United States monetary policy are much greater. The key questions here arerelated to amount and velocity -- that is, (1) how would digital bills or notes, or digital coins, berepresented on the books of a bank or depository institution; and (2) how many times would thiselectronic coin or bill circulate in the general economy without somehow being processed andrecorded by a bank? In this regard, the October 1996 Bank for International Settlements report“Implications for Central Banks of the Development of Electronic Money” states “E-moneycould lead to shifts in the velocity of money which might temporarily reduce the usefulness ofthe monetary aggregates, especially narrower ones, for countries that rely on them as targets orindicators.” In a June 1996 speech before a cyber-payments conference, Governor EdwardKelley of the Board of Governors stated that, with respect to a bank’s liabilities incurred throughissuing stored-value cards, such liabilities should be included in the statistical reports that banksmust currently submit to the Board of Governors.3 It is difficult to argue that bank liabilitiesresulting from the issuance of electronic “coins” or electronic “bills and notes” should bereported any differently.A more problematic question arises when considering the matter of nonbankissuance of electronic coins or bills. Currently, the largest nonbank issuers of travelers checksare not required, but do volunteer to the Fed, the outstanding balances of their travelers checks,so that this information can be statistically recorded and reported in United States monetaryaggregates by the Fed. If the issuance of private electronic money grows to a significant level inthe real economy, and if much of that growth is provided by nonbank issuers of electronicmoney, there could be a similar request for nonbank issuers to provide information about thevolume of their issuance and their outstanding electronic money liabilities, to the extent theseliabilities are not recorded on the books of a bank every time they are circulated in the generaleconomy.A Bank Supervisor’s ViewFrom this perspective, combining banking and the Internet offers both greatopportunity and great potential risk. First, the good news -- it is primarily cost-related. It hasbeen reported by several banking studies that the cost of a typical transaction at a bank branch isnow over $1.00; the cost of an ATM transaction is approximately $0.25. The cost of an Internettransaction, however, has been estimated at about a penny. I do not vouch for this statistic, butthe difference is substantial. Such figures make a compelling argument for banks to get on theInternet sooner rather than later, and to move as many of their customers on to electronic orInternet banking as soon as they possibly can. Indeed, some banks offer low-fee accounts wherethe customer is not expected to enter an office physically -- mail, phone, and ATM aresufficient.As stated by Board of Governors Chairman Alan Greenspan: “it is useful...tobegin by reminding ourselves just why there is bank supervision and regulation. At bottom, ofcourse, is the historical experience of the effects on the real economy of financial market                                                  3Remarks of Edward W. Kelley, Jr., Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, atthe Cyberpayments Conference ’96 (June 18, 1996).BIS Review   17/1997
- 3 -disruptions and bank failures, especially when the disruptions and failures spread beyond theinitial impetus.”4A bank supervisor should have concerns other than cost, and these comprise thebad news -- the “risk” aspect of banking on the Internet. In the simplest terms, while we strive toensure that banks remain efficient and cost-effective, we also have to ensure that banks knowwhat they are getting into, and that they are capable of handling the risks that accompanybanking on the Internet. The tension between the two is very constant and real, particularlybecause the technology today seems to be moving so much faster than bankers or banksupervisors can fully absorb.At the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we are being proactive in this area.We currently conduct on-site, information systems examinations of State member banks in ourdistrict -- in addition to commercial, trust, trading, and compliance examinations -- in which wetry to review and constructively criticize the examined bank’s entire MIS infrastructure. There isno separate, independent electronic or Internet bank exam as such. However, a part of theinformation systems examination reviews the bank’s electronic and Internet activities and plans,and all examiners ask general questions that we feel that any bank offering on-line bankingservices should be able to answer responsively.In addition, we have convened a special task force at the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York to review security issues involving on-line and Internet banking. The goal of this taskforce is two-fold: (1) to gather, review, and benchmark current and future on-line securityprocedures and policies of State member banks in our district; and (2) to then somehowdisseminate, without unduly disadvantaging any specific depository institution that provided uswith its information, the best of these policies and procedures into a kind of “sound practices”security guide for banks to use for their electronic and Internet banking services. The task forceshould issue its first report in the summer of 1997.In a similar vein, I believe that the United States Federal bank supervisors, whilemindful of the risks, have tried to be as supportive of electronic and Internet banking as possible.Each of the various bank supervisory agencies, i.e., the Board of Governors, the Office of ThriftSupervision (“OTS”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and the Office ofthe Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), has dealt in some immediate way with the issuesposed by electronic and Internet banking. Both the OTS and the Board of Governors have dealtdirectly with Internet banking through the bank applications approval process. In May of 1995,the OTS approved the application of a new thrift, the Security First Network Bank (“SFNB”),that sought explicitly to provide the majority of its electronic banking services over theInternet.5 In May of 1996, the Board of Governors approved the application of SFNB’s parent, abank holding company, for SFNB to acquire a data-processing firm specializing in dataprocessing activities that would provide nationwide banking and financial services over theInternet.6 In December of 1996, the Board of Governors approved the application of aMinnesota bank holding company and two foreign banks to join a consortium of 15 North                                                  4Alan Greenspan, Banking in the Global Marketplace, address before the Federation of BankersAssociations of Japan (Nov. 18, 1996).5See OTS Order No. 95-88 (May 8, 1995).6See Cardinal Bancshares, Inc., 82 Fed. Res. Bull. 674 (1996). In this Board Order, the Board stated that“The Board believes the provision of computer banking services by SFNB to its customers in accordance with theauthority granted by the OTS, and as specifically described in this proposal, is consistent with Cardinal’s existingauthority under the [Bank Holding Company Act] and Regulation Y to operate a savings association.” Id. at n.1.BIS Review   17/1997
- 4 -American banks and IBM to form Integrion Financial Network, LLC.7 Integrion itself hasannounced that it will not provide electronic or home banking services, but will instead designand operate a secure electronic gateway or interface system linking bank customers to theirdepository institutions, including links via the Internet.8 Finally, the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York and the Board of Governors are currently processing an application from a foreignbank, with a United States securities brokerage subsidiary, to acquire a software firm planning todesign software for customers of brokerage firms to place securities buy-and-sell orders over theInternet.9 The OCC, meanwhile, confirmed in correspondence in August of 1996 that, inaddition to providing home banking services to its customers through the Internet, a nationalbank subsidiary could also provide Internet access to customers and nonbank customers in thebank’s service area.10In the midst of all this supervisory “support,” however, I should also mentionsome of the as-yet unsettled issues dealing with the unique regulatory burdens facing depositoryinstitutions offering financial services over the Internet. Among the most difficult will be theproper application of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), a United States statute thatrequires depository institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities where they acceptdeposits. What exactly is a deposit community in cyberspace? Nobody really knows. This hasnot yet become a significant issue because most depository institutions offering on-line servicesstill have brick-and-mortar branches, on to which current definitions of a CRA community arebased. Still, for exclusively on-line depository institutions, the CRA issue will becomeincreasingly important as their market share grows. Some early discussions with the relevantcompliance supervisors may be in order. I also note that this also raises interesting questions onthe definition of the relevant geographic market in the analysis of bank mergers.Furthermore, considering the CRA issue brings forth another, broader issue: whatis the role of nonbanks in the realm of Internet financial services, particularly payment services,which are still largely the province of banks and other regulated depository institutions? Becausebanks have been so intricately involved in the United States payments system, banks today faceunique regulatory burdens: CRA, reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, and thecosts of good supervision and good supervisors. If nonbanks begin to take significant marketshare away from banks because of an inherently lower cost structure, that raises real questionsabout a level playing field and whether or not banks can ever fairly compete. If nonbanks beginoffering through the Internet many of the payment services, or alternatives to the paymentservices now offered exclusively by banks, that raises real concerns about the ultimate value of abank charter, and what it really means to be a “bank.” Or is this “banking”? Another issue thatmay be relevant here is the implication of a firm that has a balance sheet that looks like that of abank but does not have direct access to the lender-of-last resort.Finally, and especially in light of the issues just raised, I think it is important forme to emphasize that the bank supervisors have expressed a clear willingness to listen to whatthe banking community has had to say on the issues involving electronic and Internet banking.Regulation E, promulgated by the Board of Governors, implements the Electronic FundsTransfer Act of 1978, and establishes primarily for consumer protection purposes the basic                                                  7See Royal Bank of Canada, et al., 83 Fed. Res. Bull. _____, (Order approved Dec. 2, 1996).8Integrion also stated that it will not function as an Internet service provider, but will provide a secureelectronic link to one.9See Notification to the Board of Governors Regarding Investment in Marketware International Inc. ofToronto Dominion Bank (Dec. 19, 1996).10See OCC Interp.

- 5 -rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use, and financial institutions who offer,retail electronic funds transfer services.11 Among the protections provided are requireddisclosures, error resolution procedures, and loss protection. In 1996, when the Board ofGovernors issued its proposed regulations concerning the applicability of Regulation E tostored-value cards, the Board of Governors explicitly requested that commenters to the proposedrevisions indicate whether the commenters believed that part or all of Regulation E should applyto electronic “money” or “value” residing on a computer system or a personal-computer harddrive.12Similarly, the FDIC, while holding public hearings on its General CounselOpinion No. 8 on stored-value cards and Federal deposit insurance coverage,13 specificallyrequested additional commentary on Federal deposit insurance coverage and electronic valuerepresented on computer systems or personal computers. I believe the message is clear: as banksupervisors, we are open to what the banking community has to say on this rapidly evolvingmarket. New ideas and reasoned arguments are welcome. We must try not to restrain importantnew services developed by the banking industry but should remain vigilant as banking-typeservices are offered by nonbank institutions.A Payments Systems Overseer’s ViewFrom the perspective of a payments system overseer, I see much activity, but thusfar, few genuinely revolutionary innovations with respect to banking and the Internet in theUnited States. Mainly, I see the application of faster, cheaper electronic processing of older,more established paper-based methods of transferring payments between parties. Credit cardpayments on the Internet are one example. Instead of using a telephone, a normal card reader,and a customer’s signature, one leading Internet payments company has devised a secure methodof allowing a bank customer to shop on-line with a credit card, by never releasing “in the clear”the customer’s credit card number on the Internet itself. Instead, the company only releases thecredit card number and a merchant’s request for payment to the customer’s issuing bank, awayfrom the Internet, after verifying on-line with the customer that the purchase was authenticallymade. The bank processes the transaction as it would any other credit card purchase; the valueadded by the company is that the customer’s credit card number is never on-line, a benefitindeed in today’s security-poor Internet.It is not hard to imagine that another step in this direction is for a third-partyorganization (perhaps even a bank subsidiary) to issue secure, encrypted electronic checks on theInternet on behalf of bank customers, or even unaffiliated parties, wishing to make purchaseson-line. Much legal uncertainty remains in the United States about establishing such a process,however. Basic questions remain unanswered. What, exactly, would be an authorized signatureon an electronic check? Put another way, what types of entities would be authorized to act ascertification authorities on the Internet for such commercial conveniences as electronic purchaseorders, electronic negotiable instruments, or their bases, digital signatures? Would these                                                  11See 12 C.F.R. Part 205.12I should note here that other consumer-protection regulations issued by the Board of Governors addressconsumer credit transactions.13FDIC General Counsel Opinion No. 8 stated, in essence, that the FDIC would consider granting Federaldeposit insurance coverage for electronic value residing on stored value cards issued by a bank, only if the valueon the stored value card represented an obligation definitively linked to an existing bank customer’s depositaccount.BIS Review   17/1997
- 6 -certification authorities be entirely private sector derived? Or would they be established andoperated by the government, by the individual states, some of whom already have enacted digitalsignature statutes? What is the role of banks in this process? In particular, what are the risks tothe bank, in allowing a nonaffiliated third party to act as a certifying authority for electronicchecks drawn from the accounts of bank customers?I could ask some even more basic commercial law questions about banking incyberspace. When is an Internet payment final? More specifically, when a payment over theInternet is made, has the maker of the payment made a provisional payment, as with writing acheck, or a final payment, as with giving a certified check or making a wire transfer? Articles 3,4 and 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) govern the above circumstances, but havenothing to say on Internet payments. Currently, private contract law governs; agreementsbetween each of the parties in an on-line transaction should be very carefully drafted andreviewed. Still, if Internet banking and commercial transactions were to grow in volume andcomplexity, it is quite possible that private contract law could evolve into a specializedcommercial law of cyberspace, and eventually be codified into parts of the UCC.On a less theoretical note, I should mention that a multi-national Task Force onthe Security of Electronic Money, established by the Committee on Payment and SettlementSystems and the Group of Computer Experts of the Group of Ten Central Bank Governors, andchaired by Israel Sendrovic of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, issued a report on itsfindings entitled “Security of Electronic Money” in August 1996. This Task Force examinedprimarily consumer-oriented stored-value payment products by, among other activities,surveying the leading global suppliers of both card-based and software-based stored-valuesystems, and concluded that the technical security measures of these systems are being designedto achieve an adequate level of security relative to other forms of common retail payment,assuming they are implemented appropriately. I recommend the report to anyone interested in ageneral discussion about security issues and stored-value systems, Internet-based or not.Moving away from consumer banking and the Internet, and looking perhapsnot-so-distantly into the future, I have also had occasion to question what the repercussions arefor large-value payments transfer systems, such as Fedwire, with the emergence of a different,much more secure Internet. Generally speaking, the Internet today is a “somewhat” secureenvironment in which to conduct banking and financial service activity. The current level ofsecurity is not adequate for large-value payments. Some Internet-based payment products arebecoming more secure, but only after the creators of these products have spent a great deal oftime, effort and resources making their products secure. Consistent fast transmission andprocessing are also essential for large-value payments. The Internet today has no authorized,universal means of prioritizing specific electronic messages from other messages. Faster andbetter hardware helps, certainly, but offers no guarantee.One of my responsibilities is to serve as the Product Director of the WholesalePayments Product Office of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. This includes the Fedwiretransfer of funds, transfers of securities against payment, and net settlement. In providing thesepayment services, the Reserve Banks must charge a fee designed to cover their costs, plus whatwe refer to as a “private sector adjustment factor,” a proxy for the capital, taxes, and other costsincurred by private-sector service providers. Thus, I am keenly interested in the next stage of theInternet.If messages sent across the Internet could be made timely, become much moresecure at reasonable cost, and, if a widely-accepted prioritization scheme for electronic messagesBIS Review   17/1997
- 7 -could be implemented so that large-value payment messages could move instantaneously, it isnot inconceivable that the effect on existing large-value payments transfer systems could besubstantial. Within a five-to-ten year time frame, I could see at least a portion of Fedwirelarge-volume transfers of funds and securities -- with real-time gross-settlement -- handled overthe Internet. Please do not ask me exactly when this will come about. On the other hand, withpotentially enormous, secure, bilateral netting arrangements occurring between clearing banks inreal time over the Internet, volume on existing large-value transfer systems could decreasedramatically. The clearing banks could, conceivably, save themselves some real money.Jurisdictional IssuesAny discussion of banking or any form of commerce over the Internet todaywould not be complete without at least a few words on the legal jurisdictional issues that theInternet presents. This is arguably the area of law most in flux, the most subject to change on amonthly or even daily basis, depending on the specific jurisdiction and long-arm statute underdiscussion. In the United States, cases have already been decided regarding court jurisdictionand the Internet over alleged trademark violations,14 contract disputes,15 and advertisingdisputes.16 Although I am as yet unaware of any banking organizations that have becomeembroiled in litigation over jurisdictional issues from being on the Internet, I cannot promiseyou that such a suit will never occur. If a State banking agency or a State attorney generaldecided one day that a Web-site or an Internet-based transaction conferred sufficient minimumcontacts with a state resident so that the state’s long-arm statute applied to the bank, a suit couldeasily be filed. Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III filed six lawsuits in 1995against six companies accusing them of engaging in illegal business practices or running outrightpyramid schemes over the Internet, although none of the six companies was based in Minnesota,and no Minnesota citizen ever came forward to complain about the companies. The fact that aMinnesota resident could have accessed the scams run by the companies, claimed AttorneyGeneral Humphrey, was sufficient to confer jurisdiction of his lawsuits in the Minnesota courts.Lest this argument sound wildly and improbably expansive, it should be notedthat the “Internet access = jurisdiction” idea has already been accepted by some of the Federaldistrict courts that have decided such cases, although it must also be noted that these courts’decisions have been inconsistent, have all had slightly different facts, and have taken great painsto distinguish themselves from one another. New case law on the issue of jurisdiction conferredby Internet access is undoubtedly being made as we speak. At a minimum, then, banks offeringservices through the Internet should have signed contracts with electronic and Internet bankingcustomers that specify to the courts where claims or disputes may be brought. Web-sitesdesigned merely to advertise a bank’s financial services should be designed to be ascontroversy-free as possible, although that may be difficult without making the sites content-freeas well. Banks should err on the side of caution until the jurisdictional issues have had more timeto sort themselves out.I would like to present a hypothetical fact situation to you which I thinkdemonstrates some of the thorny legal and supervisory issues that could be raised by theexistence of offshore banking entities doing business over the Internet with individuals in our                                                  14See Panavision Int’l, L.P. v.

- 8 -jurisdictions. I travel to the island of Atlantis, where I obtain a Class Z banking charter. I ampermitted under this charter to engage in the business of banking every place in the world,except with residents of Atlantis. As you have probably suspected, Atlantis is founded on theprinciple of free and open markets, unfettered by supervision and regulation of banks with ClassZ charters. Atlantis also provides for strict adherence of the principles of banking secrecy. Mybank is named The Internet International Bank (“IIB”). The IIB offers a full spectrum ofbanking services to Atlantis nonresidents. Being a modern bank, it conducts business principallyon the Internet. IIB has a series of quite attractive Internet pages where its products are offered.These pages spell out the products, deposit terms and interest rates, and loan terms and interestrates. All agreements are governed by the law of Atlantis. All deposits are deemed received overIIB’s “counters” in Atlantis, and all loans are paid out of Atlantis. Atlantis has an enjoyableambiance even exceeding that of Nice and Saint Paul de Vence; therefore, I see no need to leavethe island. I do receive and entertain customers when they visit Atlantis. I do place telephonecalls to customers who have responded to my Internet page, but I do not make cold calls tocustomers. Communications with customers over the Internet are state-of-the-art secure.Customers receive account statements over the Internet, issue payment instruments to IIB overthe Internet, and request loans over the Internet. All payments to and from accounts are made bywire transfer to IIB’s correspondent account maintained on the books of Atlantis Bank, the onlybank chartered under Atlantis law authorized to engage in banking transactions with Atlantisresidents. Customers may instruct IIB to make payments for their account. These too areconsummated by means of payments out of IIB’s account at Atlantis Bank. Loans are disbursedand paid the same way.The question presented is whether IIB is violating the law of the countries inwhich its customers are located. While I have my own views as to the application of UnitedStates banking and securities laws to this fact situation, I prefer not to spell those out in myprepared remarks. Instead, we all might prosper by sharing our views as to the properapplication of our home country’s laws to individuals in our countries who might do businesswith IIB. I should note that this fact situation is a pure figment of my imagination. Thecooperative efforts of bank supervisors over the world should be designed to ensure preciselyagainst this sort of bank. In other words, like Atlantis, IIB should never surface above water.Our discussion should include responses to the following questions: (1) is IIBengaged in an impermissible activity in your home country; (2) if it is impermissible, whatauthority has responsibility for enforcing that law; (3) if impermissible, is that a civil or criminalviolation; (4) if impermissible, is there any way for IIB to qualify to do business in your homecountry; and finally, (5) does your home-country court have jurisdiction to hear cases brought bya customer against IIB?ConclusionTo conclude, I simply wish to commend the banking and legal communities forlearning as much about electronic and Internet banking as they can, now, and for trying to stayahead of the curve of ever evolving and improving technology. I fully agree with the philosophyof letting the markets decide what will work and what will not. We, as supervisor and centralbanker, will try to stay out of the way as much as possible, unless because of criminal activitiesor systemic risk concerns we have to jump in. The private sector seems to have done fairly wellso far. To this end, I point out a recent creation of the Banker’s Roundtable, an organizationcomposed of some of the largest United States banks, in organizing the Banking IndustryTechnology Secretariat (“BITS”).BIS Review   17/1997
- 9 -BITS, as I understand it, is in the process of designing and implementing commontechnological standards for the inter-operability of systems linking banks and their customers,and is also hoping to act as a certification authority for its member banks for third-party systemand software providers, to ensure that when an electronic or Internet banking transaction takesplace, the bank’s name is the only name the customer ever sees. Similarly, a certified software orsystems provider would agree that the customer’s payment information would stay with the bankand not the provider.I mention this not as an endorsement of BITS, but as an example of the type ofinnovation and cooperative or collaborative effort that can occur when the banking communityrealizes the enormous challenge and opportunity it has in the next few years. Central banks andbank supervisors must also be equal to these challenges. In order for us to fulfill ourresponsibilities, it will be necessary for the private sector financial institutions to keep educatingand challenging us. It is those dynamics that will help ensure good public policy in bankingsupervision and regulation of banking transactions over the Internet.BIS Review   17/1997
Herr Gaddum gives his views on the challenges facing European centralbanks in the light of EMU   Address by the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank,Herr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, to the 32nd Conference of the Governors of South-East AsianCentral Banks in Bangkok on 13/2/97.II consider it a great honour to be invited to speak at the Conference of theGovernors of South-East Asian Central Banks. Professor Tietmeyer was glad to receive yourinvitation and took it up with pleasure. He regrets very much that he is unable to be here.We regard the contacts and dialogue within the global central bank community asbeing most important and valuable. In addition, I would rate your invitation as being a reflectionof your interest in Europe, and in economic and monetary developments there. Conversely, I canassure you that European interest in Asia has increased tremendously in recent years.We are full of admiration for your cultural and economic achievements. WeGermans, in particular, are well aware that economic progress is neither a miracle nor a matterof luck. Economic success has to do with wise policy decisions. And it also has to do with thecapabilities and industry of human beings.The present day and age is distinguished by progressive economic integration. Itis taking place on two levels. The one level is regional integration. In many parts of the worldthe regions are moving more closely together. This is mostly due to economic factors: creatinglarger markets and free-trade areas, and structuring the division of labour more effectively. InEurope the economic motives are combined with political ones. The peoples of Europe havelearned from past conflicts.Besides the economic merging, European integration is designed to help forestalltensions between countries and reconcile diverging interests. Incidentally, regional integration iscelebrating anniversaries this year, both here in South-East Asia and in Europe. ASEAN will bethirty years old this year, and the European Union forty.The other level of integration is globalisation, which is galloping ahead. Here,several factors are combining and mutually reinforcing one another:-the internal decisions many countries have taken to open up their markets,-the easing of restrictions on multilateral trade and,-in particular, the huge technological advances in telecommunications anddata processing.Undoubtedly, one of the major challenges facing policy makers worldwide is thatof fostering regional and global integration side by side, rather than in opposition to one another.It is a matter - as we say in German - of doing the one without failing to do the other. In thetriangular global political relationship between Asia, North America and Europe, thetransatlantic community between the European Union and North America, on the one hand, andAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), on the other, already have an important part toplay. I hope and confidently expect that in future the Asian-European link in this triangle willincrease in significance. An important initial step in this direction was the first European-AsianSummit Meeting of Heads of State and Government here in Bangkok just under a year ago.BIS Review   18/1997
- 2 -IIThe two levels of integration are currently determining to a very large extent thework of European central banks. The challenges posed by the global markets are affecting allcentral banks worldwide in much the same way. But the tasks faced in the context of regionalintegration in Europe are unique.After all, under the Treaty of Maastricht Europe has set itself the target of amonetary union before the end of this century. The present year will be of crucial importance onthe road to that goal. The timetable envisaged is as follows: the countries that will participate inthe monetary union from the start will be ascertained in spring 1998. The participating countrieswill have to fulfil the following criteria, in particular:-stable monetary conditions as regards the value of money, the exchangerate and the longer-term interest rate level,-lastingly sustainable public finance, and-an independent national central bank.Which countries that will be, will become manifest after the examination anddecision next spring. To date, there have been forecasts, as well as some wishful thinking. Butdecisions or preliminary decisions have not been taken yet.Monetary union is due to begin in 1999. At that date the participating countrieswill irrevocably fix the exchange rates of their currencies and introduce the euro. From the firstday onwards, the European Central Bank will assume full responsibility for monetary policy.National central banks will become members of the European System of Central Banks. On thebasis of the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, they will then implement monetarypolicy decentrally (insofar as that is possible).Whereas the financial markets are expected to use the euro from as early as 1999,retail business is likely to go on using national currencies at first. This is because banknotes andcoins denominated in euros are not due to be issued until the beginning of the year 2002.Without any doubt, the monetary union is an ambitious project. It implies, from the first dayonwards, irrevocably fixed exchange rates between the participating countries and a singlemonetary policy; that is to say, a common central bank, identical central bank rates for allcountries, a virtually uniform arsenal of policy instruments and much more besides. The eurowill be a supranational currency. The single monetary policy will apply - unlike the situation inmost other monetary areas - to several states that in other respects remain sovereign.On the one hand, the introduction of the euro will present new opportunities forintegration. The economies of the participating countries will be able to grow more closelytogether. The Common Market will be afforded a new dimension. On the other hand, in order torealise the benefits, the euro area will have to fulfil two main conditions: First, the participatingcountries will have to be able (both economically and in terms of anti-inflation policy)permanently to relinquish the instrument of exchange rate adjustment relative to one another.And, second, the differing national traditions and structures which the countries bring into themonetary union will have to grow into a single whole. For instance, some countries havedifferent policy traditions on issues such as:-what part can and should monetary policy play in the real economy?BIS Review   18/1997
- 3 --which target has priority in the event of a conflict between domestic pricestability and external exchange rate stability?In addition, national central banks have divergent backgrounds as regards theirrelations with the government and their standing in the eyes of the general public. In some cases,they also have different policy instruments, deployed in different ways. By such means, theyhave taken due account of the differing structures of the domestic banking system.Establishing a monetary union implies building sustainable bridges across thesedifferences. The single currency calls for joint answers to the underlying issues of monetarypolicy. The prerequisites are being elaborated at three levels: First, the choice of the participantsat the start of monetary union is vitally important. This is to ensure that the range of countriesremains fairly homogeneous overall with respect to their maturity for anti-inflation policy.Second, the Treaty of Maastricht laid down the independence of the European Central Bank andof all the central banks participating in monetary union. The statute of the European CentralBank defines ensuring price stability as its priority target. In this way the Treaty gives anunambiguous answer to the question of the fundamental orientation of the future monetaryunion. It is designed as a community of stability. And third, the European Monetary Institute, asa forerunner of the European Central Bank, has been working in Frankfurt for three years now.IIIUnder the auspices of the European Monetary Institute, we are preparing theorganisational and technical framework for the decision on the single monetary policy and itsimplementation.The preparatory work makes up a long list:-First of all, a strategy for harmonised monetary statistics was drawn up.-Central banks are working together with the European Monetary Instituteon the introduction of a real time gross settlement system (TARGET).-The EMI Council has already decided on the design of the future eurobanknotes.-In its Framework Report, the European Monetary Institute has recentlymapped out a framework for the future strategy and the arsenal of policyinstruments.The policy instruments will be geared to market conditions, transparent andefficient. Open market operations will be at the centre of refinancing policy. Two standardtenders are envisaged: one tender running for two weeks (that will be the most importantinstrument), accompanied by a second tender running for three months. In the case of thelonger-term tender, national central banks, when assessing the eligibility of collateral, are tohave the option of taking national financing patterns into account. Two standing facilities areavailable for providing or absorbing overnight liquidity. They form a corridor for the rate forday-to-day money and signal the prevailing monetary policy stance.In the shape of the Framework Report, the European Monetary Institute hasalready laid down a number of benchmarks for future European monetary policy. However, itcannot take all decisions away from the European Central Bank. This is because the ultimatedecision on the strategy and the actual deployment of the policy instruments remains, of course,BIS Review   18/1997
- 4 -in the hands of the European Central Bank. After all, it bears the responsibility and must take thefinal decision. Hence, where there is still no consensus on the EMI Council, the decision remainspending for the time being. That applies, for instance, to the strategy. The Framework Reportprovides for an alternative between a two-tier strategy, with a monetary aggregate as theintermediate target, and the single-tier strategy of a direct inflation target.The Bundesbank strongly advocates the monetary targeting approach. Needless tosay, we also recognise that managing a monetary aggregate is becoming more difficult under theconditions presented by current financial markets. But the European Central Bank coulddemonstrate its responsibility more clearly and more transparently by means of the monetarytargeting strategy. And the virtual adoption of the strategy of the erstwhile anchor currencyDeutsche Mark would be a token of continuity.Another unresolved question, for example, is the issue of minimum reserves. TheEuropean Monetary Institute is preparing the option. Then the European Central Bank will haveto decide at a later date whether minimum reserves will be adopted, and in which form. Infuture, a great deal will depend on the European Central Bank. Many people are pinning theirhopes and expectations of a stable euro on its independence and steadfastness.The biggest challenge facing the European Central Bank lies in its need to earnthe requisite reputation and credibility as quickly as possible. This is in order to justify people’shopes of a stable euro. And to enable it to weather the test to be expected from the globalfinancial markets.IVThe environment in which central banks (and other economic policy makers, too)operate has undergone a radical change in the last decade.-We are witnessing economic developments in the markets:professionalisation of investors, globalisation of financial markets.-We are witnessing political reforms: deregulation of the domestic markets,liberalisation of border-crossing capital movements.-We are witnessing technological breakthroughs in information andcommunications technology.All these changes are interacting, reinforcing one another and constituting a newreal world. This upheaval presents great opportunities. The international capital markets canoperate more efficiently. Market transparency is increasing. Greater diversification ofinvestment may help to allocate capital more effectively, in line with its marginal productivity.Risk management is becoming more efficient. The financial markets are better able to performtheir transformation function. The markets are better able to reconcile savers’ and investors’preferences with respect to maturities, batch sizes and risks.Nowadays the financial markets perform a monitoring function all around theclock. Those markets test countries’ policies. They scrutinise the lasting sustainability of publicfinance. They scrutinise the gearing of monetary policy to stability. Where they register doubt,they are able to penalise massively by siphoning off capital and imposing high capital marketrates. Hence the financial markets, in their monitoring and sanctionative capacity, figure asvaluable allies of a monetary policy geared to stability.BIS Review   18/1997
- 5 -At the same time, however, the financial markets often appear to give cause forconcern. Many people are suspicious of the financial markets’ power. For the financial marketsincreasingly seem to be divesting themselves of the “subservient role” they are supposed to play.Such fears apply, for one thing, to the relations of the global financial markets with nationalmonetary, economic and fiscal policy. Anonymous market forces constrict policy makers’national room for manoeuvre. This may lead to tensions because domestic policy-makingnormally claims to be sovereign. But, at least insofar as the financial markets thereby lessen thescope for a monetary policy that is detrimental to stability and a fiscal policy that inflates debt,the economist will not deplore that fact unduly. For a policy that fosters inflation andexacerbates national debt widens scope, at the most, for a temporary period; in the longer run,any such scope is narrowed.But there is a second dimension to the misgivings that the financial markets areno longer duly performing their subservient function. That relates to the relations with the realeconomy. In itself, a high volatility of financial market prices may affect real economicdecisions. For example, enterprises may increasingly switch to hedging against the risk ofsharply fluctuating exchange rates not only by means of financial contracts such as currencyfutures, but also by diversifying the locations, in terms of different currency areas.Prolonged distortions, such as misalignments of exchange rates or bubbles in assetprices, are all the more problematic. It is not only that the financial markets distort realrelationships. The relevant adjustments are often sudden and violent, as in the case of theEuropean Monetary System early in the nineties, or of Mexico. It is precisely such crisis-likeupheavals that prompt the question of whether and, if so, to what extent today’s financialmarkets have become more unstable, and whether systemic risk has increased?Some people fear that the advance of professionalism among fund managers andinstitutional investors, in particular, might increase the incidence of such dangers. Their thinkingis determined primarily by the short-term performance of their portfolio. In certain situations,that may intensify the “herd instinct”, triggering a “rush to the exit”. At the same time, newfinancial instruments make it easier for them to incur higher risk positions. Swings in sentimentmay then lead all the more easily to precarious situations.On the other hand, the greater international diversification of investments makesthe markets fundamentally more resilient today. Furthermore, owing to the increasedsignificance of the funds, relative to that of the banks, the creditor pattern is nowadays muchmore heterogeneous and more diversified. That reduces the risk of chain reactions. If the banksare less heavily involved, the danger of a liquidity crisis impairing the viability of the paymentand settlement system decreases. After all, not every liquidity crisis poses a systemic risk.VCentral banks - like other economic policy makers - must adjust to the realityrepresented by the global financial markets. That applies to all policy areas: monetary policy,exchange rate policy, banking supervision. Problematic developments in the financial marketsare not as a rule exclusively inherent in those markets. They often also have to do with current orearlier policy decisions. Monetary policy itself must not be an uncertainty factor that fostersvolatility. It must focus on continuity, must build confidence. Continuity, consistency,credibility - the three Cs denote the right direction.BIS Review   18/1997
- 6 -To be sure, a medium-term monetary policy geared to continuity is not alwayseasy to pursue, with the present-day financial markets and their frequent volatility as acounterpart. But there is no alternative. By and large, a steady, sound policy stance is easier foran independent central bank, which is at least spared the turmoil of day-to-day politics. Itsguiding principle for exchange rate policy must be: it must not set unrealistic objectives. It musttake great care not to provide the markets with triggering points; that is to say, points on whichthe entire credibility of a system or a policy hinges. Then, the markets can undertake a test.And its guiding principle for banking supervision must be: financialconglomeration and market globalisation, in particular, call for closer cooperation in the field ofbanking supervision between the responsible national authorities and between the internationalsupervisory bodies for banking, insurance and securities operations. This applies even if acomplete restructuring of a supervisory regime outside the existing patterns of supervision isunlikely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Present-day supervision does not seek topush the market into the background, but rather to reinforce it. Competition is meant todiscipline. Supervision is not intended to get bogged down in details, but to draw up a few keyrules. Risks must be covered. A minimum of transparency must be present.Above all, the sanctionative mechanism of the markets must continue to work.There must not be any bailing-out that fosters moral hazard. Banking supervision seeks toenhance competition. It is therefore not merely a matter of lessening systemic risk. It is also amatter of identical competitive conditions, along the lines of “same business, same risks, samerules”. I am glad that the banking supervisory authorities are now working together in Baslebeyond the range of the G-10 countries alone. Although the responsibility will remain at nationallevel in future, the closer international cooperation among national supervisory authorities willimprove mutual information, in addition to devising common standards.VIInformation and communication: these are the keywords for the interaction of themarkets and for the globalisation of business. To my mind, information and communicationmust also be the keywords for collaboration among central banks; naturally at the regional level,and particularly at the global level, too. In this context, I continue to believe that the G-10 is aforum that is useful and has proved its worth. But, needless to say, global collaboration must bemuch more broadly based. It should encompass all major players. It is this conviction that hasrecently prompted the BIS to invite a number of central banks from South-East Asia to becomenew members.Furthermore, the G-10 working parties - the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision, the Euro-Currency Standing Committee, and the Committee on Payment andSettlement Systems - have invited representatives of non-G-10 countries, in order increasingly toaddress questions connected with the emerging markets. At the same time, the Governors haveenlarged their meetings in Basle. Non-members of the BIS are also being invited to take part inthe informal discussions and make their views known.The discussions in Basle cover a wide variety of topics:-the instruments, strategy and environment of monetary policy,-questions of foreign exchange reserve policy,BIS Review   18/1997
- 7 --recent developments in the markets, such as changes in financialintermediation or electronic money,-and much else besides.I am sure that such exchanges of views will enhance mutual understanding of theproblems and the approaches to solutions. Needless to say, the conditions for central banks areheterogeneous all over the world. But even so - or precisely for that reason - collaboration at aglobal level may be fruitful. In any case, the globalised markets are pushing all central banks -regardless of their regional affiliation - in the same direction. Not in the sense that all centralbanks are forced to think or act in the same way. But no matter which actual policies a centralbank may pursue, the globalised markets demand a high degree of solidarity. This is a currentand future challenge facing every central bank in the world.BIS Review   18/1997
Mr. Greenspan offers some considerations as a guide for governmentdecisions on regulating the financial markets  Remarks by Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Financial MarketsI am pleased to participate once again in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’sannual Financial Markets Conference. As in previous years, the Reserve Bank has developed aconference program that is quite timely. Changes in technology have permitted the developmentin recent years of increasingly diverse financial instruments and intensely competitive marketstructures. The rapid evolution of products and markets has led many to conclude that marketregulatory structures, many of which were established in the 1920s and 1930s, have becomeincreasingly outdated. Some see new products and markets not covered by governmentregulation and fear the consequences of so-called “regulatory gaps.” Others see old governmentregulations applied to new instruments and markets and fear the unintended consequences ofwhat seems unnecessary and burdensome regulation.Nowhere have these tensions been more evident than in the ongoing debate overthe appropriate government regulation of derivative contracts, a debate which has varied inintensity but has never fully subsided for at least ten years. Recent efforts by members of theSenate Agriculture Committee to clarify and rationalize the regulation of derivative contractsunder the Commodity Exchange Act have once again placed these contentious issues on thefront burner. In my remarks today I shall proffer a set of considerations that I find quite valuableas a guide to decisions about the need for government regulation of financial markets. I shallthen review the history of government regulation of derivative contracts and markets in theUnited States and consider the current regulatory structure for those products and markets inlight of these considerations.Market RegulationI would argue that the first imperative when evaluating market regulation is toenunciate clearly the public policy objectives that government regulation would be intended topromote. What market characteristics do policymakers seek to encourage? Efficiency? Fair andopen access? What phenomena do we wish to discourage or eliminate? Fraud, manipulation, orother unfair practices? Systemic instability? Without explicit answers to these questions,government regulation is unlikely to be effective. More likely, it will prove unnecessary,burdensome, and perhaps even contrary to what more careful consideration would reveal to bethe underlying objectives.A second imperative, once public policy objectives are clearly specified, is toevaluate whether government regulation is necessary for those purposes. In making suchevaluations, it is critically important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated. Theself-interest of market participants generates private market regulation. Thus, the real question isnot whether a market should be regulated. Rather, the real question is whether governmentintervention strengthens or weakens private regulation. If incentives for private marketregulation are weak or if market participants lack the capabilities to pursue their interestseffectively, then the introduction of government regulation may improve regulation. But ifprivate market regulation is effective, then government regulation is at best unnecessary. Atworst, the introduction of government regulation may actually weaken the effectiveness ofregulation if government regulation is itself ineffective or undermines incentives for privatemarket regulation. We must be aware that government regulation unavoidably involves someBIS Review   19/1997
- 2 -element of moral hazard -- if private market participants believe that government is protectingtheir interests, their own efforts to protect their interests will diminish to some degree.Whether government regulation is needed, and if so, what form of governmentregulation is optimal, depends critically on a market’s characteristics. A “one-size-fits-all”approach to financial market regulation is almost never appropriate. The degree and type ofgovernment regulation needed, if any, depends on the types of instruments traded, the types ofmarket participants, and the nature of the relationships among market participants. To cite justone example, a government regulatory framework designed to protect retail investors from fraudor insolvency of brokers is unlikely to be necessary -- and is almost sure to be suboptimal -- ifapplied to a market in which large institutions transact on a principal-to-principal basis.Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is seldom appropriate, it may beuseful to offer transactors a choice between seeking the benefits and accepting the burdens ofgovernment regulation, or forgoing those benefits and avoiding those burdens by transacting infinancial markets that are only privately regulated. In such circumstances, the privately regulatedmarkets in effect provide a market test of the net benefits of government regulation. Migrationof activity from government-regulated to privately regulated markets sends a signal togovernment regulators that many transactors believe the costs of regulation exceed the benefits.When such migration occurs, government regulators should consider carefully whether lessregulation or different regulation would provide a better cost-benefit tradeoff withoutcompromising public policy objectives.Historical Development of U.S. Government Regulation of Derivative MarketsBefore evaluating the current regulation of derivatives in light of theseconsiderations, it is quite useful to know something of the history of these instruments and theirregulation. Derivative contracts (forward contracts and options) appear to have been utilizedthroughout American history. Indeed, it will probably come as a surprise even to this audiencethat 15 to 25 percent of trades on the New York Stock Exchange in its early years were timebargains, that is, forward contracts, rather than transactions for cash settlement (in those days,same-day settlement) or regular-way settlement (next-day settlement). In the case ofcommodities, forward contracts for corn, wheat, and other grains came into common use by1850 in Chicago, where they were known as “to arrive” contracts. The first organized futuresexchange in the United States, the Chicago Board of Trade, evolved through the progressivestandardization of the terms of “to arrive” contracts, including lot sizes, grades of grain, anddelivery periods. Trading apparently was centralized on the Board of Trade by 1859, and in1865 it set out detailed rules for the trading of highly standardized contracts quite similar to thegrain futures contracts traded today.The first recorded instance of federal government regulation of derivatives wasthe Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864, which prohibited the trading of gold futures. Thegovernment had been unhappy that its fiat currency issues, the infamous greenbacks, were at thattime trading at a substantial discount to gold. Unwilling to accept this result as evidence offailure of the government’s monetary policies, Congress concluded that it was evidence of aserious failure of private market regulation. In the event, Congress’s action was followed by afurther sharp drop in the value of the greenbacks. Although it took the government many yearsto restore monetary policy to a sound footing, it took Congress only two weeks to conclude thatits prohibition of gold futures was having unintended consequences and to repeal the act.BIS Review   19/1997
- 3 -It has been the trading of agricultural futures, however, that from its inception hasproduced calls for government intervention. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies, farmers were often opposed to futures trading, particularly during periods when pricesof their products were low or declining. They presumed that dreaded speculators weredepressing their prices. The states were the first to respond to calls for government regulation offutures. For the most part, state legislation on futures was limited to prohibitions on bucketshops, that is, operations that purport to act as brokers of exchange-traded futures but “bucket”rather than execute their clients’ trades. An Illinois statute of 1874 signaled early concerns aboutmarket integrity. The statute criminalized the spreading of false rumors to influence commodityprices and attempts to corner commodity markets.After its misadventure with futures regulation during the Civil War, the federalgovernment appears not to have given further consideration to regulating futures trading until1883, when a bill was introduced in Congress to prohibit use of the mails to market futures.Thereafter, repeated efforts were made to regulate or prohibit trading of futures and options onagricultural products. When the Agriculture Department reviewed the Congressional Record in1920, it found that 164 measures of this sort had previously been introduced. These effortsculminated in passage of the Futures Trading Act of 1921. That act was promptly declaredunconstitutional by the Supreme Court, on the grounds that it was a regulatory measuremasquerading as a tax measure. But in 1922 Congress restated the purpose of the 1921 act as “anact for the prevention and removal of obstructions and burdens upon interstate commerce ingrain, by regulating transactions on grain futures exchanges,” and renamed it the Grain FuturesAct of 1922. As an explicitly regulatory measure, it was later upheld by the Court.The objective of the Grain Futures Act was to reduce or eliminate “sudden orunreasonable fluctuations” in the prices of grain on futures exchanges. The framers of the actbelieved that such sudden or unreasonable fluctuations of grain futures prices reflected theirsusceptibility to “speculation, manipulation, or control.” Moreover, such fluctuations in pricewere seen to have broad ramifications that affected the national public interest. Grain futurescontracts were widely used by producers and distributors of grain to hedge the risks of pricefluctuations. Futures prices also were widely disseminated and widely used as the basis forpricing grain transactions off the futures exchanges. Indeed, given the relative size of theagricultural sector of the time, fluctuations in futures prices no doubt had the potential to affectthe economy as a whole.It is not entirely clear that the view that futures trading was exacerbating volatilityin agricultural prices was well-founded. To be sure, evidence abounds that market participantstalked incessantly about corners and bear raids. Moreover, the design of the contracts may,indeed, have made such contracts susceptible to manipulation. However, empirical studies ofmore recent experience cast doubt on whether the use of derivatives adds to price volatility.And, while charges of market manipulation are heard to this day, they typically are difficult, ifnot impossible, to prove. Professional speculators were easy to blame for fluctuations in marketprices that actually reflected fundamental shifts in supply or demand, as they are today. Themarket clearing process is a very abstract concept. It is sometimes far easier to envisage pricechanges as the consequence of individual manipulators. Indeed, for a lot of nineteenth-centuryring traders, it was some measure of manhood (women were few) that they could squeeze orcorner a market. The evidence suggests that this was largely Walter Middy-type fantasy.In any event, the Grain Futures Act of 1922 established many of the key elementsof our current regulatory framework for derivatives. In general, the act was designed to confinefutures trading to regulated futures exchanges. The act made it unlawful to trade futures onBIS Review   19/1997

Theseincluded the establishment of procedures for recordkeeping and reporting of futures transactions,for prevention of dissemination of false or misleading crop or market information, and forprevention of price manipulation or cornering of markets. Finally, the act recognized the need topermit bona fide derivatives transactions to be executed off of the regulated exchanges; itexplicitly excluded forward contracts for the delivery of grain from the exchange-tradingrequirement. Forward contracts were essentially defined as contracts for future delivery to whichfarmers or farm interests were counterparties or in which the seller, if not a farmer, owned thegrain at the time of making the contract.The next major piece of federal legislation affecting futures regulation was theCommodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936. As in the case of the Grain Futures Act, an importantobjective of the CEA was to discourage forms of speculation that were seen as exacerbatingprice volatility. In addition, the CEA introduced provisions designed primarily to protect smallinvestors in commodity futures, whose participation had been increasing and was viewed asbeneficial. These provisions included requirements for the registration of futures commissionmerchants (FCMs), that is, futures brokers, and for the segregation of customer funds from FCMfunds. The CEA also expanded the coverage of futures regulation to cover contracts for cotton,rice, and certain other specifically enumerated commodities traded on futures exchanges, andprohibited the trading of options on commodities traded on futures exchanges.The federal regulatory framework for derivatives market regulation then remainedsubstantially unchanged until 1974, when Congress enacted the Commodity Futures TradingCommission Act. The act did not make any fundamental changes in the objectives of derivativesregulation. However, it expanded the scope of the CEA quite significantly. In addition tocreating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an independent agency andgiving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures and options, the 1974amendments expanded the CEA’s definition of “commodity” beyond a specific list ofagricultural commodities to include “all other goods and articles, except onions, . . . and allservices, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the futuredealt in.” In one respect, this was sweeping deregulation, in that it explicitly allowed the tradingon futures exchanges of contracts on virtually any underlying assets, including financialinstruments. Only onion futures, banned in 1958 as the presumed favorite plaything ofmanipulators, remained beyond the pale. In another respect, however, this was a sweepingextension of regulation. Given this broad definition of a commodity and an equally broadinterpretation of what constitutes a futures contract, this change brought a tremendous range ofoff-exchange transactions potentially within the scope of the CEA. In particular, it could beinterpreted to extend the broad prohibition on off-exchange trading of futures to an immensevolume of diverse transactions that never had been traded on exchanges.The potential for the legality of a wider range of transactions to be called intoquestion did not go unnoticed during debate on the 1974 act. In particular, the TreasuryDepartment proposed language excluding off-exchange derivative transactions in foreigncurrency, government securities, and certain other financial instruments from the newlyexpanded CEA. This proposal was adopted by Congress and is known as the TreasuryAmendment. In proposing the amendment, Treasury was primarily concerned with protectingforeign exchange markets from what it considered unnecessary and potentially harmfulregulation. The foreign exchange markets clearly have quite different characteristics frommarkets for agricultural futures -- the markets for the major currencies are deep and, as somecentral banks have learned the hard way, they are extremely difficult to manipulate.BIS Review   19/1997
- 5 -Furthermore, participants in those markets, primarily banks and other financial institutions, andlarge corporations, would not seem to need, and certainly are not seeking, the protection of theCEA. Thus, there was, and is, no reason to presume that the regulatory framework of the CEAneeds to be applied to the foreign exchange markets to achieve the public policy objectives thatmotivated the CEA. Indeed, the wholesale foreign exchange markets provide a clear andcompelling example of how private parties can regulate markets quite effectively withoutgovernment assistance.BIS Review   19/1997
Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve Board on somebroad issues associated with financial modernization   Testimony of the Chairman of theBoard of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Subcommittee onFinancial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Banking and Financial Servicesof the US House of Representatives on 13/2/97.Madam Chairwoman, members of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions andConsumer Credit, it is a pleasure to appear here today to present the views of the FederalReserve Board on some broad issues associated with financial modernization. The unremittingpressures of technology and the market are drastically changing the financial landscape anderoding traditional positions of competitors, inducing new competitive strategies andparticipants, forcing new regulatory responses, and building pressures on the Congress to shapedevelopments in the public interest.Madam Chairwoman, I know that you have been an active sponsor and supporterof legislation to modernize the financial system. The Board also has been a strong proponentboth of expanded financial activities for banking organizations and enhanced opportunities fornonbank financial institutions to enter banking. We continue to support financial modernizationbecause we believe it would provide improved financial services for our citizens. Moreover,both our experience and analysis suggest that the additional risks of new financial products aremodest and manageable. Indeed, technology already has resulted in a blurring of product andservice-defining lines so dramatic as to make many financial products virtually indistinguishablefrom each other and the old rules inapplicable. In the process, we have already seen the publicbenefits, benefits that removal of old barriers could only enhance.But, as we proceed down the path of reform, reforms both desired for theirbenefits to the public and required by global markets and new technologies, the Board urges thatany modifications be tested against certain standards. In particular, the Board believes that thechanges we adopt should be consistent with (1) continuing the safety and soundness of thebanking system; (2) limiting systemic risks; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and(4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net.Thus, if my comments today sound cautious, I want the subcommittee tounderstand that my observations do not reflect opposition to further freeing of constraints onfinancial competition. To the contrary. We strongly urge an extensive increase in the activitiespermitted to banking organizations and other financial institutions, provided these activities arefinanced at nonsubsidized market rates and do not pose unacceptable risks to our financialsystem. While a level playing field requires broader powers, it does not require subsidized ones.Safety Net ImplicationsIn this century the Congress has delegated the use of the sovereign credit -- thepower to create money and borrow unlimited funds at the lowest possible rate -- to support thebanking system. It has done so indirectly as a consequence of deposit insurance, Federal Reservediscount window access, and final riskless settlement of payment system transactions. Thepublic policy purpose was to protect depositors, stem bank runs, and lower the level of risk tothe financial system from the insolvency of individual institutions. In insuring depositors, thegovernment, through the FDIC, substituted its unsurpassable credit rating for those of banks.Similarly, provisions of the Federal Reserve Act enabled banks to convert illiquid assets, such asloans, into riskless assets (deposits at the central bank) through the discount window, and toBIS Review   16/1997
- 2 -complete payments using Federal Reserve credits. All these uses of the sovereign credit havedramatically improved the soundness of our banking system and the public’s confidence in it.In the process, it has profoundly altered the risks and returns in banking.Sovereign credit guarantees have significantly reduced the amount of capital that banks andother depositories need to hold, since creditors demand less of a buffer to protect themselvesfrom the failure of institutions that are the beneficiaries of such guarantees. In differentlanguage, these entities have been able to operate with a much higher degree of leverage -- thatis, to obtain more of their funds from other than the owners of the organization -- than virtuallyall other financial institutions. At the same time, depositories have been able to take greater riskin their portfolios than would otherwise be the case, because private creditors -- depositors andothers -- are less affected by the illiquidity of, or losses on, the banks’ portfolios. The end resulthas been a higher risk-adjusted rate of return on depository institution equity.Moreover, the enhanced ability to take risk has contributed to economic growth,while the discount window and deposit insurance have contributed to our macroeconomicstability. But all good things have their price. The use of the sovereign credit in banking -- evenits potential use -- creates a moral hazard that distorts the incentives for banks: the banksdetermine the level of risk-taking and receive the gains therefrom, but do not bear the full costsof that risk. The remainder of the risk is transferred to the government. This then creates thenecessity for the government to limit the degree of risk it absorbs by writing rules under whichbanks operate, and imposing on these entities supervision by its agents -- the bankingregulators -- to assure adherence to these rules. The experience in the 1980s with many insuredthrift institutions showed just how dangerous lax enforcement of supervisory rules can be. In theend, some hard lessons were learned, many of which were legislated into the FDIC ImprovementAct of 1991.The subsidy to the banking and other depositories created by the use of theunsurpassable sovereign credit rating of the United States government is an undesirable butunavoidable consequence of creating a safety net. Indeed, one measure of the effectiveness of asafety net is our ability to minimize the subsidy and limit its incidence outside of the area towhich it was directed. Some of the value of the subsidy has been passed to depositors of, andborrowers from, banks, for example, as well as to the original bank shareholders. But, the UnitedStates government has been remarkably successful in containing the value of most of the subsidywithin depository institutions. The bank holding company organizational structure has, onbalance, provided an effective means of limiting the use of the sovereign credit subsidy by otherparts of the banking organization. To be sure, bank holding companies have indirectly benefitedfrom the subsidy because their major assets are subsidiary banks. The value of the subsidy givento the subsidiary banks has no doubt been capitalized in part into the share prices of holdingcompanies and has improved their debt ratings, lowering their cost of capital. But, holdingcompanies also own nonsubsidized entities that have no direct access to the safety net.Accordingly, both bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries have a higher cost ofcapital than banks.This is clear in the debt ratings of bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies,which are virtually always higher than those of their parent holding companies. Moreover,existing law and regulation under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act require thatany credit extended by a bank to its parent or affiliate not only be totally collateralized andsubject to quantitative limits, but also be extended at arms-length and at market rates, making adirect transfer of the safety net subsidy difficult.BIS Review   16/1997
- 3 -It is true that a bank could pay dividends from its earnings, earnings which havebeen enhanced by the safety net subsidy, to fund its parent’s nonbank affiliates. However, theevidence appears to be that such transfers generally do not occur. Existing holding companypowers are limited and do not offer a broad spectrum of profitable opportunities. Accordingly, itis not surprising that data for the top 50 bank holding companies indicate that transfers frombank subsidiaries to their parents which, like dividends, embody the subsidy, appear to haveapproximately equaled holding company net transfers to their own shareholders and long-termcreditors. This indicates that few subsidized dollars in the aggregate found their way into theequity accounts of holding company nonbank affiliates from the upstreaming of bank funds.We must, I think, be continually on guard that the subsidy provided by the safetynet does not leak outside the institutions for which it was intended and provide a broad subsidyto other kinds of activities. Put another way, we must remain especially vigilant in maintaining aproper balance between a safety net that fosters economic and financial stabilization and one thatbenefits the competitive position of private businesses for no particular public purpose. As Inoted, safety net subsidies have costs in terms of distorted incentives and misallocated resources.That is why the Congress must be cautious in how the sovereign credit is used.It has been suggested that the bank holding company structure imposesinefficiencies on banking organizations, and that these organizations should thus be given theoption of conducting expanded financial activities in a direct subsidiary of the bank. The banksubsidiary may be a marginally more efficient way of delivering such services, but we believe itcannot avoid being a funnel for transferring the sovereign credit subsidy directly from the bankto finance the new powers, thereby imparting a subsidized competitive advantage to thesubsidiary of the bank. One can devise rules -- such as 23A and 23B -- to assure that loans fromthe bank to its own subsidiaries are limited and at market rates. One can even devise rules tolimit the aggregate equity investment made by banks in their subsidiaries. But one cannoteliminate the fact that the equity invested in subsidiaries is funded by the sum of insureddeposits and other bank borrowings that directly benefit from the subsidy of the safety net. Thus,inevitably, a bank subsidiary must have lower costs of capital than an independent entity andeven a subsidiary of the bank’s parent. Indeed, one would expect that a rational bankingorganization would, as much as possible, shift its nonbank activity from the bank holdingcompany structure to the bank subsidiary structure. Such a shift from affiliates to banksubsidiaries would increase the subsidy and the competitive advantage of the entire bankingorganization relative to its nonbank competitors.I am aware that these are often viewed as only highly technical issues, and henceones that are in the end, of little significance. I do not think so. The issue of the use of thesovereign credit is central to how our financial system will allocate credit, and hence realresources, the kinds of risk it takes, and the degree of supervision it requires. If the Congresswants to extend the use of the sovereign credit further, to achieve a wider range over which thebenefits of doing so can accrue, it ought to make that decision explicitly, and accept theconsequences of the subsidy on the financial system that come with it. But, it should not, in thename of some technical change, or in search of some minor efficiency, inadvertently expand theuse of the sovereign credit. This issue would not be so important were we not in the process ofaddressing what must surely be a watershed in the revamping of our regulatory structure. Wemust avoid inadvertently extending the safety net and its associated subsidy without a thoroughunderstanding of the implications of such an extension to the competitive balance and systemicrisks of our financial system.BIS Review   16/1997
- 4 -Central to the Board’s choice of a financial structure is its desire for one that willbe most effective in fostering both a viable financial system and a vibrant economy. Theseobjectives, in our view, would be thwarted if the safety net subsidy directly benefited newactivities. With the safety net comes the moral hazard of which I spoke earlier, and its attendantmisallocation of resources, and uneven competitive playing field. If the government subsidiesdirected to banks were channeled to bank subsidiaries, in my judgement, both the benefits andenumerated costs to the financial system and the public would occur.If banks were permitted to engage in new activities in their own subsidiaries,inevitably virtually all holding companies would shift those activities now conducted in holdingcompany affiliates to bank subsidiaries, eviscerating the holding company structure. Were suchshifts to happen solely as the result of operational efficiencies, no one, including the Board,should mourn the demise of the holding company. But if, as I suspect, such shifts occurredbecause of the attraction of a government subsidy, we should be concerned because the insidiouseffects of such subsidies would have spread. The evidence from flows between banks and theirparents, relative bond ratings, and the administration of Sections 23A and B of the FederalReserve Act, all strongly suggest that the holding company structure is far more capable ofcontaining the sovereign credit subsidy whose purpose is support of the safety net, not providingexpanded competitive advantage.As new activities hopefully expand for banking organizations, we believe that it isessential that we assure they are financed at market rates, not subsidized ones. This will notalways be easy. Containment of subsidies is often implemented through firewalls and otherdevices which could also inhibit the very synergies which the expansion of activities is meant toachieve. But we have dealt with these trade-offs before and should be able to in the future aswell.Umbrella SupervisionWhether new activities are authorized in bank subsidiaries, bank holdingcompanies, or both, Congress, in its review of financial modernization, must consider legalentity supervision versus umbrella supervision. The Board believes that umbrella supervision isa realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system and to limit any misuse of thesovereign credit.The bank holding company organization is increasingly being managed so as totake advantage of the synergies between its component parts in order to deliver better productsto the market and higher returns to stockholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the model of theholding company is one in which the parent is just, in effect, a portfolio investor in itssubsidiary. Indeed, virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated unitsand are managed as such.As bank holding companies began to widen their activities, and as newtechnologies permitted not only the development of new products but also the systems forcontrolling them, the banking organization was impelled to develop centralized risk controltechniques that crossed legal entities. Today, risk management for the entire company isincreasingly centralized not only at the larger and more sophisticated banking organizations, butat other large financial services providers as well. This development reflects the demands of themarketplace, which views banks and their affiliates and other financial businesses and theiraffiliates as integrated organizations in terms of financial condition, management, andreputation.BIS Review   16/1997
- 5 -To understand the risk controls of the bank, we have first to come to grips withthe fact that the organization is interested in risk and its control, not by instrument or legalentity, but for the entire business. This type of control is being adopted by more and moreorganizations each year, and can only increase as more activities are authorized by the regulatorsand the Congress. Regulatory policies and operating procedures have had to respond to theserealities, to focus on the process of decisionmaking for the total organization. Thus, the FederalReserve -- the historical umbrella supervisor -- also has found it necessary to concentrate moreon the process that banking organizations use to manage market, credit, operating and exchangerate risk, and less on the traditional after-the-fact evaluation of balance sheets that can and oftendo change dramatically the day after they have been reviewed by the supervisors. In such aworld, process, if not everything, is critical, and that process is determined increasingly at theparent holding company for all of the units of the organization on a consolidated basis.One could argue -- as several witnesses appearing before this subcommittee didon Tuesday -- that regulators should only be interested in the entities they regulate and, hence,review the risk evaluation process only as it relates to their regulated entity. Presumably eachregulator of each entity -- the bank regulators, the SEC, the state insurance and finance companyauthorities -- would look only at how the risk management process affected their units. It is ourbelief that this simply will not be adequate. Risks managed on a consolidated basis cannot bereviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors.Indeed, our experience has been that a problem in one legal entity can have acontagion effect in other entities. If a bank affiliate begins to have difficulty, the marketevaluates the problem as the consolidated entity’s problem and can bring pressure on all theunits. These pressures usually take the form of funding or liquidity difficulties, as creditors seekto reduce their exposure to all units of an organization that seems to be having trouble. Bettersafe than sorry. Indeed, it is in the cauldron of the payments and settlement system, wheredecisions involving large sums must be made in short periods, that this contagion effect might befirst seen as participants understandably seek to protect themselves from the uncertainty thataccompanies this contagion effect. And that is how crises often begin.These concerns were part of the motivation for the congressional decision justfive years ago to require that foreign banks could enter the United States if, and only if, theywere subject to consolidated supervision. This decision, which is consistent with theinternational standards for consolidated supervision of banking organizations, was a gooddecision then. It is a good decision today, especially for those banking organizations whosedisruption could cause major financial disturbances in United States and foreign markets. Forforeign and for U.S. banking organizations, retreat from consolidated supervision would, theBoard believes, be a significant step backward.We have to be careful, however, that consolidated umbrella supervision does notinadvertently so hamper the decisionmaking process of banking organizations as to render themineffectual. The Federal Reserve Board is accordingly in the process of reviewing its supervisorystructure and other procedures in order to reflect the aforementioned market-directed shift fromconventional balance sheet auditing to evaluation of the internal risk management process.Although focused on the key risk management processes, it would sharply reduce routinesupervisory umbrella presence in holding companies. As the committee knows, the Board hasrecently published for comment proposals to expedite the applications process, and thelegislation Congress enacted last year eased such procedures as well. Nonetheless, the Boardrequests even greater modification to its existing statutory mandate so that the requiredBIS Review   16/1997
- 6 -applications process could be sharply cut back, particularly in the area of nonbank financialservices.We would hope that should the Congress authorize wider activities for financialservices holding companies that it recognize that a bank which is a minor part of such anorganization (and its associated safety net) can be protected through adequate bank capitalrequirements and the application of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The caseis weak, in our judgment, for umbrella supervision of a holding company which, because it ownsonly a small bank, does not have material access to the safety net.As I noted when discussing the safety net and bank subsidiaries, attached to alluses of the sovereign credit come efforts by the government to protect the taxpayer. Thoseentities interested in banks are really interested in access to the safety net, since it is far easier toengage in the nonsafety net activities of banks without acquiring a bank. If an organizationchooses to deliver some of its services with the aid of the sovereign credit by acquiring a bank, itshould not be excused from efforts of the government to look out for the stability of the overallfinancial system. For bank holding companies that own more than a small bank, this impliesumbrella supervision. Although that process will increasingly be designed to reduce supervisorypresence and be as nonintrusive as possible, umbrella supervision should not be eliminated, butrecognized for what it is: the cost of obtaining a subsidy.Banking and CommerceFinally, let me turn to an issue that has bedeviled supervisory and regulatorydiscussions for years: the potential separation of commerce and banking.As I indicated earlier, it is clear that rapidly changing technologies are altering thenature of what constitutes finance. Indeed, just as the lines between banking and other financialinstitutions are often already difficult to discern, the boundaries between finance and nonfinanceare likely to become increasingly indistinct as we move into the 21st century. For example,computer and software firms will certainly be offering ever more sophisticated financialproducts. And doubtless financial firms will be offering an increasingly sophisticated array ofnonfinancial services. In addition, some of the financial firms who mainly produce products andservices that many observers believe should be permissible to banks are also engaged in, oraffiliated with, nonfinancial businesses.Newer technologies will make it highly unlikely that the walling off of anyownership of financial institutions by nonfinancial businesses and vice-versa can be continuedvery far into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the Board has concluded that it would be wise tomove with caution in addressing the removal of the current legal barriers between commerce andbanking. The free and open legal association of banking and commerce would be a profound andsurely irreversible structural change in the American economy. Hence, we must be careful toassure ourselves that whatever changes are made in our supervisory structure, that it not distortour evolution to the most efficient financial structure as we move into the next century.Were we fully confident of how the structure would evolve, we could presumablyconstruct today the regulations which would foster that evolution. But we cannot be certain. Wethus run the risk of locking in a set of inappropriate regulations that could adversely alter thedevelopment of market structures. We cannot be confident we know what the true synergiesbetween finance and nonfinance will be in ten or even five years. Our ability to foreseeaccurately the future implications of technologies and market developments in banking, as inBIS Review   16/1997
- 7 -other industries, has not been particularly impressive. As Professor Rosenberg of StanfordUniversity has pointed out, ". . . mistaken forecasts of future structure litter our financiallandscape." Consider the view of the 1960s that the "cashless society" was imminent.Nonetheless, the public preference for paper has declined only gradually. Similarly, just a fewyears ago conventional wisdom argued that banks were dinosaurs that were becoming extinct.The reality today is far from it. Even more recently, it was argued that banks and nonfinancialfirms had to merge in order to save the capital-starved banking system. Today, as you know,virtually all of our banks are very well capitalized.All these examples suggest that if we change the rules now about banking andcommerce under circumstances of uncertainty about future synergies between finance andnonfinance, we might end up doing more harm than good. And, as with all rule changes bygovernment, we are likely to find it impossible to correct our errors promptly. Modifications ofsuch a fundamental structural rule as the separation of banking and commerce shouldaccordingly proceed at a deliberate pace, testing the response of markets and technologicalinnovation to the altered rules in the years ahead. The public needs to have confidence in theregulatory structure, implying that we proceed slowly and cautiously.Excessive delay, however, would doubtless produce some inequities. Expandedfinancial activities for banking organizations requires, the Board believes, that those firmsoperating in markets that banks can enter should, in turn, be authorized to engage in banking.However, some of these nonbanking financial firms already own -- or are owned by --nonfinancial entities. A complete commerce and banking prohibition would thus require thedivestiture of all nonfinancial activities by those organizations that wanted to acquire or establishbanks. The principle of caution suggests an approach which may prove useful. Perhaps thoseorganizations that either have or establish well-capitalized and well-managed bank subsidiariesshould be permitted a small basket of nonfinancial assets -- a certain percentage of eitherconsolidated assets or capital. A small permissible basket would establish, in effect, a pilotprogram to evaluate the efficacy of further breaching of the banking and commerce wall. Wefound that such a slow and deliberate policy worked well with Section 20 affiliates.Of course, some nonbanking firms would find that their nonfinancial activitieswould exceed a small basket exemption. Such excess nonconforming assets might be addressedon a case-by-case basis with a scheduled longer-term divestiture to avoid the worst short-terminequities. A basket clause plus case-by-case review of individual situations might also provide away to make available a common bank and thrift charter to those unitary thrifts that are affiliatedwith nonfinancial businesses. The Board has no firm opinion on just exactly how such trade-offsmight be made, constrained only by the general concerns I summarized earlier.BIS Review   16/1997
Mr. Heikensten looks at the consequences for Sweden of joining EMUSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the Baker &McKenzie’s EMU seminar held in Stockholm on 5/2/97.First a word of thanks for the invitation to talk with you about Sweden and theEuropean Economic and Monetary Union. Today I have chosen to consider this matter fromthree angles: general aspects of the issue of Sweden and EMU; the work we did last year in theUnion to prepare for EMU; and some consequences of EMU for Sweden’s financial sector.The EU’s preparations for the economic and monetary union are continuing. Themember states are doing all they can to fulfil the economic criteria for participation in the euroarea. Along with this, intensive political work is being done to remove any remaining obstacles.After the latest meeting of Heads of State or of Government, in Dublin last December, politicalagreements are in place on, for example, the stability and growth pact and the relationshipbetween the euro and outside currencies.Solutions are still required on a number of important issues. One is how the pathinto EMU is to be arranged for countries that do not belong to the first group. Then there aremany technical details to adjust in the course of the year. But the puzzle’s main pieces are nowin place.EMU - an important part in EU cooperationWhen asked about the likelihood of EMU being actually established on time,some observers declare that “the EMU process has reached a point of no return”. I neither cannor want to be so categorical. But that EMU will be realised on time in accordance with theTreaty does seem highly probable. The political determination is strong, as has beendemonstrated time and again when conflicting views threaten the process.I am glad the debate has now started in Sweden and that it is concentrating to agreater extent on the consequences for Sweden of joining the monetary union or remainingoutside, rather than on whether the EMU project as such is good or bad. What I still lack in thedebate is an appraisal of EMU in a broader policy perspective.  The purpose of the economic andmonetary union is the same as for the European Union: closer European cooperation on suchareas as integration, growth, employment and prosperity.The European Union is often discussed in Sweden in terms of a Brusselsbureaucracy that deals with the length of cucumbers or the curve of bananas. That is of courseboth incorrect and unfortunate. The Union should be seen as an arena or, if you like, a playingfield. For some years now Sweden has been a player, which involves learning the rules andtaking initiatives for the development of Europe in concert with other countries. But thispresupposes that, instead of again remaining outside, we participate in the contexts wheredevelopments are constructed.Opportunities and risksThe idea behind a single currency in Europe is simple. One currency is better thanmany - it makes things work more efficiently. Eliminating the need to exchange currenciesreduces transaction costs. The exchange rate stability facilitates trade and investment. A singlecurrency makes price comparisons and economic estimates easier, not least for small andBIS Review   14/1997
- 2 -medium-sized companies. More direct price comparisons should lead in turn to strongercompetition and downward pressure on prices, to the benefit of consumers.But risks are also involved when a single currency is introduced in so manycountries with geographical, cultural and institutional differences. The Calmfors report hashighlighted the insurance argument. I agree that this is an important point against EMU andtherefore warrants particular attention. Monetary and exchange rate policy can be used as a kindof insurance against major, unforeseeable shocks in a single country. Without it, largeadjustments may be required in other parts of the economy.However, when Calmfors and others claim that country-specific shocks have beenmore frequent in the Swedish economy than in the EU’s core countries, they are on uncertainground. There are many indications that the shocks in Sweden have been occasioned above allby domestic economic policy and other institutional conditions, in the labour market and inwage formation. Wage costs in Sweden rose considerably faster than in other countries in the1970s and 1980s; competitiveness was restored by resorting to devaluations.It is not self-evident that shocks generated externally would hit Sweden moreseriously than countries which are currently taken as given for EMU. So the risk of whateconomists call asymmetric shocks in Sweden should not be exaggerated.Moreover, when it comes to influencing production and employment in the eventof major shocks, monetary policy has a limited capability. It may even be the case thatindependence in monetary policy increases the risk of self-inflicted shocks. In the longer run,monetary policy is not a substitute for the changes that need to be made, for instance to improvewage formation and the workings of the labour market.The Governing Board of the Riksbank will shortly be submitting an opinion onthe Calmfors report. The arguments for and against EMU participation will be considered thereat greater length. A general theme in the report is that every kind of decision - to joint now, tojoin later or to stay outside - entails risks and has a price. Although the report conclude thatSweden should wait joining EMU for the time being, not much is needed to tip the scales theother way, for example if EMU begins with more participants than the core countries or if thealternative of remaining outside does not confer any substantial freedom in monetary policy. Butas I said, there will be occasion to return to this.Preparatory work in the EUThe preparatory work is in full swing in all the EU institutions as well as in themember states. The EMU project will not founder on technical aspects.In May 1995 the Commission presented a green paper on the practicalarrangements for a changeover to the single currency. At the Madrid meeting that year theEuropean Council adopted the scenario for the changeover, specifying dates for the centraldecisions. The Council confirmed that Stage Three of EMU is to start on 1st January 1999. Thedecision on which countries will participate in the euro area is to be made as early as possible in1998 (probably February--April) on the basis of which countries fulfil the convergence criteriain respect of statistics for 1997. Euro banknotes and coins are to be in circulation by January2002 at the latest.BIS Review   14/1997
- 3 -The preparatory work last year was dominated by two issues: one was what isnow called the growth and stability pact and the other was the nature of the relationship betweenthe euro and the currencies outside the euro area. A common factor in these matters is thequestion of maintaining stability once EMU has been established.1. Growth and stability pactWithout specific restrictions, participation in the euro area would make it easierfor a country to implement an expansionary budget policy. When national currencies disappearand the interest rate largely reflects the single monetary policy, some of the immediate signals topoliticians and other decision-makers will disappear. Access to the large, uniform capital marketthat will result from EMU will also make it easier to borrow. Up to a point, of course, this isgood; it eases the tax burden in countries with a large government debt, for example. But it alsoinvolves risks, above all that a country abuses the situation so that ultimately it is other countrieswhich may have to pay when failure threatens.The Maastricht Treaty, as most people probably know by now, contains a numberof conditions that member states have to fulfil in order to participate in the euro area. Oncecountries have joined the euro area, however, there are no correspondingly strict rules. This iswhere the growth and stability pact comes in.The purpose of the pact is to get participating countries to strive for a cyclicallybalanced budget or a surplus position. Deviations from this target are to trigger alarm signalswhereby the Council starts to take action in the form of examinations, advice, recommendations,publication and, ultimately, sanctions. The monitoring of economic development in memberstates is to be reinforced with a mandatory stability programme, similar to the presentconvergence programme. In the event of a country having an excessively large budget deficit, itsgovernment must act. If adequate measures have not been taken within ten months, the countrywill be required to deposit a no-interest fee with the EU Commission. If the deficit is stillexcessive after two years, the fee is transformed into a fine. At most the fine can amount to theequivalent of 0.5 per cent of GDP.If the deficit is due to exceptional circumstances, sanctions are not to be imposed.If GDP falls by 2 per cent, no sanctions are to be levied for an excessively large budget deficit.The Council can also decide not to impose sanctions if GDP falls by between 0.75 and 2 per centand other “special circumstances” apply.While the point of a system for preventing the abuse of fiscal policy in EMU hasalways been clear, one cannot turn a blind eye to the risks inherent in rules such as those in thestability pact. It is thus a matter of striking a reasonable balance between different interests,which is why the discussion has been so protracted. The risks are mainly of two kinds:- One has to do with the need of adjustment mechanisms. With no possibility ofusing monetary and exchange rate policy at the national level, it may be important for the systemto provide other “buffers”. Therefore the pact ought not to be so strict that it might in practicehave a destabilising effect in a particular country with problems.- The other concerns credibility. What would happen if the threat of sanctionsfails to act as a deterrent? Will the European political system be capable of punishing a memberstate?BIS Review   14/1997
- 4 -The main features of the growth and stability pact have been established. Itremains to draw up specific rules about, for example, the monitoring of exchange rate stability,the construction of the stability programme and the legal framework. Finally it may be worthmentioning that the monitoring routine and the excessive deficit procedure will be essentially thesame for countries outside the euro area, except in one respect - the sanctions.2. ERM 2The Dublin meeting also decided that a new exchange rate arrangement, ERM 2,is to be set up as the dominant mechanism for the coordination of monetary policy and othereconomic policies between the member states in the euro area and those that remain outside. Thesystem will resemble the existing ERM except that this is a multilateral system of rates forconversion between all the member currencies, while in ERM 2 the currencies of non-participating countries will be linked directly to the euro.The risk of systemic tensions with ERM 2 will probably be smaller than it hasbeen earlier with ERM because the degree of convergence in the EU area is now greater.Moreover, the band on either side of the central rates will probably be relatively broad. Theexperience gained in 1992-93 has also resulted in a greater readiness to adjust rates when this isconsidered necessary. But of course speculative situations cannot be ruled out either in thepresent ERM or in ERM 2, as is clear from developments in Finland in recent months.The Swedish position has been to avoid making the new exchange ratearrangement mandatory. Basically, we consider it would be better to achieve coordination inEurope with a single inflation target. We find the present construction of Swedish monetarypolicy satisfactory. But we can get along with the system that has been chosen. Cooperation willnot be mandatory, which means that monetary policy can be conducted with an inflation targetas well as with a fixed exchange rate with the euro. Still it is clear that there will be strongpressure on us to participate in ERM 2. It is also conceivable that a period of participation in theexchange rate mechanism will prove to be a condition for EMU membership. In any event, as aEU member state we have undertaken to conduct exchange rate policy as “a matter of commoninterest”.Changeover plan for the financial sectorIt is the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) that decides if Sweden should join EMU.The Riksbank has the task of helping to ensure that Sweden does in fact have a choice when thetime comes to decide, so that Sweden is ready to join if a Riksdag majority so requires.The Ministry of Finance and the Riksbank each have an organisation for theeuro’s practical introduction. The scale of the systemic changeover is tremendous, roughly on apar with our earlier change to driving on the right-hand side of the road. A fundamentalprinciple for the work is that, as far as possible, all those concerned are to find their ownsolutions to the problems posed by EMU.The Riksbank is responsible for the changeover in the financial sector. To this endwe have set up a body called SIFS (the Swedish acronym for Consultation and Information tothe Financial Sector). One result to date is a report, published a few days ago, on the situation asregards the euro in Sweden’s financial sector.Good progress has been made in the preparatory work. Timetables and suitablesolutions have been established in a number of fields. The Riksbank considers that the financialBIS Review   14/1997
- 5 -sector can manage a changeover to the euro on 1st January 1999. Participation from a later datecan facilitate the preparatory work in certain respects and complicate it in others. The worstalternative is a long period of uncertainty; that would entail a costly duplication of systems inmany fields.I should like to end with some examples of changes that will occur and be ofimportance for the financial markets.1. Monetary policyA single currency presupposes a single monetary policy. In EMU this will beimplemented by the ECB. In this context the national central banks will function as “operativearms”, acting on instructions from the ECB.For Swedish banks and financial institutions, the difference as regardsparticipation in central bank monetary policy operations will probably not be all that great. TheRiksbank will no doubt continue to be the financial sector’s counterparty. The main differencesfrom today for Swedish banks are that the overnight market will be considerably larger and thatminimum reserves are likely to be required.How monetary policy is to be constructed and implemented in detail has still to bedecided. These matters will not be finalised until the ECB has been established next year. Thus itis the countries which participate from the start that will be in a position to influence the conductof policy as well as the organisation of the work in the new European bank. There are alreadytendencies for countries belonging to the “presumed” core to exercise a greater influence overthe process.2. Payment systemA single monetary policy calls in turn for a common payment system in order tohandle the payments connected with the policy’s implementation. The arrangements whereby allthe national systems are interlinked is called the Target system.In the new system, a cross-border payment will normally be made in a matter ofseconds, whereas at present in the best case it takes a whole day. The main objective of Target isto enable the ECB to implement monetary policy but the new system will also provide a new“highway” for commercial transactions. The extent to which banks and other enterprises use thesystem will probably depend on the price.All the national central banks in the EU area can join Target, whether or not theircountry is in the euro area. But there is a considerable risk of countries outside the euro areabeing in a worse position, for instance due to restrictions on intra-day borrowing in euro tocounter fluctuations in the payment flows. We have vigorously opposed this threat ofdiscrimination but the issue, along with others, has been deferred and will now be decided by thecountries that join the euro area from the start.3. Legal frameworkA clear legal framework for the euro is essential. Economic values, for instance incontracts, bank accounts and pension agreements, must be guaranteed during the changeoverperiod from 1999 to 2002, when the euro and national currencies will exist side by side. The so-BIS Review   14/1997
- 6 -called continuity of contracts is regulated in one of the euro statutes but amendments to nationallaws will also be needed.Another legal issue concerns the national central banks. As regards the Riksbank,the Maastricht Treaty calls for a more independent statutory status. This means, for instance, thatthe status of the Governor must be clarified; grounds for his or her dismissal will have to beexplicit, e.g. serious misconduct, etc. Neither will the Riksbank be able to accept directives,except of a statutory nature, from others, e.g. the Government. The composition of theGoverning Board may be a problem; the appointment of members of Parliament to theGoverning Board runs counter to traditions in Central Europe.4. Debt conversion and issuesThe countries that join the euro area may - and it is also envisaged that they will -issue treasury paper denominated in euro. A member state wishing to convert its stock of debtinto euro will be allowed to initiate the appropriate measures. A member state may also takesteps whereby private issuers and marketplaces (e.g. the Stockholm Stock Exchange, OM andthe Securities Register Centre) can switch to euro in the changeover period. Many institutionsand agents are in fact planning to do this.All private economic agents are to be free to choose between using euro from thestart of Stage Three and waiting until the changeover has been completed. However, the agentsin the Swedish securities market, banks, financial institutions, the Securities Register Centre, theStockholm Stock Exchange, OM and others are unanimously in favour of a “big-bang” solution,that is, a quick, concerted changeover from kronor to euro right from the turn of 1998.5. Banknotes and coinsEuro banknotes and coins will not be introduced until the beginning of 2002. Fora time, commerce will have to cope with two sets of prices, one in krona and the other in euro. Atimetable for the substitution of banknotes and coins is to be fixed by each country. For Swedenthe Riksbank hopes that the changeover can be arranged in an appreciably shorter time than theallotted six months.It should be underscored, finally, that EMU is likely to bring about notablechanges in the financial landscape. Some products will simply disappear: currencies, as well asforward and option instruments derived from them. With a single monetary policy and noexchange risk, interest rate differentials between national treasury papers will arise only fromcredit risk. The market for Swedish treasury paper will be more or less integrated in a market fortreasury paper in euro. Provided the debt situation in the countries concerned is under controland reasonably similar, national T-bonds will become close substitutes. That will also do awaywith a number of national forward and option products.Certainly there will be new financial products; there has been no lack of creativityin this field in the past decade. There will clearly be increased competition between financialinstitutions as well as between financial markets in different locations.There is nothing new about the  globalisation and integration of the world’sfinancial markets but it is reasonable to suppose that EMU will accelerate the process.BIS Review   14/1997
- 7 -Summary and conclusionsToday it looks for the most part as though economic and monetary union willstart as planned on 1st January 1999. For Sweden the question is whether we are to participatefrom the start, wait a while or try to remain outside for ever. Recently the discussion of this issuehas finally got going. My view has been that it is not just a question of economics, though theeconomic arguments do point to participation. EMU is one important component of the EUcooperation in which Sweden is now taking part.From the debate about economic aspects of EMU one sometimes gets theimpression that an alternative exists which is much simpler, enabling us to avoid all theadjustments which Brussels imposes. That is not the case. Sweden has experienced a profoundeconomic crisis in the 1990s that was essentially self-inflicted. Development in the rest ofEurope has on the whole been better. We must now in any event continue to consolidategovernment finance and establish long-term confidence in the stability of Swedish economy.This will scarcely be easier outside EMU.I find it hard to envisage that Sweden would ultimately want to remain outside afunctional EMU. Bit by bit the countries of Europe will grow together. This makes the questionnot whether but when Sweden ought to join. Perhaps this perspective can help to make thequestion less dramatic.In our efforts to prepare the financial sector for EMU we can see that the workhas come a long way. We also meet a strong desire from the parties concerned to get going asquickly as possible so as not to fall behind; so as to compete on the same terms as otherEuropean enterprises and not lose business opportunities.My own experience of EU cooperation prompts the same conclusion. As a “freerider” alongside EMU it is not just business opportunities that we lose but also influence onEuropean cooperation.BIS Review   14/1997
Mr. George looks at the question as to whether banks are still specialSpeech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the IMF 7thCentral Banking Seminar entitled Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World ofCapital Markets and held in Washington on 29/1/97.Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to take part in this well-directed and well-timedseminar.  I am particularly pleased to be able to share with you my thoughts on the question youput to me “Are banks still special?”  That question is partly a matter of institutional fact; butbeyond that lies the question of whether the institutional characteristics of banks still justifycentral banks’ special concern for the stability of the banking system reflected in both macro-and micro-prudential oversight and in their role as lender of last resort.  So the answers to thosequestions could have far-reaching implications for the role of central banks themselves.In offering my answers I will ask, first, why banks have been regarded as special?Then I will ask whether banks have changed, or whether other financial institutions have becomemore bank-like?  I will save my conclusions until the end!  I am conscious, in this internationalforum, that I speak from a British perspective - in terms of the institutional and legal contextsand their evolution in relation to banks.  But I would hope that, while some of the detail may bespecific to the UK, the broad substance will not be.In what ways have banks been regarded as special?Let me begin then by discussing why, and in what senses, banks have beenregarded as special.The term bank, historically and more than ever today, covers a multitude of sins.In practice it refers to a range of very different institutions which may, and do, within legalrestraints, engage in a variety of different financial - and even some non-financial - activitieswhether on their own account or in an agency or advisory capacity.  But banks have some keydistinguishing characteristics in common.  In particular they take unsecured deposits from thepublic at large.The particular characteristics of bank deposits are that they are capital certain and(more or less) immediately accessible to the depositor, so that they came to be used as theprincipal means of making payments.  In short, because of their convenience, bank depositsbecame the predominant repository for the immediately liquid asset holdings of the rest of theeconomy, and the predominant form of  money.The attraction of these deposit and payments services depends upon depositorsgenerally having a high degree of confidence that their funds will in fact be available on demandand it depends upon the cost of the services.  In providing the services, therefore, the banks needto strike a balance between deploying their deposits in low-yielding, high quality, liquid assets tomeet cash withdrawals, and riskier investments to generate a higher return.  In this latter contextbanks have traditionally played a key role in financing the corporate and household sectors,earning their return by gathering information about, and assessing and monitoring, thecreditworthiness of private sector borrowers, especially those who do not or cannotcost-effectively provide the comprehensive, public, information that would allow them to accessthe capital markets.  Much of the banks’ lending, while nominally at short-term, for example inthe form of callable overdrafts, is in practice illiquid and non-marketable.  So a furtherBIS Review   13/1997
- 2 -distinctive characteristic of banks is that they typically function with a mismatch between theirhighly liquid liabilities and their less liquid, non-marketable, assets.There is no need, I think, to labour the importance to the economy as a whole ofthese distinctive banking functions, or the damage that would be caused if the banks’ role - asthe repository of liquidity, as the core payments mechanism, and as the principal source offinance to at least a large part of the economy - were seriously interrupted.  That in itself helps toexplain the public interest in the effective functioning of the banking system, or why bankscollectively have been regarded as  special.But beyond that, the distinctive banking characteristics that I have described, ofliquid liabilities and less liquid assets, give rise to special needs.Given the banks’ role in the payments system they may need late access toliquidity to square their positions vis-à-vis each other after executing payments instructions onbehalf of their customers.  This explains why, in their routine monetary operations to relieveshortages in the money-market, central banks in many countries tend to confine their (late)lending to banks even when they accept a wider range of counterparties in providing liquiditythrough open market operations.The same distinctive characteristics make banks especially dependent upon publicconfidence.  Bank depositors are not generally in a position to monitor or assess the financialcondition of their bank, so that any suggestion that a particular bank may not be in a position tomeet its liabilities is likely to lead to the panic withdrawal of its deposits.  This can precipitatethe suspension of payments as a result of lack of liquidity even when a bank is solvent as a goingconcern;  and the forced realisation of illiquid assets may in itself result in insolvency.Moreover, any suggestion that one bank is in trouble may be taken - perhaps whollyunjustifiably - as evidence that other banks are likely to be facing similar problems, especiallywhen they are engaged in similar activities.  Bank runs can for this reason become contagious.And the risk of contagion is increased by inter-bank exposures, including those arising from thebanks’ role in the payments system.  So the  special  nature of banks has reflected not just theirdistinctive functions, and the importance of those functions to the wider economy, but also theirpeculiar vulnerability to liquidity pressures.  Central banks evolved in response to thisvulnerability, which gave rise to a readiness to act as lender of last resort to the banking systemin situations in which substantial systemic disturbance could otherwise occur and to an on-goingconcern for the macro-prudential characteristics of the banking system.  And while this concernrelates to the banking system as a whole, last resort assistance, when it is judged to be necessary,is extended to individual banks because problems of course arise in the first instance at the levelof the individual bank.Now, the fact that central banks (in conjunction as necessary with governments)are prepared, in certain circumstances, to extend support in this way encourages bankintermediation;  it represents in effect a form of subsidy, implicitly justified as being in thewider interest of the economy.  It helps to preserve public confidence;  and it enables the banksto take on more maturity transformation or risk than they could otherwise, so lowering theeffective cost of their intermediation.  But it has long been recognised that if central banksupport is made available too liberally - in situations where there is no genuine systemic risk, sothat it comes to be relied upon as a matter of course, then that would give rise to  moral hazard.The extent of bank intermediation would be unjustifiably expanded.  On the one hand, the banksthemselves may be encouraged to take on excessive risks;  while, on the other, depositors maybe encouraged to ignore risk and to become literally care-less as to where they place theirBIS Review   13/1997
- 3 -deposits.  So, both the safety and soundness of the banking system, and its competitiveefficiency, and that of the financial system more generally, may be undermined.Central banks’ macro-prudential concerns for the stability of the banking systemhave necessarily meant that they have taken a close interest in the risk characteristics ofindividual banks as the component parts of the system.  But more recently (at least in the UK -with the coming into force of the first Banking Act in 1979) individual banks were broughtunder formal banking supervision for the first time, and non-bank depositors provided withlimited deposit insurance.  Such micro-prudential supervision of each individual bank, of course,also helps to reduce the risk of instability in the system as a whole, and even limited depositprotection may reduce the risk of bank runs, at least in the form of the sudden withdrawal ofretail deposits.  This, too, of course, can give rise to moral hazard problems if it is perceived astantamount to a guarantee.  But micro-prudential supervision and deposit insurance wereintroduced in the UK at least (though not in the US) with the distinct, social, purpose ofproviding individual, small, depositors with a degree of protection against the sudden loss oftheir principal liquid asset holdings.  This made banks, and bank deposits, special in a differentsense insofar as similar formal supervision and asset protection were not (at that time) extendedto other financial intermediaries or their liabilities.These then are the respects in which banks have hitherto been regarded as special.Let me now move on to consider whether, or to what extent, the banks have kept their distinctivecharacteristics, or to what extent other financial institutions have developed similarcharacteristics so that banks are no longer special in that sense.To what extent have banks changed?It is certainly true, as I noted earlier, that banks engage in a range of financialactivities besides those which I have described as distinctively  banking  activities.  Major bankseverywhere have increasingly diversified the products and services they offer, built upinvestment banking businesses and trading activities, extended into life insurance, and so on,sometimes on a single balance sheet or sometimes in separate non-banking entities.  In thepresent context, however, the question is whether these developments have fundamentallyaltered the characteristics of the  banking  part of their balance sheets.  It seems to me that theanswer, generally speaking, is that they have not.On the liabilities side, while there may have been (indeed in some countries,where close substitutes for money, such as money-market mutual funds have taken off, therecertainly has been) some erosion of the banks’ market share as a repository for liquid assetholdings, that erosion has generally been very gradual.  In the UK, for example, bank (andbuilding society) deposits still account for 42% of personal sector liquid asset holdings against50% a decade ago;  the proportion would be very much higher if liquid assets included onlythose that are capital certain.  And the vast bulk of the banks’ liabilities remain in the form ofunsecured, short-term, deposits.  Despite the rapid development of (secured) repo markets, onlysome 3% of the major UK banks’ funding (in sterling and foreign currency together) wassecured (from information provided last Autumn) through repo;  and the figure for all UKbanks, including the business conducted in branches and subsidiaries of overseas banks, whichhave less direct access to deposits, was only around 8½%.  The proportion of secured funding isbelow 5% for other major internationally active banks that we have looked at, with the exceptionof JP Morgan and Bankers Trust - both somewhat special cases - where the proportion is veryBIS Review   13/1997
- 4 -much higher (25-35%).  And even in those special cases it is still well below that for the majorUS securities firms (typically 55-80%).Banks remain, too, at the heart of payments systems.  Payments may be madedirectly across bank accounts through instructions, for example, in the form of cheque or debitcard;  or they may be made indirectly, through, for example, the use of credit cards, the balanceson which are subsequently settled using a bank account.  Even where disintermediation createsnew chequing facilities, as for example, in the case of money-market mutuals, these are stillcleared through settlement banks.  It is true that new forms of money transmission - e-money -are being developed, sometimes outside the conventional banking system.  But I suspect thatthey, too, will typically depend upon clearing through the banking system.  To the extent thatthey come to involve the creation of what are effectively direct deposits, they will representbanking  in a different form and become special, and logically subject to regulation, in much thesame way as conventional bank deposits.  In the payments system context, too, importantprogress is being made to reduce inter-bank exposures (through the introduction of real timegross settlements systems in many countries, for example, and through the netting of foreignexchange settlements) but those exposures, as well as inter-bank exposures incurred in directinter-bank transactions - the large bulk of all of which are unsecured - remain extraordinarilylarge.  Individual inter-bank limits can substantially exceed 25% of capital (the normalsupervisory limit for large exposures), and as an example of aggregate inter-bank exposures themajor UK retail banks currently place some £115 billion, or 16% of their total assets, with eachother or with other UK banks.Turning to the assets side, there is some evidence of a gradual erosion of the roleof banks in financial intermediation.  One measure in the UK is a decline in the banks’ (andbuilding societies’) share in the assets of the whole financial sector (including securities firms,collective investment vehicles, and life assurance and pension funds’ investments etc) which hasfallen fairly steadily over the past 10 years, from close to 70% to some 55%.  I believe that inthe US, where financial innovation has probably been even greater, comparable figures alsoshow this decline, from around 45% in the mid-1970s to about one third now.In the UK, bank lending to the corporate sector has fallen, erratically, from some27% of total corporate borrowing outstanding (including all forms of debt as well as equityissuance) in 1985 to less than 17%.  This mainly reflects the increased access of larger corporateborrowers to the domestic and international capital markets for short and longer-term corporatepaper, where they often have a better credit rating than banks.  Smaller corporates, on the otherhand, remain very heavily dependent upon bank finance - for well over half their overall needs.Meanwhile the banks’ share of net external finance of the personal sector has not changed muchat all over the past decade, at around 80%.Trends in the liquidity of bank assets are difficult to assess because liquidity itselfis so hard to judge simply from balance sheet categories.  The advent of securitisation and thedirect sale of loans ought to have helped.  But except in the US, securitisation has in fact so farmade only limited progress, and debt sales have been focused mainly on impaired developingcountry or corporate debt.  One reason why prime corporate loans are not so far traded is theimportance that both banks and borrowers still attach to their mutual relationships.  My guess isthat the liquidity of bank assets by these means will gradually increase;  and that process may behelped by the development of techniques such as credit derivatives.  But for the time being - andindeed some time to come - bank loans are, for the most part, likely to remain illiquid in mostcountries.BIS Review   13/1997
- 5 -We can nevertheless look at the crude balance sheet data, and, for what they areworth, we have looked at the share of loans to non-banks in total assets as a measure of theliquidity of the asset portfolio for a range of different types of institution.  These data show that:-for some representative small, domestic, UK banks the loan ratio is stillsome 70-80% of the total, apparently with no particular trend;-for large UK, internationally-active, banks the share of loans is currentlyaround 50%, having fallen quite sharply from some 65-70% some five years ago, perhapsreflecting the expansion of their investment banking activity;-for large continental banks the share of loans is either side of 50%, havingfallen more gradually.Again JP Morgan and Bankers Trust are outliers.  Their loan ratio to total assets isdown to around 12% from around 50% in 1985 and 30% only 5 years ago.  That is still muchhigher than the illiquid asset ratio for the large US securities firms which has fairly consistentlybeen around 2%.The conclusion that I draw from all of this is that while there certainly have beenimportant changes affecting the banks, and the environment in which they operate, they havenot, yet at least, been such as to affect fundamentally their relevant key functions or theimportance of those functions to the economy;  nor have they altered fundamentally thedistinctive characteristics of either the banks’ liabilities or their assets.To what extent have other financial institutions become more like banks?So, then, to what extent have other financial institutions developed similarcharacteristics to the distinctive characteristics of the banks as I have described them?The question, let me be quite clear, is not whether other financial institutionsperform economically or socially important functions - clearly they do - and those functions mayequally be  special  in their own distinctive ways.It is also obviously true that, with the upsurge in financial innovation andglobalisation that we have seen in the past 10-20 years, there has been substantial blurring of theboundaries between different types of financial institution and the increasing emergence ofmultifunctional, multinational, financial groups, so that non-bank institutions have taken overbanks or offered banking services just as banks have entered substantially into non-bankingfinancial activities.  But that is not the issue either.  The question is whether the distinctionbetween banking and non-banking financial functions has been eroded, again whether thosefunctions are carried out in separate entities or on the same balance sheet.  I do not think it has.Take, for example, long-term savings institutions - life insurance companies andpension funds.  They clearly perform a vital economic and social function, and they are subjectto separate functional regulation because of their  special  importance as homes for the long-termsavings of the personal sector and as providers of long-term capital.  But their liabilities aretotally unlike the very liquid liabilities of banks, and the liquidity of their assets and liabilitiesare much more closely matched - indeed their marketable assets tend to be more liquid than theirliabilities.  The distinction remains even where these activities are carried out in a bankingBIS Review   13/1997

That is not to deny that there may well be risksrunning from one part of the group to another - for example reputational risks or operationalrisks arising from shared systems or personnel and so on.  It is not to deny either that there canbe large cross-functional financial exposures.  That, of course, is why the respective supervisorsneed to take an interest in all parts of a financial group and in intra-group exposures.  But noneof this, it seems to me, means that long-term savings institutions have taken on the distinctivespecial characteristics of banks.So far, I would hope, so good in the sense that perhaps most of you would agreethat this particular distinction remains. But have I chosen this extreme example as an AuntSally?Well perhaps to a degree I have.  So let me take some less obvious cases.What about money-market mutual funds, for example?  Surely they at least havesome of the characteristics of banks?  They, too, act as a repository for liquidity and it ispossible to make payments from some of them, which looks very like a banking arrangement?And so it does.  But in fact I think this appearance is deceptive, for three reasons:- first, investments in money market mutuals are not, as I understand it, inprinciple capital certain (though in practice they may be supported by the fund’s sponsor);  norare they covered by deposit insurance (though this may not always be understood by theinvestor);- secondly, as I mentioned earlier, money-market mutuals are not themselves atthe heart of the payments mechanism, but in effect piggy-back on the banks which are;- and, thirdly, money market mutuals do not undertake maturity transformation bymaking illiquid loans;  like all collective investment schemes they put their investors’ funds intomarketable instruments in accordance with the rules of the fund.Whereas money-market mutuals have something of the character of banks on theliabilities side of their balance sheets, but not on the assets side, the converse is true of non-bankfinance companies.  They do make illiquid loans, much as banks do.  But they typically fundthemselves in capital markets or from the banking system, and do not offer capital-certain,immediately available, liabilities to the public at large which are in any way comparable to bankdeposits.  Nor do they typically offer payments services.But what about the free-standing securities houses - and in particular those ofAmerican and Japanese parentage that have, up to now, been separated from commercialbanking activity by the Glass-Steagall Act and by Article 65?  They, surely, have both liquidliabilities and engage in maturity transformation; and, of course, they do actually operate partlythrough banking entities outside their home jurisdictions.Again, however, I think appearances may deceive.  The liabilities of the housesare not in fact a bit like bank deposits.  While it is true that the houses have increased the extentof their unsecured funding, for example through public issues, the bulk of their liquid liabilitiesare still secured - with, as I said, some 55-80% of the total funding of the US houses we havelooked at typically in the form of repos.  Nor do the houses hold themselves out to take depositsBIS Review   13/1997
- 7 -from the public at large.  Nor, finally, are their liabilities directly usable as a payments medium.In all these respects the houses’ liabilities are non-monetary - even if they can rapidly be turnedinto money.On the assets side of the balance sheet, the securities houses continue to investprimarily in liquid, marketable assets which can readily be sold.  This is partly a reflection of thenature of investment banking business, in particular trading, underwriting and so on, and ofregulatory requirements, but also of funding uncertainty:  the securities house protects itself bybeing able, if necessary, to contract the size of its balance sheet very rapidly.  Illiquid assetscontinue to be a small proportion of the total, generally of the order of 2%, and the housesmitigate the maturity transformation risk in holding these, and marketable assets of moredoubtful liquidity (such as some emerging market instruments), by matching with long-termborrowings.What is certainly true is that the securities houses have expanded their activitiesenormously - with balance sheets extending to $100-200 billion, which puts them in this respecton a par with large international banks.  And, given their focus on trading activity - in money,capital and foreign exchange markets - they are, of course, huge counterparties of the banks,with very large exposures both among themselves and between them and the banks, but with theimportant distinction that exposures between, or to, securities houses are more typically secured.Size in any event does not in itself mean that the securities houses now have thespecial, distinguishing, characteristics of banks - any more than the long-term savingsinstitutions or the money funds or indeed large non-financial corporates, which may also havehuge balance sheets and which may also have large Treasury operations in-house to manage thefunds for own account.Systemic riskSo it seems to me that banks are indeed still special insofar as they continue toperform distinctive economic functions and insofar as their liabilities and assets still havedistinctive characteristics.  This means that there is still a distinct public interest in the activitiesof institutions that are engaged in banking - as defined - whether as free-standing entities orwithin a broader group structure.  That interest includes a micro-prudential concern to providesome measure at least of protection to public depositors, reflected in the supervision ofindividual banking institutions and in deposit protection schemes.  But it includes also amacro-prudential concern with the stability of the banking system as a whole, because of itspeculiar vulnerability to contagious - systemic - disturbance, reflected in central banks’preparedness to provide liquidity to the system where that is judged to be necessary.Other forms of financial activity also perform distinctive functions, and havedistinctive characteristics which make them special in their own different ways.  And thesespecial features equally may - and often do - give rise to special public interests.  The publicinterest in these other financial activities may be driven by a social concern to protect consumers(for example the prospective beneficiaries of pension funds or life insurance policy holders, orinvestors, whether in collective funds or individually, through different kinds of intermediary, incapital markets), which is similar to the social concern relating to depositor protection.  And itmay extend to other aspects of the particular activity, including aspects of business conduct aswell as the financial integrity of the institutions involved.  In fact the public interest innon-banking financial activity has certainly increased in this sense - both in terms of the range ofBIS Review   13/1997
- 8 -activities covered and the standards of protection demanded - as is reflected in the spread offinancial regulation over the past 10-20 years as the activities themselves have expanded.  Ourown Financial Services Act, for example, which provides for formal regulation of investmentbusiness dates only from 1986.  A corollary of this broadening public interest is thatmultifunctional financial services providers are bound to be subject to a broadening range offunctional regulation - however such regulation is structured.What I think is less clear is the extent and nature of the public macro-prudentialinterest in non-banking financial activities.  I have argued that other, non-banking, financialactivities are not - because of the different characteristics of the related liabilities and assets -subject to runs in the same way as banks, and that they are not therefore subject to contagious -systemic - disturbance in the same sense as banks.  But that does not mean that non-bankfinancial institutions cannot face liquidity pressures.  It does not mean either that the failure of anon-bank financial institution could not - through its direct credit or settlements exposures toother financial institutions (bank or non-bank) - have damaging knock-on effects.  Conceivably,too, such a failure could have such serious consequences for the liquidity of - or price level in -some particular sector of the financial markets, that concerns would arise for the liquidity, orsolvency, of other bank or non-bank institutions that were known, or believed, to be heavilyexposed to that market.  In this sense size does matter - and, whether or not one chooses todescribe the risk of this happening as systemic, there is no doubt that a sufficiently largedisturbance originating in the non-banking activity of one financial institution could put othersin difficulty.  This possibility must be of concern to financial regulators, including central banks,concerned with the stability of the financial system as a whole.  It certainly in my view providesmacro-prudential justification for regulatory oversight of the activity of (large) non-bankfinancial institutions, and of the non-banking activities of banks - quite apart frommicro-prudential regulation in the interests of consumer protection.  It provides justification, too,for some form of consolidated prudential oversight of multifunctional financial groups and formonitoring large exposures, both intra-group and to outside counterparties.  Where a problem ofthis sort does arise, it may well justify technical central bank intervention to help contain it - forexample by facilitating payments and settlements to minimise market disturbance.  But, I wouldbe very cautious about extending last resort liquidity provision to financial institutions notengaged in  banking  activity, and where the particular justification for it, based upon banks’distinctive functions and the distinctive characteristics of banks’ balance sheets, did not clearlyapply.  While I do not think such intervention can, realistically, be excluded altogether, I amconcerned that an unduly liberal interpretation of systemic risk would increase the scope formoral hazard and ultimately weaken the safety and soundness of the financial system as a whole.ConclusionMr. Chairman, my answer to your question  Are banks still special?  is essentiallythat while in some respects they may be less special than they were, they remain specialnonetheless.  They remain special in terms of the particular functions they perform - as therepository of the economy’s immediately available liquidity, as the core payments mechanism,and as the principal source of non-market finance to a large part of the economy.  And theyremain special in terms of the particular characteristics of their balance sheets, which arenecessary to perform those functions - including the mismatch between their assets and liabilitieswhich makes banks peculiarly vulnerable to systemic risk in the traditional sense of that term.Perhaps the day will come - and I do not at all exclude the possibility that other financial activitywill continue increasingly to be carried on alongside banking activity, even on the same balancesheet, indeed I expect that to happen.  That, in my view, does not reduce the special publicBIS Review   13/1997
- 9 -interest in banking activity;  although it may well affect the appropriate substance of bankingsupervision;  and it certainly extends to banks’ other, different, functional public interests,including different regulatory interests.  On the other hand I am not persuaded that the specialpublic interest in banking activity extends to non-banking financial institutions, though differentfunctional public interests in many cases clearly do.  What is absolutely clear, in a world ofincreasing financial integration, is that neither the financial regulators nor the central bankersamong you can expect an easy life!BIS Review   13/1997
Mr. Chen discusses monetary relations between China and Hong KongSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China, Mr. Chen Yuan, at the Bank ofEngland Seminar held in London on 10/9/96.INTRODUCTIONIn less than three hundred days, China will resume the exercise of sovereigntyover Hong Kong. Given Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre, it is natural forthe international investment community to be interested in the future of Hong Kong. I amgrateful to Governor George for giving me this opportunity to share with this distinguishedaudience the Chinese Government’s policy on the monetary relationship between the mainlandof China and Hong Kong after 1997.By way of introduction, let me first explain the origin of the basic principle of“one country, two systems”, which forms the backbone of China’s policy towards the HongKong Special Administrative Region as from 1 July 1997. This will help people to understandwhy China is so committed to implementing this very important principle in Hong Kong.THE “ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS” PRINCIPLEWhat does “one country, two systems” mean? It means that after 1997, thesocialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.This principle was not a compromise solution reached in the Sino-Britishnegotiations for political expedience. It was not even an idea floated by the British side. It was infact a paramount guiding principle adopted by the Chinese Government for advancing theunification of China. The principle was also the outcome of intense research by the ChineseGovernment on what factors contributed to the economic success and stability of Hong Kongand how they could be preserved beyond 1997. We are convinced that this principle would servenot only China’s long-term national interest but also that of Hong Kong.It was against this background that the Chinese Government put forward in thenegotiations the concept of “One Country, Two Systems” and the guiding principles. These weresubsequently incorporated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and then in the BasicLaw promulgated by our National People’s Congress in 1990. I should add that the principle of“one country, two systems” as a fundamental policy for the unification and development ofChina has been written into our country’s constitution and become a long-term irreversiblenational policy. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is a treaty registered with the United Nations.The Chinese Government is committed to implementing fully and faithfully the provisions of theJoint Declaration and the Basic Law.My second point is that notwithstanding our commitment, there is no lack ofsceptics who doubt that the Chinese Government would abide by the Basic Law and fulfil itscommitments after 1997. This brings to mind those sceptics who doubted China’s commitmentto the open door policy and the economic reform which China initiated in late 1979. Such criticsthought that the problems faced by China in the reform process were so huge that we weredoomed to fail. They also doubted how our economic reform could square with China’s socialisteconomy. Today, you and I can both see that these critics have been proven wrong.BIS Review   12/1997
- 2 -Between 1979 and 1995, China’s GDP has increased by an average of 9.9% everyyear and the standard of living has improved significantly. The economic and monetaryconditions and the legal and institutional reform of our financial sector have made progressbeyond the expectations of many. China’s foreign reserves reached a record high of US$ 90.7billion in early August 1996.The critics are right in pointing out that China is a vast country, with a largepopulation of over 1.2 billion people. It is natural that in the implementation of our reform wecould run into difficulties of one sort or another. At times we need to adjust our pace a bit toresolve those problems but there is no question that China is firmly resolved to continuing witheconomic reform. Equally, China remains firmly and totally committed to maintaining theprosperity and stability of Hong Kong, in accordance with the provisions of the JointDeclaration and the Basic Law. I am sure that the facts and events will demonstrate that thesceptics will once again be proven to be wrong.Ladies and gentlemen, let me now proceed to outline first the legal and policyframework and then the seven basic principles governing the monetary relationship between themainland of China and Hong Kong. Finally, I will describe China’s policy on Hong Kong’sparticipation in international and regional financial institutions and forums.THE LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORKAccording to the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, Hong Kong will enjoyautonomy in all areas other than foreign affairs and defence matters. The key provisions on themonetary and financial sides provide that:The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall providean appropriate economic and legal environment for the maintenance of its status as aninternational financial centre. Hong Kong shall, on its own, formulate monetary and financialpolicies, safeguard the free operation of financial business and financial markets, and regulateand supervise financial activities in accordance with the law.The Hong Kong dollar, as the only legal tender in Hong Kong, shall continue tocirculate, and the existing currency issue mechanism shall continue. The Hong Kong dollar shallremain freely convertible, with free flow of capital and no exchange controls. The ExchangeFund, which holds Hong Kong’s foreign reserves, shall be managed and controlled by theGovernment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, primarily for regulating theexchange value of the Hong Kong dollar.The above provisions form the foundation for defining and establishing themonetary relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong under the principle of “onecountry, two systems”. Under these provisions, this relationship can be best summarised as onecountry, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities, under twodifferent social and economic systems within a sovereign state.SEVEN PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE MONETARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEMAINLAND AND HONG KONGI will now set out the seven principles governing the monetary relationshipbetween the mainland of China and Hong Kong.BIS Review   12/1997
- 3 -The first principle concerns the relationship between the two currencies andbetween the two monetary systems.According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own systemof currency issuance and management after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi willcirculate as legal tender in Hong Kong and the mainland respectively. The Hong Kong dollarwill be treated as a foreign currency in the mainland. Likewise, the renminbi will be treated as aforeign currency in Hong Kong.The three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong will continue to issue Hong Kongdollar bank notes, with 100% backing by US dollars under the linked exchange rate system. Thecurrency in circulation in Hong Kong is in fact backed over five times by foreign reserves. HereI would like to stress that China supports Hong Kong’s commitment to the maintenance of thelinked exchange rate system, which has served Hong Kong well by providing monetary stabilitysince its introduction in 1983.Corresponding to the two currencies will be two monetary systems. They possesstheir own characteristics, reflecting the differences between the two economies. The twomonetary systems are of equal importance to China in its reform and liberalisation. One does notprecede or be subsidiary to the other. They will operate in a mutually independent manner.The second principle relates to the relationship between the two monetaryauthorities. It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland andHong Kong that the two monetary authorities will also be mutually independent. The HongKong Monetary Authority will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong government. ThePeople’s Bank of China will not take the place of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and willnot set up any office there.As Hong Kong and the mainland develop increasingly close economic ties in bothtrade and investment, close co-operation between the two monetary authorities becomes evenmore important. The two monetary authorities must, therefore, strengthen further the presentsound co-operation of central banking functions, including monetary management, bankingsupervision and the development of the financial infrastructure.The third principle concerns co-operation in prudential supervision. According tothe Basic Law, the Hong Kong government will continue to supervise financial institutions inHong Kong, including financial institutions from the mainland. Supervision will continue to beundertaken in accordance with international rules and practices.Notwithstanding different business practices in the mainland and Hong Kong, wehave reached consensus on licensing procedures and supervision of each other’s financialinstitutions. It has been agreed that :Financial institutions based in the mainland and Hong Kong setting up offices ineach other’s territory shall be approved on the same basis as foreign financial institutions. Themainland offices of Hong Kong-based financial institutions shall continue to enjoy the samepreferential treatment in the mainland as other foreign financial institutions. mainland financialinstitutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy any privileges. They shall abide by the law of HongKong and be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong.BIS Review   12/1997
- 4 -This arm’s length treatment will certainly help to underscore the implementationof the “one country, two systems” principle.The fourth principle is that the People’s Bank of China will support the currencystability of Hong Kong. On behalf of the PBOC, I have early this year signed a bilateralagreement with the HKMA on the repurchase of US treasury paper. We are prepared to offerliquidity support to the HKMA for the purpose of stabilising the exchange rate of the HongKong dollar. We also stand ready to use our foreign reserves to support the Hong Kong dollar, ifnecessary.However, I must point out that under no circumstances will China draw on orresort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or other assets in any way and for any reason. Imentioned earlier that the Basic Law states that the Exchange Fund shall be managed andcontrolled by the Hong Kong government. It is also stated that the financial revenues of theHong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes. Inaddition, the Basic Law stipulates that the Chinese Government shall not levy taxes in HongKong. These triple safeguards are evidence that China does not have its eyes on siphoning offthe resources of Hong Kong.The fifth principle relates to the treatment of financial business between Chinaand Hong Kong. After 1997, all financial business between the two places will be conducted inaccordance with the rules and practices of international financial activities. Claims and liabilitiesbetween banks and companies from the mainland and those in Hong Kong will continue to beregarded as external claims and liabilities. When raising funds in Hong Kong, Chinese entitieswill have equal treatment as other international and local market participants, without anyspecial privileges. Disputes relating to contracts between banks and companies of the mainlandand those of Hong Kong shall be handled in accordance with international practice. WhereChina’s Arbitration Law and other relevant laws and regulations are applied, the provisionsrelating to arbitration involving foreign parties will apply.The sixth principle is about the standing of mainland financial institutions inHong Kong. As discussed earlier, mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong must abide bythe law of Hong Kong and be regulated by relevant regulatory authorities there. I would like tostress that the Bank of China group, though being one of the three note-issuing banks and aleading commercial bank in Hong Kong, shall not be treated more favourably than other banks.It shall not carry out any activities beyond the role of a commercial bank.The seventh principle is on the complementarity between Shanghai and HongKong. As you know, Shanghai used to be China’s financial centre. With China’s deepeningreforms and open-door policy, Shanghai is becoming a vibrant city with tremendous potentialfor further development. To a certain extent, Shanghai has met the conditions for revivingherself as a financial centre. While there are concerns as to whether Shanghai will replace HongKong, I would like to emphasise that these are groundless speculations because the Basic Lawhas already stipulated that Hong Kong shall maintain its status as an international financialcentre.We are of the view that Hong Kong and Shanghai will have a complementary andmutually reinforcing relationship. In the short run, and at least before the renminbi becomesfully convertible, it will not be possible for Shanghai to become an international financial centre.Given the size of China’s economy, there is plenty of room for more than one financial centre.BIS Review   12/1997
- 5 -Hong Kong and Shanghai will likely become two complementary and mutually reinforcingfinancial centres that will each develop with its own characteristics.HONG KONG IN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY RELATIONSApart from these seven principles, it is also important for Hong Kong as aninternational financial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations andparticipate in the activities of international and regional financial institutions, central bankforums etc.There are therefore provisions in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law thatHong Kong may, on its own, maintain and develop financial relations and conclude andimplement agreements with other countries, regions and relevant international organisations,using the name of “Hong Kong, China”.Some international financial organisations restrict their membership to sovereignstates. In those cases, where negotiations are held on matters involving Hong Kong, the ChineseGovernment would normally consult Hong Kong and include its representatives in the Chinesedelegation. When entering into international financial agreements which may involve HongKong, the Chinese government will first seek the views of Hong Kong before deciding whethersuch agreements will apply to it.Taken together, these provisions will enable Hong Kong to continue and alsodevelop its current international monetary relationship.PROSPECTS FOR HONG KONG AFTER 1997I believe Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable after 1997. Why? This isbecause:First, the strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong and the entrepreneurialand management skills of the people of Hong Kong are the basis for its continued prosperity andstability.Secondly, the Basic Law has provided a legal safeguard for the maintenance ofthe prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.Thirdly, the economic development of the mainland has created excellentconditions for Hong Kong’s continued prosperity and stability. As pointed out by China’s Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji at his meeting on 29 May this year with senior officials of four mainfinancial regulators and institutions from Hong Kong including the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority - China is confident in Hong Kong’s maintaining prosperity and stability and its statusas an international financial centre after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economicdevelopment of China.As Hong Kong will continue its role as an international financial centre, it willbecome the most important funding centre for China and very likely for the Asian region as awhole. With the ongoing reform and open-door policy, the mainland of China has achievedsustained and strong economic growth. Our target for economic growth in 1996 is 8% but itcould exceed 9%. Inflation should be within the range of 7 to 8% for 1996.BIS Review   12/1997
- 6 -The mainland of China’s growth will obviously benefit Hong Kong’s economytremendously as we are its largest trading partner. The mainland of China is also one of theleading investors in Hong Kong, with total investment reaching US$ 25 billion last year. At thesame time, Hong Kong has also contributed greatly to the mainland of China’s reform andmodernisation, both in terms of investment and know-how. Hong Kong is the largest investor inthe mainland. Total cumulative direct investment from Hong Kong has now reached US$ 78.6billion, accounting for 58% of total foreign direct investment. In 1995 alone, about half of theforeign direct investment in the mainland came from Hong Kong, which amounted to some US$20 billion. Also, for the 23 Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets, the trading ofsuch overseas stocks is most active in Hong Kong. Out of the 23 companies, 21 had theirprimary listing in Hong Kong.As China continues with its financial and economic reforms, Hong Kong’s role asa financial centre for China will become even more important. It is therefore vital that HongKong remain the vibrant financial centre with its own economic system that we know now. Wecertainly would not do anything which would jeopardise Hong Kong’s prospects.To conclude, I have no doubt that Hong Kong will continue to do well after 1997 as it has donein the past three decades during which Hong Kong survived numerous shocks and marketturbulence. History has shown that Hong Kong has been extremely resilient to external shocksand was able to regain its vitality and competitiveness through swift internal adjustments.Investors who had the foresight and wisdom of capitalising on the opportunities in Hong Konghave done well and will be able to continue to share in the prosperity of Hong Kong.Ladies and gentlemen, 1997 is not a time when Hong Kong will need a miracle inorder to survive the transition. I hope you will also come to the conclusion that China,particularly Hong Kong, offers tremendous business potential for investors, both local andoverseas.BIS Review   12/1997
Mr. Dai assesses the outlook for Hong Kong as Asia’s financial centreSpeech by the Governor of the People’s Bank of China, Mr. Dai Xianglong, at the luncheonhosted by the  Hong Kong Financial Secretary in Washington on 30/9/96.The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings will be held in Hong Kong nextyear. Mr Liu Zhongli, the Minister of Finance and myself will be there welcoming you as thehost of the occasion. I foresee that the Annual Meetings to be held next year will be amagnificent event which commands far-reaching historical significance. This is because theAnnual Meetings of the two important international financial organisations are to be held inHong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.Representatives from various countries will have the opportunity to witness the realisation of theprinciple of “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong. I believe that nobody will wish to misssuch an opportunity.Mr Tsang has just expressed his views on the economy of Hong Kong before andafter 1997. I would like to say a few words from the perspective of the People’s Bank of China(PBOC). I have stated on many occasions that we are confident that after China resumes theexercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the territory will not only remain prosperous andstable, but its status as an international financial centre will also be further enhanced.And I have good reasons for this confidence.First, there are the strong economic fundamentals of Hong Kong and theentrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong. These form the basis forHong Kong’s continued prosperity and stability and for maintaining Hong Kong’s status as aninternational financial centre.As you all know, Hong Kong is an international trade, transport, financial andinformation centre. With the rapid economic developments taking place in the Asia-Pacificregion, Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre will not be weakened; instead, itsimportance will certainly increase. According to the “Joint Declaration of the Government of theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People’sRepublic of China on the Question of Hong Kong” and “The Basic Law of the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China”, Hong Kong will become aSpecial Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China from 1 July 1997. It will enjoya high degree of autonomy with Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. Hong Kong will becomean independent tariff and trade region and an international financial centre in China but with itsown currency. In order to maintain its status as an international financial centre, Hong Kong willinevitably face various challenges. However, Hong Kong will continue to have a sound legalsystem, advanced communication facilities and infrastructures, professional and managementexpertise, and strong foreign reserves. Currently, Hong Kong’s foreign reserves rank seventh inthe world while China’s rank second. With the backing of such strong economic strength, we areconfident that Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre will be maintained andfurther enhanced.Secondly, from the legal angle, the Basic Law assures the continuation andenhancement of Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.Articles 109 to 113 of the Basic Law lay down specific provisions relating toHong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, its monetary and financial policies, thestatus of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements, capital movements and the role ofBIS Review   12/1997
- 2 -the Exchange Fund. These principles establish the basic monetary relationship between Chinaand Hong Kong under the principle of “one country, two systems”, and this can conveniently besummarised as “one country, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetaryauthorities” within a sovereign state. It should be pointed out that the co-existence of twocurrencies, that is, the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi, is a clear demonstration of thedifferences between the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland. It is therefore essential thatthe two monetary systems should be mutually independent. The renminbi will not replace theHong Kong dollar. We are of the view that the co-existence of two monetary systems issignificant to the economic reform of China.It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainlandand Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities will also be mutually independent and one isnot superior to the other. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will be accountablesolely to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government from 1 July 1997. ThePBOC will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any branch office in Hong Kong.I am glad that international organisations and other central banks alsoacknowledge the mutually independent relationship between the PBOC and the HKMA.Both the PBOC and the HKMA were offered membership in the Bank forInternational Settlements in early September this year. This shows that the work done by thePBOC and the HKMA are widely accepted and appreciated by the central banking fraternity.This also shows that the international financial community fully supports the principle of “onecountry, two systems” laid down by the Basic Law.The Basic Law also states that the Exchange Fund shall be managed andcontrolled by the Hong Kong government. It also states that the revenues of the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes. In addition, theBasic Law stipulates that the Chinese Government will not levy taxes in Hong Kong. Thesethree-fold safeguards are evidence that China will not interfere with Hong Kong’s financialmatters. We have reiterated time and again that under no circumstances will China draw on orresort to Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund or other assets in any way or for any reason. On thecontrary, the PBOC will support the currency stability of Hong Kong. The PBOC and theHKMA entered into a bilateral agreement on repurchase of US treasury paper early this year.We also stand ready to provide funds to support the Hong Kong dollar, if necessary.Thirdly, the economic development of the mainland has created excellentconditions for the continuity and further strengthening of Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.Economic development in the mainland provides a strong support to Hong Kong’s economicdevelopment. China is confident in Hong Kong’s maintaining prosperity and stability after 1997because we have full confidence in the economic development in China.China is firmly committed to continuing with its economic reform and ourachievements are widely recognised. Currently, the macro-economic situation in mainland Chinais steady. The various macro-economic indicators do meet our targets laid down early this yearand some even out-perform our expectations. It is anticipated that this year’s economic growthwill be around 9%. The retail price is expected to rise by about 7% and is expected to remainsteady over the next two years or may even ease further. At present, our foreign reserves areover US$ 90 billion and are expected to exceed US$ 95 billion by the end of this year. Since thebeginning of the second quarter this year, external trade has posted some steady growth. There isa significant inflow of capital and our balance of payments is in a healthy position. Therefore theBIS Review   12/1997
- 3 -exchange rate of the renminbi, which is determined by the market, will remain stable. Therenminbi, for all intents and purposes has become fully convertible in the current account. Weare in advance of our schedule in satisfying the requirement stipulated in Article VIII of the IMFArticles of Agreement.In the next five years, China will continue to adopt an appropriately tightmonetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly, we will have an appropriately tightmonetary stance to keep inflation at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly,money supply should grow at an appropriate level. In the next five years, the annual growth rateof M1 will be kept at around 18% and M2 at 21% to 23%. Thirdly, reforms and improvementswill continuously be made to the approach in making macro-economic adjustment. That is, wewill move from reliance on direct control of the volume of credit towards regulating moneysupply by means of indirect monetary policy instruments such as reserve requirements, openmarket operations and interest rate policy. Appropriately tight monetary policy is not limited tothe control of total credit but also adjustment of the credit structure, deepening of monetaryreforms, and timely adjustments to the different aspects of the monetary system. Anappropriately tight monetary policy is conducive to the healthy, stable and sustained growth ofthe national economy. It also helps to create favourable conditions for the resumption ofsovereignty and the continued prosperity of Hong Kong.Stability in China is the very basis for Hong Kong’s stability while Hong Kong’sstability will certainly enhance economic reform and developments in China. Foreign investorsin Hong Kong will, at the same time, benefit from the stability of China and Hong Kong.Those sceptics who have doubted China’s commitment to the open door policy nolonger can have such doubts after witnessing the implementation of our economic reforms andits achievements. I hope you will recognise that China is firmly committed to implementing theprinciple of “one country, two systems” and maintaining the prosperity and stability of HongKong, just as we have been firmly committed to the implementation of economic reform inChina. The principle of “one country, two systems” is the realisation of the spirit of ourconstitution and has become a long-term irreversible national policy. As China continues topursue its economic reform, Hong Kong’s role as the international financial centre in China willbecome more and more important. We will do our best to help maintain the existing economicsystem of Hong Kong and keep up its economic dynamism. We also hope that the internationalfinancial community will join us in our efforts to maintain Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.Ladies and gentlemen, when you come to next year’s Annual Meetings in Hong Kong, you willall see for yourselves the realisation of the principle of “one country, two systems” in HongKong. In addition, I believe that the 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings will be animpressive event as a result.BIS Review   12/1997
Ms. Phillips examines whether national financial market regulatory systemsshould be harmonised in the light of international competition   Remarks by Ms. Susan M.Phillips, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Seminaron Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored bythe International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 28/1/97.It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a topic that has become more importantin a world of global financial markets -- the matter of coordinating and harmonizing our nationalregulatory systems. On the conference agenda, the topic was phrased as a question, that is,whether we should harmonize our systems. In a sense, the question is somewhat moot -- theglobalization of the markets and the breadth of international conglomerate financial institutionsis forcing us in that direction. But I would quickly add that one definition of “harmony” is “apleasing combination of elements.” We can sing compatible and pleasant-sounding notes,without singing the same note. It is in that sense that I believe harmonization of our regulatorysystems will develop.In my comments this afternoon, I will mention some of the efforts underway inwhich the United States is working with other countries to develop more consistent supervisoryand regulatory systems, particularly for large financial conglomerates. That experience mayprovide others with ideas about how they might pursue similar efforts, either on a bilateral ormultilateral basis. Perhaps more importantly, though, I will also offer my views on where ourinterests are likely to be most similar and why and how regulators around the world are likely tocontinue working toward compatible or “harmonized” systems. Let me begin with thosethoughts.The Importance of Compatible Regulatory RegimesOne cannot have dealt with U.S. and world financial markets during the past fewdecades without being thoroughly impressed with the rapid pace of change and the manner inwhich technology and financial innovation have affected market practice. The improvements incommunications and transportation and, importantly, the gains from technology and theminiaturization of the goods we produce have fueled a growing volume of international trade.Our financial institutions, in turn, have sought constantly to find more effective and efficientways to facilitate and finance these activities, and at the same time manage the related risks. As aresult, we have seen dramatic growth in financial derivatives, strong support within the industryfor new clearinghouses and netting procedures to reduce counterparty credit risk, a growing needto clarify our laws and regulations regarding financial contracts, and financial markets that arefar more closely linked today than they were even a decade ago.In the area of bank regulation and supervision, substantial progress has been madein developing capital standards that help to ensure the financial strength of internationally activebanks and that promote greater competition. Simply put, firms in need of international financialservices will utilize domestic or foreign financial institutions to the extent their prices arecompetitive and their financial stability can be assured. As a result, regulators are recognizingthe need to harmonize laws and regulations in order to promote economic growth and to dealwith important and oftentimes increasingly complex matters that are of common interest to usall.We are recognizing also the need to enhance financial systems -- includingsupervision and regulation -- in the emerging market economies, primarily for the sake of thoseeconomies, themselves, but also because of their increasing importance in international financialBIS Review   11/1997
- 2 -markets. Indeed, G-7 leaders at their summit meeting in Lyon last summer identified this goal asan important element in efforts to promote international financial stability.That we need some level of conformity seems, I’m sure, quite clear. Otherwise,the inconsistency and incompatibility of rules and regulations across countries may make itdifficult, if not impossible, for some firms to engage in global business activities. Such barriersare detrimental to the efficiency of international trade and finance, generally.The difficulty, of course, is the precise nature and level of conformity that isnecessary to maintain an efficient and equitable world financial system. Here I submit that itmay be less important that we standardize particular banking laws and regulations, than it is forus to pursue similar goals, as we independently develop our domestic regulation and supervisorystructures. Specifically, if we apply market-based incentives in our regulatory structures, that,alone, should keep our rules sufficiently similar and compatible.We must also recognize that technology and financial innovation are permittingbanks today to become ever-more adept at avoiding regulatory barriers and other restrictions thatartificially constrain their activities. Moreover, to the extent they are effective, such restrictionscan work against local institutions, businesses, or consumers by making banks less competitiveinternationally or by withholding from their customers the benefits that competition can bring.Regulatory regimes are likely to be more effective in the long run for financial institutions andfor domestic economic growth if they are market-compatible.Areas of Common InterestsIn our roles as central bankers, bank supervisors, and regulators, what are theareas of greatest common interest to us for which we should develop compatible rules andregulations? To keep it simple, let me suggest two. First, to maintain a healthy, responsive, andfinancially strong banking and financial system will facilitate the growing needs of our domesticeconomies. Second, to build and maintain an adequate legal and regulatory structure will permitour institutions to compete safely on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis, both domesticallyand abroad. These thoughts may not sound original; they’re not. They are essentially the tworeasons the Basle Committee on Supervision exists, and they underpin most other internationalefforts to coordinate banking issues.When I consider the past successes in coordinating international bank supervisoryor regulatory policies, I think first of the Bank for International Settlements and the work of thesupervisors’ committee. After all, the BIS has been the principal forum for developinginternational supervisory standards for banks in industrialized countries and, by their voluntaryadoption, for banks and bank supervisors in other countries throughout the world. Bilateraldiscussions can also serve useful functions either where particular issues are of concern or as abasis for subsequent broader dissemination.Nearly a decade ago, such bilateral and -- through the BIS -- multilateral effortsproduced the risk-based capital standard, known as the Basle Accord. Since then, we haveproduced numerous other policy statements dealing with sound risk management practices forbanks. These statements related first to derivatives activities and most recently involve themanagement of interest rate risk. Dr. Padoa-Schioppa, chairman of the supervisors’ committee,has probably already discussed these initiatives with you.BIS Review   11/1997
- 3 -One of the Committee’s most recent accomplishments, however, is thedevelopment of new capital standards for market risk in trading activities. That standard isnotable because it reflects a new approach for constructing international banking standards. Inparticular, the internal models approach contained within that standard builds on leadingindustry practices and helps supervisors to promote risk management in banks.Promoting sound risk management is a goal we should all pursue moreaggressively in considering new banking policies and regulations. It is also the type of approachI had in mind when I said earlier that our laws and regulations should be compatible withunderlying economics and market demands. To the extent we can continue building on “best” orsound banking practices in designing our rules and regulations, we will be working toward acommon end. As we work together identifying those practices and deciding how to apply themas supervisory or regulatory standards, we will also be strengthening relations among ourselvesthat can prove invaluable in times of market stress.Not to over-use the example of the market risk standard, but it illustrates anotheruseful point, as well. Reliance on a bank’s own risk measurement and modeling process indetermining regulatory capital standards also acknowledges that no single or specific techniqueis best for everyone. Each institution should tailor its risk measurement and management processto its own needs. While adhering to basic principles, each institution must determine for itselfthe proper incentives and techniques for managing its affairs. No two banks or banking marketsare identical in their operations, structure, or historical development. Permitting a range ofcompatible responses to similar situations encourages experimentation, innovation, and growth.Accommodating a certain level of flexibility is necessary for banks, and it is necessary forregulators, too.Indeed, flexibility may be even more important for non-G-10 countries than it isfor those of us with large, developed financial systems because of the greater range of capitalmarket and economic infrastructures among developing countries. Materially different situationstypically require different solutions. Accommodating differences, though, does not reduce theneed for minimum regulatory or supervisory standards based upon well-known principles ofsound banking. It is up to supervisors and, if necessary, legislators to craft regulations and lawsconsistent with internationally recognized standards, but accommodative to local customs andeconomic needs.In developing sufficiently flexible, market-compatible regulations, I believe weshould rely as much as prudently possible on market discipline and on banks’ internal incentivesto perform well. This approach requires that the public have information about the riskexposures of banks and about their procedures for managing those risks. As regulators, we canencourage this process by requiring or prodding banks to disclose information to the marketsthat is both relevant and comparable among institutions.Whether such disclosures are imposed by official regulations or evolve throughmore subtle efforts, supervisors can help guide the process by considering carefully the kinds ofinformation the private sector needs and that banks use -- or should use -- to manage risk. Evenin the United States, where surveys show disclosure is relatively good, supervisors makeavailable to the public data collected on Call Reports.In countries where disclosure practices are minimal at best, bank regulators maybe able to perform a particularly important role by publicly disclosing some, if not much, of theinformation banks report to them. By fueling market information in this way, regulators mayBIS Review   11/1997
- 4 -stimulate greater investor interest in banks and the growth of local capital markets. Improveddisclosure practices by banks may, in turn, also spill over to other industries. One thing we knowfor sure is that investors dislike uncertainty. By shedding light on a bank’s condition and futureprospects, some of that uncertainty should disappear.While it is important that key prudential standards be sufficiently robust andconsistent among countries, certain variations in the details and applications of these standardscan be useful. As with private markets, some level of competition among regulators canstimulate improvements and change. I will grant that the United States may take regulatorycompetition to an extreme, but it also demonstrates, I believe, the advantages that derive fromaccommodating different views and permitting financial institutions alternative ways to dobusiness. In my view, and considering the political difficulties we have faced in trying to changeU.S. banking laws, our current regulatory structure, offering some choice in charter that isadministered by multiple regulators, has provided financial institutions with more freedom andexpanded powers than they would likely have received with a single regulator.Supervisors must be careful, however, as they try new or different techniques,that they do not impair their oversight efforts or relax them beyond prudent bounds. In suchglobal markets as we have today, weak or ineffective supervision in either large or smallcountries can have far reaching consequences. Those concerns were at the heart of early work ofthe Basle Committee and its efforts to identify the respective roles and responsibilities of homeand host authorities for internationally active banks. It is important for supervisors to be able torely on their counterparts in other countries to administer agreed-upon standards of financialinstitution safety and soundness.Whether we conduct our own on-site examinations, rely on external auditors, oruse combinations of other supervisory techniques, we need to assure ourselves that all bankingoffices are adequately managed and supervised. I would note here that among G-10 countries amore consistent approach may begin to emerge. We in the United States are making greater useof the findings of a bank’s internal and external auditors to guide or supplement our on-siteexaminations, while some of our counterparts abroad are recognizing more the benefits of on-site exams.Financial ConglomeratesSome of the greatest challenges to bank supervisors may arise when organizationslink banking activities with other financial or nonfinancial businesses. Such financialconglomerates, which often combine banking, insurance, and securities activities, are notcurrently allowed to provide a full array of financial services in the United States, but they maydo so abroad.The existence of such firms -- and the fact that some of them are headquartered inthis country -- have required regulators and supervisors in the United States to work withcounterparts abroad to discuss oversight arrangements and develop ways to deal with matters intimes of crises. This very issue is one of our current challenges. I have to say that this is not aparticularly quick or easy process and is further complicated by the diverse regulatory structures,both here and abroad, involving banking, securities, and sometimes insurance regulators.These discussions often raise difficult issues, since they tend to break new groundin supervision. For example, what approach should be taken regarding nonbank -- or evennonfinancial -- activities of companies that own banks? In the context of these conglomerates,BIS Review   11/1997
- 5 -what does or should “consolidated supervision” mean? Within the context of consolidatedsupervision, how can the traditional safety-and-soundness approach used by bank supervisors bereconciled with the disclosure/self-regulatory approach used by many securities regulators?Moreover, do the diverse operating structures of conglomerates imply an extension of the safetynet that virtually all governments currently extend to banks? One thing is clear: as we addressthe challenges of promoting a more consistent bank supervisory and regulatory processworldwide, we cannot always take official descriptions of regulatory and oversight regimes atface value. We need to dig deeper to understand how laws are interpreted and how individualbanking agencies monitor and enforce safe banking.Different countries necessarily have different banking and financial systems thatface unique combinations of exposures and business risks. Even within the United States, forexample, we have a relatively uniform supervisory approach for all banks and a risk-basedcapital standard that applies to them all. In practice, however, the activities of our banks, theircapital levels, and their operating practices are quite diverse, and our oversight efforts take thosedifferences into account. Small banks, themselves, recognize the greater risks they face fromtheir lack of size and diversity, and have consistently maintained higher capital ratios than domoney center banks. But they also have less formal procedures and internal controls, simplybecause their staffing and operations are so much smaller. The point is that even a uniform set ofrules within a given country can and should be implemented differently as conditions demand.ConclusionIt seems clear that as financial markets become more and more integrated, bankregulators around the world will be seeing more of each other than they have in the past. Even incountries that have no internationally active domestic banks, authorities need to ensure that thebanks operating in their markets are sound and subject to adequate supervision, whether byhome or host authorities. Banks operating imprudently and without proper supervision are theones most likely to mismeasure their risks, misprice their products, and disrupt the markets.Detecting and deterring such institutions does not require us to have uniform regulatory orsupervisory systems, but it does require a certain level of cooperation and coordination and amaterial level of consistency in our regulatory regimes. Our experience in the United Statessuggests that achieving an appropriate convergence takes time, not only to develop but tomaintain. Progress we have seen through the European Union and the BIS goes far incoordinating, or harmonizing, banking laws, regulations, and operating standards, but that’s justa start. As managers of large financial institutions develop more sophisticated and morecomprehensive risk management systems, they are paying less attention every day to the peculiarlegal structure of their organizations. As regulators, we need to understand how bankingorganizations manage and control risks and the full implications of their practices for thefinancial safety of depository institutions. By doing so, we can do much to protect our owninterests while still recognizing and accommodating the business needs of banks.In developing our laws and regulations we need to work together, for sure. Butperhaps more importantly, we need to understand the market forces and incentives that banksface. If we keep those factors in mind in developing our individual rules, we may go far indeveloping regulatory systems that are both compatible among countries and less intrusive to theinstitutions we oversee.BIS Review   11/1997
Mr. Greenspan examines the process by which former centrally plannedeconomies are embracing free markets   Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governorsof the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Woodrow Wilson Award Dinnerof the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in New York on 10/6/97.On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, symbolizing the end of anexperiment in economic and social policy that began more than four decades earlier with thedivision of the states of Western and Central Europe into market economies and those governedby state central planning.  At the end of World War II, as Winston Churchill put it, “FromStettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain ... descended across the Continent.”Aside from the Soviet Union itself, the economies on the Soviet side of the “curtain” had been,in the prewar period, similar to the market-based economies on the western side.  Over fourdecades both types of economies developed with limited interaction across the dividing line.  Itwas as close to a controlled experiment in the viability of economic systems as could ever beimplemented.The results, unequivocally in favor of market economies, have had far-reachingconsequences.  The long-standing debate between the virtues of economies organized aroundfree markets and those governed by centrally planned socialism is essentially at an end.  To besure, there are still a few who still support the old fashioned socialism -- but for the vastmajority of professed socialists it is now a highly diluted socialism, an amalgam of social equityand the efficiency of the market, often called market socialism.  The verdict on rigid centralplanning has been rendered, and it is generally appreciated to have been unequivocally negative.Over the last seven years, with the Soviet bloc books now open, we of coursehave learned much about how communist economics worked, or, more to the point, did not.  Butthe biggest surprise is what the aftermath of the four-decade experiment has been teaching usabout how and why our own Western economies and societies function, or, perhaps moreexactly, refreshing our own long-dormant memories of the process.Economists have had considerable experience this century in observing howmarket economies converted to centrally planned ones but until recently have had virtually noexposure in the opposite direction.  Ironically, in aiding in the process of implementing thelatter, we are being forced to more fully understand the roots of our own system.Much of what we took for granted in our free market system and assumed to behuman nature was not nature at all, but culture.  The dismantling of the central planning functionin an economy does not, as some had supposed, automatically establish a free marketentrepreneurial system.  There is a vast amount of capitalist culture and infrastructureunderpinning market economies that has evolved over generations: laws, conventions, behaviors,and a wide variety of business professions and practices that have no important functions in acentrally planned economy.Centrally planned economic systems, such as that which existed in the SovietUnion, had great difficulty in creating wealth and rising standards of living.  In theory, and to alarge extent in practice, production and distribution were determined by specific instructions --often in the form of state orders -- coming from the central planning agencies to the variousdifferent producing establishments, indicating from whom, and in what quantities, they shouldreceive their raw materials and services, and to whom they should distribute their final outputs.The work force was assumed to be fully employed and wages were somewhat arbitrarilypredetermined.BIS Review   64/1997
- 2 -Without an effective market clearing mechanism, the consequences of such aparadigm, as one might readily anticipate, were both huge surpluses of goods which, whileproduced, were not wanted by the populace, and huge shortages of products that consumersdesired but were not produced in adequate quantities.  The imbalance of demand over supplyinevitably required rationing or its equivalent, standing in queues for limited quantities of goodsand services.One might think that the planning authorities should have been able to adjust tothese distortions.  They tried.  But they faced insurmountable handicaps in that they did not haveaccess to the immediate signals of price changes that so efficiently clear markets in capitalisteconomies.  Just as important, they did not have the signals of finance to adjust the allocation ofphysical resources to accommodate the shifting tastes of consumers.In a centrally planned system, banking and finance play a decidedly minor role.Since the production and distribution of goods and services are essentially driven by state ordersand rationing, finance is little more than record keeping.  While there are pro-forma paymenttransfers among state-owned enterprises, few if any actions are driven by them.  Paymentarrears, or even defaults, are largely irrelevant in the sense that they are essentially transactionsamong enterprises owned by the same entity, that is, the state.  Under central planning there areno credit standards, no interest rate risks, no market value changes, that is, none of the keyfinancial signals that determine who gets credit, and who does not, and hence who produceswhat, and sells to whom, in a market economy.  In short, none of the financial infrastructurewhich converts the changing valuations of consumers into market signals that direct productionfor profit are available.  But it didn’t matter in the Soviet-bloc economies.  Few decisions inthose centrally planned systems were affected by the lack of a developed financial system.That centrally planned economies, as a consequence, were highly inefficient isbest illustrated by the fact that energy consumed per unit of output was as much as five to seventimes higher in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union than in the West.  Moreover, theexceptionally large amount of resources devoted to capital investment, without contributing tothe productive capacity of these economies, suggests that these resources were largely wasted.Regrettably, until the Berlin Wall was breached and the need to develop marketeconomies out of the rubble of Eastern Europe’s central planning regime became apparent, littlecontemporary thought had been given to the institutional infrastructure required of markets.Nonetheless, in the years immediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall many of the states ofthe former Soviet bloc did get something akin to a market system in the form of a rapid growthof black markets that replicated some of what seemingly goes on in a market economy.But only in part.  Black markets, by definition, are not supported by the rule oflaw.  There are no rights to own and dispose of property protected by the enforcement power ofthe state.  There are no laws of contract or bankruptcy, or judicial review and determinationagain enforced by the state.  The essential infrastructure of a market economy is missing.Black markets offer few of the benefits of legally sanctioned trade.  To know thatthe state will protect one’s rights to property will encourage the taking of risks that create wealthand foster growth.  Few will risk their capital, however, if there is little assurance that therewards of risk are secure from the arbitrary actions of government or street mobs.BIS Review   64/1997
- 3 -Indeed, today’s Russia is striving to rid itself of a substantial black marketintertwined with its evolving market economy.  Law enforcement in support of private propertyis uneven in its application.  Private security forces, to a large extent, have taken over protection,with results sometimes less than satisfactory.  The shift of vast real resources from the defunctSoviet state to private parties, whose claims in many instances are perceived as dubious, has notenhanced public support for the protection of such claims by official authorities.Some, but not all, would argue with the Russian academic who last month told theWashington Post that “The state thinks ... private capital should be defended by those who haveit. ...It’s a completely conscious policy of the law enforcement authorities to remove themselvesfrom defending private capital.”Certainly, if generations of Russians have been brought up on the Marxist notionthat private property is “theft,” a breakdown of the Soviet central planning infrastructure is notgoing to automatically alter the perceived moral base of its social system.  The right to propertyin market economies, on the other hand, is morally rooted in its culture.Indeed, the presumption of property ownership and the legality of its transfermust be deeply embedded in the culture of a society for free market economies to functioneffectively.  In the West and especially under British common law and its derivatives, the moralvalidity of property rights is accepted, or at least acquiesced in, by virtually the whole of thepopulation.  Accordingly, a very small proportion of contracts have to be enforced throughactions in the courts.  Moreover, reflecting a strong commitment to property rights, asurprisingly large number of contracts, especially in financial markets, are initially oral,confirmed only at a later date, and at times after much price movement, by a written document.The differing attitudes and views toward property ownership are passed fromgeneration to generation through family values and education systems.  Hence, the process offull transition from the so-called collective rights of socialist economies to the individualproperty rights of market economies and legal certainties can be expected to be slow.  Oneprominent young Russian reformer of my acquaintance thinks the transition is moving quicklyamong those under forty years of age, much less so among their elders.  Altering what a nationteaches its children is a profoundly difficult task and clearly cannot be accomplished overnight.Changing attitudes toward property and profit is not simple.  These attitudes derive from thedeepest values of personal worth people hold.Aside from property rights enforced by an impartial judiciary, for a marketeconomy to function effectively, there must also be widespread dissemination of timely financialand other relevant information.  This enables market participants to make the type of informedjudgments that foster the most efficient allocation of capital -- efficient in the sense that ourphysical resources are directed at producing those goods and services most valued by consumers.This requires a free press and government data information systems that are perceived to be freeof hidden political manipulation.Government censorship in any form renders information suspect.  Suchinformation will be disregarded by market participants as virtually useless, requiring individualsto rely on rumor and other dubious sources of information.  This leads to misjudgments aboutthe changing patterns of consumer demand and hence significantly eviscerates the market’seffectiveness and its role in directing real resources to their optimum uses.BIS Review   64/1997
- 4 -Most other rights that we Americans cherish -- protection against extra-legalviolence or intimidation by the state, arbitrary confiscation of property without due process, aswell as freedom of speech and of the press, and an absence of discrimination -- are all essentialto an effective, functioning market system.Indeed a list or bill of rights enforced by an impartial judiciary is, and I hesitate touse the analogy, what substitutes for the central planning function as the guiding mechanism of afree market economy.  It is these “rights” that enable the value judgements of millions ofconsumers to be converted through a legally protected free market into prices of products andfinancial instruments; and it is, of course, these market prices that substitute for the state ordersof the centrally planned economies.We depend on government in a free society to ensure those market “rights.”Perhaps of greater importance, those rights can also be viewed as a list of prohibitions delimitingthe actions of government.  Thus, the more effective the list is in constraining the arbitraryactions of government officials, the less it matters what they do.  The tighter the proscription ongovernment officials’ discretion, the less arbitrary government power is available to the highestbidder.The democratic process, of course, is needed to ensure that the “list of marketrights” has the continued sanction of the people.  Since any bill of rights specifies the limits towhich government officials can infringe on the rights of individuals, the rational self-interest ofthe populace is always to protect and broaden individual rights.  The self-interest of thoseofficials who have the power to exert discretionary power in areas not specifically delimited by abill of rights, is, too often, to broaden that scope.  Hence, authoritarian societies, evenbenevolent ones, are biased to restraining the rights of individuals generally and property inparticular.Clearly, not all democracies protect the private right of property with the samefervor.  Indeed, they vary widely.  Nor is it the case that all societies with firmly protectedproperty rights bend invariably to the majority will of the populace on all public issues.Certainly in its earlier years Hong Kong did not have a democratic process but a “list of rights”protected by British common law and Britain’s democracy.  Singapore, from a similar heritage,does protect property and contract rights, the crucial pillars of market efficiency, but does nothave some of the other characteristics of western democracies with which we are familiar.There are those who argue, however, that as this remarkable city-state evolves, increasing wealthwill push it toward broader freedoms.To summarize then, the ideal state of affairs for a centrally planned economy isone in which there is continuous production of the same type of goods, of the same quality, ofthe same design, obediently purchased in repetitive quantities, with cash wages backed asnecessary by rationing coupons.  Centrally planned economies are frozen in time. They cannotreadily accommodate innovation, new ideas, new products, and altered specifications.In sharp contrast, capitalist market economies are driven by what ProfessorJoseph Schumpeter, a number of decades ago, called “creative destruction.”  By this he meantnewer ways of doing things, newer products, and novel engineering and architectural insightsthat induce the continuous obsolescence and retirement of factories and equipment and areshuffling of workers to new and different activities.  Market economies in that sense arecontinuously renewing themselves.  Innovation, risk taking, and competition are the drivingforces that propel standards of living progressively higher.BIS Review   64/1997
- 5 -Thus, the bold, if unintended, experiment in economic and social systems, whichbegan after World War II in Europe, did not come to a full resting place with the fall of theBerlin Wall in 1989.  Despite the ebb and flow of governments of differing persuasions, the faceof the world economy continues to edge toward free-market-oriented societies.  This isespecially the case as increasing numbers of transition economies prosper and emerging marketeconomies wedded to free-market paradigms grow impressively.There has been, to be sure, much pain and periodic backtracking among a number of the nationsthat discarded the mantle of central planning.  There will doubtless be more.  But the experienceof the last half century clearly attests to how far the power of the idea of market freedom cancarry.BIS Review   64/1997
BIS Review   63/1997Mr. Trichet discusses Franco-German monetary cooperation and monetaryunion   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of France, M. Jean-Claude Trichet, on the occasionof the fiftieth anniversary of the Land central bank of Rheinland-Palatinate and the Saarland inMainz on 2/6/97.It is a great honour to speak in Mainz today and to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Land central bank of Rheinland-Palatinate and the Saarland. Everybodyknows that Mainz played a decisive role in spreading culture and ideas in Europe, in particularthanks to the invention of printing by Gutenberg.And the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of your institution gives me theopportunity to underline once again the prominent role played by the Bundesbank for thestability, credibility and prosperity of the German economy. As you know, the Banque de Francedeeply supports this culture of stability, which sets the basis for monetary cooperation betweenFrance and Germany, the basis for European monetary union. The celebration of an anniversaryis a good opportunity to draw lessons from the past and to foresee the future. That is why I havedecided today to speak about Franco-German monetary cooperation during the last fifty yearsand the prospects for monetary union. In this respect, the creation of the single currency onJanuary 1st, 1999 is a major event for our respective countries. Far from being a breaking offwith the past, the creation of monetary union is the logical crowning of Franco-Germanmonetary cooperation. Indeed:- Franco-German monetary cooperation is based on solid foundations and hassteadily developed during the last fifty years (1)- this cooperation will be crowned by the creation of monetary union in 1999 (2).FRANCO-GERMAN MONETARY COOPERATION IS BASED ON SOLID FOUNDATIONSAND HAS STEADILY DEVELOPED DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARSIn order not to bother you by an unduly long speech, I will focus on the last fiftyyears only! Nevertheless, one could easily demonstrate that our respective monetary historieshave been deeply linked since the Middle Ages. Indeed, Emperor Charlemagne enacted a billcreating a unit of account common to its whole empire, which enshrined most of the presentterritories of France and Germany. The global features of the system (in particular thesubdivisions) experienced an exceptional longevity of almost 1000 years.The last fifty years constitute, however, a rather homogeneous period, duringwhich Franco-German monetary cooperation really developed. First, it is useful to underline thesolid roots and foundations of this cooperation. These foundations paved the way for theemergence of a common destiny, which is best illustrated by the creation of the EMS. Thiscommunity of views and interests have been crucial in the decision to create a Europeanmonetary union and a single currency.I will first explain the solid roots and foundations on which Franco-German monetarycooperation is basedFranco-German monetary cooperation is based on historical and economicfoundations.The historical roots of Franco-German monetary cooperation can easily beidentified.
- 2 -BIS Review   63/1997Both countries had first to rebuild the whole economy in 1945, in a period whensacrifices were difficult to impose on populations. Germany tackled these disturbances rapidlyand efficiently. The monetary reform implemented in 1948, aimed at definitively eradicatinginflation, paved the way for monetary stability and economic prosperity. A new currency  - theDeutschemark - was introduced, and a strong and independent central bank was founded.France followed a similar strategy with the creation of the “nouveau franc” or“new franc”, whose nominal value was 100 “anciens francs” or “old francs”. This reformcontributed to stabilizing the French currency, which did not experience any devaluation for tenyears.In 1971, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the currency instabilitywhich followed convinced European Governments that an exchange rate system had to be set up.The first experience, known as the Snake, was not completely successful, but was the first steptowards a common monetary destiny between European countries.As far as economic foundations are concerned, our two economies have beenincreasingly interlinked for decades.First of all, the various obstacles to foreign trade in Europe have beenprogressively lifted. Indeed, the Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 aimed at creating a commonmarket. The removal of all sorts of barriers to trade proved nevertheless difficult to achieve.That is why the European authorities felt that another step was indispensable, and signed theSingle Act in 1987. By now all persons, goods, services and capital can move freely from onecountry to another. This is the case for France and Germany.Trade is a good example of this integration. The share of French imports comingfrom Germany is currently about 19%, while the share of German imports coming from Franceis about 15%. Each country is the other's first trading partner. Beyond these gross figures, it isinteresting to note that this trade is largely made of complementary goods as opposed tosubstitutable goods, thus increasing interdependence.This interdependence is not only commercial, it is more generallymacroeconomic. Econometric work has indeed shown that French and German GDPs are closelycorrelated. This means that national economic policies cannot deviate excessively from eachother.These foundations progressively convinced France and Germany that they needed a commonmonetary destinyAs I said earlier, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system led EuropeanGovernements to organize monetary relations between each other. France and Germany wereamong the most prominent actors in this strategy. I personally see two main elements in thiscommon destiny: the creation of the European monetary system (EMS) in 1979 and theemergence of a conceptual convergence between our two countries as regards monetary issues.The creation of the European Monetary System in March 1979 highlights bestthe cooperation between France and Germany. The EMS not only provided exchange ratestability through the setting-up of formal fluctuation bands between currencies; it also organizeda monetary solidarity between countries, by providing compulsory interventions and relatedfinancing facilities.
- 3 -BIS Review   63/1997Although the very first years of the EMS were characterized by several currencyrealignments, due to insufficient nominal convergence between countries, the systemprogressively contributed to exchange rate stability. German monetary policy, based on stabilityand credibility, proved to be efficient. In this context, the French authorities fully endorsed theobjectives and disciplines of the EMS and embarked on monetary and exchange rate stability.The years that followed were characterized by increasing convergence betweencountries and fewer realignments. All countries, including new participants in the system,adopted similar strategies. Although satisfactory in theory, this stance was nevertheless difficultto follow for some economies still facing imbalances, and in particular a lack ofcompetitiveness.This explains partly the crises that occurred in 1992 and 1993. I cannot forgethow efficient Franco-German cooperation was during this difficult period.This concrete cooperation has also been made possible by the emergence of aconceptual convergence as regards monetary issues. Since 1987, the central rate of the Frenchfranc within the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) has been unchanged, and a virtuousdisinflation process has been taking place. This policy has allowed French short-term andlong-term interest rates to decline steadily and to stand at similar levels to those reached by thebest performers within the EMS. And a consensus has emerged in France that monetary policyshould be shielded from short-term influences and short-termist strategies and placed in theframework of a medium and long-term strategy of credibility.In this respect, a decisive step was the decision to grant independence to theBanque de France in late 1993. This reform was based on a new perception by the Frenchpopulace of the role of a central bank in a developed country. The last three years have shownthat independence was not merely a theoretical concept; the Banque de France has adopted itsmonetary policy and has made its own decisions, according to the law without any interferencefrom the Government. The Banque de France has steadily increased its credibility among marketparticipants and other observers.The stability culture that has developed in France during the last decade is deeplyrooted in French society itself. A strong consensus now exists in favour of a stable currencybacked by an independent central bank and contributing to preserving the purchasing power ofthe currency, and thereby the purchasing power of citizens.That is why Franco-German monetary cooperation made the case for European monetary unionmore obviousIndeed it is clear that a single market is more efficient if it is backed byexchange-rate stability. Excessive exchange-rate volatility and misalignments are invisiblebarriers to trade, since they increase uncertainty and create inappropriate and erratic competitivefluctuations. Moreover, in an environment characterized by free capital movements, isolatedmonetary strategies are made more difficult. There is thus a need for monetary coordination,whose ultimate form is the creation of a monetary union and a single currency. France andGermany have had no difficulty in understanding this development and are deeply involved inthe preparatory work for EMU.The Maastricht Treaty contains clear and efficient monetary provisions by settingspecific deadlines for the creation of a single currency and by organizing three separate stages
- 4 -BIS Review   63/1997for this process. These stages allow for a progressive but logical move to monetary union, whichensures that the single currency will rest on solid foundations.Moreover, the independence of the European System of Central Banks, made upof the European Central Bank and national central banks which is fully warranted by the Treaty,will guarantee price stability and the credibility of the single currency.Last, the Treaty allows for a balanced policy mix based on an independentmonetary policy and appropriate fiscal discipline (in this respect, the stability and growth pact isa useful “user guide” to the provisions of the Treaty and not a new constraint coming fromnowhere).We are now in the implementation phase of the monetary provisions of theMaastricht Treaty. The concrete preparations of monetary union are the responsibility of theEuropean Monetary Institute. The preparatory work is well on track and will allow the ESCBto perform its tasks right from the start of Stage Three in January 1999; moreover, the EMI isoften consulted by other European authorities, who pay careful attention to the advice itprovides; this was notably the case for the changeover scenario adopted by the Heads of Stateand of Government in Madrid in December 1995, and for the elaboration of draft regulationsconcerning the legal framework for the use of the euro. Here again, France and Germany areplaying a very active role in these preparations, and as early as tomorrow I will meet PresidentTietmeyer in Frankfurt, together with our colleagues, to attend the monthly EMI Councilmeeting.FRANCO-GERMAN MONETARY COOPERATION WILL ULTIMATELY BE CROWNEDBY THE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION IN 1999I am personally convinced that the creation of monetary union in 1999 is thelogical consequence of economic, monetary and financial developments that have been takingplace during the past years. The increasing integration of the European economies - and inparticular those of France and Germany - called for a single monetary policy and a singlecurrency.I am also convinced that monetary union will successfully go through, right from1999 since:- it is a credible process;- it will create an environment of stability.EMU is a credible processIndeed, the case for a European monetary union is based on solid economicgrounds, and it will be implemented in a realistic way.EMU is not just some abstract concept dreamed up by a few people. It is based onsolid economic grounds. When the exchange rate stability provided by the Bretton Woodssystem and by the barriers between national financial markets disappeared in the 1970s, anumber of European governments became progressively convinced of the need for a singlecurrency. The Maastricht Treaty is indeed the result of past major initiatives, such as the WernerReport in 1970 and the Delors report in 1989.
- 5 -BIS Review   63/1997The removal of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade has made Europe thelargest market in the world. The EU accounts for 21% of total world trade, against 17% for theUS and 10% for Japan. The benefits of the sheer size of the Single Market are plain to see. Theallocation of savings and investments is more efficient, competition is stronger, and the greaterliquidity of financial markets makes more capital available at lower cost to finance profitableventures.No doubt the European Monetary System and its Exchange Rate Mechanism havehelped curb exchange rate instability and eradicate the inflation culture that prevailed in somecountries; yet the current level of economic and business integration calls for the Europeans totake a further step towards monetary integration, for the benefit of all European economic agentsand citizens.The benefits of the single currency are clear. It will reduce uncertainty andfacilitate production and investment decisions. It will make price comparisons across Europemore transparent and reduce transaction costs. In addition, the single currency area will enjoyprice stability and sound public finances, which will lead to a high level of confidence and tolow market interest rates. Last but not least, the euro will be a major international currency andthis will facilitate international monetary cooperation.EMU is not only based on solid economic grounds. It is also a realistic economicprocess. EMU is based on convergence criteria which have to be met on a sustainable basis. Thefulfilment of the convergence criteria is not only a legal condition for participating in EMU but,of course, corresponds to the sound policy management which is in the interest of all MemberStates.I am convinced that EMU will create an environment of stabilityI know how important the concept of stability is to the German people. Thisculture of stability, which explains to a large extent the economic success of your country, isshared by many Governments, central banks and citizens all over Europe, not least in France.I know that the German people have expressed some qualms about thedisappearance of the Deutschemark and its replacement by the euro. But I will try to convinceyou that the euro will be as stable as the Deutschemark, as stable as the French franc today, forthe sake of European economic prosperity and growth. Indeed, EMU will contribute toreinforcing stability in Europe. EMU will bring legal, fiscal and monetary stability.EMU requires a sound legal basis to foster the credibility of the changeover to thesingle currency. The Madrid European Council asked the Commission to prepare a draft Councilregulation on the legal framework for the use of the euro.This regulation is of the utmost importance. Market participants need legalcertainty, not only as regards the new instruments in euro, but also as regard the continuity ofinstruments denominated in the former national currencies or in ECU. Besides financial markets,legal certainty is also important for citizens, as the emergence of a new currency is inevitably, atthe first stage, a source of uncertainties. In this respect, technical preparatory work on the legal framework for theuse of the euro is almost achieved. The European regulations that have been drafted and shouldbe endorsed by the European Council in Amsterdam clearly state that the euro will be the
- 6 -BIS Review   63/1997currency of the European monetary union as from the 1.1.1999 . As a consequence, the nationalcurrencies, in particular notes and coins, will continue to circulate during a transitional period, assubdivisions of the euro. Two other key elements are that the changeover will ensure thecontinuity of existing contracts denominated either in national currencies or in ECU and that theECU will become the euro at a rate of 1 to 1.Besides legal security, EMU will reinforce monetary stability in Europe.The Maastricht Treaty provides for a monetary framework very similar to thatprevailing in Germany and in France. The primary objective of the European System of CentralBanks (made up of the European Central Bank and national central banks) will be price stability.The ECB Council of Governors (only those of countries participating in monetary union) willdecide independently the level of official interest rates. Representatives of the European Councilmay attend the ECB Council meetings, but they will not participate in the voting procedure.Monetary union will be characterized by a single monetary policy and nationalfiscal policies. In this context, the issue of fiscal discipline and coordination is crucial. Soundfiscal policies will help the ESCB to maintain price stability. Coordinated fiscal policies willcontribute to a balanced policy mix in Europe. Fiscal discipline will prevent free-rider strategiesby countries running large deficits and raising funds at low interest rates, thanks to thecredibility and stability of other countries.This question of European fiscal discipline is important in the context of the maincriticisms which are presently enumerated, particularly from outside Europe, in the analysis ofthe concept of EMU. Without being exhaustive in this listing, I personally see four majorcriticisms:First, it is sometimes argued that EMU will lead to greater rigidity, in divertingattention from the necessary structural reforms and inducing an inward-looking posture overEurope at the very moment when global competition is of the essence.Secondly, the difficulty of delivering an appropriate “policy-mix”, the monetarypolicy being by definition concentrated in the hands of the ECB and the ESCB when, at thesame time, the absence of a federal government and therefore of a federal budget leaves thefiscal policy of the Union in the hands of 15 different governments.Thirdly, the difficulty of absorbing “shocks” in a particular member economy,whether this shock is of a domestic or an external nature. This difficulty stems in particular fromthe absence of the automatic stabilizers of fiscal transfers because there is no federal budget.Fourthly, it is stressed that there are important costs associated with the transitiontowards EMU, namely the necessity to reduce overall fiscal deficits in the run-up to the singlecurrency in accordance with the Maastricht fiscal criteria and the necessity to embark on anexcessively tough monetary policy after the creation of the single currency to ensure the globalcredibility of the ECB, which in this view will start from scratch.Let me respond to these criticisms and try to demonstrate that the Europeans haveembarked upon a coherent economic and monetary strategy, responding as accurately as possibleto the various questions I have just listed and paying due attention to the special nature of theEuropean endeavour.
- 7 -BIS Review   63/1997As regards the first criticism, which I call the “diverting from structural reform”argument, I really think that it rests on a misunderstanding of the very nature of the MonetaryUnion: the essence of EMU is the completion of the single market, which has been one of theboldest structural reforms ever launched in industrialized countries. On top of the commonmarket which was the initial concept of the Treaty of Rome, the single market is marshalling theelimination of all non-tariff barriers, of all those barriers that are of a structural nature and arehampering the smooth circulation of goods, services and capital throughout the European Union.In order to meet the single market targets, workshops have been set up everywhere in Europe inall sectors of the economy and in all capitals to embark on the modernization and harmonizationof regulations of all kinds. It is a major medium-term endeavour and an indispensable economicimpetus to foster competition, economic growth and job creation throughout the single market.In this perspective, the single currency appears as the last decisive messier for thecompletion of the single market, eliminating the last barriers that still exist within the EuropeanUnion: no more additional costs for transactions, no more exchange risks, either justifiable ornot amenable to appropriate hedging, and no more costs associated with these hedgingmechanisms. Throughout the single market, there will be the same visibility of all prices, thuspermitting immediate price comparisons, cost comparisons and therefore fostering competitionin all markets.My conclusion on this point is that the single currency will not prevent Europefrom embarking on eliminating economic rigidities, inducing market flexibilities and generatingmeasures to cope efficiently and successfully with global competition. On the contrary, thesingle currency endeavour will help foster the structural reforms that are needed in Europe toimprove growth prospects and job creation and counter unemployment.The second and third criticisms are based upon the argument that the Europeanswill not set up an optimum currency area like the US because of the absence of a federalgovernment and a federal budget and therefore that there is no possibility of ensuring anappropriate consolidated fiscal policy and ensuring shock absorption through automaticstabilizing transfers.In my eyes, the Maastricht Treaty gives a pertinent response to these pertinentquestions. The thrust of the spirit and of the letter of the Treaty is that everything is done toconstruct the euro area as an optimum currency area.First by ensuring that it incorporates economies that have already proved beingconvergent in the fiscal field as well as in the monetary and financial fields. This is why theso-called five Maastricht criteria are important. Not only can one expect that a particulareconomy meeting the five criteria is clearly eligible to belong to a currency area composed ofother economies with the same fiscal, monetary and financial features but one can also expectthat the business cycles in these economies are likely to be largely synchronized.Convergence from the very beginning of the single currency is a necessarycondition to create an optimum currency area. But convergence is not only necessary at themoment of the selection of member economies. It is also necessary afterwards in what we couldcall the permanent regime of the euro. And then the stability and growth pact is of the essence. Itcalls for each country to remain in a sound position as regards its fiscal behaviour.There is a paradox enshrined in the stability and growth pact: implementing theMaastricht Treaty provisions, including sanctions vis-à-vis past behaviour, it places more power
- 8 -BIS Review   63/1997in the hands of the „centre“, which is in that case the Council, say Brussels, vis-à-vis memberstates than is the case, for example, for the US government vis-à-vis Texas or California.The absence of a significant federal budget and the absence of a federalgovernment have driven the Europeans to embark upon a direct coordination of their nationalfiscal postures, through direct peer pressures and decisions within the Council of Ministers.This very bold construction, which has no worldwide equivalent in the world, willsimultaneously permit through the decision-making process that has been decided in Dublin:- to ensure that we have a sound consolidated fiscal policy at the level of the euroarea even without a federal budget,- and to ensure that each particular economy reloads the fiscal cannon in order tobe able to cope with domestic or external shocks even without the automatic stabilizers of thetransfers built into a federal budget.Ensuring a sound consolidated fiscal policy at the level of the Union andreloading the fiscal cannon at the level of national economies are the two major goals of thestability and growth pact monitored by the Stability Council and decided, in accordance with theTreaty, by the Council itself.As regards the costs associated with the transition towards the euro, which werethe fourth major criticism, I will confine myself to two main remarks relating to the fiscal side aswell as to the monetary side.From a European perspective, the strategies of fiscal retrenchment that have beendecided within the European Union are to be implemented in any event, whether the MaastrichtTreaty existed or not. There is no doubt that even in a pure, selfish, domestic approach in each ofthe European countries, meeting the fiscal criteria would be welcome for the sake of theeconomy, for the sake of the appropriate financing of the competitive sector, for the sake of thecredibility of the signature of the State, for the sake of the confidence in the currency andtherefore for the sake of growth, job creation and the fight against unemployment. All Europeangovernments are saying that Maastricht or no Maastricht, they would pursue their sound fiscalpolicies and strategies.In the case of France, the proof is even easier. For it was in June 1982 that Franceadopted the 3 % rule, on the basis of a multipartisan consensus and for domestic reasons, tenyears before the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.As regards the monetary side of the coin, shall I also say that we in the Banque deFrance would pursue exactly the same kind of monetary policy based on low inflation, exchangerate stability, a high level of credibility and confidence, and therefore a low level of long-terminterest rates. Implementing what our law says, namely price stability, through exchange ratestability and the monitoring of our domestic monetary aggregates, the French independentcentral bank would meet spontaneously on pure domestic considerations the three Maastrichtcriteria that are in our monetary and financial domain, namely a low level of inflation, a lowlevel of long-term market rates and exchange rate stability.For these reasons, I see no extra cost associated with the fiscal and monetarypolicies that are consistent with progress towards monetary union.
- 9 -BIS Review   63/1997The question of the costs associated with the launching of the ECB and the ESCBis also important. The question arises only to the extent that the ECB is supposed to start fromscratch and has to build credibility on its own. But it is certainly not the spirit nor the letter ofthe Maastricht Treaty; it is certainly not the very nature of the monetary concept of the singlecurrency.The single currency is neither supposed to start from scratch, nor to result fromthe averaging of the various currencies that exist within the European Union. It must clearly andit will according to the convergence concept, have the legacy of the most credible and solidcurrencies participating in the ERM mechanism. The euro, in any case, must be as solid andcredible as are the most credible currencies in Europe.**   *In conclusion, I would like to make three points- Firstly, it is not only monetary union that we are preparing actively, but alsoeconomic union, i.e. political union in the economic field. We should not forget that the Treatyitself provides for a higher degree of political union than is usually acknowledged, with theconcept of coordination of economic policies and the provisions for fiscal discipline andsanctions. The stability and growth pact grants important powers to the Council - i.e. the Councilof national Governments which is the equivalent in Europe of a federal government in a politicalfederation.- Secondly, one should not underestimate the degree of monetary stability alreadyachieved by European countries. Monetary stability is not only a project for the future, it isalready a major achievement in many European countries. For example, seven countries havebeen participating in the ERM without any change in their central parities for more than tenyears.- Thirdly, it is a false perception to view the necessary fiscal consolidation andmonetary stability as constraints imposed by the Maastricht Treaty against the very interests ofEuropean countries. We would be implementing the same economic policies if there were noMaastricht Treaty, since they are based on some principles of sound economic managementwhich are necessary to create jobs and tackle the problem of unemployment.Finally, economic and monetary union and the creation of the euro will crowneconomic and monetary cooperation between European countries, notably France and Germanywhich are the two pillars of it, and will foster prosperity, stability and peace in the EuropeanUnion.
Mr. Matsushita comments on recent monetary and economic conditions in Japanand the reform of the financial markets   Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan,Mr. Yasuo Matsushita, at the Kisaragi-kai Meeting in Tokyo on 14/4/97.I. IntroductionI am greatly honored to have been invited today to address this distinguished audience. Iwould like to take this opportunity to first discuss recent monetary and economic conditions in Japan andissues regarding the financial system. I would then like to discuss the Bank of Japan’s views on financialmarket reform in Japan, the subject of heated discussion since Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the“Big Bang” deregulation package for Japan on November 11, 1996. The financial markets constitute the infrastructure supporting a nation’s economy, andthus their efficient and stable functioning is essential to the promotion of unhindered economic growth inthe long term. Accordingly, market reform has become an urgent issue in Japan, as the financial marketsseem to be losing international competitiveness. However, various arguments are being heard on the paceand the potential side effects of the reform. Bearing these arguments in mind, I wish to return to thebasics of market reform and discuss why a reform is currently needed in Japan and the approach to betaken in promoting the reform.II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in JapanA. The Strength of Economic Recovery I would like to start by examining the strength of the self-sustained economic recoveryover the past several years. According to the Economic Planning Agency, the current economic recovery began inOctober 1993, and has continued for about three and a half years. The recovery, however, has not beenconstant, and therefore, many people may not have been able to appreciate the true strength of therecovery.In fact, the growth rate of the economy remained low at around 1 percent even after1993, and there were concerns about the occurrence of a deflationary spiral at one time in 1995. Thisextremely slow pace of economic recovery was due to the fact that the Japanese economy had toovercome various structural adjustment pressures - that is, pressures to reduce the burdens created by thebursting of the economic “bubble” and pressures to adapt to a new global economic environment. Since 1996, however, the recovery in real economic activity has finally become evident. Looking at  GDP growth in 1996, the contribution of fiscal expenditures, which had beenlarge at the beginning of the year, gradually decreased. At the same time, the pace of decline in netexports (exports in excess of imports) slowed, and domestic private demand, such as business fixedinvestment and personal consumption, showed steady growth. Owing mostly to the increase in domesticprivate demand, GDP in the fourth quarter of 1996 grew by 2.9 percent over the same period of theprevious year, despite the negative contribution by public works. The key to the realization of a self-sustained economic recovery is the sustainability ofrecovery in domestic private demand. In this respect, there have been concerns that the recovery inbusiness fixed investment might be due in large part to the temporary increase in investment in thetelecommunications industry. Equally, there have been concerns that growth in housing investment andpersonal consumption might have been caused mainly by the boost in demand ahead of the rise in theconsumption tax rate in fiscal 1997. BIS Review   61/1997
- 2 -These issues must be examined from various points of view when judging the economicoutlook for the current fiscal year. I would, however, like to emphasize here that a virtuous circle ofdemand, production, and income has gradually come into operation from the latter half of 1996. During the first half of 1996, increase in demand did not bring about significantimprovement in production, as the increase was offset by growth in imports and inventory adjustment. Inthe latter half of the year, however, the decline in external demand halted due to the depreciation of theyen, and, in addition, inventory adjustment progressed. As a result, the increase in final demand wasreflected fully in production growth. In fact, the year-to-year growth rate of production improved fromless than 1 percent in the first half of 1996 to 4.4 percent in the latter half of 1996, a level consistent withthe growth in demand. The increase in production appears to have led to a recovery in business fixedinvestment and employment in the latter half of 1996, through increased corporate profits. This virtuouscircle of demand, production, and income brightens the prospects for a sustained recovery in domesticprivate demand.The strength of recovery, however, is different in each economic sector. According to theresults of the March 1997 “Tankan - Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,” whileincreased corporate profits have been stimulating increases in business fixed investment, they have not tothe same extent led to increased consumption through improved employment and wage conditions. Inaddition, while business fixed investment by large firms continues to increase, recovery in the levels ofinvestment by smaller firms has not yet gained strength.While several factors remain uncertain, the Bank of Japan judges that the economicrecovery has gradually been firming since autumn 1996, on the basis of the developments in theeconomic growth rate and its determining factors, and the strengthening of the virtuous circle.B. Future Economic and Price Developments, and Monetary Policy Management The Bank will pay close attention to whether the self-sustained recovery of privatedemand from fiscal 1996 will further strengthen, leading to a firm recovery of the economy despite thedownward pressures of fiscal tightening. The developments in the financial markets indicate considerable concern on the part ofmarket participants as to the firmness of economic recovery. Long-term interest rates continued todecline from autumn 1996 and have recently been at a historic low of 2.1 to 2.2 percent. Stock prices fellsharply at the beginning of the year with no significant improvement thereafter. The results of the March1997 Tankan also indicated that while firms were confident about their business outlook in terms ofexpected sales and profits, they had little expectation of an improvement in business conditions in thesecond quarter.The low level of confidence in the economic outlook may be attributed to a variety ofcauses. The renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions and itseffects on the economy may be one factor. With regard to economic developments in the short-term,however, the most significant factors are likely to be the concerns over the downward pressures of fiscaltightening. The Bank has not yet detected any clear signs of such downward pressures, and intendsto continue examining the possible effects of fiscal tightening. There appear to be, however, several goodreasons not to be too pessimistic.Regarding fiscal tightening, public works are not to be cut drastically in the new fiscalyear, but rather, have already been reduced gradually from the latter half of 1996. Despite the decline inpublic works, domestic private demand has continued to expand, supported in part by the improvementin external demand. BIS Review   61/1997
- 3 -With regard to the rise in the consumption tax rate, it may have two different types ofimpact: (1) in the short term, the rise may induce an increase in demand ahead of its implementation anda subsequent reaction after the rate change; and (2) in the longer term, it may fundamentally affectconsumer behavior. As to the short-term influence, this may have made a certain contribution to the recentimprovement in economic indicators such as increased automobile sales and department store sales. FromApril, therefore, it is likely that there will be some reaction against the increase. From the viewpoint ofachieving a self-sustained economic recovery, however, what matters is how the increase in theconsumption tax rate will fundamentally change consumer behavior through a decline in the purchasingpower of households. The degree of the change will depend largely on consumer confidence and wageconditions. In this respect, the recent improvement in employment and wage conditions, though modest,is encouraging.Nevertheless, a temporary slowdown in economic recovery is likely as the various effectsof fiscal tightening will be seen most strongly between now and summer. The Bank, however, is also ofthe view that the current trend of recovery is likely to be maintained owing to the recent strengthening ofthe virtuous circle in the economy. In this respect, the Bank will continue to monitor closely economicdevelopments, especially consumer behavior. Turning to recent price developments, it has become increasingly clear that prices havestopped declining since the end of 1996, following an improvement in the domestic supply and demandconditions and a rise in import prices. While the decline in crude oil prices makes it unlikely that importprices will rise further, putting additional upward pressures on domestic prices, the Bank will continue tomonitor price developments closely, including the effects of the depreciation of the yen. If I should mention one point about the recent foreign exchange developments, it is thatthe Bank’s thinking is based on the Group of Seven agreement that exchange rates should reflecteconomic fundamentals and that excess volatility is undesirable. While refraining from commenting onspecific exchange rate levels, the Bank will continue to carefully watch foreign exchange ratedevelopments, which have recently shown rather rapid movements. Returning to the subject of prices, the raising of the consumption tax rate in April will bereflected in product prices, pushing up the price index accordingly. It would not be appropriate toformulate monetary policy against such a one-time, superficial price adjustment. The issue of concern iswhether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes taking advantage of the rise or will lead toinflationary expectations, which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of thetax rate increase. The Bank will also continue to monitor price developments carefully from thisviewpoint, with particular attention given to the underlying domestic supply and demand conditions andconsumer confidence. In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue tomonitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation foreconomic recovery.III. Issues Regarding the Financial System I would now like to move on to the issues regarding the financial system. From the endof fiscal 1996 to the beginning of fiscal 1997, a number of banks announced their intention to front-loadtheir schedule of writing off nonperforming loans and to revise their business results for fiscal 1996downward accordingly. On April 1, Nippon Credit Bank announced a comprehensive restructuringpackage, and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank announced their plan to merge in pursuit ofmore efficient management. These developments indicate the determination of Japanese financialinstitutions to adapt to the far-reaching reform of Japan’s financial system, which I will discuss later,while continuing to strive to promptly resolve their nonperforming loans. BIS Review   61/1997
- 4 -I would therefore like to discuss the implications that the decisions of Nippon CreditBank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank may have for Japan’s financial system as a whole and for thenonperforming-loan problem with which the system is burdened. Let me first explain the circumstances which led these banks to take such drastic actions.In recent years, significant progress has been made in the disposal of nonperforming loans by majorfinancial institutions including city banks, long-term credit banks, and trust banks. As a result of activeprovisioning and write-offs, in fact, most banks already have a clear prospect of completing the disposalwithin a year or two. Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, however, have tended to fall behindothers due to the large amount of nonperforming loans they hold relative to their financial strength.Needless to say, it has been believed that both banks could dispose of the nonperforming loans over anextended period of time. However, with the financial markets about to undergo a drastic change, financialinstitutions that will require time to solve their nonperforming loan problem will unavoidably be placedunder serious constraints as they try to survive the reform. With this in mind, domestic and overseasmarket participants have begun to scrutinize the financial conditions of Japanese financial institutionswith increasing severity since the beginning of the year. In this context, the two banks were urged to setforth restructuring plans which are comprehensive enough to remove the sources of uncertainty in themarket. Nippon Credit Bank announced a plan which includes thorough restructuring,comprehensive disposal of nonperforming loans, and reinforcement of the capital base. Private financialinstitutions which have direct capital or business interest in Nippon Credit Bank have been asked toparticipate in the capital subscription to the bank. The capital which cannot be obtained from privatefinancial institutions will be supplemented by the New Financial Stabilization Fund through theunderwriting of preferred shares. This will be carried out using the outstanding amount which has beencontributed to the Fund by the Bank of Japan. In this respect, the restructuring plan of Nippon CreditBank involves public support. We at the Bank believe that Nippon Credit Bank is by no means insolvent,and that it is fully capable of reconstructing its financial position. We have at the same time determinedthat the entire financial system might be adversely influenced should the implementation of thecomprehensive measures to solve the financial problems of Nippon Credit Bank be delayed, and shouldmarket confidence in the bank not be maintained or restored. Based on this judgment and in light of theobjective of the Fund - which is to “enhance the stability of and global confidence in our country’sfinancial system” - the Bank deemed it appropriate to utilize the New Financial Stabilization Fund toreinforce the capital base of Nippon Credit Bank. Meanwhile, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank announced a plan to merge with Hokkaido Bank,also based in the Hokkaido region, with a view to becoming a so-called super-regional bank with a stablecustomer base in the Hokkaido region and with operations in a geographically larger area in the rest ofJapan. As part of the planned merger, they announced a management strategy to strengthen the financialbase, improve customer services, and thus contribute to invigorating the regional economy. Although the cases of Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are different,one involving public support and the other a commercial solution, the approaches taken by the two banksin coping with their problems have points in common. First, both banks are to implement far-reaching restructuring measures in terms of theiroperation, personnel, and branches, which are unprecedented for major Japanese banks. The plansadopted by the two banks would be comparable to the drastic restructuring measures adopted by U.S.commercial banks in the latter half of the 1980s and in the early 1990s to solve their managementproblems. Second, both banks plan to withdraw from overseas operations. Nippon Credit Banksubsequently announced an agreement on business collaboration with Bankers Trust of the United States.BIS Review   61/1997
- 5 -We at the Bank are strongly encouraged by these initiatives because they indicate a significant shift fromthe conventional strategy pursued to date by major Japanese banks, and will contribute significantly tothe smooth implementation of the two banks’ restructuring packages. The common aspects of the two cases illustrate the determination of Japanese financialinstitutions to renovate themselves in order to adapt positively to the changing financial environment. AsI shall discuss later, the Japanese financial system is undergoing a drastic change in preparation for the21st century. These two cases reflect the fact that managements are seriously reconsidering theirstrategies, freeing themselves from their traditional way of thinking, through identifying areas ofcomparative advantage and improving customer services.The measures taken by the two banks represent significant steps toward the resolution ofnonperforming loans. The disposal of nonperforming loans by Nippon Credit Bank will reach a levelcomparable to other major banks. In addition, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank will beable to complete the disposal of their nonperforming loans much faster than they would have separately,for the merger will greatly enhance efficiency through such measures as reorganization and consolidationof branch network and elimination of redundant investment.The decisions of the two banks are thus expected to contribute significantly to removinguncertainties from, and ensuring domestic and international confidence in the Japanese financial system.At the same time, the Bank believes that the proposed measures are of great significance in the sense thatthey represent voluntary action taken by financial institutions in preparation for the fundamental reformof the Japanese financial system.IV. Financial Market ReformA. The Necessity for Market Reform I would now like to move on to the other theme of my speech, financial market reform inJapan. Specific measures of the Big Bang deregulation package for Japan are currently under deliberationin the relevant councils. I would therefore like to discuss the fundamental points of this issue, such aswhy a reform of the financial markets and the financial system is currently needed, and the approach tobe taken in promoting the reform. Today, financial innovations are in progress around the world, and new financialinstruments and transactions are being developed one after another. At the same time, however, theJapanese financial markets seem to be losing international competitiveness. This is the main reason themarkets need to be reformed. Failure to heighten competitiveness would result in the hollowing out ofthe Japanese financial markets, eventually threatening the sound development of the Japanese economy. Since the 1980s, Japan has gradually deregulated the financial sector. Interest rates ondeposits have been liberalized, and banks and securities companies have been permitted to enter into eachother’s fields of business through subsidiaries. During this period, however, the Tokyo market has fallenfar behind the New York and London markets in its ability to develop diverse financial instruments andservices. This is partly because Japanese financial institutions had to divert much of their energy to thedisposal of nonperforming loans, a burden created by the bursting of the economic “bubble.” It is alsoattributable to the conventional frameworks of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system,which have been left unchanged despite the rapidly changing financial environment, making it difficult todevelop and introduce new financial instruments and services. Globally, the most conspicuous change in the financial markets in recent years has beenthe rapid progress in financial innovations, reflecting the development of computer and communicationstechnology. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitization have made it possible tounbundle risks - namely, credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk - of conventionalBIS Review   61/1997
- 6 -financial instruments such as loans and bonds, and trade these risks individually or as variouscombinations of risks. The risks traded through the new financial instruments are no different from thoseoriginally incorporated in the conventional financial products. However, the range of services thatfinancial institutions can provide has expanded significantly as it has become possible to trade only therisks without paying for or delivering the underlying asset.Conventional financial services, for example, focused on the flow of funds, that is,investment and financing, of firms and households. In comparison, recent financial services place greateremphasis on analyzing the overall risks of the assets and liabilities of firms to hedge those risks or to takenew risks. The services can thus be elaborately tailored to the specific financial conditions of individualcustomers. In other words, it has become possible for firms and households to manage their portfoliosefficiently and more flexibly by utilizing custom-made services based on advice from financialinstitutions. The words derivatives and securitization may sound irrelevant to households, but they havein fact increased opportunities for households to efficiently manage their assets and liabilities, byexpanding the range of assets in which pension trusts and investment trusts can be invested indirectlythrough institutional investors, and by increasing the range of instruments which can be accessed directlyby households. Along with the progress in financial innovations, advances in computer andcommunications technology are further promoting financial globalization. Today, firms and institutionalinvestors around the world are not only transferring funds frequently across borders, but are alsoaccessing financial markets worldwide on a daily basis in pursuit of the best means to control risk. Interms of technical capability at least, by utilizing computer networks, even firms that are small in scalecan solicit funds directly from overseas investors and individuals can deal directly with overseas financialinstitutions. Availability of diverse financial services to meet the potential needs of firms andhouseholds provides the basis for revitalizing the financial sector as a growth industry. Countries aroundthe world have recognized the financial sector as a high growth industry, and for this reason they havebeen vying with each other in the reform of their domestic financial markets. The Big Bang implementedin the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s was in fact aimed at strengthening the financial sector as theleading industry of the country’s economy by attracting back to London financial transactions that hadshifted to the United States. The development and introduction of diverse financial services is becoming increasinglyimportant in Japan as well, given the changes in the flow of capital in Japan and abroad. With theaccumulation of personal assets and the need to prepare for the aging of society, there is a growingdemand in the household sector for diversification of assets and risks, while the corporate sector iswaiting for the emergence of venture businesses to lead growth industries and the establishment of newchannels to facilitate the supply of capital to such businesses. There is concern, however, as to whether the Japanese financial markets have thecapacity to create financial services and instruments which can satisfy the various needs of the corporateand household sectors. The conventional framework of the Japanese financial system has divided the industry bytype of business, entrusted each type of business to specialized financial institutions, and prohibitedinstitutions from entering into other types of business. The majority opinion is that this institutionalsegmentation of financial businesses was effective in supplying capital to priority industries during thepostwar reconstruction period and the era of high economic growth. With the rapidly expanding scope offinancial services and the diversifying needs of users, however, the appropriateness of such segmentationhas come into question. It must indeed be thoroughly examined whether it is impeding the provision ofefficient financial services and the introduction of new financial technology, and whether it is restrictingmarket competition.BIS Review   61/1997
- 7 -It is also important to review the institutional frameworks of the legal, tax, andaccounting systems to make them suitable for the financial services of the new era. If the institutional frameworks are not improved, even transactions between residentsmay shift to overseas markets due to the exercise of choice by market participants. This may be called“transactions flight” rather than “capital flight.” As the financial markets constitute the infrastructuresupporting the economic activity of a country, hollowing out of the markets must be prevented.B. The Basic Approach to Market Reform As I have explained, market reform should not be conducted as a mere deregulationprocess. Rather, it should be promoted from the viewpoint of creating an internationally competitivemarket and making the market attractive to domestic and overseas participants. In doing so, it must beremembered that countries around the world are also striving to attract domestic and cross-borderfinancial transactions to their own markets by enhancing their international competitiveness. That is tosay, while the systems of various countries differ significantly, each country is reviewing its existingsystem on a continuous basis in pursuit of improved efficiency. Therefore, if we simply consider thepresent New York and London markets as our goal, we might find ourselves trailing behind thosemarkets by the time reform in Japan is realized. In other words, it is most important to try to be one ortwo steps ahead of the times as we rebuild Japan’s financial markets. The frame of reference in these efforts is to fully utilize the creativity of the privatesector, or in other words, to maximize the functioning of the market mechanism. In fact, the driving forcefor the development of the New York and London markets has been the innovative strength of the marketmechanism. It is therefore important that existing regulations be reviewed and abolished as much aspossible while placing stronger emphasis on market participants’ self-responsibility and on honoringmarket discipline. It is essential that a framework be built in which diverse financial services are madeavailable to the public, enabling them to choose the most efficient products or products that sufficientlymeet their various needs. Such a framework will not only promote greater efficiency of the entirefinancial system by drawing out innovative ideas through competition, but should also contribute to thestability of the financial system by putting to work the check mechanism inherent in markets. When we look back at the Japanese financial markets from this perspective, we see thatevery attempt to introduce a new financial product, such as commercial paper or securitized instruments,required a lengthy process before the product could actually be launched. This was because there wasalways heated debate about whether the new product could be construed as a negotiable security underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1948, in order to determine which type of financial institution, that is,securities companies or banks, would handle the product. Another feature of the Japanese financial markets has been the restrictions or conditionsimposed to limit the risk carried by securities traded on the capital market, that is, those imposed on theinvestment instruments of institutional investors and on the corporate issuers of negotiable securities.Examples are the restrictions on equity investment by investment trusts and pension funds and thequalification criteria for corporate bond issues, which were abolished at the end of 1995. This feature,however, seems to have constrained the basic function of the capital market which is to realize efficienttransfers of business risks based on the price mechanism and has consequently restricted access to thecapital market. Such features of the Japanese financial markets had the aim of protecting investors,which was realized by making specific institutions responsible for specific financial instruments, andthen regulating and supervising the institutions responsible for handling the financial products. Shouldthis remain unchanged, however, new financial instruments may not be introduced expeditiously and thefunctions of the capital market may not be fully utilized, further weakening the internationalcompetitiveness of the Japanese markets. In addition, if regulations continue to severely restrict theactivities of the institutions offering financial products, this may leave little room for the financialBIS Review   61/1997
- 8 -institutions to exercise creativity and, in the end, even discourage them from doing so. In practice, theregulations were applied with a certain degree of flexibility to avoid impairment of market functions. Inorder to strengthen the competitiveness of the Japanese markets, however, it is essential to resolutelyrelax or remove existing regulations to allow the private sector to fully exercise its creativity. It then becomes important that market participants be held responsible for their ownactions and market discipline be respected, and also that comprehensive rules be made that are applied tothe entire market to ensure the adequate functioning of the market mechanism. Such market rules can besummarized conceptually in the following two categories. The first type is rules that financial businesses in general - for example, banks, securitiescompanies, insurance companies, and investment trusts - must observe in their transactions withcustomers. These include rules that provide for adequate explanation of the risks involved in a certainproduct in accordance with the customer’s level of knowledge and experience, or for a strict separation ofthe customers’ assets from the institution’s assets. The second type is rules pertaining to disclosure andthose that prohibit unfair trades. The basis of investor protection is to disclose information that enablesinvestors to make rational decisions about investment. With such disclosure, all responsibility for theinvestment decisions will lie with the investors. It is thus necessary to enhance public disclosure, whileconsidering for which instruments investor protection should be provided. Besides these two types of rules, prudential regulations will need to be imposed on bankswhich participate in the settlement system. This is because failure of one bank might trigger thematerialization of systemic risk, disrupting the entire financial system. However, if the prudentialregulations are applied too rigorously, banks may be put at a major disadvantage vis-à-vis other financialinstitutions. Therefore, banking regulations are now being reviewed so that they encourage further effortsby banks themselves. These rules and regulations should not control the details of the actions of financialinstitutions. Instead, their aim is to guarantee free and self-reliant behavior of financial institutions withinthe minimum necessary framework. Relaxation or removal of all unnecessary regulations within thatframework should promote competition among financial institutions, improving the quality of financialservices available to users in Japan and abroad.C. The Future of the Japanese Financial Markets Before concluding, I would also like to discuss the Bank’s views regarding the future ofJapan’s markets, about which questions are often raised. First of all, in light of the experience of the Big Bang in the United Kingdom, someanticipate that when the market reform is accomplished, Japanese financial institutions might end upbeing acquired by foreign interests. It is extremely difficult to forecast whether this will happen in Japanand to what extent it will occur. However, whoever will be the providers of financial services, what ismost important is to establish financial markets which efficiently supply diverse financial services to thepeople and which thereby provide the foundation for the sound development of the national economy.Even if attempts are made to protect domestic financial institutions by means of market regulation, thecost of that protection will have to be borne by the people, if the financial institutions lack internationalcompetitiveness. This would reduce the international competitiveness of Japanese firms and, in the end,might only shackle the economic development of Japan. Following the Big Bang in the United Kingdom, the London market grew once again andconsolidated its status as a global market. It is true that in the process, capital of various origins found itsway into British financial institutions. This, however, occurred because the London market had thecapacity to create new financial techniques, and obviously the subsequent revitalization of the market hascontributed to the development of the British economy. BIS Review   61/1997
- 9 -In the end, financial institutions seem to have no choice but to reinforce their financialstrength and enhance their competitiveness to survive tough competition. I strongly expect that financialinstitutions in Japan will further strengthen their competitiveness through efforts to reform themselves,and I am convinced that they remain full of determination in this respect. Another concern in Japan has been that if deregulation proceeds further, many of thesmall and medium-sized financial institutions will find their business base taken over by the largerinstitutions. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States, however, I feel that there is atendency for financial institutions to become specialized in the present financial environment. While it istrue that some financial institutions might seek to provide comprehensive financial services, they will notbe able to survive the severe competition by merely expanding the scale and scope of their operations.Those institutions will also have to develop areas or niches in which they can be competitive to securethe base for their existence. It is thus strongly expected that each financial institution will advance itsknow-how and expertise in its particular areas of strength so as to provide quality financial services.While market reform in Japan will thus intensify competition among financial institutions, I am of theview that it will not directly cause the small and medium-sized financial institutions to lose their businessbases.V. ConclusionThe reform of the financial markets involves numerous issues besides relaxation andremoval of existing regulations and improvement of the institutional framework of the legal, tax, andaccounting systems. Review of public financing and adequate regulation and supervision, for example,are important considerations. The revision of the Bank of Japan Law should also be perceived as part ofthe process of reform of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system. With regard to the revision of the Bank of Japan Law, a bill to amend the entire Law wassubmitted to the Diet in March following intense deliberations by the Central Bank Study Group, anadvisory panel to the Prime Minister, and by the Financial System Research Council, an advisorycommittee to the Minister of Finance. The bill aims at establishing a new central bank system founded onthe two basic principles of independence and transparency. Underlying the amendment proposal is theperception that in order to improve the efficacy and flexibility of monetary policy amid the changesoccurring in the global environment surrounding the Japanese financial markets, which I have discussedtoday, the legislation based on which the Bank of Japan operates must be appropriate for a central bankin the new age. I strongly hope that the bill will have a smooth passage following Diet deliberations. Atthe same time, we at the Bank of Japan are determined to strengthen our efforts to reform the Bank toensure appropriate policy and operational management. In closing, I would like to ask for your continued understanding and cooperation.BIS Review   61/1997
Bank of Japan presents the summary of an article published in the Mayedition of its Quarterly Bulletin   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 30/5/97.Checklist for Risk Management (Revised Edition)The English version of the Checklist published in the May 1997 issue of the Bankof Japan Quarterly Bulletin includes specific sample questions in addition to check points thatwere provisionally published in the November 1996 issue. The original Checklist written inJapanese has precedence over this English version.I. ObjectivesThe Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Japan initially compiled theChecklist for Risk Management (hereafter referred to as the former Checklist) in December 1987to assist examiners in assessing the adequacy of risk management at individual banks during on-site examinations. The former Checklist was distributed to financial institutions under theBank’s supervision as a reference for checking and strengthening their risk managementsystems.  Amid the progress in financial liberalization and innovation that has taken placeduring the past several years, financial institutions have expanded the scope of their businessactivities, and this has enabled them to pursue higher returns by taking on risks freely whilegiving consideration to market rules. At the same time, this has led to a better understanding byfinancial institutions of the importance of maintaining the balance between risk and return byadequately assessing and controlling risk exposure. As a result, financial institutions are takingthe initiative in strengthening and upgrading their risk management systems in order to securefinancial safety and soundness.  With these changes in the environment surrounding financial institutions, theBank of Japan has recognized the increased importance of adequately assessing any futurethreats to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. This implies nothing more thanfurther strengthening and promotion of the same kind of examination focused on riskmanagement as in the past. With this aim, the Bank Supervision Department hascomprehensively revised the former Checklist (hereafter referred to as the new Checklist).Like its predecessor, the new Checklist has been distributed to all banks subject tothe Bank of Japan’s supervision, as it is intended to assist banks in reviewing and strengtheningtheir risk management systems based on the principle of self-responsibility, while serving as aguideline for bank examiners. As this revised document includes some points that will beequally useful to those financial institutions not subject to the Bank’s supervision (such as someshinkin banks, credit cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and labor credit associations) andbusiness enterprises, the new Checklist is presented in the Quarterly Bulletin.II. Major FeaturesThe most prominent feature of the new Checklist is the change in categorization.In view of the transformation of risk management emphasis from heightening recognition ofrisks in the former Checklist to the recent actual control of risks, the overall structure of theChecklist has been altered from the eight categories by type of risk in the former Checklist(credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, operations risk, electronicdata processing [EDP] risk, systemic risk, and management risk) to four categories by type ofoperation (management and internal controls, lending operations, market operations and assetand liability management [ALM], and business operations and EDP).BIS Review   60/1997
- 2 -The Checklist has also been revised to reflect the important points in riskmanagement acquired during the Bank’s past on-site examinations, while giving dueconsideration to the various reports and guidelines of international organizations and foreignfinancial authorities, and to trading practices in Japan. Concretely, the section on management and internal controls emphasizes basicmanagement policy and strategy concerning risk management, while including items regardinglegal compliance and countermeasures against disasters. This section is given the highest priorityin the new Checklist. Second, against the background of the increase in nonperforming assetsaccompanying the bursting of the “bubble” economy, the section on lending operations has beenstrengthened to reflect points important in the evaluation of creditworthiness and avoidance ofcredit concentration. At the same time, this section promotes comprehensive management ofdomestic, overseas, on-balance-sheet, and off-balance-sheet transactions, and includes generalremarks foreseeing the introduction of a loan grading and review system, further contributing tothe continued enhancement of risk management as a whole.  Third, the section on market operations and ALM has been expanded in content,as this section is the most strongly influenced by the progress in financial liberalization andinnovation, namely, the rapid growth in derivatives transactions and the greater impact of ALMskills on profit/loss of financial institutions. This section incorporates numerous concepts fromthe Checklist for Risk Management on Derivatives Transactions, which was compiled and issuedin April 1995, and reflects new risk management techniques and lessons learned from some ofthe recent financial incidents.  Fourth, with the development of EDP at financial institutions, more weight hasbeen put on EDP in the section on business operations and EDP. Furthermore, to reinforce theimportance of the accuracy of individual offices’ work, this section has given as comprehensivea treatment as possible to such issues as new types of transactions accompanying progress ininformation technology (i.e., fund transactions using customers’ computer terminals).BIS Review   60/1997
M. Roth s’interroge sur les implications de l’Union monétaire pour la SuisseExposé présenté par M. Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice-président de la Direction générale de la Banquenationale suisse, à l’Assemblée générale de l’Association Suisse d’Assurances à Genève, le27/5/97.1.  IntroductionSelon le calendrier du Traité de Maastricht, le processus d’intégration monétaireen Europe entre maintenant dans sa dernière ligne droite. D’ici moins d’un an, la liste des paysqui participeront à la première phase d’intégration sera arrêtée et, au 1er janvier 1999, leSystème européen de banques centrales (SEBC) prendra la conduite des opérations monétaires.L’euro deviendra alors réalité.Le projet est très ambitieux, non seulement sur le plan politique, mais aussi sur leplan technique. Les pays membres de l’Union Européenne (UE) y travaillent d’arrache-pieddepuis le début des années nonante. Leurs efforts visent non seulement à mettre en place unemonnaie unique de qualité qui pourra dignement succéder aux devises européennes les plussaines actuellement, mais aussi à donner à l’Europe les moyens de mener une politiquecommune générant confiance et stabilité.Mon propos, aujourd’hui, ne sera pas de discuter les avantages et lesinconvénients d’une unification monétaire en Europe. Ce ne sera pas non plus de tenter dedéfinir le contour géographique de la future zone euro. Sur ces points, suffisamment a été dit etécrit. Vous êtes en possession des éléments du problème.Je souhaite consacrer le temps que vous m’accordez à faire d’abord le point despréparatifs techniques, puis à m’interroger sur les conséquences de l’apparition de la monnaieunique pour les Européens et pour la Suisse.2.  L’état des préparatifsLes travaux préparatoires en vue de la première phase d’intégration monétairesont de deux ordres:  D’une part, des efforts considérables sont déployés au niveau national envue de remplir les critères de convergence fixés par le Traité de Maastricht. D’autre part, destravaux importants de planification sont nécessaires préalablement à l’introduction de lamonnaie unique et à la conduite de la politique monétaire commune.Si les questions relatives aux critères de convergence sont largement connues dupublic, celles qui se rapportent aux préparatifs monétaires opérationnels le sont moins. Elles sontpourtant d’une importance vitale, car si elles ne sont pas résolues la zone euro ne pourra pasfonctionner correctement. Par ailleurs, pour ceux qui, comme nous, resteront à l’écart duprocessus, les éléments techniques comportent une dimension pratique évidente.Je m’arrêterai sur les travaux préparatoires relatifs:- à la politique monétaire commune,- aux opérations du SEBC,- au système des paiements,- aux relations avec les tiers.2.1.  La politique communeL’objectif de l’UEM est de substituer aux monnaies européennesactuelles - généralement mises en place au 19e siècle -  une monnaie unique gérée en commun.BIS Review   57/1997
- 2 -Aucun projet monétaire d’une telle envergure n’a été réalisé au cours de ce siècleen Europe. Le projet est d’une extraordinaire ambition car il s’agit d’un pari sur l’avenir. Depuisque l’étalon-or n’est plus à la base de nos systèmes monétaires, la monnaie est avant tout uneaffaire de confiance dans la capacité des autorités à la gérer de telle sorte que son pouvoird’achat ne s’érode pas. La grande audace de l’UE est de confier le destin de sa monnaie à uneautorité qui n’existe pas encore, donc qui n’a pas de crédibilité acquise à l’épreuve de combatspassés. Le risque est ici d’autant plus grand que la révolution monétaire, qui se déroulera sousnos yeux, ne sera pas accompagnée d’une révolution politique qui serait en mesure, d’ores etdéjà, de rendre claires les axes de développement et les priorités futurs.Conscients de cette déficience de crédibilité, les Européens ont fixé trèsprécisément les objectifs de l’action du SEBC. Ce dernier devra assurer la stabilité des prix, unmandat qu’il aura à remplir en toute indépendance par rapport aux pouvoirs politiques. De plus,grâce aux critères de Maastricht, seuls des pays ayant démontré leur stabilité financière pourrontfaire partie de l’Union, ce qui doit donner un avant-goût de la culture qui existera au sein duConseil des gouverneurs de la future autorité monétaire européenne.Tout a donc été prévu pour donner au SEBC la crédibilité indispensable àl’application d’une politique visant à la stabilité des prix. Evidemment, cette question n’est passeulement théorique, elle est également d’une grande portée économique pour les pays quientreront dans l’Union. Si la crédibilité des autorités européennes est inférieure à celle desautorités monétaires nationales actuelles, le taux d’intérêt européen aura tendance à êtresupérieur aux taux que l’Europe connaît aujourd’hui, ce qui pourrait avoir un impact négatif surle développement de la conjoncture. Le maintien d’un processus cohérent d’intégration est donccrucial pour le “standing” futur de la monnaie européenne, mais surtout pour les conditions definancement et d’investissement dans les pays qui passeront à la fusion monétaire.2.2.  La planification opérationnelleAu-delà des questions essentielles liées à la politique monétaire, les Européensdoivent également régler nombre de détails techniques pour être en mesure de gérer en communle nouvel ensemble monétaire. Ils ont dû s’entendre sur la stratégie et le cadre opérationnel quiseront ceux du SEBC à partir du 1er janvier 1999.Comme déjà indiqué, l’objectif de la politique monétaire du SEBC sera lastabilité des prix. Pour l’atteindre, les autorités monétaires suivront une stratégie qui se situera àmi-chemin entre le monétarisme traditionnel - à l’allemande - et la fixation - àl’anglaise - d’objectifs d’inflation. Ces réflexions ont été faites au sein de l’Institut MonétaireEuropéen (IME), le précurseur de la Banque centrale européenne. Il est naturel que l’IME n’aitpas été en mesure d’arrêter une stratégie unique pour l’instant. Bien des éléments d’appréciationlui échappent encore: une approche à l’allemande ne pourra être suivie que si la future demanded’euros est suffisamment stable. Si celle-ci ne peut être mise en rapport direct avec l’activitééconomique dans l’Union monétaire, une stratégie alternative, comme une stratégie basée surdes objectifs d’inflation, pourrait devenir une bonne solution de rechange.On notera au passage qu’une stratégie de cours de change a été écartée d’emblée.Par une stratégie de change, les Européens pourraient décider de lier le sort de l’euro à celuid’une autre monnaie  - le dollar dans notre cas. Ici des éléments politiques et psychologiques meparaissent importants: si l’Europe veut mettre en place une monnaie commune qui puisse fairecontrepoids  - à terme -  au billet vert, il lui est difficile de la faire tenir sur les fonds baptismauxpar un parrain américain. Par ailleurs, comme la politique de change ne relèvera pas de lacompétence du SEBC mais du Conseil européen, l’autonomie des autorités monétaires seraitBIS Review   57/1997
- 3 -d’entrée gravement compromise; en effet, leur marge de manoeuvre dans la gestion de laliquidité du marché de l’euro serait sous la coupe des fluctuations du dollar.Au-delà des questions stratégiques, l’IME a dû régler une foule de détailstechniques afin de permettre au SEBC de mener son action monétaire. Ainsi, est-il déjà clair quela liquidité du marché sera gérée par voie d’open-market, que deux taux d’intérêt officiels serontpubliés, l’un  - un taux de dépôt -  constituera une sorte de plancher pour les taux du marchémonétaire, l’autre  - une forme de taux lombard -  jouera le rôle de plafond. La gestion desfacilités de crédit et de dépôt relèvera des compétences nationales, alors que l’open-market seramené par la banque centrale européenne.Une particularité du dispositif européen sera la présence de réserves obligatoiresou, plus précisément, la possibilité d’imposer de telles réserves. La question de l’utilité d’un telinstrument ne fait pas l’unanimité dans les banques centrales de l’UE, le SEBC pourra en faireusage s’il s’avère nécessaire de régulariser la demande de liquidité des banques.2.3. Le système de paiementUn volet très important des travaux préparatoires est celui de la mise en placed’un système européen de paiements interbancaires par voie électronique.Pourquoi est-ce si important? Parce qu’il est nécessaire que les marchés nationauxsoient de véritables vases communicants. Si la banque centrale européenne injecte de la liquiditédans un marché, celle-ci doit pouvoir se distribuer ensuite  - très rapidement -  dans les autres.De même, si un marché recherche de la liquidité, l’appoint devra pouvoir être immédiatementfourni par les autres grâce à des opérations d’arbitrage. Il n’existera alors qu’un seul tauxd’intérêt pour des transactions devant être exécutées en “valeur le même jour”.Dans ce domaine c’est également une révolution qui se prépare car, actuellement,chaque pays de l’UE possède son propre système de paiement interbancaire. Une harmonisationet une coordination sont donc nécessaires. Au plan de l’harmonisation, il est prévu que lessystèmes fonctionneront selon des principes de règlement analogues. Au plan de la coordination,il s’agit de connecter ces systèmes afin qu’ils puissent ensuite permettre aux paiements depasser, sans obstacle ni perte de temps, d’un pays à l’autre. Ces domaines sont extrêmementtechniques et réclament des investissements considérables.On ne peut s’arrêter sur les questions de paiement sans parler des préparatifs enmatière de billets de banque. Ici, l’objectif est plus lointain puisque les billets libellés en eurosn’apparaîtront pas avant 2002. Un concours a été organisé, un graphiste choisi. Les travaux definalisation, puis d’impression, des coupures occuperont largement les trois années quisépareront 1999 de 2002.2.4.  Les relations avec les pays extérieursA côté des préparatifs de politique monétaire et de la mise en place du cadretechnique, les Européens ont dû arrêter également une stratégie pour leurs relations extérieures.Peu de choses sont connues pour l’instant. Il est déjà clair, toutefois, que lesrelations entre la zone euro et le reste de l’UE  - ceux que l’on appelle les “outs” -, seront d’uneimportance primordiale. N’oublions pas que l’Union monétaire se déroulera en phases, si bienque la nature des relations entre les membres de l’Union et les pays qui n’ont pas encorevoulu - ou pu - adhérer à la zone euro est particulièrement importante, non seulement pour lespays candidats, mais aussi pour les membres de l’Union. A ce stade, une seule chose sembleBIS Review   57/1997
- 4 -claire:  les pays ne participant pas à la première phase d’intégration ne pourront bénéficier desfacilités de crédit du SEBC; le privilège de la liquidité en euro sera réservé aux pays membres.Mais c’est bien entendu dans le domaine des changes que des dispositionsspéciales devront être prises. Aujourd’hui, la majeure partie des pays de l’UE font partie duSystème Monétaire Européen (SME) et de son Mécanisme de Change (MCE). Demain, lorsquecertains membres auront décidé de lier définitivement leurs monnaie, les conditions defonctionnement du MCE devront être révisées. Il s’agira de mettre la zone euro à l’abri demanipulations monétaires extérieures et d’aider les pays en attente d’intégration à réaliser à leurtour la fusion monétaire.Enfin, la Banque centrale européenne devra également considérer que d’autrespays européens, non-membres de l’UE, souhaiteront établir des relations particulières entre leurmonnaie et l’euro. Certains pays d’Europe centrale ont déjà indiqué qu’ils pourraient envisagerde lier leur monnaie à l’euro. Qu’en est-il de notre pays, lui qui pourrait se trouver, demain, aucoeur de la zone monétaire européenne?3.  Les implications pour la SuisseQue pouvons-nous attendre de l’Union monétaire?Je l’ai déjà indiqué, c’est une révolution qui se prépare à notre porte. Avecl’Union monétaire, le paysage macro-économique européen va être profondément modifié. D’unespace à devises multiples, à marchés financiers fragmentés, on va passer à une zone uniformedont la dimension potentielle est comparable à celle des Etats-Unis. Le bouleversement sera siprofond que chacun d’entre nous, même dans sa vie courante, en percevra les conséquences.Quelles sont les évolutions qui peuvent être pressenties:- au niveau des entreprises,- au niveau macro-économique?3.1.  L’impact de l’euro au niveau des entreprisesAvec l’apparition de l’euro, le terme “grand marché” appliqué souvent au marchéeuropéen aura pris toute sa signification. Au sein de la zone euro, les risques de change aurontdisparu, les coûts et les prix seront formulés dans une unité commune, le coût du capital seraidentique.De cette constatation banale découleront d’importantes conséquencesindustrielles:En premier lieu, l’unification monétaire encouragera les entreprises européennes àaller encore plus loin dans leurs investissements transfrontières. La localisation des lieux deproduction s’effectuera plus rationnellement qu’aujourd’hui en fonction des conditions-cadrelocales. Un rôle essentiel joueront ainsi des facteurs comme le coût du travail, la situationfiscale, l’état des communications et la proximité des marchés. Les barrières monétairesdisparaîtront: plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur les marges, plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur lerendement des investissements; tous les bilans seront aisément consolidables en euros.Nous allons donc assister à l’apparition d’entreprises à profil plus européen quefrançais ou allemand. Elles seront peut-être multiculturelles dans la langue  - pour autant quel’anglais ne devienne pas la langue véhiculaire de l’Europe continentale -  mais très “grandmarché” dans leur organisation. Il en résultera forcément une unification progressive destechniques et des procédures; peu à peu, s’installera une mentalité de marché intérieur qui,BIS Review   57/1997
- 5 -comme on l’observe aux Etats-Unis, débouchera sur une inflexibilité, une incompréhension àl’égard des marchés extérieurs de faible taille.Pour la Suisse, cela signifie que les règles du jeu commercial deviendront plusdifficiles. Les pratiques européennes en matière de contrats, de conditions, de normes,s’imposeront à nous. Il sera toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le franc suisse comme base defacturation, c’est l’euro qui deviendra la référence pour nos exportateurs. Sur le plan interne, letouriste européen qui transitera par notre pays souhaitera payer en euro dans les commerces,plutôt que devoir passer par le franc suisse. Nous devons donc nous préparer à vivre avec unensemble européen monolithique alors qu’aujourd’hui nous sommes confrontés à une mosaïqueaux couleurs très variées. Jusqu’ici le commerce transfrontière était une tradition européenne,demain il le sera moins.En second lieu, la création de la zone euro stimulera la concurrence dans lesmarchés des produits financiers. C’est certainement dans ce secteur que la suppression desrisques de change aura l’impact le plus marqué. Le marché financier européen gagnera enprofondeur, il attirera aussi les opérateurs étrangers. La compétition entre les établissements decrédit, entre tous les établissements financiers, s’accentuera même si des particularités nationalessubsisteront en matière de surveillance ou dans le domaine fiscal.Il faut donc s’attendre à ce que l’apparition de l’euro entraîne une accélération desajustements des structures financières. Ici également, le cadre de référence ne pourra plus êtrenational; il deviendra supranational.Cet ajustement des structures est déjà largement engagé dans notre pays. Enraison de l’étroitesse de notre marché, nos principaux établissements financiers - banques etassurances - ont déjà été conduits à adopter des stratégies globales. Je crois donc que nous seronsainsi bien en mesure de saisir les chances qui nous seront offertes par le “grand marchéfinancier” de l’euro.Pour conclure cette section sur les services financiers, il convient de parler desservices de paiement. Dans ce domaine, notre situation est semblable à celle des pays européensqui ne participeront pas à la première phase d’intégration monétaire. Nous disposons en Suissed’un système de paiement électronique et de transfert des titres très performant et totalementconforme aux principes retenus par les Européens. Il conviendra d’établir les ponts nécessairespour que ce système puisse “dialoguer” avec le système européen. Sur ce plan, la situation de laSuisse n’est pas très différente de celle du Royaume-Uni. Les Européens n’ont pas encore définidans le détail les règles de collaboration dans ce domaine entre les “ins” et les “outs”, lesmembres et les non-membres de l’Union monétaire. Lorsque cela sera fait, nous verrons quellessont les variantes qui peuvent être envisagées.Il est indéniable que la monnaie unique créera, dans les relations entre la Suisse etl’Union européenne, un nouveau rapport de forces. Je ne doute pas que nous puissions le gérer,même que nous puissions en exploiter les éléments positifs. Cela réclamera toutefois des prisesde risques dans des domaines où nous avons bénéficié de situations fort confortables par lepassé. Cela réclamera aussi une volonté de s’adapter à un environnement nouveau, une remise enquestion de notre manière de commercer avec nos voisins. Il faudra chercher à innover plutôtqu’à optimiser.3.2.  L’impact de l’euro au niveau macro-économiqueL’apparition de l’euro modifiera aussi l’environnement macro-économique danslequel opère notre pays.Arrêtons-nous tout d’abord sur les effets de long terme.BIS Review   57/1997
- 6 -Fondamentalement, si les Européens gagnent leur pari, si l’euro s’avère être unemonnaie saine, la Suisse bénéficiera d’un environnement européen beaucoup plus stable que parle passé. Jusqu’ici, notre économie a souvent dû s’adapter douloureusement aux distorsionscréées par les désordres monétaires extérieurs. A titre d’exemple, rappelons-nous lesmouvements spectaculaires de la lire italienne au cours des quinze dernières années. Dans lesannées quatre-vingt, la lire, intégrée au SME, ne cessait de s’apprécier en termes réels face aufranc suisse, ce qui ne pouvait que plaire à nos entreprises qui se trouvaient en concurrence avecdes entreprises italiennes. Au fil des années, la capacité exportatrice de l’Italie s’est trouvée sifortement entravée que la lire a dû quitter le SME en 1993. Elle a alors rapidement perdu près dela moitié de sa valeur, éliminant en quelques mois les excès de poids accumulés pendant les dixannées précédentes. De tels mouvements de yo-yo échappent à nos moyens de contrôle; ils sontdramatiques pour nos entreprises exportatrices. Si, demain - ou peut-être après-demain -, detelles situations ne survenaient plus grâce aux progrès de la stabilité monétaire en Europe, c’estl’économie suisse tout entière, comme lieu de production, qui en profiterait.Le second effet de long terme que l’on peut attendre de l’unificationmonétaire - et c’est peut-être un paradoxe aux yeux de certains d’entre vous -, c’est uneintégration accélérée de l’économie suisse dans l’économie d’Europe continentale.Déjà aujourd’hui, la conjoncture de notre pays dépend étroitement de ce qui sepasse chez nos voisins. Depuis le début des années nonante, tous nos retournements de cycleconjoncturel ont coïncidé avec ceux que l’on observait en France et en Allemagne. Aujourd’hui,notre atmosphère conjoncturelle est semblable à celle de nos voisins. Si, à l’avenir, les pulsionsde l’activité économique en Europe devenaient beaucoup plus uniformes, je ne doute pas quenotre rythme de production serait encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent.Lorsque le grand marché gagnera en homogénéité, la Suisse aura de plus en plus un profileuropéen. Il en résultera une synchronisation croissante des décisions de politique économique,des mouvements des taux d’intérêt et de la conjoncture. Dans le domaine monétaire, lesdécisions de la future Banque centrale européenne seront de première importance pour laBanque nationale suisse.Mais, au-delà de la conjoncture, si l’euro se révèle être une monnaie forte, commeles Européens le souhaitent, deux phénomènes, essentiels pour nous, se manifesteront sur lesmarchés financiers. D’une part, nous assisterons à une diminution des incertitudes, donc à unebaisse du niveau des taux d’intérêt sur l’euro; d’autre part, dès l’instant où les marchésréaliseront que les éléments sous-jacents à l’euro et au franc sont fort semblables, ilsconsidéreront notre monnaie comme une monnaie parente de la monnaie unique: nos tauxd’intérêt pourraient ainsi être progressivement attirés par ceux de l’euro. Je ne serais donc passurpris si, tendanciellement, nous observions ces prochaines années un rapprochement gradueldes taux d’intérêt suisses et européens. Comme indiqué tout à l’heure, je ne pense pas quel’ajustement s’opérera de notre côté seulement, car une fois terminée la phase d’introduction del’euro, les conditions de financement devraient se détendre en France comme en Allemagne.Si cette évolution intervient, c’est-à-dire si les marchés considèrent le franc etl’euro comme des monnaies de qualité semblable, l’écart entre taux suisses et européensdiminuera et une intégration à terme du franc dans la zone euro ne devrait pas poser deproblèmes. Je vous rappelle ici que l’objectif à long terme du Conseil fédéral est une intégrationde la Suisse dans l’édifice européen en construction.3.3.  Les incertitudesMais bien entendu, les évolutions que je vous ai décrites présupposent que l’euroBIS Review   57/1997
- 7 -devienne une monnaie stable. Certains en doutent et craignent que la monnaie unique ne soit pasle digne successeur du mark allemand.On ne peut écarter totalement cette hypothèse car l’intégration monétaire est uneopération délicate. Toutefois, je reste confiant car les Européens ont reconnu ces dernièresannées l’importance de la stabilité des prix; ils ont aussi vu qu’une monnaie saine permetd’abaisser durablement le coût du capital, d’allouer efficacement les ressources productives et destimuler la croissance. J’ai donc le sentiment que le SEBC veillera avec grand soin à remplir lemandat qui lui est assigné par ses statuts.Pour nous, Suisses, les incertitudes portent moins sur la qualité future de l’euroque sur les conditions de son introduction. A cet égard, cette année et l’année prochaine jouentun rôle crucial. Au-delà de 1999, le SEBC sera jugé par sa politique et il aura les moyens demaîtriser la situation.Jusque-là, les choses seront plus délicates car les marchés vont essayer, à l’aided’informations fragmentaires et de suppositions, de mesurer la qualité de la future monnaieeuropéenne. Une grande volatilité peut être crainte, volatilité dommageable pour notreéconomie.Je reste toutefois confiant. Ma confiance n’est pas du “wishful thinking”, maisrepose sur des faits objectifs:En premier lieu, je crois qu’il n’est pas dans l’intérêt des Européens de procéder àl’intégration monétaire dans le désordre. Certains pays - et je pense ici à l’Allemagne - verraientcertainement d’un mauvais oeil que l’introduction de l’euro entraîne une dégradation marquéede leur stabilité monétaire. Il me paraît évident que la Bundesbank prendrait des contre-mesuressi une spéculation contre le mark devait se déclencher. Les Allemands sont intéressés à un eurofort.En deuxième lieu, les Européens ont tout fait jusqu’ici pour convaincre lesmarchés que l’intégration monétaire sera ordonnée. Les critères de convergence et le pacte destabilité sont autant de signaux indiquant que seuls des pays financièrement sains pourrontaccéder à la monnaie unique. Je crois qu’il se tiendront à cette ligne de conduite jusqu’à ladécision finale.En troisième lieu, en dépit des évolutions récentes, c’est le dollar  - non le francsuisse -  qui absorbe les incertitudes de la construction européenne. La monnaie américaine estvue par les placeurs comme la principale alternative, non notre monnaie qui, elle, se trouveratoujours dans le sillage des monnaies européennes.Quoi qu’il en soit, des risques de perturbations existent. En cas d’agitation desmarchés, nous ne serions pas sans moyens pour nous défendre. Notre principale arme est lapolitique monétaire qui peut tenir compte des turbulences extérieures. Un assouplissement denotre politique en cas d’appréciation du franc est possible  - nous venons de le démontrer il y aun peu plus d’une semaine. En cette matière, il convient toutefois de rester réaliste: la Banquenationale n’a pas les moyens de mettre la Suisse totalement à l’abri de perturbations extérieures.Comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure, l’économie suisse a souvent souffert des chocsmonétaires provenant de l’étranger; la politique monétaire ne peut  - au mieux -  qu’en atténuerles effets négatifs. Nous nous efforcerons de lutter contre les mouvements irréalistes du franc.Faudrait-il, dans ces conditions, souhaiter purement et simplement un accrochagedu franc à l’euro? Par une opération de ce type, pourrait-on éliminer les risques d’un envol dufranc sur les marchés? Malheureusement, il n’existe pas de solution miracle. Tant que la Suissene sera pas membre des Institutions européennes, il ne sera pas possible de convaincre lesmarchés que le franc est lié irrémédiablement à l’euro. Si nous définissions unilatéralement uneBIS Review   57/1997
- 8 -parité du franc par rapport à l’euro, les marchés la testeraient. Nous attiserions plus que nouscalmerions les mouvements de fonds spéculatifs. L’arrimage unilatéral du franc à la monnaieeuropéenne ne tiendrait donc pas longtemps.4.  ConclusionsLes travaux préparatoires à l’Union monétaire vont donc bon train. Au cours desprochains mois, un certain nombre de détails techniques seront encore éclaircis, c’est auprintemps prochain que sera connue la liste des pays prêts à la fusion monétaire.Nous n’en serons pas. Mais nous n’en ressentirons pas moins les conséquences.J’utilise ici le terme “nous” afin de couvrir tous les acteurs de la vie économiquecar le changement du paysage monétaire européen sera si profond que chacun d’entre nous seraaffecté, directement ou indirectement. Ce sont bien entendu ceux qui sont au front du commerceextérieur  - de biens ou de services -  qui verront l’environnement changer le plus rapidement.Le poids de l’euro se fera sentir; le marché européen  - considéré comme international par lepassé -  deviendra un grand marché intérieur avec sa dimension, bien sûr, mais aussi avec sestendances protectionnistes et dominatrices.Pour la Banque nationale également, l’euro ouvre un nouveau chapitre desrelations monétaires en Europe. Nous avons confiance que le processus d’intégration sedéroulera sans déclencher des vagues sur le marché des changes. Nous espérons aussi ques’installeront en Europe des conditions de stabilité qui permettront aux trajectoires du francsuisse et de l’euro de se rejoindre un jour.BIS Review   57/1997
Mr. Heikensten gives a review of recent developments in the Swedisheconomy and monetary policy   Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden,Mr. Lars Heikensten, given on Real-Estate Day in Stockholm on 15/5/97.Let me begin with a word of thanks for being invited to talk with you about theSwedish economy and monetary policy.Today I shall be considering three issues. First some words about the constructionof monetary policy and why low inflation is a good thing. Then a look at what has happened inthe Swedish economy since the crisis culminated in 1993. Finally I shall be saying somethingabout the future outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.1. Low inflation and economic stabilityThe objective is low inflationThe Riksbank conducts monetary policy with a target that is clear andunmistakable: the annual rate of change in the consumer price index is to be kept at 2 per cent,with a tolerance interval of –1 percentage point. In order to fulfil the target the Riksbank variesits instrumental rate (the repo rate), which influences the level of economic activity and therebyinflation. Experience has taught us that the time lag before an interest rate adjustment has its fulleffect on inflation ranges from one to two years. This means that the Riksbank has to operatewith a forward-looking perspective - the interest rate must be set in the light of forecast inflationone to two years ahead.The central function of the Riksbank is to achieve price stability or at least keepthe rate of price increases low and stable. This approach to monetary policy is based on theinsight that in the longer run, higher price increases cannot generate growth and employment.Growth stems from other factors, such as technological advances, the way the economyfunctions, demographic trends, etc. Attempts to stimulate economic growth by accepting higherinflation soon tend to boomerang. This is clear both from our own experience in recent decadesand from what has happened in other countries. The players in the economy adapt to the higherinflation; prices, wages and interest rates rise; the end result is normally an economic trend thatis weaker instead of stronger.Throughout the western world today, economic policy is less concerned with“stop and go” policies to influence short-run activity and focuses more on creating good andstable long-term conditions for economic growth and employment. In such an approach, thefunction of monetary policy is to safeguard the value of money. In the past decade support for apolicy of this type has also grown markedly in Sweden. This year’s Spring Economic Bill statesthat “The overriding task for monetary policy is price stability”. In keeping with this and inorder to facilitate the implementation of a credible monetary policy, more and more countriesare striving to separate monetary policy decisions from day-to-day policy-making. The latestinstance of this comes from Britain, where one of the first things the new government did wasrelinquish control of interest rate policy to the Bank of England.The harm done by inflationHigh inflation impairs the workings of the economy. General price increasesmake it more difficult for households and firms to keep tabs on how the prices of certain goodsBIS Review   56/1997
- 2 -and services are moving in relation to others. It then also becomes more difficult for firms toknow which products are worth marketing, which investments will pay best and so on.A case in point and one that is certainly familiar to some of you is Sweden’sproperty boom in the 1980s. The combination of high inflation and the tax system in those daysmade speculation in real estate profitable. The property market then collapsed in the early 1990sand occasioned huge economic costs. The overheated real estate market had crowded out other,more productive investments and when the bubble burst, finance companies and banks were hitby loan losses at the same time as the ensuing adjustment entailed massive costs in the form oflost production and unemployment.There are also grounds for supposing that low, stable inflation moderates cyclicalfluctuations in economic activity. This seems to be the case, at least, in the United States, wheresince 1982 there have been two long expansionary phases separated by a single, relatively briefdownturn. Experience in Sweden points to the same conclusions. The first two post-war decades,for example, when inflation was low, were considerably more stable than the 1970s and 1980s,when inflation was left to rise and there was a series of devaluations, with negative effects onproductivity and growth.Moreover, the higher the rate of inflation, the more likely it is that the rate willfluctuate, which accentuates the uncertainty about future inflation. Savers and creditors thenrequire higher compensation for risk: besides compensation for the expected rate of inflation,they will demand a premium for the degree of uncertainty about future inflation. This meanshigher real interest rates, which weaken the propensity to invest.Furthermore, the more inflation fluctuates and is difficult to forecast, the greaterwill be its arbitrary and random effects on the distribution of income and wealth. Inflation tendsto redistribute from savers and lenders to borrowers, from those with fixed nominal incomes tothose who pay such incomes, and so on. Clearly, such arbitrary redistributional effects are hardlyin line with a distribution policy based on fairness.2. Developments since the crisisSeveral years of good growthSince the upturn from the profound crisis in 1991-93, economic growth inSweden has averaged 2.8 per cent, which is higher than we were accustomed to in theinflationary 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, the composition of growth has been favourable, withexports and investment predominating (Diagram 1). It should be underscored that this has beenaccompanied by the lowest level of inflation for decades.The low inflation as such has no doubt helped to make the economy functionbetter. The conditions for a long, stable upswing have improved. Together with clearer pricesignals, this makes it easier for households and firms to plan and make decisions. The workingsof the economy have also been improved by the tax reform, various deregulations and changesto social security systems. Competitive pressure has grown as a result of EU membership and theglobalisation of trade. The result is discernible in a higher rate of capital formation and structuralchanges in the economy.In both 1994 and 1995 GDP growth topped 3 per cent. In 1996 the growth of finaldemand remained fairly high, 2.1 per cent, and the rate accelerated in the second half-year to 2.6BIS Review   56/1997
- 3 -per cent from the corresponding period the year before. Total production, however, did notmatch the growth of final demand, the reason being that firms chose to trim stocks. The growthof GDP, which represents total output, stopped at 1.1 per cent in 1996.Diagram 1Composition of GrowthPercentage contributionsSSoouurrcece: : SSttaattiissttiiccs s SSwweeddeenn; ; 19919977--98 98 ffoorrecaecasst t bby y       NNaattiioonnaal l IInnssttiittuutte e oof f EEccoonnoommiic c RReesseaearrcchh--66--55--44--33--22--110011223344119993931199949411999595119996961199979711999898NNeet t eexxppoorrttssSSttoocck k bbuuiillddiinnggGGrroosss s ccaappiittaal l ffoorrmmaattiioonnCCoonnssuummppttiioonnStock trimming in the current cyclical phase is not uncommon; it occurred atmuch the same juncture in the 1970s and 1980s. It has to do with the tendency to produce inexcess of demand when activity is rising so as to avoid being unable to deliver if demand growsrapidly. In time, firms find they have accumulated surplus stocks and initiate an adjustment. Thishas the reverse effect - production rises more slowly than final demand.Under certain circumstances stock adjustments may trigger a more markedeconomic slowdown. This may happen, for instance, if effects of the adjustments either spreadto private consumption or have a negative impact on the labour market and householdconfidence. The Riksbank was therefore alert to the risk of private consumption being weakerlast spring and summer, which would have pointed to a further curb on inflation. In practice,however, private consumption went on rising in the summer and its growth became somewhatstronger in the autumn.Low inflation and interest rate reductionsThe rate of inflation decreased during 1996 and the rates that different economicagents expected in the future also moved down markedly (Diagram 2). This enabled theRiksbank to lower the repo rate from 8.91 to 4.10 per cent. As a result, the initial position for theongoing growth phase in Sweden’s economy is more favourable than for many years.The drop in the rate of consumer price increases was appreciably accentuated bythe Riksbank’s repo rate cuts in that these contributed to the reduction of mortgage interest costs.Under normal circumstances the tolerance interval around the price stability target should sufficeBIS Review   56/1997
- 4 -to absorb transitory effects on the price level. Last year, however, the fall in interest rates wasvery marked because many factors had a concerted effect that rapidly altered the picture ofinflation. The magnitude of that interest rate fall is also largely responsible for the weak pricetrend to date in 1997.Diagram 2Money Market Agents’ InflationExpectationsPer centOOcctt. . ’’9494OOcctt. . ’’9595MMaay y ’’9696NNoovv. ’. ’9696FFeebb. ’. ’9977Sources: Statistics Sweden and Prospera ResearchCPI--1100112233445594949595969697979898999900000101--11001122334455Diagram 3--1515--1212--99--66--3300336699992299339944995599669977--1515--1212--99--66--3300336699Components of the CPI percentage 12-month changeHHoouusse e mmoorrttggaagge e iinntteerreesst t ccoosst t ((99%%))IImmppoorrt t ((2244%%))DDoommeessttiic c ((6767%%))SSoouurrcceess: : SSttaattiissttiiccs s SSwweeddeen n aannd d tthhe e RRiikkssbbaannkkBIS Review   56/1997
- 5 -Different indicators of underlying inflation also show a declining rate of increase,though the picture measured in this way is not quite as dramatic (Diagram 3). Excluding housemortgage interest costs, the current rate of inflation is about 1 percentage point higher thanindicated by the CPI.It seems reasonable to conclude, however, that an evaluation of the Riksbank’spolicy for inflation must recognise that a part of the changes in the rate of inflation stems fromtransitory effects occasioned by the Riksbank’s own measures.3. The current assessmentThe March inflation reportI should now like to turn to the outlook for inflation in the coming years. In orderto provide as open and clear a picture as possible of how the Riksbank analyses the futureprospect for inflation and approaches the construction of monetary policy, we present reports onthis four times a year. In the latest report, published this March, it was considered that the GDPgrowth rates for 1997 and 1978 would be 2 and 3 per cent, respectively. It was also foreseen thatno appreciable capacity restrictions should arise in these years. With an unchanged monetarystance and given that households and firms continue to count on inflation remaining low,underlying domestic inflation (the CPI change excluding transitory effects on inflation) one totwo years ahead was judged to be between 1.5 and 2 per cent.In that the transitory effects will be dropping out of the 12-month change figures,however, registered inflation will move up by degrees in 1997 and 1998. In March we countedon the annual rate of inflation in 1997 being around 0.5 per cent, which would still be clearlybelow the inflation target. We also envisaged that in 1998 inflation would be somewhat below 2per cent.As we all know, forecasting economic activity and prices is not a simple matter.Since such assessments cannot be very exact, one has to weigh up risks and probabilities. Twosecondary alternatives were therefore discussed in the March report, where future inflation mightbe lower and higher, respectively, than in the main scenario.In the former alternative, lower inflation might result from a weaker developmentof consumption. In the latter, on the other hand, higher inflation might stem from a weakerexchange rate that leads to higher growth for exports and GDP, thereby generating strongerinflationary pressure.Against this background, I want to say something about our current view oftendencies for private consumption and the exchange rate.Private consumptionIn 1996 household disposable income fell, unexpectedly, by 0.1 per cent despite astrong increase in the wage bill. The National Institute of Economic Research and many otherobservers had expected a 2 per cent increase in disposable income. The growth of consumptionwas therefore financed entirely from a reduction of the saving ratio to 5.4 per cent. This hasaltered the starting point for assessing private consumption’s future path.BIS Review   56/1997
- 6 -In recent years household income has been greatly affected by measures forconsolidating government finance, mainly increased taxes and decreased transfers. But for theimpact of public systems, household income in each of the years 1994-98 would have been 3 to4 per cent higher (Diagram 4). As it is, the level is likely to be virtually unchanged. Thewithdrawal of household income probably peaked in 1996 but even in the two following yearsthe fiscal stance measured in this way is tight.Diagram 4Household Sector’s Real DisposableIncome, Gross and Net of Public SectorTransfers, Direct Taxes and Charges--66--55--44--33--22--11001122334455191999001919991119199922191999331919994419199955191999661919997719199988%GGrroosss s ddiissppoossaabbllee  iinnccoommeeDiDissppoossaabblle e iinnccoommeenneet t oof f ppuubblilic c sseeccttoorrSource: National Institute of Economic ResearchDiagram 5--88--66--44--22002244668810101212757577777979818183838585878789899191939395959797RReaeal l ssaavviinnggSSaavviinnggFFiinnaanncciiaal l ssaavviinnggSSoouurrcecess: : SSttaattiissttiiccs s SSwweeddeen n aannd d NNaattiioonnaal l IInnssttiittuutte e           oof f EEccoonnoommiic c RReesseaearrcchhHousehold Saving as a percentage ofDisposable IncomeBIS Review   56/1997
- 7 -A number of structural reforms (cuts in transfer systems, the tax reform, etc.)have probably elicited a permanent increase in the household saving ratio but the futuretendency is difficult to foresee. One approach is to compare with countries where the economicframework for households resembles that in Sweden. This suggests that both the household netsaving ratio and the ratio of total wealth to disposable income are relatively low in Sweden. Itthen seems unlikely that in a long-term perspective the saving ratio will fall back to thehistorically low levels in the 1980s (Diagram 5).Leading indicators point to a continuation of private consumption’s upwardtendency in the first quarter of 1997. House prices have shown signs of moving in recentmonths. A growing money supply and lending to the household sector likewise point to acontinued increase in consumption. Retail turnover, above all for consumer durables,strengthened in February and March, as is also evident in the March business tendency surveyfrom the National Institute. In the first four months of this year the number of cars newlyregistered in the household sector rose in annual terms by around 60 per cent. Households havebecome more optimistic about their own economy; in April a majority envisaged animprovement 12 months ahead.There is no cause at present to modify the main assessment in the inflation report- that consumption will show a stable but by no means dramatic rise in the coming years. But anappreciably weaker development of consumption, which was a prominent component of one ofthe alternative scenarios, seems to have become somewhat less probable.Exchange rateThe Riksbank does not target the exchange rate. The monetary policy target isprice stability. But the exchange rate does feature as one important factor in the Riksbank’sassessment of inflation in the coming two years.The exchange rate conditions demand in the economy, particularly in the exportsector, and also affects inflation directly in the form of import prices. The latter, moreimmediate effect is, however, transitory and of secondary interest provided it does not influenceinflation expectations and thereby price and wage setting behaviour.An assessment of future inflation therefore requires a forecast or judgement of theexchange rate in the coming two years, yet this is a variable that is notoriously difficult topredict and has fluctuated widely for Sweden since 1992. A natural starting point for this is thecurrent exchange rate together with an estimate of what a reasonable long-term level might be inrelation to competitiveness, financial saving, etc.The past six months provides an example of how the argument might go. SinceOctober 1996 the krona’s effective exchange rate has weakened by about 7 per cent. Most of thischange stems from the appreciation of sterling and the US dollar against currencies incontinental Europe (Diagram 6). Cyclical factors have been at work here; the United States andBritain are leading an upward phase and there have been expectations about future monetarypolicy that tended to strengthen both their currencies.But the krona has also fallen, particularly during the winter and spring, againstmost Central European currencies, including the German mark. At times this has had to do withunrest in Europe over the EMU process. Many market observers, however, also point to someuncertainty about the durability of Swedish economic policy.BIS Review   56/1997
- 8 -In the longer run there are good grounds for a stronger krona. Productivity in theSwedish economy has risen rapidly in recent years. The current account shows a large surplusand the expansion of export production should ultimately spread to the domestic sector. Theoutlook for inflation is favourable and government finance shows a considerable improvement.Still, there is reason to take the weakening of the krona seriously. Policy must continue to focuson consolidating government finance; budgetary improvements in connection with strongeconomic activity cannot be used for easing the fiscal stance.Under these circumstances, neither are there grounds as regards the exchange ratefor appreciably modifying the March assessment. To date in 1997, however, the krona has beensomewhat weaker than envisaged and this, together with the available indicators, points tomarginally higher export growth.*      *      *All in all, today there is no reason to revise the overall picture of the economy andinflation that was presented in the March inflation report. The tendencies to date seem to broadlyconfirm the assessments there.Various forward indicators suggest that the Swedish economy is again entering aperiod of increased growth. At the same time, most things point to price increases remaining lowthis year and next, which is the period we can assess at present.The repo rate was lowered most recently last December. Since then we havefrequently declared that the monetary stance is well balanced. This still applies.BIS Review   56/1997
Mr. Sheng looks at questions relating to financial regulation  Lecture byMr. Andrew Sheng, a Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, to theMacquarie University MA (Finance) Programme in Hong Kong on 8/5/97.“A state is better governed which has but few laws, and those laws are strictlyobserved”...René Descartes (1596-1650)IntroductionFinancial markets today are the biggest markets in the world. The foreignexchange market turns over US$ 1.2 trillion daily, roughly one quarter of annual world exports.The regulation of financial markets therefore concerns us all. This paper covers the What, Why,Who and How of financial regulation.Financial markets engage in the exchange of property rights. Financial assets arederivatives of physical or real assets, derivatives being property rights of property rights that arenot “lumpy” or asset specific, and transactions costs in them being lower than transactions in realassets.The first thing to remember about financial products is that they are all defined bythe law. Therefore, all financial transactions are about transactions in legal products, underprocedures regulated by rules or laws. Even financial institutions are, strictly speaking, legalconstructs. To paraphrase another French philosopher: Man is born free, but after that he isbound by the law.What is Financial Regulation?The Dictionary of Finance defines regulation as actions that ‘command andcontrol’ the individual decisions of firms, in an effort to prevent private decision-making thatwould take inadequate account of the ’public interest’. Regulation may be self-imposed, or, as isusual, by a third party. The Government may intervene in a market or industry in the form oflaw, administrative rules, taxation or moral suasion. Self-regulation could be imposed throughindustry associations and codes of conduct.The regulatory framework will shape market behaviour. Therefore, the design andpractice of the regulatory framework determines the efficiency and performance of the regulatedmarket.Why Regulations?There are a few theories that attempt to explain the existence and forms ofregulation, including:- the competition for regulation theory suggests that there exists a market forregulation, in which consumers and producers compete. Regulation will serve the interests ofthose who are willing to offer the most for the regulation. Since regulation can be regarded as apublic good, the free-rider problem suggests that the benefit to the individual consumer is likelyto be small relative to the producer. Therefore, producers will have more incentive to try andobtain favourable regulation through industry associations. A countervailing force is thereforethe consumer lobby; and   capture theory suggests that producers capture regulatory agencies andcontrol them in their own interests. Vested interests reinforce the regulatory framework toBIS Review   55/1997
- 2 -support their interests, but the danger is that such behaviour would result in non-competitivenessin the international market, leading to long-run social loss.If we believe the above theories, and assume that regulations impose ultimately acost on the consumer or taxpayer, it may be in the public interest to remove regulations andallow greater competition. This is the primary driving force behind current market deregulationpolicies prevalent in OECD markets.A recent example of the deregulation drive to “make markets work better” is thereport of the Australian Financial System Inquiry (Wallis Report), whose recommendations seekto:-create a flexible regulatory structure which will be more responsive to the forcesfor change operating on the financial system;clarify regulatory goals;increase the accountability of the agencies charged with meeting those goals;ensure that the regulation of similar financial products be more consistent andpromote competition by improving comparability;introduce greater competitive neutrality across the financial system;establish more contestable, efficient and fair financial markets, resulting inreduced costs to consumers;provide more effective regulation for financial conglomerates which will alsofacilitate competition and efficiency; andfacilitate the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system.On the other hand, a market without regulation also does not work. Free bankingand frontier capitalism results in control by the Mafia, with huge losses inflicted on the innocentand unwary. The public interest theory argues that regulation is an attempt to correct for marketfailures, such as monopoly, externalities and lack of information. For example, the social cost ofthe failure of a financial institution may be much higher than the private cost to the institutionitself. Therefore, financial institutions left to themselves will accept more risk than is optimalfrom a systemic point of view, thus forming the basic case for government regulation of bankingactivity and the establishment of capital requirements (Martin Feldstein, quoted in Dale, 1996).On this basis, we can justify the case for external regulations on private sectorbehaviour on four broad grounds which all relate to market failure:-first, the moral hazard argument. If a market participant believes that the state willunderwrite his losses, then behaviour will change. A good example is how deposit insuranceencourages depositors and bankers to engage in risky behaviour that forces the state to pay in theend, thus undermining market discipline and entailing regulation.second, the widows and orphans argument. These regulations provide protectionto poorly (asymmetrically) informed clients, based on the view that small depositors andinvestors cannot assess properly the riskiness of financial institutions they deal with.third, the public policy argument. In free market economies, public policyarguments call for competition and free trade. An example would be anti-trust laws in somecountries to prevent monopolisation of certain markets.fourth, the systemic risk issue, which allows the state to prevent the failure of oneparticipant to destabilize the whole system. This justifies the regulation, for example, of thepayment system and the banking sector.BIS Review   55/1997
- 3 -Regulation therefore has two important dimensions that must always be borne inmind. First, regulation is a cost that is like taxation: someone bears the cost of regulation. Thepublic must always ask whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Second, regulation has a timeelement - regulations must change with the times. Old regulations may prevent or impedemarket growth. As markets change, so must regulations. Third, regulation should not prevent theeffective working of market forces. For example, we should avoid bank failures, but not preventall bank failures. Chairman Alan Greenspan of the US Fed (1997), said “our goal as supervisorsshould not be to prevent all bank failures, but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so thatbanking problems that do occur do not become widespread.”What are we regulating?We can regulate products, functions or institutions or a combination of all three.Problems arise when we have overlapping regulatory terrain, competing regulatory agencies andconfused regulatory objectives. There are also arguments for and against the concentration andcompetition in regulatory agencies. A good example of a one-stop regulatory agency is theMonetary Authority of Singapore, which combines the regulation of the banking system, thesecurities market and the insurance industry in one institution. At the other end of the spectrum,the US banking sector is regulated by at least four different agencies, the Federal Reservesystem, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC) and the state banking commissioners. Since US banks are increasinglyengaged in securities areas, their functions are also subject to the Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) and consumer lobbies. Regulation may be based on product types such thateach regulatory authority specialises in one financial product. Under this framework, a securitiesregulator will concentrate in the oversight of securities activities, irrespective of the type offinancial institutions that are carrying out this business.Functional regulation is generally conducted by two separate regulatory bodies,an investor protection arm and a systemic stability arm. The investor protection arm deals withretail depositors and small investors to ensure fair conduct, equitable competition and customerprotection.The systemic stability agency, on the other hand, looks at the larger players andwholesale activities. It would also be responsible for the safety, structure and functioning of allpayment systems and financial markets. Preventive measures include capital adequacyrequirements; constraints on connected lending and other rules aimed at preventing insolvency;and an official safety net such as lender of last resort or deposit insurance.This approach follows the Goodhart (1995) model, which suggests that thedifference in focus and function of investor protection and systemic stability is large enough tojustify two separate regulatory bodies in each country to share the regulatory responsibilities.According to Goodhart, the formulation of rules for the safety of the system should be theresponsibility of the systemic stability arm. On the other hand, the monitoring and operation ofthe system should be divided between the two arms on the basis of their size, e.g. balance sheet.Another regulatory framework, which developed historically, takes the form ofinstitutional regulation. It reflects institutional segmentation within each country, with insurancecompanies, securities houses, mortgage lending companies and banks becoming the concern ofdiffering regulatory bodies. Institutional regulation becomes less practicable as the barriersbetween operating in differing functional and geographical financial markets have been eroded.BIS Review   55/1997
- 4 -In between, the regulatory system may be organised along mixedfunctional/institutional lines. As banks, securities houses and insurance companies compete ineach other’s turf, there is now a less meaningful difference between institutions and functions.One model, colloquially known as “Twin Peaks”, consists of a Financial Stability Commission,with responsibility for systemic risk, the prudential supervision of all major institutions, andconduct of business regulation of wholesale activities, and a Consumer Protection Commission,which could be in charge of conduct of business regulation in retail markets, as well as detectingmarket manipulation and insider dealing. It would also carry out prudential supervision of thosestock brokers and fund managers who deal with private clients, and of independentintermediaries. This is essentially the model adopted by the Wallis Commission.Approaches to RegulationThe latest mantra on financial regulation is the International Monetary Fund’sapproach, which calls for “Internal Governance, Official Oversight, and MarketIncentives”(Lindgren, 1996). To this, I would add, “Robust Financial Infrastructure”.The first line of protection against bank failure must be internal management’sown risk controls. The growing complexity and variety of banking business suggests that neitherthe authorities nor informed customers can prevent internal management from making mistakesif internal controls do not work. The best defense against mistakes and fraud are proper internalgovernance, or checks and balances. Internal dual controls, together with both internal andexternal auditors, plus a proper disclosure policy would give the best incentives for internalmanagement to perform according to proper rules of behaviour.Public disclosure rather than private channels of information would be cheaperand reduce unwarranted expectations of what a regulator or supervisor can actually achieve.However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee full disclosure. It is doubtful whether freemarkets work well enough in conditions where information is partial and asymmetricallydistributed and externalities exist. Thus, it is not really possible for the authorities to shiftentirely to reliance on disclosure and to abandon their specialised supervisory function.Increasingly, therefore, the public oversight function is one of monitoring andsurveillance, to ensure that systemic risks are not incurred at excessive public costs. When bestpractices and market standards are applied, any behaviour by regulatees that deviate from thenorm would be subject to public scrutiny. There is therefore greater pressure for establishinginternational norms of performance, such as capital adequacy standards and risk managementtools. The Basle Committee has recently established “Core Principles” to guide the regulation ofbanks.The application of certain regulatory tools, such as required capital ratios,exposure limits, constraints on self-dealing and CAMEL ratings are designed to ensure thatmarket participants comply with minimal standards of capital and risk exposures. It should beemphasised that effective regulation requires proper compliance and enforcement. Thisembodies the idea of “bark versus bite”. Teeth must also include sound exit policies - non-exitimplies no enforcement, which is the case of state-owned enterprises in the Mainland of China.However, increasingly it is recognized that such rules should be kept simple and broad-brushed,in order to allow a rule-based environment to function. Too many rules impose too heavy aregulatory cost, with redundant or excessive information burdens.BIS Review   55/1997
- 5 -However, given very rapidly changing market conditions, some degree ofdiscretion can be more practical than rigid rules. On the other hand, excessive discretion can leadto systematic forbearance (time inconsistency) that undermine rules and could even be subject tocorruption and abuse. Therefore, the time inconsistency problem can be solved by authoritiespre-committing themselves to a sequence of automatic, graduated responses, giving the markettime to adjust to rule changes or rule application.However, it must be true that the incentive or pay-off structure is one that mustnot be overlooked. One of the main reasons why agents do not abide by established controlprocedures is because it is not in their own perceived interest to do so (Goodhart, 1996). Thebest way to control risks is the market incentive to do so. For the market to work, there must beadequate information transparency, and an adequate pay (or penalty) structure that causes theprivate sector or market to regulate itself. For example, excessive bonuses may have caused theBarings management to overlook the risks assumed by Leeson. Low pay for internal auditorsrelative to dealers may prevent them from raising the alarm bell. Internal audit committees offinancial institutions should signify that they have considered the implications for the riskpreferences of key personnel of their pay structures.It is now better recognized that a robust financial infrastructure is also a form ofregulator on market participant behaviour. Modern financial infrastructure, such as automatedpayment systems, impose on market participants certain minimum standards of performance,such as time compliance in payments. Failure of one participant to perform would immediatelyexpose the participant to market discipline. There is therefore peer pressure on marketparticipants to comply with the standards demanded by international payment systems.Costs of RegulationRegulation is not without costs. The US estimates that regulation costs theconsumer roughly 7% of GDP annually, both directly or indirectly. Bank regulation can belikened to deposit insurance - the higher the regulation and safety, the higher the insurancepremium. One theory suggests that banks can elect to be one of three categories: super-safebanks, safe or normal. Super-safe banks are only allowed to hold super-safe assets, but in returnhave 100% deposit insurance. Normal banks are allowed to hold any asset, but depositors get noprotection at all. But super-safe assets offer a lower yield than normal assets, so the safer thebank the lower the interest rate offered to the depositors.The cost of regulation lies not only in the cost of preventing bank failure, but alsothe opportunity costs of foregone innovation. Excessive or outmoded regulation results in loss ofinternational competitiveness, thus imposing future adjustment costs on the economy. Hence,there is a need to review regulations constantly and to de-regulate or re-regulate.Why are we deregulating?There are four major reasons why deregulation is occurring:GlobalisationFinancial innovation and disintermediationChanging consumer behaviour, e.g. aging populationExcessive costsBIS Review   55/1997
- 6 -The globalisation of financial markets can be demonstrated by the tremendousincrease in cross-border transactions. For instance, at the end of 1994 the stock of cross-borderbank assets was more than 4.5 times its level of 15 years earlier, which represents an increasefrom 20% of the combined GDP of OECD countries in 1980 to around 35% in 1994. Between1980 and 1994 cross-border securities transactions in industrial countries expanded from lessthan 10% of GDP to well above 100% of GDP. Within the equity sector, cross-exchange andcross-border transactions have increased rapidly as a percentage of world equity turnover to thepoint where one in four stock market trades conducted world-wide involves either a foreignsecurity or a foreign counterparty.The globalisation of financial markets may increase systemic risk, throughcontagious financial disorders originating in poorly regulated financial centres. As AlanGreenspan (1997) mentioned, ’the efficiency of global financial markets, engendered by therapid proliferation of financial products, has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far fasterpace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago, and not evenremotely imagined in the 19th century.’ Depositors, investors and counterparties may beexposed to foreign jurisdiction risks which they are not in a position to monitor or control.Besides, the co- existence of uneven national regulations and global markets may severelydistort competition between financial institutions.The growing integration of markets calls for international cooperation amongsupervisors. Accordingly, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision was established in 1974and is involved in establishing a common regulatory framework. The Basle Committee and theInternational Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) issued co-ordinated guidelineson risk management on OTC derivatives business. IOSCO also adopted the so-called WindsorDeclaration on co-operation between supervisors of futures and options markets. Industryinitiatives also aimed at strengthening prudential standards in international financial markets.The Group of Thirty has proposed minimum standards relating to netting arrangements,settlement procedures and managerial oversight of derivatives risks. The International SecuritiesDealers Association (ISDA) has established good practice guidelines for the management ofderivatives and FX business globally by broker-dealers. And in early 1996, 49 exchanges andclearing houses announced an agreement to exchange information on their members’ riskexposures in different markets.Another key development in international financial markets is the emergence offinancial conglomerates which provides a wide range of services including insurance, securities,mortgage lending and banking services etc.. The fusion of different types of business is madepossible by deregulation initiatives in major financial centres. In London, the rules of the StockExchange were amended in 1986 to allow acquisition of member firms by outsiders, includingbanks, thereby ending the separation of banking and securities businesses which had been afeature of the UK financial services industry for some 300 years.In the US, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 still formally separates banking fromsecurities businesses, but through liberal interpretation of this statute the US regulatoryauthorities have in recent years permitted the US banks to develop significant securitiesoperations through special-purpose affiliates. Furthermore, there is a widespread consensuswithin the US that Glass-Steagall should be repealed. In Japan, the Financial System ReformLaw that came into effect in 1993 allowed commercial banks and securities firms to expand intoeach others’ business territory by establishing separate subsidiaries. In the European Union, thecapital adequacy directive’s trading-book approach permits banks to engage freely in securitiesactivities.BIS Review   55/1997
- 7 -The revolution in information and data processing technology has transformedour financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In mostrespects, these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transactioncosts, to the benefit of consumers of financial services, and for managing risks. But in manyrespects they highlight the inadequacies of existing regulations.The ease and cheapness of gathering, processing and disseminating informationhas encouraged financial innovation in a number of areas, including the development ofscreen-based trading systems, securitisation and the proliferation of derivative products.One of the regulatory responses to financial conglomerates is the adoption ofconsolidated supervision. Regulators should consider whether various businesses within aconglomerate (banking, securities, insurance, etc.) should be consolidated in an accounting sensefor the purpose of calculating capital adequacy and other prudential ratios, and for assessment ingeneral. The more general view expressed, for instance, in European financial market directivesand Basle regulatory guidelines is that like activities should be treated identically for supervisorypurposes, regardless of the category of institution. It is also important that bank and securitiesregulators co-operate at the international level.Financial innovation, e.g. derivatives trading, creates transparency problems forregulators, because of the speed and complexity of risk transformation. The appropriate responseof market transparency is more extensive disclosure of financial information. But in the contextof fast-moving derivatives business the difficulty is to formulate effective disclosure rules thatdo more than provide an outdated snapshot of risk exposures. For management of financialinstitutions, the main emphasis must be on internal controls. External regulators, such as theBasle Committee and IOSCO, have responded and issued detailed guidelines on riskmanagement. As trading position can be transformed swiftly through the use of derivatives andhence may not be reliable, regulatory focus has shifted to assess internal risk models, rather thanthe instruments held at a point in time. In addition to external regulation, the Group of Thirty inits 1993 study of derivatives made recommendations at strengthening risk-managementtechniques and procedures. Another industry initiative was JP Morgan’s decision to release itsown proprietary risk-management model for general use.In addition, changing consumer behaviour resulting from aging population, forexample, calls for new and sophisticated products like pension funds and long-term debtinstruments. Also, consumers’ expectations are likely to be higher as they now have access tomore choices from more diversified markets.Finally, de-regulation has occurred because old regulations have not prevented themassive losses incurred by worldwide bank failures. In many countries, the losses caused bybank failures have been as high as 15% of GDP, with bank losses in Japan and France at anestimated 8% of GDP. In the light of these heavy costs, governments around the world havebegun to look seriously at the cost of regulation. The latest initiative include the Japanese BigBang, which would be complete by 2000.Should the Central Bank also act as the Supervisor?There are several arguments in support of the assumption of the supervisory roleby the central bank. The first is efficiency consideration. There is huge overlap between theareas of interest of, and information required by, and available to, both the supervisor and thecentral bank. Second, rescue or liquidity crisis will normally involve and require the immediateBIS Review   55/1997
- 8 -provision of liquidity, which can only be done by the central bank. This is facilitated byinternalising the supervisory body within the central bank.Others argue the reverse. First, since the finance of any large rescues involvesgovernment funding, the politicians have a direct interest and involvement in financialregulation. This may undermine the independence of a central bank if it also plays a supervisoryrole. Second, it is argued that an independent central bank in its conduct of monetary policy andbeing responsible for banking supervision may be perceived as too powerful. Third, the failureof a central bank in its supervisory duties will harm its credibility in its conduct of monetarypolicy. There is an inherent conflict between supervision and monetary policy. Central bankassistance to bail out problem banks tends to be inflationary on the money supply.The arguments are finely balanced. Whether the regulatory power should becentralized or diffused will depend very much on the legal, constitutional and historicalbackground for each financial system.ConclusionRegulation is an art, not a science. It involves complicated trade-offs betweencompeting interests. As Walter Bagehot said over 120 years ago, money will not manage itself.The regulation of money will be debated in the years to come.References:Bank for International Settlements, “Report on Financial Stability in EmergingMarket Economies”, April, 1997Bullock, Alan, Stallybrass Oliver and Trombley Stephen, The Fontana Dictionaryof Modern Thought, Fontana Press, 1988Commonwealth of Australia, “Financial System Inquiry: Final Report Overview”- the Wallis Report -, Australian Government Publishing Service, March 1997Dale, Richard, Regulating the New Financial Markets, Proceedings of aconference “The Future of the Financial System” held at the H.C.

Mr. Duisenberg assesses what we have learned from the Marshall PlanDinner speech held by the President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for InternationalSettlements, Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, at the occasion of the Marshall Plan celebration inWashington on 15/5/97.On 5th June this year it will be exactly 50 years ago since George C. Marshall, ina speech at Harvard University, set out his plans for the economic recovery of Europe. AlthoughI fear that I will not succeed in making as momentous a speech as Marshall did, I am honouredto speak to you here today and commemorate this historic occasion, which I believe marks thestarting point of Europe’s post-war economic miracle.Anniversaries such as this present a useful opportunity to reflect on our pastsuccesses and to draw lessons from them. This is the challenging task which the organisers ofthis conference have set out before me today and I will endeavour not to disappoint them. Indoing so, I would like to start out by pondering for a moment on what it was exactly that theMarshall Plan contributed to post-war economic recovery. Although the importance of theMarshall Plan is relatively undisputed, the channels through which it boosted economic growthhave been the subject of lively debate. Only if the role of the Marshall Plan is put into the properperspective, can we hope to fruitfully draw on our past experiences. Subsequently, I will attemptto apply what we have learned to the current transformation process in Central and EasternEurope, which shows some interesting similarities with post-war reconstruction. As I will argue,however, the transformation process in transition economies is, in other respects, uniquelydifferent. In my view this precludes using the Marshall Plan as a blueprint for aid to transitioneconomies, although it harbours some important lessons.Finally, a word of caution is in order. I am a central banker. As such, I will focuson the economic aspects of the Marshall Plan, not the political ones. Such a discussion isnecessarily incomplete; but I will leave it to others to comment on the political and diplomaticcontext in which Marshall aid took place.The contribution of the Marshall Plan – distinguishing fact from fictionMarshall aid was a lifeline from the United States to Europe at a time when,economically, Europe had been brought down to its knees. Between 1948–1951 the programannually transferred roughly 1% of American GDP, or around $ 13 billion in aid, to some 16European countries. In net present value terms this amounts to roughly $ 80 billion. By 1951, sixyears after the war and the effective end of the Marshall Plan, national incomes per capita weremore than 10 percent above pre-war levels, while the economic growth rate in the next twodecades reached levels which were twice as high as for any comparable period before or since.This temporal coincidence between the extension of Marshall aid and the“miraculous” recovery of Europe has induced the inferral of a causal relationship. It should benoted, however, that, even after extensive academic research, the roots of Europe’s economicmiracle are not yet adequately understood. Thus, it is difficult to isolate the contribution of theMarshall Plan. Economically, the strong post-war growth performance is in large part explainedby the so-called Solow residual – that is, not by traditional factors such as capital and labour.This is an economist’s way of saying we do not fully understand what is going on.A first observation in this regard is that the reconstruction of Europe did not startin 1948 – the year in which the first Marshall aid was disbursed – but in 1945. At that time theUS was already channelling large amounts of aid to Europe through the United Nations ReliefBIS Review   54/1997
- 2 -and Recovery Administration and other programs. This aid, which was in the order of $ 4 billionannually in the first two post-World War II years, was – in flow terms – in the same order ofmagnitude as the Marshall aid.A second observation is that, given the unprecedented magnitude of aid from theperspective of the donor community, the Marshall Plan in a quantitative sense played a smallerrole than one would expect in accelerating the replacement and expansion of the Europeancapital stock. Marshall aid accounted for less than 2.5% of the combined national incomes ofrecipient countries between 1948 and 1951. While this is indeed a significant sum, this resultedin at most a 1% increase in investment, at a time when domestic investment was running at 15%of GNP. In other words, this does not explain growth rates several percentage points above theirhistoric trend levels. It should be noted, however, that growth may have been stimulated throughother channels, for instance, by providing much-needed hard currency reserves which could beused for financing industrial raw materials. Over a third of Marshall aid was used in this way.A third observation is that the Marshall Plan also did not play a large role infinancing the reconstruction of devastated infrastructure as this had been largely accomplishedbefore the program got underway. In fact, countries that were major aid recipients saw thegovernment spending share of national income fall relative to other nations, the opposite of whatone would expect if there had in fact been a shortage of public investment capital.So how did Marshall aid matter? Recently, there has been a shift amongacademics to what might be termed as a “revisionist” analysis of the contribution of the MarshallPlan to European recovery. According to this view, the Plan’s main contribution was to alter theenvironment in which economic policy was made, tilting the balance in a qualitative mannerrather than quantitatively.As you will recall, in 1947, two years after the war, Europe was still characterisedby macroeconomic instability, inflation and an increasingly tight balance of payments constraint.The initial response by governments had been to counter inflation by retaining controls, therebyprompting the growth of black markets and discouraging transactions at official prices. Bydistorting the allocative mechanism of the market, saving and initiative were discouraged. Theappropriate response as prescribed by economic theory would have been to decontrol prices toinduce producers to bring their goods to market. In addition, fiscal discipline and monetaryrestraint was necessary, in order to reduce inflationary pressures. Such policies, however, requirepolitical compromise and sacrifice by everyone which at that time, when the needs of Europewere greatest, were not necessarily forthcoming. The Marshall Plan may have played a criticalrole by easing decisions over the distribution of scarce resources. Of course, the extended aid didnot obviate the need for sacrifice but it increased the size of the distributional pie available to thevarious interest groups.In my opinion, however, the most important channel through which the MarshallPlan contributed is through its conditionality, with which the US was able to exercise significantinfluence over the economic policies of Marshall aid recipients. Although over the years the Planhas become synonymous with the substantial aid flows transferred from the US to Europe, it isuseful to recall that before receiving that aid each recipient country had to sign a bilateral pactwith the US. In that pact, countries agreed to balance their budgets, restore financial stability,stabilise the exchange rate at realistic levels and enhance mutual cooperation. Along with thecarrot, thus came the stick. In many ways this is similar to the approach followed in later yearsby the International Monetary Fund in its macroeconomic adjustment programs.BIS Review   54/1997
- 3 -Not only could the Marshall aid itself not be spent freely – it could be spent onexternal goods only with the approval of the US government – but the recipient was alsorequired to place a matching amount of domestic currency in a counterpart fund to be used onlyfor purposes approved by the Marshall Plan administration. As such, for each dollar of Marshallaid, the US had control over 2 dollars of real resources. In some instances the US insisted thatthe funds be used to buttress financial stability. Britain used the bulk of its counterpart funds toretire public debt. In the case of France, the US used the counterpart funds as a tool to pressurethe new government into reaffirming its willingness to continue policies leading to a balancedbudget. West Germany found the release of counterpart funds delayed until the nationalisedrailway had reduced expenditures to match revenues.Nations undergoing high inflation could not draw on counterpart funds until theMarshall Plan administration was satisfied that they had achieved a workable stabilisationprogram. As a condition for receiving Marshall Plan aid, each country was required to develop aprogram for removing trade controls in order to promote intra-European trade. The multilateralmanner in which this was achieved – through the OECD in which all Marshall recipients wereunited – contributed significantly to the European integration process. The most importantinstitutional innovation in this regard was the establishment of the European Payments Union in1950, a product of the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan should thus be thought of as a large andhighly successful structural adjustment program.At this stage, I believe it is useful to draw two preliminary lessons:–The first lesson to be drawn from the Marshall Plan is that the central elementin post-war Europe’s economic success was sound economic policy.–The second lesson is that even aid flows in the order of magnitude as thoseunder the Marshall Plan are likely to be small compared to resources generateddomestically. Nevertheless such aid flows are likely to facilitate the adoptionof otherwise painful economic policies.A new Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe?An interesting question is to what extent we can apply these lessons to the currenttransformation process in Central and Eastern Europe, to which I will refer as Eastern Europefrom now on? To some extent, of course, this question is rendered out of date by the fact that thetransition process in a number of countries has been underway for over seven years now.The International Monetary Fund has more or less adopted a role similar to that ofthe Marshall Plan. Through its macroeconomic adjustment programs credits are extended on thebasis of countries meeting economic performance criteria. As such, IMF macroeconomicstabilisation programs form a crucial first step in the transformation process, without which thelonger lasting structural reforms cannot take hold. Of the early reformers – Hungary, Poland, theCzech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltics, Croatia and Slovenia – only Hungary still has an IMFprogram, but it is of a precautionary nature; no purchases are made. In fact, since 1995 thesecountries have been making net payments to the Fund and some have obtained access tointernational financial markets. Others, however, are less advanced and still in need of therequired reforms.The transition process, so far, seems to mirror the circumstances leading to theadoption of the Marshall Plan in two important regards. First, financial instability which wasBIS Review   54/1997
- 4 -pervasive in the early years of post-World War II Europe is also present in several transitioneconomies. As for Europe 50 years ago, an important precondition for growth to take off is thestabilisation of prices and, after an initial adjustment, the exchange rate. This has been thepurview of the IMF in its adjustment programs, which through the extension of credits hassomewhat facilitated the adoption of painful economic policies.Second, both Europe in 1948 and Eastern Europe at present have experienced aperiod of intensive government intervention, albeit for different reasons. This has created a habitof control and regulation along with a certain unease with the workings of the market, similar tothe mistrust of the market in post-war Europe following the failure of market mechanismsduring the Great Depression. In both periods, the myriad of restrictions needs to be abolished,and structural reform needs to take hold.But there are also important differences between the transformation process andpost-war recovery. The Marshall Plan was effective at least in part because Europe hadexperience with markets. It possessed the institutions needed for their operation. Property rights,bankruptcy codes, court systems to enforce market contracts – not to mention entrepreneurialskills – all were in place. This institutional basis has been lacking in Eastern Europe. Moreover,the physical allocation mechanism and absence of meaningful prices were much more extremethan under wartime rationing.Second, the scale on which enterprises in Eastern Europe need to be restructuredfinds no comparison in post-war Europe. On the issue, for instance, how fast to close certainfactories given the absence of an adequate social safety net, the experience of post-war Europe isof little help simply because there was little to close down. In addition, the post-war experiencedoes not teach us how to implement mass privatisation, nor how to put a huge sector of largestate enterprises on a commercial basis, all simultaneously.Third, transition economies have to liberalise their economies in an already highlyliberalised international environment and of highly developed international capital markets. Insuch a context, policy mistakes or a lack of market confidence can easily lead to a large andrapid outflow of capital, thus draining away much-needed savings. These problems areexacerbated by weak financial systems where experience and expertise in, for instance, creditallocation is lacking.So what does Eastern Europe need?This leads me to believe that the needs of Eastern Europe are different from thoseof post-war Europe under the Marshall Plan. At a conference several years ago, the reformprocess in Eastern Europe was compared first with post-war reconstruction and then with thereconversion of regions or industries in decline.1 Of the latter, we have plenty of examples, forinstance, the shipbuilding industry in Europe or the coal, steel and textile sectors. Generallyspeaking, the transformation of these industries is a slow and painful process, usually at a highcost. Whereas post-war reconstruction was a process of building upon what existed,reconversion, by its nature, implies changing and perhaps destroying the existing structure, notbuilding upon it. This is much harder to achieve. Which experience is the more relevant forEastern Europe? In my opinion: reconversion. The discussion in Eastern Europe is not so much                                               1Blanchard O. “Panel discussion: Lessons for Eastern Europe today”, Postwar Economic Reconstructionand Lessons for the East Today, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1993.BIS Review   54/1997
- 5 -about rebuilding existing structures, but rather about replacing them by new ones; similar to thereplacement of declining West European industries by new ones.The question is whether we can aid this reconversion process by transferringcomparable amounts of money towards Eastern Europe as under the Marshall Plan. Transferringthe equivalent of 2.5% of national incomes of the recipient countries, has been estimated to costroughly $ 20 billion a year. The Bretton Woods institutions have of course been extendingcredits but on a smaller scale. By comparison, the annual flow of total official financing toEastern Europe has been around $ 15 billion, some 25% below that which was transferred underthe Marshall Plan. Total flows, however, including private financing, reached some $ 36 billionin 1996. From the recipient’s perspective, therefore, the amount of financing transferred toEastern Europe is quite significant. From a donor’s perspective, on the other hand, the presenteffort still pales somewhat compared to the tremendous display of solidarity by the US afterWorld War II. In this regard, we should remember that the US financed the entire Marshall Planby itself. If industrial countries were to make a similar effort and transfer 1% of their GDP toEastern Europe, aid flows to this region would amount to more than $ 170 billion a year, muchmore than the current $ 15 billion. This again illustrates the unique nature of the post-war UScontribution. It is uncertain whether increasing the amount of official financing to Marshall aidstandards would yield significant additional benefits. It could further facilitate support forrequired reforms, but to measure the marginal benefit of extra aid in these political terms is verydifficult. In any case, it is critical that whatever programs are adopted, aid should be provided onthe basis of actions taken rather than need.The achievements of the Marshall Plan suggest that the transformation process inEastern Europe would be significantly enhanced by intensifying mutual cooperation in the area.Cooperation in the fields of trade, financial and monetary matters could become the engine ofeconomic growth just as it was during the post-war boom. Between 1948–1952 trade amongEuropean countries increased more than 5 times as fast as European trade with other continents.One of the lessons of the post-war era is that trade can be the engine in a process of economicrestructuring. At the same time, the post-war experience evinced the importance of foreigndemand in underpinning a supply-side response. In other words, access for the East Europeancountries to the markets of the European Community. The European Union has concluded“Europe Agreements” with ten Eastern European countries. These are important steps and theycan be built upon further. Constructive mutual cooperation will be most conducive to a positiveperception of the region’s stability, thereby helping attract investment.Cooperation could gain an added dimension in the future. Several EasternEuropean countries have already joined the OECD as members and are knocking on the door ofthe European Union. Although eventual EU membership is a process that will require sometime, it is a realistic perspective. The European Union is in the process of completing a processof deepening cooperation, which will find its preliminary climax in the establishment of theeuro. Subsequent to the creation of full monetary union we may expect the EU to turn its sightseastwards, leading to an ever more integrated Europe.Let me conclude by reaffirming that the Marshall Plan was an important part ofthe foundation for post-war European recovery. At the same time, Marshall aid was more thanthe transfer of money alone. The economic policy conditions attached to this aid constituted anessential element in the realisation of the reconstruction process. Like the US after World WarII, the IMF has stepped into the transformation process of transition economies, albeit on asmaller scale in financial terms. In part, this may reflect the lower importance attached to therole of finance per se, and, in part, simply the lack of adequate donor funds forthcoming. DespiteBIS Review   54/1997
- 6 -this, however, Eastern Europe is on the right track. And although EU membership is still someway off, the prospect of such membership and the economic cooperation and integration beingpursued to achieve that membership, inspires confidence that the lessons of the Marshall Planhave indeed been taken to heart.BIS Review   54/1997
Bank of Japan’s May review of monetary and economic trends in JapanBANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 20/5/97.Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend despite somefluctuations caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate, with private demand showingunderlying firmness.  With respect to final demand, public-sector investment has decreased, andhousing investment has declined, reflecting the reversal in the stepped-up demand which tookplace ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate.  However, net exports have continued to riseand business fixed investment is increasing steadily. Despite the reversal in the stepped-updemand caused by the consumption tax rate hike, the recovery in personal consumption has notbeen hindered, given the moderate but firm recovery in labor market conditions and incomeformation. In these circumstances, industrial production has been firm to recover the level ofinventories which declined owing to the temporary surge in demand ahead of the rise in theconsumption tax rate.  Meanwhile, prices have stopped declining, and growth in monetaryaggregates has continued at around 3.0 per cent.With regard to personal consumption, outlays for travel have continued toincrease moderately.  With respect to goods, sales particularly in expensive goods surged inMarch 1997 ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate, followed by a decline in April as itsreaction.  Passenger-car sales recorded buoyant two-digit growth year-to-year for sixconsecutive months between October 1996 and March 1997, but showed a two-digit declineyear-to-year in April.  Although sales of electrical appliances, as well as sales at departmentstores and supermarkets, rose significantly in March 1997, April figures available for departmentstores in Tokyo are significantly below the previous year’s level.  However, the recovery trendin personal consumption do not seem to have been hindered, as labor market conditions as wellas household income formation are improving steadily, albeit moderately.Among leading indicators of business fixed investment, machinery orders haveincreased steadily.  Construction floor area has also continued to recover moderately.With respect to housing investment, housing starts in terms of theseasonally-adjusted annual rate reached a significantly high level in the fourth quarter 1996,partly reflecting the stepped-up demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate.  Later,they declined as the surge in demand reversed.Regarding public-sector investment, the amount of public works contracted hasquite recently picked up somewhat, reflecting orders included in the supplementary budget forfiscal 1996.  However, public-sector investment has been on a declining trend since spring 1996when orders from the large economic stimulus package peaked out.Real exports are increasing, reflecting the moderate expansion of overseaseconomies and the effects of the yen’s depreciation between mid-1995 and April 1997 .  Realimports have also continued to increase, reflecting such elements as the rise in domestic demand.However, growth has been moderate compared to that in exports against the background of thenarrowing price differentials between home and abroad caused by the yen’s depreciation.Reflecting these developments in exports and imports, the real trade surplus has been risingsince the second half of 1996.  The nominal current-account surplus is also increasing, but itsincrease has been more moderate owing to rising crude oil prices until early 1997 andfluctuations in the income account.Industrial production increased at a significant pace in the fourth quarter 1996 andthe first quarter 1997.  Industrial production in April and May is expected to remain virtuallyBIS Review   54/1997
- 2 -unchanged at the level recorded in the first quarter 1997 despite the reversal in the surge in finaldemand.  This has partly been supported by the recovery in inventories from the low level at theend of March 1997 created by the temporary surge in demand ahead of the consumption taxhike.Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately on the whole.Although the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth has beenmoderate, growth in nominal wages has been accelerating somewhat, reflecting the increase inproduction and corporate profits.  The ratio of job offers to job applications has continued toimprove.Prices have stopped declining.  Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonalelectricity rates) rose by almost 2 per cent in April 1997, as the rise in the consumption tax ratewas almost fully passed on to prices.  Downward pressures remain strong, including those fromtechnological innovation, such as in electrical machinery, but domestic wholesale prices haveremained unchanged or have risen marginally.  This reflects the yen’s depreciation and higheroil prices to date, as well as the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demandconditions.  The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices are narrowing steadily, mainlyowing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions, although leasing charges continueto decline.  In consumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables), overall consumer prices aremarginally above the previous year’s level mainly because the year-to-year declines in goodsprices have slowed.Growth in monetary aggregates, measured in terms of the year-to-year growthrate of M2 + CDs average outstanding, has slowed somewhat compared to that in summer 1996,reflecting the shift of assets to those outside M2 + CDs.  Recently, M2 + CDs averageoutstanding grew at around 3 per cent on the whole.Regarding money market rates, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) hasmoved at a level slightly below the official discount rate.  The 3-month CD rate has stayed ataround 0.55 per cent.  Meanwhile, the long-term government bond yield declined to a recordlow of below 2.1 per cent in early April 1997.  However, it recently rose to around 2.5 per centas market uncertainties about the economic outlook and about Japanese financial institutionshave gradually subsided in line with developments in the stock market.With respect to bank lending rates, the short-term prime lending rate hasremained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995.  The long-term primelending rate had been moving at the record low of 2.5 per cent since December 1996.  Reflectingmovements in long-term interest rates, however, it was raised by 0.6 percentage points to 3.1 percent in May 1997.On the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average has been rising since thesecond half of April 1997, reflecting the fact that market uncertainties about the economicoutlook and about Japanese financial institutions have gradually subsided, and the strong U.S.stock prices.  In early May, it recovered to above ¥20,000 for the first time in four and a halfmonths, and has recently continued to move at around ¥20,000.In the foreign exchange market, the yen depreciated between April and early Mayto around ¥126 - 127 to the U.S. dollar.  However, the yen’s depreciation was later reversedrapidly, as concerns about the appreciation of the U.S. dollar strengthened, and as the differentialin interest rates between Japan and the United States narrowed somewhat.  The yen has recentlyBIS Review   54/1997

Mr. Rangarajan elucidates the monetary and credit policy of the ReserveBank of India for the first half of the 1997-98 financial year   Address by the Governor of theReserve Bank of India, Mr. C. Rangarajan, at the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry atChennai on 19/4/97.I would like to take this opportunity given to me to speak to you this afternoon tofocus on the monetary and credit policy for the first half of 1997-98 which was announced a fewdays ago. It may be useful at the outset to review the major developments during 1996-97.2.  The growth rate of broad money (M3) in 1996-97 was 15.6 per cent which waswithin the targetted band of 15.5 - 16.0 per cent. The real GDP is expected to have grown by 6.8per cent. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the Wholesale Price Index was 7.3 percent on a point-to-point basis. A notable feature of 1996-97 was that the money and foreignexchange markets were generally calm in contrast with the turbulence witnessed in these marketsin the previous year. A strong growth in bank deposits, coupled with substantial reduction incash reserve requirements resulted in abundant liquidity in the system. However, the off-take ofbank credit was subdued. Short-term money market rates have moved down as a result of theeasy liquidity conditions. Lending rates are known for their stickiness and remained at highlevels during the first half of 1996-97 but softened later. There has been a strong accretion to theforeign exchange reserves. The slow growth in non-food bank credit, the persistence ofrelatively high lending rates despite comfortable liquidity in the banking system and theacceleration of inflow of funds from abroad call for active monetary and exchange ratemanagement by the Reserve Bank.3.  While the overall growth momentum has been sustained in 1996-97, divergenttrends were observed in various sectors with agricultural output showing an impressive recoveryand industrial growth slowing down. Even within the industrial sector, the decline in growthrates in mining and electricity sectors was sharp. The inflation rate at 7.3 per cent was a matterof concern. While manufacturing prices rose only by 5.1 per cent, primary articles recorded anincrease of 8.3 per cent. During 1996-97, procurement of foodgrains was low, while the off-takewas high. With the result, buffer stocks of foodgrains fell from 23.3 million tonnes at the end ofMarch 1996 to 18.6 million tonnes at the end of January 1997. The decline in wheat stocks wassharper.4.  The target for expansion in M3 during 1996-97 was set at 15.5 - 16.0 per cent.During the financial year 1996-97, M3 increased by 15.6 per cent as compared with 13.7 percent in 1995-96. Aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks showed a strong growth ofRs.697.8 billion (16.1 per cent) during 1996-97 as compared with a modest increase of Rs.469.6billion (12.1 per cent) during 1995-96. However, the increase in non-food credit of scheduledcommercial banks by Rs.247.1 billion (10.1 per cent) during 1996-97 was substantially lowerthan that of Rs.449.4 billion (22.5 per cent) during 1995-96. The depressed capital marketsseemed to have played a role inasmuch as there has to be some balance between debt and equity.Equity raised by the corporates was significantly lower in 1996-97 than in 1995-96. Investmentsby banks in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sectorand commercial paper increased by Rs.65.8 billion in 1996-97 as compared with a decline ofRs.1.62 billion in the previous year. Thus, the total resource flow from banks to the commercialsector inclusive of loans and advances as well as investments in bonds/debentures/sharesamounted to Rs.312.9 billion as against Rs.447.7 billion in 1995-96. Investments by scheduledcommercial banks in Government securities showed a quantum jump with an increase ofRs.268.6 billion during 1996-97 as compared with the increase of Rs.145.4 billion during1995-96.BIS Review   52/1997
- 2 -5.  One of the major objectives of financial sector reform has been to eliminatefinancial repression which is inherent in an administered interest rate structure and significantstrides have been made in this direction. This process of change which began in late 1980s hasnot been abrupt but gradual. During this period, considerable degree of freedom has been givento banks to determine both deposit and lending rates. Following moderation in the inflation ratesin 1995-96 and 1996-97 and the reductions in cash reserve ratio, there has been a conspicuousreduction in both deposit rates and lending rates of banks as also spreads over the prime lendingrates (PLR). In July 1996, some public sector banks reduced their PLR by 0.5 percentage point.However, as a number of banks were charging lending rates far higher than PLR, banks weredirected in the monetary policy announcement of October 1996 that along with theannouncement of their PLR, they should, with the approval of their respective Boards, alsoannounce the maximum spread over the PLR for all advances other than consumer credit. Thepublic sector banks have since reduced their PLR further from 16.5 per cent in March 1996 to14.0 - 15.5 per cent by March 1997 and spreads in the rate of 2.5 - 4.0 percentage points wereannounced. During 1996-97, many banks had also brought down interest rates on term depositsby 1 to 2 percentage points on the shorter end of their maturity spectrum with a view to reducingthe average cost of deposits.6.  Reflecting the easy liquidity conditions during 1996-97, there has been asignificant softening of money market interest rates. At the short end of the market, the rateshave come down sharply and have ruled generally low as compared with the levels prevailing in1995-96. The typical call money rates ruled low in the range of 2.00 - 5 per cent in the recentperiod. The rate on 91-day Treasury Bills came down from 12.97 per cent at the beginning ofApril 1996 to 7.96 per cent in March 1997. Similarly, the rate on 364 day Treasury Billsdeclined from 13.12 per cent in April 1996 to 10.10 per cent in March 1997. The typical rates ofdiscount on Certificates of Deposits (CDs) and Commercial Paper (CP) have also declinedsharply since end-March 1996. There was also some softening of coupon rates on long-termGovernment bonds.7.  The stance of monetary policy in 1997-98 would be to achieve the twinobjectives of maintaining reasonable price stability and ensuring availability of adequate bankcredit to support the growth of the real sector. The economy is still subject to inflationarypressures. There is need for continued caution on the price front and this would require amoderation in monetary expansion consistent with the expected real growth. There is also theneed for developing the Bank Rate as reference rate to signal policy stance of the Reserve Bank.This would require rationalisation of the interest rate structure and linking of interest rates to theBank Rate. There is an urgency to step up the flow of bank credit. This would need streamliningand improving credit delivery system by giving greater freedom to banks. Besides, banks mustendeavour to bring down the interest rates by reducing the spreads. The money, foreignexchange and government securities markets need to be further developed and integrated.8.  In regulating money supply growth in the coming year, the Reserve Bank willhave to reckon with the impact of capital inflows. If capital inflows remain strong, the ReserveBank must take care to see that the resultant reserve money expansion after taking into accountthe net RBI credit to the Central Government does not exceed a level that is consistent with theexpansion in money supply justified by the growth of the real sector.9.  Given the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 6.0 - 7.0 per cent,monetary policy would seek to maintain the expansion in M3 in the range of 15.0 - 15.5 per centto keep the inflation rate at around 6 per cent in 1997-98. The projected increase in moneysupply may be reviewed and revised depending upon macro-economic developments. On theBIS Review   52/1997
- 3 -basis of the projected increase in M3, the working estimate of the growth of aggregate depositsof scheduled commercial banks is placed at Rs.800 billion (16.0 per cent). The expansion in netscheduled commercial bank credit including such investments as in bonds/debentures/shares ofPublic Sector Units (PSUs) and private corporate sector, is envisaged to be of the order of 20.0 -21.0 per cent. The policy measures which are being announced have been so framed that bankswill have adequate resources to meet all the genuine productive requirements of the economy.10.  Broadly speaking, the current monetary and credit policy seeks to achievefour objectives. The various measures announced as part of the policy can be brought underthese four objectives. The first objective of course is to maintain a reasonable degree of pricestability and moderate inflationary pressures in the system by regulating money supply. Asindicated earlier, the target rate of growth of M3 is set in the range of 15 - 15.5 per cent. With areal rate of growth between 6 and 7 per cent, this would enable us to keep the inflation ratearound 6 per cent.11.  The second objective is to expand the lendable resources of banks and also tobring about a reduction in the lending rates. The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was lowered atdifferent points of time during the previous year. The full impact of the reductions in the CRReffected last year will be seen in the current year. The CRR on inter-bank liabilities has beenwithdrawn as part of the policy. Apart from the impact this will have on the creation of anappropriate term deposit market, this will release about Rs.9500 million of lendable resources tobanks. We have also introduced a general refinance facility which will be available to banks andthis facility will be equivalent to one per cent of the demand and time liabilities of banks. All ofthese measures will have the impact of expanding the lendable resources of banks. The bank ratehas been reduced from 12 per cent to 11 per cent to signal a reduction in the interest rate. Wewant the bank rate to emerge as an effective signal rate as well as a reference rate. To coincidewith the reduction in bank rate, the term deposit rate for maturity of 30 days and upto one yearhas been reduced by one percentage point. The same rate has been made applicable to rates onterm deposits of Non-Resident (External) Rupee Deposit accounts of maturity of over sixmonths and upto one year. On Foreign Currency Non Resident Accounts (Banks) deposits,banks are free to determine interest rates subject to a ceiling prescribed by the RBI from time totime. Thus the various measures announced will have the effect of expanding the lendableresources of banks on the one hand and bringing about on the other a reduction in the depositrates and consequently lending rates.12. Responding to the policy announcement, a number of banks in the publicsector banks have already reduced their PLR by 50-100 basis points to take it to 14 per cent.Needless to say the only enduring way to bring about a reduction in the interest rate is bykeeping the inflation rate low and breaking inflationary expectations.13. The third objective relates to the revamping of the credit delivery systemwhich has become necessary for accelerating the credit flow from the banking system. A numberof measures announced fall in this category. I would like to list the most important among them.The mandatory consortium requirements for credit limits of Rs.500 million and more has beendispensed with. Banks and their customers can now enter into a variety of arrangementsincluding syndication subject of course to the exposure limits. Banks have been given fullfreedom to evolve their own methods of assessing the working capital requirements ofborrowers. This should result in quicker decision making and speedier flow of funds from banksto their borrowers.  The loan component of the working capital limits is being graduallyenhanced. However, banks are now free to fix the maturity period of the loans on their own. Thelimits set on the extent of bank credit that can be made available to Non-Banking FinancialBIS Review   52/1997
- 4 -Companies (NBFCs) has been removed. This, however, applies only to NBFCs which havecomplied with the requirements of registration, credit rating and prudential norms. Bankshitherto have been permitted to invest 5 per cent of their incremental deposits of the previousyear in shares and debentures. Debentures are now excluded from this limit so that this limitwould be available exclusively for shares of corporates including PSUs. In the context of thepresent condition of the capital market, banks have been allowed to extend loans to corporatesagainst shares held by them to enable such corporates to meet the promoters' contribution to theequity of new companies in anticipation of raising resources. The credit delivery system is thussought to be improved.14. The fourth objective is the improvement in the functioning of the variousmarkets - money market, government securities market and the foreign exchange market. Theimportant measures that relate to the money market are: removal of cash reserve ratio on theinter-bank liabilities; reduction in the minimum period of maturity for the commercial paper to30 days; reduction in the minimum size of certificates of deposit and improved access to cashsurplus entities through primary dealers. The Government securities market will benefit by theenlargement of instruments eligible for Repo transactions, allowing the entry of non-bankentities who are holders of SGL accounts with the Reserve Bank to enter into reverse Repotransactions and the introduction of Treasury Bills of varying maturities. In order to deepen andwiden the foreign exchange market, certain measures have been taken. These include permissionto book forward contracts on the basis of declaration of exposure, permission to AuthorisedDealers to borrow upto US$ 10 million from abroad as well as to invest up to US$ 10 millionabroad and permission given to Authorised Dealers to engage in Forex-Rupee current swapwithout the prior approval of RBI. The various measures taken in the area of marketimprovement will lead not only to the efficient functioning of the individual markets but alsobring about a greater integration among them.15. In order to facilitate greater flow of credit to agriculture, the share capital ofNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) as well as the General Lineof Credit granted to NABARD by RBI have been increased. The simplified procedure ofassessing the working capital needs on the basis of 20 per cent of the projected turn over is beingextended to borrowers having working capital limits up to Rs.20 million as against Rs.10 millionearlier. This should benefit a large number of Small Scale Industrial Units.16. The measures announced cover a wide range and touch almost every part ofthe financial system. Some of the measures are directed towards improving the functioning ofthe various markets and bringing about a greater integration among them, which should reducethe volatility of the rates in these markets. These measures are in the nature of institutional andstructural reforms. The improvements in the credit delivery system should remove the ‘chokes’in the flow of credit.17. All in all, the measures announced should have the effect of acceleratingeconomic growth, keeping inflationary pressures under control and improving the flow of creditfrom the banking system to the various segments of the Indian economy.BIS Review   52/1997
Mr. Desario looks at the financial system and the non-profit sector withrespect to ethics and solidarity in finance   Address by the Director General of the Bank ofItaly, Dott. Vincenzo Desario, before the conference on “Italian society at the turn of themillennium: opportunities and prospects of the non-profit and voluntary sector” held in Milan on17/3/97.The importance of the non-profit and voluntary sector is now appreciable not onlyethically and culturally, as a tendency whose expansion bears witness to the human and civicdevelopment of Italian society, but also on the economic plane.Everywhere, substantial budget deficits are forcing a retrenchment of publicspending and more generally an attenuation of direct government involvement in the economy.It follows that non-profit and voluntary organizations may play an ever-larger role in reducingsocial disparities, devising modes of intervention appropriate to the continually changing formsin which inequality arises.In Italy the need for a larger and stronger non-profit and voluntary sector isespecially great, owing to the necessity of fiscal adjustment and the inefficiency afflicting publicservices.My remarks today begin with some preliminary considerations on therelationships between ethics, solidarity and finance. I shall follow this with a description of thenon-profit sector and some observations on banking foundations. Finally I shall examine thefunding of the non-profit sector and its relations with the banking system.1. Ethics, solidarity and financeThe changes in Italy’s credit and financial system in recent years reflect theconcern of law-makers and supervisors to foster market values and competition. The principlesof transparency and fairness in relations between banks and customers not only are embedded inrules of conduct but have now been given the status of purposes of supervisory activity byLegislative Decree 415 of 23 July 1996 transposing the EU Investment Services Directive intoItalian law.Reference to these principles is not merely ritual. It bids us to recognize that theoperating environment has been radically transformed and now, even more than in the past,demands the firm commitment of intermediaries to comply with the letter and the spirit of therules of good faith and fairness.These values are inextricably bound up with the relationship between bank andcustomer, which is based on trust. They make it easier to face the challenges of competition.They promote customer loyalty and enhance the bank’s reputation in the market.Trust is essential to the operation and growth of the economy. As the NobelLaureate Kenneth Arrow has observed “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itselfan element of trust, certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time. It can be plausiblyargued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack ofmutual confidence.” 1                                                  1K.J.

- 2 -The risk of a self-serving breach of trust by economic agents is one of the mainsources of transaction costs, in that it necessitates performance bonds and monitoring thecounterparty’s behaviour.The most effective way of reducing transaction costs is for market participants toadhere to the precept that it is one’s moral duty to respect others and not to betray their trust.Widely shared ethical precepts and moral conduct strengthen agents’ credibility and reliability,make it easier to reach new business agreements and ultimately increase the likelihood ofsuccess.In a market economy the credit system has the important function of selectingcreditworthy projects, economic initiatives that can produce new benefits and increase overallsocial welfare. It is essential for every bank to screen borrowers by strictly professionalstandards based on technical assessment of projects’ risks and returns.Inefficient assessment of creditworthiness results in significant losses. In marketswhere there is little competition, poor asset quality is reflected in higher interest rates, withadverse repercussions on the economy as a whole. In more competitive markets, with theirnarrower spreads, loan losses can lead to bank failures. And this affects other outstanding loans,causes jobs to be lost and wipes out uninsured depositors’ savings, with the risk that the failuremay spread.Customer confidence is the banking enterprise’s most valuable intangible asset. Itis the prerequisite for building stronger and more durable customer relations that can bebroadened from simple loan disbursement to the entire range of firms’ financial needs.With trust, there is a better likelihood that the relationship between bank andcustomer will be consolidated as a “repeated game” in which, as game theory teaches, theproblems of opportunistic behaviour are overcome.2This approach can be successful if the bank does not act in conflict of interest; if,that is, it safeguards the interests of the customer together with its own, recommending financingplans and instruments that are compatible with the customer’s projects, the state of the firm andthe prospects of its market.In finance, solidarity can be expressed by paying more attention to the customer’sneeds, viewed comprehensively, and assisting the customer in making financial choices that bestserve the realization of corporate goals. Any short-term earnings loss will be offset by the futureincome the bank will obtain as a result of the continuity of the relationship and from additionalcorporate financial services.The principle of overcoming conflict of interest also informs proper andtransparent relations with savers who entrust the bank with making an investment or managingtheir financial assets. The intermediary that reconciles its own interest with the customer’s, thatmakes customer assistance a conscious value of its corporate culture, perceiving it as a tool ofcompetition, has a better chance of success in the financial markets.                                                  2See, for example, K.G.

- 3 -The rule that one who acts on behalf of another must protect the latter’s interestand not make undisclosed profits from this management activity is clearly ethical in origin. Itwas first stated, as regards the law of trusts, in the Middle Ages in sentences handed down by theChancellor of the King of England; that is, by a judge, ordinarily also a bishop, who decidedlawsuits mainly on the basis of ethical and religious canons.Effective, correct customer assistance is premised upon thorough knowledge ofthe customer. The “know your customer” rule has been reaffirmed recently by Italian financiallegislation. Law 1/1991, as well as the more recent legislative decree transposing the EUInvestment Services Directive, lays down that in carrying on securities activities the investmentfirm must “acquire prior information about the financial situation of customers that is relevant tothe conduct of the activity.”This principle was made applicable to the entire banking and financial industrywith the publication of the Bank of Italy’s anti-money-laundering “Decalogue”, which stressesthat familiarity with the customer is essential not only for detecting suspect transactions but alsofor maintaining stable customer relations.Intermediaries have increasingly recognized the importance and the positiveimplications of this rule. Appreciable steps towards self-regulation have been taken, such as thecode of conduct for banks, adopted in 1996, which sets standards of fairness in dealings withcustomers. When they enjoy real consensus, such initiatives are an especially effective tool forreinforcing and extending the rules of professional ethics, because they are not imposed fromabove but reflect the shared feelings of those involved.In the public interest and in conformity with the law, the supervisory authoritieslay down prudential standards and rules of conduct covering all intermediaries. The authoritiesare careful not to impose costs that are not justified by greater benefits to the community as awhole. They are guided by the best practices of the market. They check that intermediaries actconsistently with the principle of sound and prudent management.Management that is sound - i.e. in accordance with the rules derived fromexperience and the theory of enterprise (profitability), not subject to improper influences(independence) and based on correct business relations - and prudent - i.e. sensitive to risk - willhave beneficial results in terms of the orderly and efficient operation of the economic andfinancial system.Sound and prudent management is an overarching criterion for supervisoryactivity. It sums up the values of stability, efficiency, integrity and proper functioning of thefinancial system. It is where systemic objectives and microeconomic goals meet. As a norm, itrequires that intermediaries’ dealings with firms and households be constantly inspired by thecanons of business and professional ethics, transparency, legality, fair competition. Sound andprudent management is at once a technical rule and an ethical canon.Safeguarding competition also carries a deep ethical significance. Abuse of adominant position, price fixing, or collusive agreement on practices to the detriment ofconsumers allows intermediaries to reap unjustified profits and excludes those who cannot paythe fixed prices from enjoying the relevant services. Such practices generate both inefficiencyand inequity.BIS Review   51/1997
- 4 -2. The non-profit and voluntary sectorAn abiding school of thought embracing analysts of differing backgrounds holdsthat a democratic political system, if it is to be deeply rooted in the social fabric, must bearticulated in a tightknit web of organizations positioned between the individual and the state:collective actors that enable citizens themselves to “become the state” by directly administeringand providing socially useful services.As the French sociologist Emile Durkheim stressed, a nation can be said to existonly if between the state and private citizens there is a whole series of secondary groups closeenough to individuals to draw them forcefully into their field of action and so involve them inthe mainstream of social life.3The grass-roots presence of associations, mutual societies, communities andclubs, networks of civic commitment, is seen by some scholars as a decisive factor inestablishing a climate of reciprocal confidence and social cooperation, which is necessary tolaunch a virtuous circle of economic development.4The non-profit sector is defined essentially by two traits: private ownership andcontrol and a ban on distributing profits. The latter feature does not imply that a non-profit bodycannot ever generate profits; what counts is that any net profits must be reinvested in the pursuitand expansion of the organization’s activity, to finance its mandated purposes.It may seem surprising that in a market economy one finds associations, clubs,mutual societies, leagues and private cooperatives providing services without distributing profitsand almost always operating alongside other institutions, such as the family, the state, andbusiness corporations. Yet historical experience teaches that the state-market dichotomy does notexhaust all the ramifications of a modern economic and social system. In economic theory themost widely accepted explanations for the existence of non-profit enterprises bear on market“failures”, which are generally related to information asymmetries, i.e. cases in which theindependent contracting power of agents does not ensure sufficient transparency orcomparability of services and products.Especially where service quality is difficult to ascertain, there is room for the riseand growth of non-profit enterprises. For the consumer, the ban on distributing profits is a signalthat the provider will not raise the price of the service without just cause or reduce its quality.Similar assurance is offered to those who wish to make donations to non-profit agencies thatassist the weak and the needy.The ban on distributing profits fosters and strengthens the bonds of trust betweenusers, private donors and the service organization. It is a deterrent to the involvement of workersand managers who would be inclined to pursue their own individual interests, those who are lesssocially committed.                                                  3E.

- 5 -The private non-profit organization has comparative advantages not only asagainst business corporations but also with respect to public provision of goods and services,especially those earmarked for particular segments of society. By virtue of more efficientcollection and processing of “local” information, i.e. within circumscribed territories, non-profitagencies cater more effectively to the particular needs of specific social groups or sectors.These are services that require more of a grass-roots presence and a greatercapacity to target action to non-standardized needs. The state retains a comparative advantage inthe provision of undifferentiated public services, such as compulsory schooling, basic healthcare, and social security.The non-profit and voluntary sector can play a major role in supplementing publicprogrammes and in broadening the area of social protection. It must become a mechanism forsoliciting and raising additional private resources, over and above government appropriations forthese purposes, in order to meet those needs that state action is inefficient in facing.Italy’s unbalanced economic development has been accompanied by phenomenaof social distress and has not succeeded, to date, in narrowing regional disparities. The growthand spread of social solidarity, volunteer service and the entire non-profit sector is highlydesirable to reinforce the pact of mutual support binding the national community at theinstitutional level and to make for fruitful, complementary relations between private and publicsocial welfare activities.Delay in the development of the non-profit sector and excessive reduction of thesocial role of the state, albeit for budgetary reasons, could place the whole burden of assistingsociety’s most vulnerable members on the family. Owing to the changes in society, the family isno longer capable, unaided, of dealing with the complicated problems posed by the modernworld.3. The fight against usury: a case of complementarity between government and voluntary actionSolidarity means disinterested assistance to those in need. The traditional ethicalcondemnation of lending at interest, found in the Old Testament and in Aristotle, can be tracedback to the ethical principle of solidarity whereby one must help the needy person, not takeadvantage of his need. Leviticus reads: “And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decaywith thee; then thou shalt relieve him; yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he maylive with thee. Take thou no usury of him, or increase.... Thou shalt not give him thy moneyupon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.”5The passage from condemnation of charging of interest to the needy to theoutright condemnation of interest as such, found in other books of the Old Testament,6 is logicalin the historical context of a static, agrarian economy in which recourse to credit is not a normalevent for anyone engaging in economic activity but the last resort of victims of exceptionaladversity.Even today, the exploitation of the weakness of those in need is an element in                                                  5Leviticus 25, 35-37. See also Exodus 22, 25.6For example, Ezekiel 18, 13.BIS Review   51/1997
- 6 -usury, an odious and socially destructive practice that has taken on alarming dimensions inrecent years.The problem is delicate, complicated, and because of its emotional impact properanalysis of the issue requires an effort of intellectual lucidity to avoid the sort of crudejudgments that surface from time to time in the discussion.The alleged inflexibility of legal intermediaries in granting loans is often cited asa contributing cause of usury. But banks operate with the funds of their depositors, which it istheir duty to safeguard; accordingly they lend to those customers who are in a position to honourtheir obligations. By using the savings it has collected in the most efficient manner andprotecting their value through sound and prudent management, the banking enterprise performsits important economic function, combining private profit-seeking with the general interest.It may be that some high-risk borrowers, at the margins of the credit market, findit hard to obtain “legal” credit. These borrowers, who tend to be small businesses even morecommonly than households, may fall prey to usurers, through no fault of the legitimateintermediaries subject to supervision.Italy’s 1996 anti-usury law accords official recognition to the role played by thevoluntary sector in sparing enterprises and households the risk of having to turn to usurers. Themain instrument for combating usury is government grants to non-profit foundations andassociations that already administer resources deriving from private donations, to be used assecurity for bank loans at moderate rates of interest to persons in financial difficulty.Italy counts a good number of associations engaged in the battle against usury.There are eight officially recognized foundations active in prevention and assistance to victims.Six operate in the central and southern regions, where usury is most widespread and perilous,owing to its links with organized crime.4. The banking foundationsAs I mentioned, non-profit enterprises develop in sectors where pronouncedinformational asymmetries between customers and service providers lead the public to preferservices supplied by undertakings that do not distribute profits.Informational asymmetries are a distinguishing feature of the banking andfinancial sector.These two points may help to shed light on the creation of banks in the form ofassociations or foundations (savings banks first and foremost), which reached its peak during thenineteenth century. These institutions served to counter usury and to overcome the aversion of“first-generation” savers towards the banking system.The great banking crises of the thirties fortified the role of the public banks,which served to restore savers’ confidence in the banking system and allowed an orderly flow offinancing to the economy.The development of the Italian economy and decades of financial stabilitysafeguarded by an effective system of public supervision brought a considerable part of thepopulation into contact with the banking system. The evolution of markets and their increasingBIS Review   51/1997
- 7 -openness brought the public banks’ entrepreneurial features increasingly to the fore, with acorresponding de-emphasis of their original social functions.The reform of the public banks that Parliament enacted at the beginning of thenineties in response to these tendencies sanctioned the passing of the public law model ofbanking; the law separated the institutions’ original social-welfare and charitable purposes frombanking activity, assigning the former to the foundations and the latter to companies limited bysharesThe most compelling reason for the reform, at the urging of the supervisoryauthorities, was to allow the introduction of organizational and operational models able to ensurehigher standards of competitiveness and efficiency. An important factor was the central roleassigned to banks’ capital by the supervisory system then being forged at Community level; thelimited scope for Italian public banks to raise funds directly in the equity market hindered theirgrowth and ability to compete.The legislative solution adopted - the original institutions to remain in existenceafter transferring their banking activity to companies limited by shares - also sought to exploitthe valuable social and civic function that most of the public credit institutions had historicallyperformed.Initially, the reform legislation was basically neutral concerning the practicaloptions for the banking foundations; it defined the spectrum of activities open to them, clearlydrew the border between banks and foundations, and laid down what the latter could not do,namely manage banks.The remodeled foundations’ sizable endowments fueled expectations that theymight satisfy the growing financial needs of the voluntary and non-profit sector. The bankingfoundations, it was felt, could fill the gap left by the shrinking of the welfare state; but in orderto occupy a central position in the nonprofit sector, it was argued, they had to dispose of theirequity interests in banks at once.However, realizing the full potential of the banking foundations requires that theycease being regarded as a pool of resources to be dipped into indiscriminately or as a body ofassets whose composition can be altered in order to pursue the most diverse purposes.The foundations are non-profit operators themselves and can actively contributeto the non-profit sector’s development by identifying areas for intervention and nurturingsocially useful initiatives. In deciding how to go about pursuing their objectives, the foundationscan adopt a directly operational setup and manage one or more socially useful activitiesthemselves, under arrangements already adopted elsewhere and not new to Italy.If they should decide instead to continue in the role of grant-making institutions,in order to make a truly effective contribution they must develop sufficient skills in selectinginitiatives, monitoring the use of funds and assessing results.Grant-making plainly entails a degree of specialization, not only geographic butalso by sector of socially useful activity. In effect, the data assembled by the Association ofItalian Savings Banks (ACRI) via reclassification of the banking foundations’ annual accountsand a survey of the grants made by the 81 ex-savings bank foundations offers evidence ofgrowing specialization. Sorting the foundations by sectoral concentration of grants shows thatBIS Review   51/1997
- 8 -60.5 per cent allocated over half of their funding to a single sector or more than sixth tenths tojust two sectors in 1995.There is some tendency away from small grants, although these are still verycommon among the smaller foundations, and considerable growth in multi-year grants, whoseshare in total disbursements rose from 7.7 per cent in 1994 to 11.6 per cent in 1995. Accordingto the ACRI report, disbursements amounted to 211 billion lire in 1995, equal to a little less thanone third of the foundations’ net operating results and 7.8 per cent up on the 1994 figure of 196billion.The banking foundations’ activities are hampered by their low return on assets.ACRI calculates that the ex-saving bank foundations’ overall ratio of net operating results toassets was 2 per cent in the 1994-95 financial year. This poor performance, though animprovement on 1.43 per cent in the previous financial year, reflects the modest return onholdings of bank shares, dividends from which account for 80 per cent of the result. Thus, theability of the foundations to fulfil their institutional purposes depends largely on cyclicalconditions in the banking industry.It is incumbent on the foundations to seek an optimal return on their capital, inorder to preserve its real value and ensure the continuity of their activities. This will requiregreater asset diversification, a necessary condition for the foundations’ assuming a more fertile,autonomous role in the social sphere.Fostering such a role is the basic objective of the provisions for the revision of thecivil-law and tax treatment of the banking foundations in the Government’s recent enabling bill,which are meant to encourage them to dispose of their bank shares. The proposed legislationwould provide tax incentives for the operations connected with privatization; unlike earlierproposals, it sets no deadline for the sale of bank shares.The decision to encourage rather than order such disposals and to allow them tobe spread out over time appears appropriate. It is compatible with the objective of respecting thedecision-making autonomy of the parties involved and improving the profitability of banks so asto enhance the attractiveness of their shares. And it creates scope for the stock market to be ableto absorb the shares of the banks, without excess supply depressing the placement price. Thefoundations will have a better chance to dispose of their bank equity with the necessarygradualness. The incentives for the sale of bank shares will facilitate the reorganization of thebanking system and foster an increase in bank size, especially if the sales bring in authentic freshcapital.However, the breadth of the delegation of powers contemplated by the enablingbill and, above all, the diversity of its objectives are such that a well-defined legislativeframework is not yet discernible. The parliamentary debate will have to fill in gaps and resolveuncertainties. The proposed establishment of a regulatory authority for non-profit institutions,including the banking foundations. deserves some comment. This authority would be assigned tooversee the legitimacy of the actions of the foundations’ governing bodies, their sound andprudent management, the return on assets, and their effective pursuit of the aims specified in thebylaws. Its powers would also include authorizing transformations and combinations, passing onamendments to bylaws, removing the governing bodies and dissolving foundations in the eventof repeated management irregularities, setting a minimum proportion of income (not less thanone half) that must be allocated to institutional purposes, and acting in lieu of the governingbodies for individual acts.BIS Review   51/1997
- 9 -Beyond a certain point, it is not easy to reconcile the intensity of the plannedadministrative controls with the degree of autonomy that recognition of the institutions’ privatenature would imply. Nonetheless, the experience of foreign jurisdictions with longer traditions inthis field shows that some form of supervision on the foundations and non-profit sector ingeneral remains appropriate, especially as regards entitlement to favourable tax treatment.However, supervision should be calibrated so as to avoid stifling the initiative of the non-profitinstitutions, draining their capacity to act and ultimately reducing the benefits to civil society.5. Financing the non-profit and voluntary sectorThere are four possible sources of funds for the non-profit sector: privatedonations, government transfers, debt capital and self-financing.Government contributions bulk large in Italy, whereas private donations aremarginal. The relationship between the two is specular, and in fact in countries where privatedonations play a larger role they are encouraged by favourable tax treatment.Banks can help to increase the flow of private donations to non-profit enterprisesby offering their customers specially designed financial instruments; for example, the so-called“ethical” funds and accounts that some financial intermediaries have promoted, whose rulesrequire subscribers or depositors to assign all or part of their income from the investment to non-profit institutions.These products can involve financing as well as donations; alongside theassignment of customer earnings or capital gains, there is often an obligation for theintermediary to invest the monies received only in undertakings that conform to certain ethicalstandards or pursue specific objectives.The organizational and opportunity costs of launching such initiatives arecompensated for by the enhanced reputation and standing that the intermediary enjoys amongsocially aware customers.The specific advantage of banks’ interposition with regard to charitable donationsstems from their placement power: branch networks, which give banks an edge in supplyingtheir own financial products and those of others, also put them in a strong position to sell“ethical” products to their customers.Where profit-seeking intermediaries offer customers financial products earmarkedto fund the non-profit sector, organizational and accounting controls are necessary to ensuretransparency.Other conditions being equal, two factors may handicap non-profit undertakingsin raising debt capital. First, the rule prohibiting distribution of profits may strike the prospectivelender as likely to erode operating efficiency in the long run. Whereas for commercialenterprises the profit motive is the mainspring of survival and growth, for non-profit institutionsthere is a problem of ensuring that the altruistic drive does not flag over time. On the other hand,the ban on distributing profits is also a point of strength, since it allows non-profit enterprises toscreen and select collaborators, workers and managers who share their altruistic objectives ofservice.BIS Review   51/1997
- 10 -The second adverse factor is linked to the eventuality of the non-profitundertaking failing to repay the loan. In this event, a bank bringing action for forced recoverywould run the risk of appearing to put its own interests before the social, humanitarian orcharitable purposes of the distressed undertaking.Financial support can be provided to the non-profit and voluntary sector byintermediaries that exclusively, prevalently or even only occasionally engage in such lending(so-called “ethical” intermediation). The record shows a variety of such experiences in manycountries.To cite a few significant examples, Ökobank in Germany, which focuses onenvironmental and peace issues, had 63,000 customers and 170 billion lire of deposits in 1993;in the Netherlands, Triodos Bank, of the eponymous association for social development andenvironmental protection, accounts for 2.5 per cent of the country’s total bank deposits; inSwitzerland, the banner experience is that of Alternative Bank ABS, which in 1992 had around106 billion lire of loans outstanding to local non-profit enterprises and associations for third-world development.Other intermediaries concentrate on fostering small business in the third world orin economically depressed areas of the industrialized countries.The best-known example is Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which lends to farmersin the poorest rural areas. The key to its success is its technique of forming small groups ofcustomers who take part in training workshops that also serve to select the creditworthy. Thesmall loans disbursed to them are gradually scaled up if each member of the group meets therepayment terms. The bank’s high credit quality testifies to the efficacy both of the method usedfor assessing creditworthiness and of the system of cross-monitoring among members of agroup. The high risk that nonetheless characterizes the bank’s activity made it advisable for it tofund its loans primarily with public contributions and the bank’s own resources, part of whichwas paid in by the beneficiaries of its lending.In the United States, a very interesting case is that of the Illinois NeighborhoodDevelopment Corporation, created by non-profit shareholders and licensed to engage in bankingsince the seventies. The bank initially operated in one of the worst slums of Chicago, the SouthShore, and endeavoured to redevelop the area particularly by giving minority groups moreaccess to credit. The programme’s success allowed it to be extended to other rundown, outlyingneighbourhoods. Thanks to its skilled and highly-motivated staff, this bank has combinedrigorous lending standards with a variety of assistance and promotional services, operating incompliance with the normal banking supervisory requirements.A complete review of the experiences in various countries would also have toinclude the cases of failure and those demonstrating the difficulty of transplanting successfulinitiatives to different social and institutional settings.For an “ethical” intermediary actually to achieve comparative advantages infinancing the non-profit and voluntary sector, various conditions, not always easily satisfied,have to be met: a highly motivated staff, for one, and savers receptive to the ethical aimspursued and willing to support them over time with deposits.The affinity of ideals between the bank and the borrower must not tempt theformer to relax its technical standards of customer selection or neglect to heed the principle ofBIS Review   51/1997
- 11 -operating profitability. Specialization in the non-profit and voluntary sector must be compatiblewith the key principle of the banking system. Operating losses could not only cause the bank tofail but also have adverse repercussions on similar initiatives.The success of such projects essentially depends on devising techniques to limitthe credit risk while simultaneously upholding both the “mission” of funding the non-profitsector and the banking industry’s standards of competence and prudence.When a bank is to be established that intends to finance the non-profit sector bytaking deposits from the public, the above prudential recommendations become especiallycogent. History shows how high the social costs of bank failures can be, and how complex isrecourse to the instruments that make up the system’s crisis “safety net”.* * *Modern economic theory accepts the principle that a solid ethical commitment isalso economically rational. The propagation of virtuous conduct is a value in and of itself, in thatit lends strength and security to economic agents, averting costs and formalities that wouldotherwise be necessary. This reinforces the ties between ethics and finance, between ethics andbusiness.Ethical and moral principles are increasingly taking root among economic agents,producing closer links between the social dimension and the markets.Modern society is very attentive and sensitive to these values. The demand forethical conduct is ever broader and stronger.Establishing relations of trust with customers invigorates financial activity. Theintermediary must adopt the principle of proper assistance to the customer, of serving the latter’sbest interest. In a framework of competition between financial operators, this must be effected inconformity with the intrinsically ethical standard of sound and prudent management.When non-profit institutions are formally organized as enterprises, i.e. when theyare based on the principle that revenues must cover costs, they can turn to the banking systemand the capital markets for financing to supplement their endowments, private donations andpublic contributions.In countries where the non-profit sector has grown to significant dimensions, itsenterprises compete with commercial firms in the product markets and in the market forfinancial resources. They obtain funds from commercial intermediaries on the basis of provensolvency and established reputation.In Italian law the formation and the range of business of an intermediary whosevocation is to finance the non-profit sector cannot deviate from the rules governing financialactivities in general. These rules respond to needs and interests, including ethical interests, of thefirst order, which are expressed in the canon of sound and prudent management and the valuesof stability and efficiency.Only within this framework can financial institutions dedicated to lending to thenon-profit sector succeed, enhancing the contribution of finance to the growth of solidarity andvoluntary agencies.BIS Review   51/1997
Mr. Greenspan reviews current monetary policy in the United StatesRemarks by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the 1997Haskins Partners Dinner of the Stern School of Business, New York University, New York on8/5/97.I am pleased to accept this year’s Charles Waldo Haskins Award and have theopportunity to address this distinguished audience on current monetary policy.A central bank’s raising interest rates is rarely popular. But the Federal Reserve’saction on March 25, to tighten the stance of monetary policy, seems to have attracted more thanthe usual share of attention and criticism. I believe the critics of our action deserve a response.So tonight, I would like to take a few minutes to put this action in the broad context of the Fed’smandate to promote the stable financial environment that will encourage economic growth.The Federal Open Market Committee raised rates as a form of insurance. It was asmall prudent step in the face of the increasing possibility that excessive credit creation, spurredby an overly accommodative monetary policy, might undermine the sustained economicexpansion. That expansion has been fostered by the maintenance of low inflation. But thepersisting -- indeed increasing -- strength of nominal demand for goods and services suggestedto us that monetary policy might not be positioned appropriately to avoid a buildup ofinflationary pressures and imbalances that would be incompatible with extending the currentexpansion into 1998, and hopefully beyond. Even if it should appear in retrospect that we couldhave skirted the dangers of credit excesses without a modest tightening, the effect on theexpansion would be small, temporary, and like most insurance, its purchase to protect againstpossible adverse outcomes would still be eminently sensible.For the Federal Reserve to remain inactive against a possible buildup of insidiousinflationary pressures would be to sanction a threat to the job security and standards of living oftoo many Americans. As I pointed out in testimony before the Congress in March, the type ofeconomy that we are now experiencing, with strong growth and tight labor markets, has thespecial advantage of drawing hundreds of thousands of people onto employment payrolls, wherethey can acquire permanent work skills. Under less favorable conditions they would haveremained out of the labor force, or among the long-term unemployed. Moreover, the currentmore-than-six-year expansion has enabled us to accelerate the modernization of our productivefacilities.It has long been the goal of monetary policy to foster the maximum sustainablegrowth in the American economy. I emphasize sustainable because it is clear from our historythat surges in growth financed by excessive credit creation are, by their nature, unsustainable,and, unless contained, threaten the underlying stability of our economy. Such stability, in turn, isnecessary to nurture the sources of permanent growth.The Federal Reserve, of late, has been criticized as being too focused on subduingnonexistent inflation and, in the process, being willing to suppress economic growth, retard jobexpansion, and inhibit real wage gains. On the contrary, our actions to tighten money marketconditions in 1994, and again in March of this year, were directed at sustaining and fosteringgrowth in economic activity, jobs, and real wages. Our goal has never been to contain inflationas an end in itself. Prices are only signals of how the economy is functioning. If inflation had noeffect on economic growth, we would be much less concerned about inflationary pressures.BIS Review   50/1997
- 2 -But the evidence is compelling that low inflation is necessary to the mostfavorable performance of the economy. Inflation, as is generally recognized throughout theworld, destroys jobs and undermines productivity gains, the foundation for increases in realwages. Low inflation is being increasingly viewed as a necessary condition for sustained growth.It may be an old cliché, but you cannot have a vibrant growing economy withoutsound money. History is unequivocal on this.The Federal Reserve has not always been successful at maintaining sound moneyand sustained growth, and the lessons have been costly. The Federal Reserve’s policy actions,the evidence demonstrates, affect the financial markets immediately, but work with a significantlag of several quarters or more on output and employment, and even longer on prices. Too oftenin the past, policymakers responded late to unfolding economic developments and found theywere far behind the curve, so to speak; as a result, their policy actions were creating oraccentuating business cycles, rather than sustaining expansion. Those who wish for us, in thecurrent environment, to await clearly visible signs of emerging inflation before acting arerecommending we return to a failed regime of monetary policy that cost jobs and livingstandards.I wish it were otherwise, but there is no alternative to basing policy on what are,unavoidably, uncertain forecasts. As I have indicated to the Congress, we do not base policy on asingle best-estimate forecast, but rather on a series of potential outcomes and the possible effectsof alternative policies, including judgments of the consequences of taking a policy action thatmight, in the end, have turned out to be less than optimal.I viewed our small increase in the federal funds rate on March 25 as taken not somuch as a consequence of a change in the most probable forecast of moderate growth and lowinflation for later this year and next, but rather to address the probability that being wrong hadmaterially increased.In the same sense that it would be folly not to endure the small immediatediscomfort of a vaccination against the possibility of getting a serious disease, it would havebeen folly not to take this small prudent step last March to reduce the probabilities thatdestabilizing inflation would re-emerge. The risk to the economy from inaction came tooutweigh the risk from action.To be sure, 1997 is not 1994 when the Fed was forced to tighten monetaryconditions very substantially to avoid accommodating rising inflation. Current financialconditions are much less accommodative than they were in 1994. Yet we must be wary. Whilethere is scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation at the moment, there also appearsto be little slack in our capacity to produce. Should the expected slowing in the growth ofdemand fail to materialize, we would need to address any emerging pressures in product andcredit markets.To understand the problems of capacity restraint, I should like to spend a fewmoments on what we have learned over the years about economic growth and the conditionsnecessary to foster it.First it is useful to distinguish between two quite different types of economicgrowth. One is true, sustainable growth, the other is not. True growth reflects the capacity of theeconomic system to produce goods and services and is based on the growth in productivity andin the labor force.BIS Review   50/1997
- 3 -That growth contrasts with the second type, what I would call transitory growth.An economy producing near capacity can expand faster for a short time through excess creditcreation. But this is not growth in any meaningful sense of promoting lasting increases instandards of living for our nation. Indeed, it will detract from achieving our long-term goals.Temporary fluctuations in output owing to say, inventory adjustments, but not financed throughexcess credit, will quickly adjust on their own and need not concern us as much, provided policyis appropriately positioned to foster sustainable growth.When excessive credit fostered by the central bank finances excess demand,history tells us destabilizing inflationary pressures eventually emerge. For a considerable portionof the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, inflationary credit excesses and prices werecontained by a gold standard and balanced budgets. Both, however, were deemed tooconstraining to the achievement of wider social goals as well as for other reasons, and insteadthe Federal Reserve was given the mandate of maintaining the appropriate degree of liquidity inthe system.Over the long haul, the economy’s growth is effectively limited to the expansionof capacity based on productivity and labor force growth. To be sure, it is often difficult to judgewhether observed growth is soundly based on productivity or arises from transitory surges inoutput financed in many cases by excess credit, but this is in part what making monetary policyis all about.In that regard and in the current context, how can we be confident we at theFederal Reserve are not inhibiting the nation reaching its full growth potential?One way is to examine closely the recent economic record. Only two and a halfyears ago, rising commodity prices, lengthening delivery times, and heavy overtime indicatedthat our productive facilities were under some strain to meet demand. To be sure, since early1995, those pressures have eased off. However, given the good pace of economic expansionsince then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at asufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment. Capacity utilization in industryis a little below its level through much of 1994, and pressures in product markets have remainedtame. However, falling unemployment rates and rising overtime hours -- as well as anecdotalreports -- unambiguously point to growing tightness in labor markets.With tight labor markets and little slack in product markets, we are led toconclude that significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods andservices, outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity, will presumably be resisted byhigher market interest rates. If, instead, that demand is accommodated for a time by a step up incredit expansion facilitated by monetary policy, increasing pressures on productive resourceswould sow, as they have in the past, the seeds of even higher interest rates and a consequentsubsequent economic retrenchment.This, then, was the context for our recent action. We saw a significant risk thatmonetary policy was not positioned to promote sustainable economic expansion, and we took asmall step to increase the odds that the good performance of the economy can continue.There is another point of view of the current context that merits consideration. Itis the notion that, owing largely to technological advance and to freer international trade, theconventional notions of capacity are becoming increasingly outmoded, and that domesticresources can be used much more intensively than in the past without added price pressures.BIS Review   50/1997
- 4 -There is, no doubt, a substantial element of truth in these observations, as I have often noted inthe past. Computer and telecommunication based technologies are truly revolutionizing the waywe produce goods and services. This has imparted a substantially increased degree of flexibilityinto the workplace, which in conjunction with just-in-time inventory strategies and increasedavailability of products from around the world, has kept costs in check through increasedproductivity.Our production system and the notion of capacity are far more flexible than theywere ten or twenty years ago. Nonetheless, any inference that our productive capacity isessentially unlimited is clearly unwarranted. As I pointed out earlier, judging from a number oftangible signs of strains on facilities, we were producing near capacity in early 1995, and it isjust not credible that an economy as vast and complex as that of the United States could havechanged its underlying structure in the short time since then.If we consider the current rate of true, sustainable growth unsatisfactory, are therepolicies which could augment it?In my view, improving productivity and standards of living necessitatesincreasing incentives to risk taking. To encourage people to take prudent risks, the potentialrewards must be perceived to exceed the possible losses. Maintaining low inflation rates reducesthe levels of future uncertainties and, hence, increases the scope of investment opportunities. It ishere that the Federal Reserve can most contribute to long-term growth.Other government policies also can affect these perceptions. For example, lowermarginal tax rates and capital gains taxes would increase the return to successful investmentsand, thus, the incentive to initiate them. In addition, coming to grips now with the outsizedprojected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have aprofound effect on current expectations of stability. Early actions could bring real long-terminterest rates down, also increasing the scope of investment opportunities. And, clearly,removing the federal deficit’s drain on private savings would help to finance such privateinvestment.Deregulation, by increasing the flexibility in the deployment of our capital andmanagement resources, can also make a decided contribution to growth. The deregulation oftelecommunications, motor and rail transport, utilities, and financial services, to name a few,may have done more to foster America’s competitive market efficiencies than we can readilydocument.Finally, though not a function of government policies, is the continued good paceof productivity growth this late in the business expansion. This cyclical pattern is contrary to ourexperience and it suggests there may be an undetected delayed bonus from technical andmanagerial efficiencies coming from the massive advances in computer and telecommunicationstechnology applications over the last two decades. If so, it is important that we nurture it withadequate incentives -- at a minimum, eschew regulations and taxation that reduce mostincentives -- for this may well be one source of our low inflation environment.While productivity improvement through capital investment and technologicaladvance is clearly central to the process of economic growth, the pace and quality of labor forceexpansion is additive to productivity growth in achieving overall gains in GDP. Hence,appropriate upgrading of skills through education and training should go with any menu toexpand economic growth.BIS Review   50/1997
- 5 -Looking ahead, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the economy’sprospects.For a vast nation such as ours at the cutting edge of technology, a large pickup inproductivity growth is difficult to envisage. But appropriate incentives advancing that cuttingedge can augment growth in a material way. And cumulatively, over time even a modestacceleration in productivity would very significantly improve the standards of living of ourchildren.The twenty-first century will pose many challenges to our ingenuity to developnew and sophisticated ways of creating economic value. But with the competitive benefits ofincreasingly open markets, I have little doubt we Americans will meet the challenge admirably.BIS Review   50/1997
Mr. Stals looks at the role of central banks in today’s economies and discussesthe experience of South Africa   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,Dr. Chris Stals, given at a Conference on Current Economic Policy Issues arranged by the EconomicsDepartment of the University of Durban-Westville and The Mercury in Durban on 25/4/97.1. The objective of monetary policyThere is fairly general consensus in the world of central banking today that theobjective of monetary policy should be to protect the value of the currency. There was a time up tothe late ’seventies when economists and central bankers advocated a much wider role for monetarypolicy in the management of the macroeconomy. Under the influence of the Keynesian demandmanagement approach, monetary policy was seen as a useful instrument to be used by the authoritiesto depress demand in times of an excessive rise in total real expenditure on goods and services, or tostimulate real demand in times of recessionary conditions.Monetary policy may have been an effective instrument for the purpose of demandmanagement in the global system of fixed par values, or in the times of Keynes’ General Theory ofEmployment, Interest and Money, (1936), when a lack of overall demand caused productionresources to remain under-utilised. During the 1970’s, however, the Bretton Woods System of fixedpar values was replaced with the global system of floating exchange rates and over-stimulation withexpansionary monetary and fiscal policies created inflationary pressures and persistent balance ofpayments crisis situations.The emphasis in macroeconomic policy gradually shifted from demand-sidemanagement to supply-side expansion in which monetary policy was assigned a different role.Monetary policy was no longer accepted as a useful short-term anti-cyclical policy instrument, butwas tasked with the responsibility of creating on a continuous basis a financial environment that willbe conducive to sustainable optimum economic growth in the longer term. This environment can becharacterised by stable overall financial conditions in which the rate of inflation will at all times below.In this new approach, central banks focused their attention on major financialdevelopments such as changes in the money supply and in bank credit extension, the level and thestructure of interest rates, changes in the official foreign reserves of the country, and movements inthe exchange rate. The ultimate objective of monetary policy became the value of the currency, andwhatever strategies were followed with the implementation of monetary policy, the success or failureof the policy was measured by the level of inflation.The major industrial countries were extremely successful with this new approach, andduring the eighties most major economies succeeded in reducing inflation to relatively low levels,that is, in general to about 1 to 2 per cent per annum. This left but little choice for the smallereconomies of the world to follow suit, particularly as the drive towards global financial integrationgained more momentum during the ninety- nineties.The odd old-time economist who believes that contemporary monetary policy is on awrong track, particularly in the developing economies, still surfaces from time to time. Thecounter-argument is often based on the so-called Phillips Curve or an assumed trade-off that isperceived to exist between inflation and economic growth. There is sufficient evidence to confirm,however, that in the longer term, maximum economic growth is invariably attained at the lowestpossible rate of inflation. The development of the theory of rational expectations questions thevalidity of the existence of a Phillips Curve trade-off, even in the short term.BIS Review   49/1997
- 2 -Be that as it may, a country such as South Africa with its open economy can hardlymaintain overall financial stability unless its rate of inflation stays more or less in line with theaverage rate of inflation in the economies of its major international trading partners and competitors.2. The South African experienceOn recommendation of the De Kock Commission of Inquiry into the MonetarySystem and Monetary Policy in South Africa, the South African Reserve Bank adopted moneysupply targets as the anchor for its monetary policy model in 1986. After the money supply increasedby 27 per cent in 1988, and the rate of inflation at one stage rose over 20 per cent, the new monetarypolicy model of the Reserve Bank was implemented with more vigour, and the rate of increase in themoney supply was gradually reduced to below 10 per cent in 1992. For two years in succession, theM3 money supply rose by about 8 per cent.Almost as if by magic, the rate of inflation also declined to below 10 per cent in 1993,and stayed in single- digits for the next four years. In 1996, the average rate of inflation was only 7.4per cent, the lowest level for any calendar year since 1972.The Reserve Bank seems to have lost some of its tight grip over the money supplyover the past three years, when the rate of increase in M3 accelerated to a level of about 15 per centduring each of the years 1994, 1995 and 1996. These were, however, extremely difficult years withmajor political and social reforms and the gradual reintegration of South Africa in the globaleconomy. The liberalisation of the foreign exchange market in South Africa, the access of more thanfifty foreign banks to the South African financial market, and the easier access of South Africanbanks to foreign sources of liquidity, brought major changes to the pattern of financial flows andbanking activities. The consequences of these changes for monetary policy must still be digested andanalysed in more detail, and some adjustments to the monetary policy model applied by the ReserveBank may be necessary.Initially, the acceleration in the rate of increase in the money supply had little effecton inflation. The rate of inflation indeed continued to decline to reach a lower turning point of 5.5 percent over the twelve months up to April 1996.A sharp depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand after February 1996 provided anew shock stimulus for inflation in South Africa and, assisted by a continuous excessive rate ofincrease in the money supply, the rate of increase in overall consumer prices accelerated to 9.8 percent over the twelve months up to February 1997.The Reserve Bank is greatly concerned about these latest trends in the rate of increasein the money supply, the rate of increase in bank credit extension, and in the rate of inflation. It isaccepted that the depreciation of the rand last year must inevitably lead to some price rises, but thereis a real danger that these price adjustments (of internationally tradable versus non-tradable goods andservices) will become embedded in a permanently higher rate of inflation.3. The monetary policy modelThe South African experience with the “monetarist” approach applied since 1986 wasrelatively successful. The present threat of a new surge in inflation should not be seen as a failure ofthe policy approach, but rather as a result of an external shock -- the currency depreciation -- and asevere testing of the monetary policy model in light of the changing macroeconomic environment.Central bankers may concur in general on the main objective of monetary policy,namely to protect the value of the currency, but they do not all follow the same strategy in pursuingBIS Review   49/1997
- 3 -this objective. The South African model, which is also used by many other countries, is primarilylinked to the growth in the M3 money supply, and predetermined guidelines for an acceptable rate ofgrowth in M3 should be seen as an intermediate objective of monetary policy. It is based on theassumption that, over time, there is a link between the rate of expansion in the money supply andinflation. If the real economy, for example, expands by 3 per cent per annum, and the current rate ofinflation is 7 per cent, a continuous increase in the nominal money supply at rates of more than 10 percent per annum will eventually exert upward pressure on inflation. Increases in the money supply ofless than 10 per cent will drag inflation downwards.Over the past few years, the Reserve Bank had indicated that an appropriate rate ofincrease for the South African money supply would be between 6 and 10 per cent. The realised ratesof increase were, however, around the level of 15 per cent during each of the years 1994, 1995 and1996. Initially, the Bank was less concerned about this excessive rate of increase in the moneysupply, particularly also in light of the relatively low rates of increase of well below 10 per centestablished in 1992 and 1993. Inflation also remained on a downward path up to April 1996. It isonly over the past twelve months therefore that inflation started moving up again, triggered by thedepreciation of the rand last year.The persistently high rates of increase in M3 were partly caused by structural changesin the South African economy. More people were absorbed in the market economy, earned regularincomes, and opened bank accounts for the first time. More banks were established in South Africa,particularly foreign banks, and offered more banking services to the South African public. SouthAfrican banks found easier access to foreign sources of credit, and made the conventional ReserveBank instruments to control overall liquidity in the banking sector less effective.The main reason for the larger than desirable increases in the money supply wasconcentrated in relatively large increases of almost 20 per cent per annum in the total amount of bankcredit extended to the private sector. The monetary policy model based on the control of increases inthe money supply, requires some effective control over the amount of bank credit extension, becausethis is the main source of money creation in the South African market-oriented economy.Control over bank credit extension requires not only a restriction on the amount ofliquidity available in the banking sector, but also the acceptance of realistic interest rates. Despite themaintenance of relatively high interest rates in South Africa, and a series of increases in interest ratessince November 1995, the demand for bank credit remained relatively strong. This may indicate aless interest-rate sensitive demand for credit in South Africa that may be associated with thesocio-political changes over the past few years already referred to above.The Reserve Bank remains concerned about the excessive rates of growth in themoney supply, and remains committed to reducing this monetary stimulation of inflation during thecourse of 1997. Recent trends in the money supply and bank credit extension beg the question,however, whether monetary policy at this juncture is restrictive enough and whether even morestringent measures may not be required to reduce overall liquidity further, which could, of course,lead to even higher interest rates and hopefully also a decline in the demand for credit.4. Other functions of the central bankRestricting the functions of the central bank to the monetary objective of creating astable overall financial environment, vests a further important responsibility with the monetaryauthorities, and that is to encourage and support the development of sound and well-managedbanking institutions. Banking institutions replace the central bank as the major supplier of money tothe public, and therefore have become important conduits for the implementation of monetary policy.BIS Review   49/1997
- 4 -The South African Reserve Bank has therefore been vested also with the task of bankregulation and supervision. This task is becoming increasingly more difficult as banking institutionsbecome more multi-national, and as cross-border financial operations increase. The Reserve Bank’sBank Supervision Department works very closely with their counterparts in many other countries toensure that uniform, compatible and effective prudential directives are complied with by all banksoperating in South Africa, and also by the foreign branches and subsidiaries of South African residentbanking institutions.The defined objective for monetary policy also requires of the central bank to acceptsome leading role in the development and administration of an efficient functioning nationalpayments, settlement and clearing system. The Reserve Bank is now working with the other bankinginstitutions to upgrade the South African payments, settlement and clearing system. Provision willsoon be made for real-time on-line settlement of large transactions, and for the daily netting andsettlement of smaller payment transactions done through the banking system.Efficient monetary policy in a market-oriented economy finally also requireswell-functioning financial markets. The Reserve Bank therefore has a vested interest in thedevelopment of the money, capital and foreign exchange markets. In the case of the South Africanforeign exchange market, the Reserve Bank is working closely with the Minister of Finance graduallyto phase out exchange controls, and to integrate the South African financial markets withinternational markets.5. ConclusionThe South African experience ratifies the international experience that monetarypolicy should primarily be aimed at financial objectives and should at all times be used to promoteoverall financial stability. This is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the promotion ofeconomic growth and development in the interest of all the people of the country.In pursuing its strictly defined financial objectives, the central bank should have someautonomy from Government and should be enabled to take quick and objective decisions on theimplementation of monetary policy. There must, however, always be close co- operation with theMinister of Finance, and monetary and fiscal policy should be closely co-ordinated. In the finalsituation, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Reserve Bank are jointly responsible formaintaining overall financial stability in the country.BIS Review   49/1997
Mr. Greenspan offers his thoughts on the efforts currently being maderelating to supervision and regulation of the financial markets   Remarks by the Chairman ofthe US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Spring Meeting of the Institute ofInternational Finance in Washington on 29/4/97.I will take this occasion to offer some thoughts related to the upcoming G-7economic summit meeting, which will be held in Denver in less than two months. One theme inrecent summit meetings -- starting in Halifax in 1995 and continuing in Lyon last year -- hasbeen the promotion of stability in international financial markets. My purpose today is not todescribe all the efforts that have been made in that regard, which relate primarily to supervisionand regulation. Rather, I would like to step back a bit and offer a framework for thinking aboutthose efforts.To begin with, we should not lose sight of the fact that government regulation, ifnot carefully designed, can undermine the effectiveness of private market regulation and canitself be ineffective in protecting the public interest. No market is ever truly unregulated in thatthe self-interest of participants generates private market regulation. Counterparties thoroughlyscrutinize each other, often requiring collateral and special legal protections; self-regulatedclearing houses and exchanges set margins and capital requirements to protect the interests of themembers. Thus, the real question is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather, it iswhether government intervention strengthens or weakens private regulation, and at what cost. Atworst, the introduction of government rules may actually weaken the effectiveness of regulationif government regulation is itself ineffective or, more importantly, undermines incentives forprivate market regulation. Regulation by government unavoidably involves some element ofperverse incentives, that is, moral hazard. If private market participants believe that governmentis protecting their interests, their own efforts to do so will diminish.At the same time, societies have judged that it is not sufficient to rely exclusivelyon the private sector to ensure the adequacy of the management of risk in our financial systems.There is a perceived need for supervision and regulation by the public sector, as well. As I willpoint out shortly, this need arises largely to counter the potential moral hazard that arises as aconsequence of the development of large safety nets for our financial systems.Many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from theirwillingness to take risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage.Through leverage, in the form principally of taking deposits, banks perform a critical role in thefinancial intermediation process; they provide savers with additional investment choices andborrowers with a greater range of sources of credit, thereby facilitating a more efficientallocation of resources and contributing importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed, it hasbeen the evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of ourfinancial systems from the earliest times -- certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discoveredthat lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable.Central bank provision of mechanisms for converting highly illiquid portfoliosinto liquid ones in extraordinary circumstances -- a key element of our safety nets -- has led to agreater degree of leverage in banking than market forces alone would support. Traditionallythese mechanisms involve making discount or Lombard facilities available, so that individualdepositories could turn illiquid assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled marketconditions by the forced selling of such assets or the calling of loans. More broadly, open marketoperations, in situations like that which followed the crash of stock markets around the world inBIS Review   46/1997
- 2 -1987, satisfy increased needs for liquidity for the system as a whole that otherwise could feedcumulative, self-reinforcing contractions across many financial markets.Of course, this same leverage and risk-taking also greatly increase the possibilityof bank failures. Without leverage, losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by a bank’sowners, virtually eliminating the chance that the bank would be unable to meet its obligations inthe case of a “failure.” Some failures can be of a bank’s own making, resulting, for example,from poor credit judgments. For the most part, these failures are a normal and important part ofthe market process and provide discipline and information to other participants regarding thelevel of business risks. However, because of the important roles that banks and other financialintermediaries play in our financial systems, such failures could have large ripple effects thatspread throughout business and financial markets at great cost.The presence of the safety net, which inevitably imparts a subsidy to banks, hascreated a disconnect between risk-taking by banks and banks’ cost of capital. It is this disconnectthat has made necessary a degree of supervision and regulation that would not be necessarywithout the existence of the safety net. That is, regulators are compelled to act as a surrogate formarket discipline since the market signals that usually accompany excessive risk-taking aresubstantially muted, and because the prices to banks of government deposit guarantees, or ofaccess to the safety net more generally, do not, and probably cannot, vary sufficiently with riskto mimic market prices. The problems that arise from the retarding of the pressures of marketdiscipline have led us increasingly to accept supervision and regulation that endeavors tosimulate the market responses that would occur if there were no safety net, but without giving upits protections.To be sure, we should recognize that if we choose to have the advantages of asafety net and a leveraged system of financial intermediaries, the burden of managing risk in thefinancial system will not lie with the private sector alone. With leveraging there will alwaysexist a remote possibility of a chain reaction, a cascading sequence of defaults that willculminate in financial implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a modern central bank, with itsunlimited power to create money, can with a high probability thwart such a process before itbecomes destructive. Hence, central banks will of necessity be drawn into becoming lenders oflast resort. But implicit in the existence of such a role is that there will be some form ofallocation between the public and private sectors of the burden of risk of extreme outcomes.Thus, central banks are led to provide what essentially amounts to catastrophic financialinsurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only the rarest of disasters. Ifthe owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped upfrequently by government support, it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices.In theory, the allocation of responsibility for risk-bearing between the privatesector and the central bank depends upon an evaluation of the private cost of capital. In order toattract, or at least retain, capital, a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overalleconomy’s rate of return, adjusted for risk. In competitive financial markets, the greater theleverage, the higher the rate of return, before adjustment for risk. If private financial institutionshave to absorb all financial risk, then the degree to which they can leverage will be limited, thefinancial sector smaller, and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand, ifcentral banks effectively insulate private institutions from the largest potential losses, howeverincurred, increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers or produce inflationaryinstability as a consequence of excess money creation.BIS Review   46/1997
- 3 -Thus, governments, including central banks, have been given certainresponsibilities related to their banking and financial systems that must be balanced. We havethe responsibility to prevent major financial market disruptions through development andenforcement of prudent regulatory standards and, if necessary in rare circumstances, throughdirect intervention in market events. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that privatesector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and appropriate risks.Our goal as supervisors should not be to prevent all bank failures, but to maintainsufficient prudential standards so that banking problems that do occur do not becomewidespread. We try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations, as well as throughformal and informal supervisory policies and procedures.The revolution in information and data processing technology has transformedour financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In mostrespects, these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transactionscosts, to the benefit of consumers of financial services, and for managing risks. But in somerespects they have increased the potential for more rapid and widespread disruption.The efficiency of global financial markets, engendered by the rapid proliferationof financial products, has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughoutthe financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago, and not even remotelyimagined in the 19th century. Financial crises in the early 19th century, for example, particularlythose associated with the Napoleonic Wars, were often related to military and other events infaraway places. Communication was still comparatively primitive. An investor’s speculativeposition could be wiped out by a military setback, and he might not even know about it for daysor even weeks, which, from the perspective of central banking today, might be considered bliss.Similarly, the collapse of Barings Brothers in 1995 showed how much morerapidly losses can be generated in the current environment relative to a century earlier whenBarings Brothers confronted a similar episode. Current technology enables single individuals toinitiate massive transactions with very rapid execution. Clearly, not only has the productivity ofglobal finance increased markedly, but so, obviously, has the ability to generate losses at apreviously inconceivable rate.These technological forces also have been central to the process of globalization,that is, the growing integration of national economies -- including national financial markets.They are, of course, not the only forces. The gradual removal of barriers to trade, deregulationand reform of financial systems, and simply the enormous creation of wealth have all generatedthe demand and opportunities for the expansion of investment and business horizons beyondnational boundaries. Technological changes have facilitated such an expansion.The growing importance of emerging market economies in international financialmarkets is one manifestation not just of the impressive growth of those economies but also ofincreasing global integration. Thus, it is not surprising that the need to promote financialstability, and in particular to enhance prudential supervision, in emerging market economies wasidentified at the Lyon summit as an important objective. It is important for those economiesindividually and for all of us collectively.One element of the follow-up to the Lyon summit that is especially fitting in thecontext of my earlier remarks has been efforts to enhance market transparency, including more -- and more meaningful -- public disclosure. Meaningful public disclosures by firms about theBIS Review   46/1997
- 4 -nature of their risk exposures and their procedures for managing those risks contributesignificantly to the constructive role of market discipline. Not surprisingly, the market itself isprobably the most powerful source of pressure for improved disclosures.I might mention one specific accomplishment related to market transparency.Central banks have agreed to establish a system of regular reporting of derivatives activities bythe world’s major dealers, beginning as of June 1998. The system has been designed to yieldaggregate data on global trading activities in a manner that avoids double counting and issensitive to reporting burden. The aggregate data will be publicly released to enable firms toassess their own activities in relation to the market as a whole.The globalization of international financial markets and of the operations ofindividual firms clearly calls for international cooperation among supervisors. Correspondingly,supervisory cooperation is an important element of the G-7 summit agenda on financial stability.Much of the recent work has related to the desirability of a more systematic exchange ofinformation among national supervisors, including consideration of what kinds of informationneed to be exchanged and under what circumstances. The possible need for and possible roles ofan “information coordinator” have been central issues in the Joint Forum discussions.The objective of a more systematic exchange of information is easy to support inprinciple. However, when it comes to implementation, there are questions that need to beaddressed. Even more questions arise when one thinks of going beyond the exchange ofinformation to other forms of supervisory coordination, involving a “lead regulator” of somekind that is intended to fill so-called supervisory gaps.What are the supervisory gaps that need to be filled? Each of us could probablypoint to episodes where problems could have been avoided, or the degree of disruption couldhave been reduced, if better information had been available sooner to supervisory authorities.Perhaps Barings is one example. It is more difficult to point to episodes when the absence offormal arrangements for coordination of supervisory actions inhibited a response to a problem.Conversely, might arrangements that are too formal, too rigid, or too cumbersome themselvesinhibit appropriate responses in emergency situations, each of which is likely to be unique?Another question is whether supervisory authorities have the expertise andresources to provide meaningful oversight and develop accurate assessments of the risk-takingactivities of large, diversified, globally active financial institutions. If the answer is no, as mightwell be the case, should we nevertheless convey to market participants the sense that we are infact adequately supervising such activities? Wouldn’t that reduce the incentives for marketparticipants themselves to provide discipline?Would a statement that all major financial firms, even the most diversified ones,are subject to coordinated supervision suggest a degree of support that effectively extends, to anunwarranted extent, the subsidy associated with national safety nets? Would it generate a degreeof moral hazard that could itself be the source of systemic risk?The answers to these questions are not straightforward. However, while manyfirms should reassess and upgrade their risk management procedures, and supervisors shouldimprove their procedures as well, I do not believe that the need for a radical change in ourframework for the supervision of internationally active financial firms has been demonstrated.The paradigm of supervision itself is, of necessity, continuously adjusted to the rapidlychanging, technologically driven financial system. In recent years, firms and supervisors alikeBIS Review   46/1997
- 5 -have sought to harness technological advances to enhance risk management procedures. Muchthought has been given to how to make public disclosure more meaningful and to reinforcemarket discipline. Supervisors around the world, not just in the major industrial countries, havegotten to know each other better and to understand better each others’ problems and policies.The legal and institutional infrastructure of financial markets has been significantly improved.Along with good macroeconomic policy -- a topic for another day -- a continuation of thisongoing process of careful and measured progress represents the most constructive strategy forensuring financial stability.BIS Review   46/1997
Mr. Stals discusses financial sector reforms and their implications for thebanking industry in South Africa   Address by the Governor of the South African ReserveBank, Dr. C. Stals, at the official opening of the new Head Office Building for Mercantile Bankin Sandton on 9/4/97.1. The need for financial sector reformsIn many countries in the world there is at this stage a need for major reforms ofthe financial sector, which invariably holds important changes for the banking industry. Lookingaround the world, at least three reasons can be found for financial restructuring.Firstly, there are the countries of Central and Eastern Europe where majortransitions are taking place in the economies of the former centrally-planned countries of thenow defunct Communist world. The transition from socialist to market-oriented economiesrequires in most of these countries a major reform of the functions and of the role of the centralbank, the introduction of private sector banking institutions driven by the profit motive, thedevelopment of financial markets, and the acceptance of macroeconomic monetary policies thatplayed no role in the previously centrally-planned systems.In these countries, it was necessary to introduce certain basic minimumrequirements first, such as a recognised system of business laws including corporate,bankruptcy, contract, consumer protection and private property laws that can be consistentlyenforced and will provide a mechanism for fair resolution of disputes. In most of these countriesuntil a few years ago there did not exist well-defined accounting principles and rules, andindependent auditors were not available to certify financial statements and accounts of bankinginstitutions.In summary, the public infrastructure for the management and running of modernbanking activity did not exist and had to be established before modern financial market systemscould be developed.Secondly, a number of developing countries, particularly from the Africancontinent, have recently embarked on major macroeconomic restructuring programmes, in manycases in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.In a recent publication of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africathe need for the reform of the financial sectors of African economies was described as follows:“Financial systems in Africa are characterized by the low level of financialintermediation which takes place in the formal sector, the distressed nature of financialinstitutions, the high risk profile of financial asset portfolios due to the concentration ofnumerous countries’ economies in only a few commodities and industrial sectors and thevulnerability of financial asset portfolios to price and supply shocks. In addition, very fewformal financial institutions have shown the capacity or willingness to provide financial servicesto the small-scale entrepreneur and the rural operators.“Furthermore, the range of financial institutions and instruments is narrow. Publicownership of financial institutions is pervasive. Institutions are plagued by a large proportion ofnon-performing loans in their portfolios. Management lacks the relevant management skills.Financial market depth and breadth is still very limited.”BIS Review   47/1997
- 2 -Reforms in these developing countries have focused on improving the legal,regulatory, supervisory and judiciary environment, reducing financial repression, restoring banksoundness, rehabilitating financial infrastructure, and have included programmes designed todownsize publicly-owned banks, privatising them where possible and encouraging new entrants.Thirdly, reference can be made to financial sector reforms in the emergingeconomies of the world. In these countries some stage of advancement has already been reachedin the development of financial systems. However, new demands are now being made in light ofa new global financial environment, characterised by a liberalisation of financial markets, anintegration of major global markets and an exposure of individual countries to relatively largeinternational capital movements.In these countries, exchange controls have been or are being removed,multinational financial institutions, including banks, are granted unrestricted entry, andinternational rules for financial regulation and supervision are being introduced that must becomplied with to the satisfaction of international investors. Domestic monetary policy objectivesmust be brought to terms with the requirements of international market operators, andgovernments must accept some eroding of their sovereign autonomy for the management of thenational economy.2. Financial sector reforms in South AfricaSouth Africa is part of the latter group of countries. Together with the majorsocial and political reforms of the past few years, we also had to contend with some importantrestructuring of the financial system.Firstly, the South African financial sector, not unlike other countries on theAfrican continent, had to adapt to the changes in the socio-political environment. Provision wasmade in the banking legislation for the existence and continuation of numerous informal savingsclubs (“stokvels”) operating outside the normal constraints of bank regulation and supervision,but also then, of course, without access to central bank accommodation at the discount window.New legislation to provide for communal ownership of a banking institution was introduced inthe form of the Mutual Banks Act. South African banking institutions also adopted their owninternal policies to provide for greater participation in the social upliftment programmes of thecountry.Secondly, bank regulation and supervision underwent major changes over the pastten years to apply the world-wide supported directives of the Basle Committee. At this stage,bank regulation and supervision is based primarily on risk identification and management, withclearly defined roles for shareholders, boards of directors, senior management and internal andexternal auditors.Thirdly the South African banking scene was opened up for foreign banks. SouthAfrican banks, in turn, were allowed to establish branch offices, subsidiaries and representativeoffices in many countries around the world.Fourthly, major changes were introduced in the operations of the financialmarkets. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange led the way with a major restructuring last year toprovide for electronic screen trading, corporate and non-resident participation, and provision fornegotiated commissions and principal versus broking trade by members of the Exchange.BIS Review   47/1997
- 3 -Fifthly, with the gradual removal of exchange controls, the South African marketin foreign exchange became more competitive and volumes increased to an average of more than$6 billion per day.Sixthly, with South Africa’s active participation in the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC), the way has been opened up for South African banks to playan enhanced role in the Southern African region.The process of financial sector reform in South Africa is continuing. Exchangecontrols have only been removed partly, and South African banks are only gradually adaptingthemselves to the environment of greater freedom in their international financial operations.Further important changes will be introduced in the structure of the domestic capital market,particularly in so far as the primary issues of government bonds are concerned, and also in thesecondary market-making activities of the Reserve Bank. A major revision of the nationalpayment, clearing and settlement system is now under way to provide for real-time on-linesettlement on a gross basis of large transactions, and a daily netting and settlement of smalltransactions in the money market.3. Implications for the banking sectorThese financial reforms have important implications for the South Africanbanking sector. Not only did the liberalisation of the markets bring greater competition for thetraditional domestic South African banks, but they were also more exposed to the vicissitudes ofvolatile international capital movements. Our banks were forced to adopt a more open andglobal attitude in the daily management of their activities. Not only the policies of the SouthAfrican monetary authorities, but also developments in, for example, the United States ofAmerica, the European Union, the Far East, and in other emerging economies of the world, nowhave a profound effect on the South African money, capital and foreign exchange markets.There are now more than ten foreign banks with formally established branches orsubsidiaries in South Africa, and more than 60 international banks with representative offices inthe country. These foreign banks provide enhanced competition for the South African banks,particularly in the field of wholesale banking, international trade financing, and in the market forforeign exchange.The liberalisation of the financial market also opened up opportunities forunscrupulous financial operators that are making use of the opportunity to exploit ignorant SouthAfricans with offers of unrealistic yields on deposits, and promises of instant miraculous profitson financial investments. It is amazing that so many South Africans still fall for deceptions suchas the ill-fated pyramid schemes that has just recently pushed Albania over the edge of completesocial and political collapse. It is even more amazing that the efforts of the Registrar of Banks toprotect the South African public against inevitable losses through these exploitations must bedefended in courts and in time-consuming litigations. In his efforts to avoid an Albaniansituation from developing here, the Registrar is even accused of acting against the Constitution.The changing financial environment also holds important implications formonetary policy in South Africa. The explosion in the volumes of transactions in all thefinancial markets, the greater participation of all South African residents in financial marketoperations, the reintegration of South Africa in the world financial system and the liberalisationof financial operations such as foreign exchange transactions, have had an important effect onthe amount of bank credit extension and the money supply. These conventional anchors ofBIS Review   47/1997
- 4 -monetary policy also increased at unacceptably high rates over the past two years, partly becauseof structural changes, and partly because of normal pressures of demand increasing at a rate inexcess of real income increases.For both the Reserve Bank and the individual banking institution the changingenvironment brings many challenges. Banks operating in the new environment must be aware ofthe increased risk exposures that are inevitably associated with an extended process of change.Conventional bank prudency becomes even more important in this situation than under morestable conditions. In many other countries a period of major financial sector reforms ended inmajor restructuring and rationalisation of the banking sector, often because of unsustainableover-expansion in individual institutions. The Reserve Bank’s concerns about the excessiveincreases in bank credit extension are not only for the effect it has on the total money supply, butalso because of the inherent dangers of a concerted future major default in the servicing of thedebt under less favourable macroeconomic conditions. The capacity of borrowers to meet futurecommitments of interest and debt repayment must not be over-stretched during this period ofstructural change and rapid expansion in the financial markets.4. Mercantile Bank and financial sector reforms in South AfricaThe Mercantile Lisbon Bank Holdings Group has been and continues to be part ofthe financial sector adjustment process in South Africa. With a substantial shareholding by theBanco National Ultramarino of Portugal, Mercantile is firmly linked to the expandinginternational participation in South Africa. Furthermore, this association brings to MercantileBank the experience of Portugal’s largest commercial bank in its participation in the structuralfinancial adjustment of a country that is preparing itself for the major reforms demanded ofprospective participants in the European Union’s integrated financial system and common Eurocurrency.South Africa obviously has a great interest in these developments now takingplace in Europe. Our recent successful negotiations for qualified access to the Lomé Conventionprovide proof of the importance attached to our future relations with the European Union. Thesupportive role of Portugal in these negotiations was appreciated. We believe that Portugal willbe able to comply with the Maastricht requirements for full participation in the first round ofEconomic and Monetary Union scheduled for 1 January 1999, and will therefore also continueto carry South Africa’s interests into the European Union.Mercantile Bank has also been part of the domestic South African financial sectorreforms in recent years. Since the acquisition in 1994 of Central Registrars, the operations of thetwo companies were gradually integrated. The changes in the operations of the JohannesburgStock Exchange last year had a significant impact on Mercantile Registrars, and its contributionto the non-interest income of the Group had increased considerably with the larger volumestraded on the JSE.Finally, Mercantile Bank is also expanding its interests to other African countries,for example Mozambique, and is therefore taking up the challenge of greater financial co-operation in the SADC region.I can only wish you well in your future operations, and may this new buildingcontribute to your future successes, in the interest of the development of a sound and well-managed banking sector in South Africa.BIS Review   47/1997
Mr. Bäckström gives a broadbrush picture of the Swedish economy andmonetary policy   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Urban Bäckström, heldat seminars before the Midland Bank and Merrill Lynch, respectively, in New York on 30/4/97.Economic developments in recent yearsIn the past few years Swedish economic policy has achieved tangible results.•By an improvement in credibility, important progress has been madetowards greater economic stability. Favourable economic growth inSweden has been combined with a rate of inflation that is the lowest forseveral decades.•There is broad political agreement in Sweden on the consolidation ofgovernment finance. This is manifested in the so called  convergenceprogramme that aims to eliminate the budget deficit not later than 1998.The budget reinforcements which the Government and the Riksdag(Sweden’s parliament) have undertaken in recent years are extensive. Thesix-monthly monitoring arrangement provides a means of ensuring thatgovernment finance is developing as planned. Moreover, in the EconomicBill this spring the Government states that the long-term target for thegeneral Government budget is a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP as a cyclicalaverage. The gradual adjustment to this goal is also specified.The general government financial balance has been strengthened from -12.3 per cent of GDP in 1993 to -2.5 per cent in 1996. This is a substantialimprovement. The Government calculates that in 1997 the deficit will be2.1 per cent and that the target of eliminating it in 1998 will be achieved.•With the improved confidence in budget and monetary policy, togetherwith the tighter interest rate policy from the second half of 1994 up to theend of 1995, it has been possible to check the earlier inflationarytendencies and bring inflation expectations down appreciably. Sweden isnow among the countries in Europe with the lowest inflation rateregardless of which measure one uses. This, in turn, paved the way for agradual lowering of our main instrumental rate - the repo rate - in 1996.•What used to be an almost chronic deficit on current account has nowbeen turned into a substantial surplus. This is reducing Sweden’s externaldebt, which also contributes to greater financial stability.•Many structural measures have been implemented since the late 1980s.There are signs that, together with economic policy’s focus on stability,this has reduced the economy’s inflation propensity and raised potentialoutput.Against this background, the direction of Sweden’s economic policy contrastssharply with the unstable, inflationary path we experienced in the 1970s and ’80s and whichcontributed to the recession in the early ’90s, which was the worst for over sixty years.BIS Review   47/1997
- 2 -A new direction in economic policyThe 1970s and ’80s illustrate how a period of inflation creates an atmosphere ofuncertainty and instability, with a speculative climate and “short-termism” in economicdecisions. Slowly but surely, production’s long-term conditions deteriorate.It was partly in the light of such experiences that Swedish economic policy wasrealigned at the turn of the 1980s. Since then, the focus on price stability has gained broadsupport in our society, including the political parties.However, in view of the severe economic problems in the early 1990s, withinflation expectations based on our historical record and a massive budget deficit, it took timefor the new direction of economic policy to acquire credibility. This has been evident, forinstance, in the periods of interest and exchange rate unrest. Financial market trends particularlyin the longer run can be regarded as an indicator of the prevailing degree of confidence in thedetermination and ability to conduct an economic policy that is consistent and oriented towardsstability.With the free movement of capital and the globalisation of financial markets,economic policy decision-makers need to be highly disciplined. In the light of our experiencesince the policy realignment at the turn of the ’80s, this is a fact that is widely recognised todayin Sweden. Turning the clock back would not be feasible.Experience from other countries, where the policy realignment had already beenmade in the early 1980s, indicates that the creation of confidence in a low inflation regime takestime and a lot of hard work. But it also shows that after a while, such a process does yield itsreward in the form of low interest rates, a stable currency and ultimately a favourable economicdevelopment.The price stability targetFollowing the move to a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy in Sweden isdirected at a quantified inflation target. In this it resembles the situation for monetary policy inAustralia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where inflation targets are also used.In Sweden the target is formulated as being to limit the increase in the consumerprice index to 2 per cent. This target is to be assessed, not in terms of isolated twelve-monthchange figures but in a somewhat longer, annual, perspective. As  monetary policy obviouslycannot control price developments exactly, the target is accompanied by a tolerance interval of±1 percentage point. This tolerance interval also serves to absorb temporary deviations fromtrend inflation. Such deviations may arise, for instance, from political decisions to alter indirecttaxes and subsidies, changes in interest rates as well as from international price shocks.For March 1997 the consumer price index showed a twelve-month fall of 0.4 percent. However, this figure was to a large extent influenced by last year’s sharp repo rate cuts.When home owners renew mortgage loans at lower interest rates we get a transitory downwardeffect on inflation.It is important to distinguish between CPI changes and underlying inflation.Transitory effects, for example changes in interest rates or in indirect taxes and subsidies, maycause the general price level to jump up and down. In the conduct of monetary policy it isBIS Review   47/1997
- 3 -therefore important to keep an eye on underlying inflation; the transitory effects are ofsecondary significance as long as they do not affect inflation expectations and thereby trendinflation.Given the time lag that applies to monetary policy, a central bank that targetsinflation has to monitor the various factors which determine inflation one to two years ahead.In a simple analysis of inflation’s determinants one can start from the familiaraugmented Phillips curve. The rate of inflation is determined by two factors: the relationshipbetween supply and demand in the economy - the output gap - and inflation’s expected rate.Note, however, that while the output gap is a useful starting point for an inflationanalysis, there is no simple way of measuring it. This makes it necessary to go into more detailand study a variety of indicators in order to analyse any tensions between demand and supply.Still, the output gap is a suitable starting point for my present purpose.The simple model tells us that when the output gap is closed, inflation is constantand equal to the expected rate. This means that, with normal capacity utilisation and given a lowlevel of inflation expectations, actual GDP can follow potential output. In such a situation someform of external shock is needed to shift inflation upwards or downwards. This can mean eitherthat production falls below or rises above the level for normal capacity utilisation or thatinflation expectations move up or down. The latter case is ultimately a matter of confidence ineconomic policy’s consistency and its future reactions.The ability of monetary policy to influence inflation has to do with the impact ofthe instrumental rate on the path of GDP and thereby on the degree of capacity utilisation,together with its effect on inflation expectations. In practice a period of restricted demand hasfrequently been necessary for the central bank to show that expectations of high inflation areunfounded. Besides monetary policy, expectations are affected by other factors. One of these isthe budget. Unsustainably large budget deficits are liable to undermine confidence in long-termprice stability.Our inflation forecast serves as a foundation for decisions about monetaryconditions. If monetary policy is directed at stabilising inflation at 2 per cent, it will over timehelp to stabilise demand so that this is in line with the economy’s available capacity.In order to clarify our line of reasoning and our inflation assessments, theRiksbank publishes an inflation report four times a year. A range of indicators is reviewed inthese reports, accompanied by a discussion of risks and opportunities in the field of inflation.The present situationIn the latest inflation report, published this March, GDP growth in 1997 and 1998was expected to be around 2 and 3 per cent, respectively. It was also argued that sizeablecapacity restrictions should not arise in the course of the period. Given that, and inflationexpectations being low, underlying domestic inflation (measured with the CPI excludingtransitory effects on inflation) in the coming two years was put at between 1.5 and 2 per cent.As we all know, to forecast inflation is a complicated task. In view of theshortcomings in such estimates, it is more a matter of assessing the balance of risks. Our latestBIS Review   47/1997
- 4 -inflation report therefore includes a discussion of two alternatives in which future inflationmight be either lower or higher than in the main scenario.One alternative is that inflation could be lower than in the main scenario, mainlyif private consumption were to be weak. The other envisages the opposite - higher inflation - onaccount of a weaker exchange rate that stimulates a stronger growth of exports and GDP, leadingto increased inflationary pressure.What are the economic tendencies that have appeared during the last months?During winter there were signs of a slowdown in manufacturing. The Decembersurvey from the National Institute of Economic Research showed an unchanged inflow of ordersand expectations of subdued production. The order statistics from Statistics Sweden, whichfluctuate fairly widely from month to month, gave the impression of relatively weak orders inthe fourth quarter of 1996. In December and January, however, the order inflow has picked upand more recent survey data likewise paint a brighter picture of activity in manufacturing. Theimprovement mainly applies to production for export but even the domestic market is somewhatoptimistic about the future. Against this background, exports and industrial production coulddevelop somewhat better than expected earlier. The changes are not very large but to datevarious indicators, including the continued undervaluation of the krona, do point in the samedirection.In the case of private consumption, the indicators to date are not uniform. On theone hand, in the first three months of 1997 the number of new car registrations for privateindividuals has risen in annual terms by more than 60 per cent, albeit from a low level.Moreover, the survey of household purchasing plans by Statistics Sweden shows that since theautumn, household’s economic expectations have become more optimistic. The development ofmonetary aggregates such as M0 is also an indication of rising private consumption. On theother hand, the lower than expected savings ratio in 1996 may increase uncertainty regardingpossible increases of private consumption in 1997 and 1998. Another indicator of a slowerincrease in private consumption could be the weak labour market.In summary it can be said that, on the one hand, exports seem to be doingsomewhat better than expected, though the differences are not all that great. On the other hand,the signals about private consumption point either to agreement with the main scenario or to asomewhat weaker course.The conclusion in the latest inflation report was that monetary policy is wellbalanced. That conclusion still holds true.BIS Review   47/1997
Mr. Erçel explains developments in the Turkish economy that help inunderstanding the country’s market opportunites   Speech by the Governor of the CentralBank of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Gazi Erçel, on the occasion of the Conference on “Privateprovision of infrastructure in Turkey” held at Çiragan Palace in Istanbul on 3/4/97.For a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities offered by Turkey’smarket, I should stress the implications of our journey toward liberalisation. In 1980, with worldconditions changing and the domestic economy in crisis, Turkey launched a structuraladjustment program based on free market principles and an outward-looking economic policy.Since then, a series of liberalisation measures have been taken. The most significantaccomplishment of the Turkish liberalisation process is that it has restructured economicrelations. Both the financial system and the foreign exchange system have been liberalised.Before discussing Turkey’s economic performance, I would like to describe some features of ourforeign exchange system and financial system. Let me begin with the foreign exchange system.Efforts to liberalise Turkey’s balance of payments go all the way back to the Great Depression,and ever since the 1930’s, the issue has been whether to liberalise the current account or thecapital account. Now these questions have been settled. Let me summarise the state of theforeign exchange regime under five headings:1. Residents are permitted to buy, sell, and use foreign exchange freely.2. Residents are also allowed to purchase, through authorised financialinstitutions, shares quoted on foreign stock markets, and are permitted to transfer foreignexchange abroad to pay for purchases of such securities.3.  By the same token, non-residents are allowed to buy and sell Turkish securitiesquoted on the Turkish stock market. They are also allowed to buy and sell Turkish governmentsecurities through intermediary institutions operating in Turkey.4. A substantial part of the controls on capital movements were removed, greatlyeasing inflows and outflows of credit. Turkey has accepted the provisions of Article VIII of theArticles of Agreement.5. To avoid excessive risks for the banks, new regulations were adoptedgoverning the foreign exchange position of the commercial banks. The banks are free to set theirown rates for buying and selling foreign exchange.Our foreign exchange system, described above, is very convenient for foreigncapital flows. Now let me describe the main characteristics of our financial system. Even thoughour efforts to liberalise the financial system did not begin until 1980, the Istanbul ExchangeMarket has existed and operated since 1858. It grew out of the activities of Non-Muslim bankersin the Galata district of Istanbul. These operators, mostly Levantines, Jews, Armenians, andGreeks, used to risk their own capital by extending credit to the government, secured by pledgesof future tax collections. Even though during the early years of the Exchange Market’s operationin the 1860’s, the amount of foreign direct investment in Turkey was negligible, foreign capitalwas being encouraged to form joint stock companies. Up until the beginning of the 20th century,the Market helped the government find funds to finance its obligations. In 1906, the IstanbulExchange Market was re-organised and once more became a source of new capital for youngprivate ventures.BIS Review   42/1997
- 2 -Without giving the whole history of the Istanbul Exchange Market, I want toemphasise that Turkey’s experience with free markets did not begin in 1980 but goes back morethan a century before. What the reforms of 1980 did accomplish was to institutionalise themarkets and put them on a solid legal footing.Besides liberalisation, the structural reforms begun in 1980 included measuresproviding investment and tax incentives. I would like to review these issues briefly. The aims ofthese incentives were to encourage activities that would earn foreign exchange on the one hand,and to help foreign sources of capital finance investments in Turkey on the other. It can be saidthat by liberalising its capital account and introducing structural tax changes to improveinvestment returns, Turkey issued an invitation to foreign capital. Under these newarrangements, the tax incentives aimed at deepening the securities market and encouraginginvestment in it are of two kinds:- Double taxation of dividends was prevented by raising the corporate income taxrate and making it the only tax on dividend income. In addition, the income tax rate for smallshareholders was lowered. - For residents, capital gains on shares became exempt from taxation if thesecurity was listed on an exchange. Capital gains from the sale of through licensedintermediaries were made tax free. Premiums from the issuance of stock are also tax free forstocks listed on a stock exchange that does not distribute dividends to shareholders.There are also tax facilities for government securities.Privatization is an important part of our modernisation and liberalisation effort.Turkey embarked on a privatization program in the 1980s. Turkey’s telecommunications andenergy sectors are great targets for global partnership. Despite extensive exemptions from theprogram, by 1994 total proceeds derived from privatization since it began in 1986 had reachedUS$2.4 billion, which is not so bad. Moreover, 25 percent of this total came from sales on theIstanbul Stock Exchange. More than 60 percent of the sales were direct sales to domestic andinternational buyers. The main purpose of privatization is to get the government out of thebusiness of business and increase the efficiency of the privatised enterprises.Let me follow this account of the general framework of regulation governingfinancial investments denominated in foreign exchange with a description of the structure,strengths and weaknesses of our economy. The basic economic features of our country areattractive. A liberal trade and exchange rate regime, a modern and competitive private sector,abundant and vigorous consumer demand, and extremely attractive investment opportunities. This rosy picture is clouded by three economic problems that can be solved by afirm commitment to macroeconomic discipline. These three problems--high and persistentinflation, high public sector deficits, and large current account imbalances--are interrelated.Persistent high inflation has been Turkey’s main economic problem for the last two decades. Itsmain cause lies in the sizeable public deficit. Its other causes include entrenched inflationaryexpectations, exchange rate movements, monetary developments, interest rates, and priceincreases initiated by public enterprises. Under conditions of an open capital account, largepublic deficits can generate imbalances in the current account. Turkey’s current account tends tobe volatile. For this reason, what Turkey really needs is to accept fiscal discipline. A sustainableand consistent fiscal policy is evidently the key to solving other economic problems. Achievingfiscal discipline will require political will as well as persistence.BIS Review   42/1997
- 3 -Even though we have economic problems, we unquestionably also have theability to overcome them. Turkey needs to make use of this potential. I therefore now wish todraw your attention to the considerable strengths of our economy. For purposes of thisdiscussion, I will split our economy in two--the real economy and the financial economy. Let mebegin my explanation of the present structure of the economy with real variables.- The Turkish economy is a continuously growing, dynamic economy. Its long-term average annual growth rate is over 4 percent and its average annual productivity increase isaround 2 percent. In each of the last two years, GNP has increased by around 7 percent, wellabove most OECD countries. Along with this rapid growth, the composition of the grossdomestic product (GDP) has shifted during the last two decades, toward the industrial andservices sectors, while the GDP share of agriculture has greatly declined. The share of the publicsector in industrial output has also decreased. - Spending on investments has been increasing since the first quarter of 1995.Normally, periods of investment aimed at increasing production capacity last for about 20months, but the increase in investment activity spending remained focused on increasingproduction capacity throughout 1995 and 1996. The Economic Trend Analysis of the CentralBank of Turkey shows that no earlier period of expectation of rising investments has ever lastedlonger. - Official records show that Turkey’s unemployment rate has been holding fairlyconstant at around 7 or 8 percent, which is very low compared to the other OECD countries. InApril 1996, total employment rose by 2.6 percent and unemployment fell to 6.3 percent. Theurban and rural unemployment rates were estimated at 9.3 percent and 3.8 percent respectively.  In addition, Turkey was among the top ten countries in terms of improving itsscore on the United Nations’ human resource development index, which is based on a country’sliteracy rate, per capita income, and life expectancy. Of course, such a nation-wide measurementtakes no account of the wide differences between urban and rural conditions. Be that as it may,the strong growth of the working age population, the high degree of urbanisation, and increasednumbers of well-educated young workers are all favourable to strong growth in laborproductivity.- Turkey has a strong, dynamic and competitive private sector. The non-agricultural private sector recovered quickly from the financial crises in spite of unsettledpolitical conditions and extremely high interest rates. In addition, it is the private sector that hasbeen mainly responsible for capital formation. ·- There have been interesting developments connected with Turkey’s foreignexchange earnings. Even though the official trade account and current account figures reflectsizeable deficits, I would like to emphasise that the level of merchandise exports is significantlyunderstated due to its omission of rapidly growing but unrecorded “shuttle” trade withneighbouring countries. We are on the verge of being able to include these activities in ourbalance of payments figures. In addition, there has been serious underreporting of the value oftransactions connected with some of Turkey’s foreign direct investments, a problem that theCentral Bank is working to resolve.Now let me touch briefly on Turkey’s financial system. Turkey’s financial sectoris still dominated by the banking sector. In other words, most financial savings are channelledthrough the banking sector. The banking sector’s total assets amount to 66 percent of GNP. TheBIS Review   42/1997
- 4 -reformation of the financial sector had the effect of reinforcing the privileged position of thebanks. Turkey has a universal banking system, which is another way of saying that Turkishbanks are allowed to participate directly in all forms of financial activity except insurance. TheBanking Act of 1985 governs the establishment of banks, their capital structure, branch banking,foreign banking, credits, deposit insurance, and all other activities related to banking. Today ourbanking sector is highly competitive and efficient. It is integrated with the international financialmarkets. Its strength is based on an up-to-date technical infrastructure, a well-educated workforce and experienced, and a well-qualified management. The banking sector’s adaptability,shown by its rapid introduction into the system of new financial instruments, has increased theavailable range of financing sources. Financial reform has increased the efficiency andcompetitiveness of our banking sector.The Istanbul Stock Exchange is one of the best performing of all the emergingmarkets. Its total market capitalisation is increasing, both in nominal terms and as a percentageof GNP, which indicates that it is playing an increasing role in the transmission of domesticfinancial savings. The GNP share of market capitalisation has increased to 22 percent, while theGNP share of M2y, which is the total of financial savings held in the banking sector, is around40 percent. In addition, the return of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, though volatile, increasedsubstantially this year. Market volatility creates liquidity and great trading opportunities.When I talk about money markets I mean the Turkish lira money market and theforeign exchange cash and deposit market, open market operations, and government securitiesauction markets. These markets, which were introduced as a part of the financial sector reforms,have increased the effectiveness of the central bank’s control over the liquidity in the financialsystem, and increased the role of market mechanisms in money management. When marketmechanisms began to play a larger part in the allocation of  resources, the responsibilities andinstruments of the central bank also changed, bringing the issue of central bank autonomy ontothe agenda of the Turkish economy.Turkey now has a well established and efficient system of financial markets. Themain obstacle at present to the functioning of the financial markets is our large public sectorborrowing requirement, which crowds out other demands for financing. The inability ofdomestic resources to cover the financing needs of the public sector has kept real interest ratesvery high for over a decade. Bold privatization efforts, broadening the tax base, and reformingthe social security system are the best ways to correct this situation, and I may say that they areall under way. Macroeconomic stability and political stability are the keys to achievingsustainable growth in a low inflation environment.BIS Review   42/1997
 Ms. Rivlin discusses how economists might be helpful in the current and upcomingmacroeconomic policy process   Remarks by the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the USFederal Reserve System, Ms. Alice M. Rivlin, at the Annual Meeting of the Eastern EconomicAssociation in Washington, D.C. on 4/4/97. I am delighted to be here today with such a large group of my fellow economists.Economists  are a very diverse group, but they share a basic kit of analytical tools that shape the waythey  approach problems. Economists share a useful shorthand vocabulary -- sometimes disparaged  byothers as jargon -- that makes it easier to communicate with each other. They share a sense  of what kindsof things are known about how economies work and, far more important, an  appreciation for how muchis not known about the workings of any complex human system,  including the economy in which we areall living and working right now. Most importantly,  economists share a sense of excitement that othersoften find hard to fathom, about unraveling  the many puzzles that abound in economic analysis. At the moment, as a relatively new governor of the Federal Reserve, I am particularlyglad to  be in a group of economists, because I can be quite sure they don’t share the popular  stereotypeof a Fed governor. This stereotype has several elements:Any Fed governor or central banker is an inflation freak who thinks reducing inflationshould be the only objective of monetary policy and a zero inflation economy would be  heaven.Any central banker has a firm view of exactly what growth rate the economy ought not toexceed and how high the unemployment rate ought to be to avoid inflation -- that something called theNAIRU is engraved on a stone tablet somewhere high on a mountain top and all we have to do is find it.Moreover, this stereotypical central banker knows exactly what monetary policy ought tobe in order to keep the economy on the desired track. This stereotype leads otherwise quite intelligent members of the press to believe that ifcentral  bankers don’t reveal this secret blueprint, it’s because they are being deliberately obscure andinscrutable. The media’s sacred calling is to interpret what central bankers really meant but out  of sheerperversity did not choose to say. So it’s a pleasure to be in a room full of economists who know that:while the Fed has access to all the latest statistics and an excellent staff to analyze them,it has not found the stone tablet;those of us at the Fed are working our way through the same fascinating puzzles thatconfront all economists and make the profession such a lively place to be. I would like to discuss today the primary puzzles that confront those of us in themonetary  policymaking arena and then offer a few thoughts about how economists might focus theirenergies to be helpful in the current and upcoming macroeconomic policy process. I’m afraid I don’t fit the Fed Governor stereotype well at all. I’m not an inflation freak;I’m a  growth freak. My answer to the question, “How fast should the economy grow?” is “As fast as  itsustainably can.” We don’t benefit from rapid growth spurts that unleash inflation which  later has to bereigned in at a high price, just as we don’t benefit from growth that damages the  environment andcreates a need for costly repair. But we ought to try to be on the highest  growth track that is sustainableand stay on it with as few ups and downs as possible, because  the downs are so costly, especially interms of lost opportunity to build human capital. Only  trouble is we don’t know exactly what that trackis and we’re sure it’s not immutable.BIS Review   44/1997
- 2 - By the same token, we ought to aim to keep unemployment as low as is sustainable. Thebenefits of tight labor markets are enormous, especially in a society whose future depends on  continuousand persistent upgrading of the skills of the whole labor force. If we can keep  labor markets at least astight as they are now for a few years (which, judging from past  history, would take an extraordinarycombination of skillful policy and good luck), we can do  a lot for the future standard of living ofAmericans. The benefit would accrue not just to those who are employed and are acquiring job skillsand  experience that they would not have gotten if they were unemployed. The benefit of tight  labormarkets is also in the signals they send to individuals and businesses that people should  be employed asproductively as possible, and that investment in training pays off. These are  the economic conditions weneed in general, but especially if we are to make welfare reform a  success and establish new patterns ofschool and work for many young people who now see  little hope for the future. Welfare reform is goingto be difficult to accomplish. The best hope  for success is avoiding recession for a long time. The benefits of the recent rapid job growth in the U.S. are especially evident by contrastwith  Europe. French and German unemployment rates have been incredibly high for a long time.  Frenchand German officials speak of their unemployment as “structural” and discuss the need  to increase jobtraining, improve the functioning of labor markets, and reduce the incentives  not to work which are builtinto their generous benefit systems. These are all doubtless  constructive things to do, but are unlikely tobe very successful unless the economies are  growing and jobs are being created. It is a lot easier toreduce structural unemployment when  the demand for labor is brisk than when it is lagging. So this central banker believes that the goal of monetary policy, like the goal of fiscalpolicy,  ought to be the highest sustainable growth rate and the lowest sustainable unemployment.  Lowinflation should not be thought of as an end in itself, but as a means to an end.  Accelerating inflation hasproved a threat to the sustainability of growth, and the self-perpetuating nature of inflation makes it morecostly to correct than to avoid. The drafters of the Humphrey Hawkins Act gave the Fed multiple goals. They said:“The  Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and creditaggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as  topromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate  long-term interestrates.” That’s a bit ambiguous, but it’s about as good a set of instructions as  any. It would be a mistaketo reword the Act, as some have suggested, to give the Fed a single  objective -- reducing inflation -- onwhich to focus monetary policy. It would be especially  unfortunate to specify a zero inflation target.First, because we don’t measure inflation well enough to know when we have hit anexact target.Second, because the benefits of getting all the way to zero may not be great and the costscould be substantial, especially if there is significant reluctance to reduce nominal  wages. But it is the second part of the central banker stereotype that economists see as mostobviously  absurd; namely, that the Fed actually controls interest rates and that it knows for sure wherethe monetary dials ought to be set to achieve a specific growth or unemployment target. The reality is that the Fed controls -- and rather imperfectly at that -- one extremelyshort-term  interest rate, the fed funds rate. The fed funds rate certainly has some influence on banks’ability to extend credit, but its relation to the longer term rates that really matter to investors  and homebuyers is uncertain at best. The most that one can say about the Fed’s principal  monetary policy tool isthat we can safely guess the direction of the effect of moving it and  that we know there is a considerablelag between the move and the effect; but we cannot  specify with any degree of certainty how large theeffect is or how long it takes. That’s a pretty  blunt instrument.BIS Review   44/1997
- 3 - Any monetary policy move is a judgment call to be made with a great deal of humilitybecause the judgment involves making a guess about what is likely to be happening to  economic activitysix months to a year or more in advance and whether resources might be  underutilized by then orinflationary pressure might be building. The judgment call seems especially hard at the moment, although I suspect it almostalways  seems especially hard, because the economy is behaving in ways that are gratifyingly  puzzling.The combination of macro-economic statistics is actually more favorable -- more  growth, moreemployment, less budget deficit, less inflation -- than most people would have  guessed possible a year ortwo ago. On one level, these are pleasant surprises; on another  level, the behavior of the economy isrevealing big challenges for the economics profession.  These challenges are not likely to yield to moreassiduous statistical manipulation of the same  data that we already collect, but instead would requiresome new tools and new kinds of data. It would be a lot easier to make those judgment calls -- to move the blunt instrument soas to  increase the probability of keeping labor markets tight and the economy growing at the  highestsustainable rate -- if we knew a lot more about three interrelated questions.1.What’s really going on in labor markets?2.What’s really going on with prices?3.And especially, what’s really going on with productivity? The labor market puzzle is partly why low unemployment is not leading to moreobvious  bottlenecks, more serious skill shortages and more rapid increases in compensation than we  arein fact experiencing? It’s tempting to believe that the uniformity of unemployment rates  around thecountry indicates that the information age is paying off in better functioning labor  markets. Possibly, atthe equilibrating margin, people now move more easily to jobs, and jobs  more easily to people than theyonce did. Possibly the organizations that worked so hard  under the pressure of competition and recessionto become less rigid and more flexible have  in fact done so. But those are all guesses -- or wishfulthinking. We don’t know for sure. The price puzzle is why prices have been so well behaved in the face of labor costs thathave  been rising, albeit not especially fast. Has the economy, as so many business anecdotes allege,really become more fiercely competitive both nationally and internationally? Is the ability of  firms toabsorb labor cost increases without raising prices and without apparent reduction in  profit marginsconfirming the hypothesis that productivity is rising faster than we thought, or  faster than the admittedlyinadequate data have been telling us? Indeed, it is the productivity puzzle that may hold the key to the gratifyingly mysteriousbehavior of the economy. Economists have thought for some time that the increasing  importance ofservices in the economy is confounding the ability to understand what is  happening to both product andproductivity. We observed an increase in manufacturing  productivity, but not in service productivity.Indeed, measured productivity was generally  negative in service industries even where anecdotalevidence indicated that processes had  been streamlined, products had been substantially improved, aswell as greatly proliferated,  and the people in the industry believed they were doing a much moreeffective job serving  their customers. Economists freely admitted they didn’t quite know how to identifyand  measure the quality of the products that were being produced in service industries, sometimes  evenin manufacturing. Economists also wondered aloud why all the investment in computers  and informationtechnology that was so obviously changing the world was not having an  impact on productivity. Weopined that maybe people weren’t using computers very well or  that many things people were usingcomputers for -- like editing everything to death or  spelling things correctly -- were not actuallycontributing to productivity at least as we were  measuring it. Now, we should turn all this speculationBIS Review   44/1997
- 4 -into a full court press to figure out what  kind of data we need and what kind of analytical methods weneed to invent in order to  understand better what is going on in this economy. The need to improve the accuracy of the CPI has captured the attention of the press andthe  politicians because the indexing of benefits and tax brackets plays such a large part in the  federalbudget. But the problems of identifying what consumers are buying and how the  quality of the itemspurchased has changed is very closely related to the problem of  identifying what is being produced andwhat inputs are going into the production. The Clinton  Administration, to its credit, has recognized theneed for improving both the concepts and  measurement of prices and products and has asked for amodest increase in resources for the  statistical agencies in the President’s budget, even in the context ofgeneral budget cuts.  Strong support from the users of the data is surely in order -- not just from academiceconomists, but from the whole community of market analysts, Fed watchers and business  and financialorganizations who need to understand how the economy is working in order to  operate better in it. Indeed, I have been struck since I have been at the Fed by the magnitude of the resourcesour  economy puts into analyzing, reporting and commenting upon the standard set of statisticsgenerated by federal statistical agencies every week -- efforts by the press, the business  community andthe people in between, such as those who write the newsletters and poop  sheets that circulate over faxesand computers. Wouldn’t it be in everyone’s interest to take a  portion of those resources and devotethem to improving the flow of statistics that are being  analyzed to death? Another thought that has struck me at the Fed is the enormous usefulness of reporting onexamples of real world happenings -- anecdotes if you will -- and the absence of useful data  that bridgethe gap between the anecdote or real world case and an aggregate statistical series. One of the unique features of the Federal Reserve is its strong regional structure. Thetwelve  Reserve Banks are very closely tied to the economies of their regions. The Reserve Banks notonly supervise and interact with the local commercial banks, but also keep in close touch with  thebusiness, farming, labor, and community leadership in their area. They have broadly representativeboards and a whole network of advisory committees (as does the Board of  Governors itself). This network of contacts and information makes the Reserve Bank presidents veryvaluable  participants in the FOMC discussion. Indeed, the most interesting part of an FOMC meeting isusually the regional round-up from the Bank presidents. This regional network and set of real  worldinteractions has given me more sense of being in touch with the whole economy than I  have had inprevious economic policy jobs where I was largely dependent on aggregate  statistics. I am not proposing government by anecdote and I am aware of the potential dangers ofnon-random samples. Nevertheless, I have the sense that our understanding of the economy  would begreatly advanced if economists could set themselves seriously to the task of systematizing feedback aboutreal world dilemmas being faced and decisions being made in  the economy in ways that give a morenuanced and lively picture of what is going on out  there than can be gleaned from standard statisticalseries. Anyway, it’s an exciting time to be an economist and I’m glad to see so many fellowprofessionals puzzling together over how the economy works and ought to work.BIS Review   44/1997
M. Roth dresse un tableau de la politique monétaire et de la conjonctureéconomique en Suisse   Allocution de M. Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice-président de la Directiongénérale de la Banque nationale suisse, au Centre International d’Etudes Monétaires etBancaires, (CIMB), à Genève, le 22/4/97.Mesdames et Messieurs,C’est avec des sentiments bien particuliers que je m’adresse à vous aujourd’hui.Certes, le thème de mon exposé - Politique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous ? - estd’une grande actualité alors que notre pays connaît sa septième année de stagnation économique.Mais au-delà de cette constatation - et avant d’entrer dans le vif du sujet -, j’aimerais rendrehommage à la maison qui nous accueille ce soir - l’Institut Universitaire de Hautes EtudesInternationales-, où j’ai eu le privilège de pouvoir faire mes études de doctorat au début desannées septante. Par son enseignement dans les domaines de l’histoire, de la politique et del’économie, l’Institut HEI a formé des générations de diplomates, de hauts fonctionnaires, dechefs d’entreprises, en Suisse et à l’étranger. Sans ne rien ôter aux mérites de HEI dans lesautres domaines, je voudrais souligner le rôle éminent que l’Institut a joué et joue encore dans ledomaine monétaire. Les plus grands noms de la théorie monétaire sont venus ici, faisant de HEIun centre privilégié d’enseignement sur le plan suisse. Les travaux de recherche de l’Institut ontun renom qui dépasse largement nos frontières. Tout ceci est dû aux efforts du corps professoralet de la direction de HEI, soutenus par les Autorités fédérales et genevoises. Je forme le voeuque ce centre d’excellence dans le domaine de la monnaie et des relations internationalescontinue à fournir à notre pays les services qu’il nous a rendus jusqu’ici.Je ferme cette parenthèse pour en venir à cette question qui nous préoccupe tous:qu’en est-il de la conjoncture? Sommes-nous au terme de la phase de stagnation qui frappe sidurement la Suisse depuis 1990? Pourquoi cette traversée du désert si douloureuse sur le plansocial? Quels sont nos moyens pour gérer la situation?J’aborderai le problème en trois phases: en premier lieu, je ferai le point sur laconjoncture internationale et mettrai en évidence la situation particulière dans laquelle se trouvel’Europe continentale dont notre pays dépend si étroitement. Ensuite, je ferai une rétrospectivedes événements conjoncturels des années nonante et m’attarderai sur les problèmes spécifiquesrencontrés par notre pays. Enfin, je tirerai de ce survol quelques enseignements pour la conduitede la politique économique dans ce pays.1.Un survol conjoncturelCommençons par faire le point de la situation conjoncturelle. Comment ne pasêtre frappé par la césure qui existe, aujourd’hui, dans les pays de l’OCDE entre le mondeanglo-saxon, d’une part, et l’Europe continentale, de l’autre.Les Etats-Unis font preuve d’une bonne santé conjoncturelle, qui semble résister àl’usure du temps. Après avoir stagné, puis reculé à la fin des années quatre-vingt, l’économieaméricaine a retrouvé le chemin de la croissance. L’emploi global n’a pas cessé d’augmenter etle taux de chômage de baisser. La croissance de l’économie se poursuit sans discontinuer depuis1992 et aucun ralentissement notable n’est attendu pour l’instant. Le risque d’une pressionexcessive sur les ressources ne peut même plus être écarté, aussi la Réserve fédérale a-t-ellerécemment décidé de relever d’un quart de point le taux des Fonds fédéraux. Les perspectives enmatière d’inflation restent toutefois bonnes, avec une progression modeste des coûts salariaux.BIS Review   45/1997
- 2 -Un scénario analogue a pu être observé au Royaume-Uni. Là aussi une stagnationconjoncturelle a pu être observée à la fin des années quatre-vingt. La reprise s’est manifestée unpeu plus tard qu’Outre-Atlantique, au début de 1993, soit avec douze mois de retard par rapportau cycle américain. Au Royaume-Uni, comme aux Etats-Unis, la croissance s’est maintenuedepuis lors, entraînant une réduction du chômage sans créer de menaces sérieuses pour lastabilité des prix.Force est de constater que l’atmosphère est bien différente sur le continenteuropéen. D’une part, en raison de la réunification allemande, le creux conjoncturel s’y estmanifesté plus tard que dans les économies anglo-saxonnes, la croissance tombant à son niveaule plus bas en 1993 seulement, et, d’autre part, la remontée d’activité ne s’est jamaisvéritablement matérialisée. Après une légère embellie à la fin de 1994 et au début de 1995, leciel conjoncturel européen s’est à nouveau assombri pour déboucher sur une année 1996franchement morose contrairement aux attentes. Parallèlement, le chômage a augmenté demanière spectaculaire, atteignant des taux records pour les quinze dernières années.Pour clore ce tour d’horizon, quelques mots sur l’Asie, l’autre pôle dedéveloppement de l’économie mondiale. Je ne m’y arrêterai que brièvement car les faits sontlargement connus. En Asie, on constate également une opposition entre deux types de situationéconomique bien différents. Les nouveaux pays industrialisés, qui, dans le sillage des Etats-Unis,ont réalisé d’importants progrès économiques, et ont vu leur croissance, ces dernières années, sesituer au-dessus de la moyenne des dix années précédentes. De son côté, le Japon, le championde la croissance par le passé, a de la peine à retrouver un sentier d’expansion comparable à celuiqui était le sien dans les années quatre-vingt. A ses problèmes de compétitivité s’ajoute unesituation financière interne chancelante.Qu’en est-il de la Suisse?2.La situation en SuisseUn survol des dix dernières années nous indique que le destin conjoncturel de laSuisse a été étroitement lié à celui de l’Europe continentale. Comme chez nos voisins immédiats,le cycle conjoncturel s’est retourné en 1993 seulement et, après une amélioration passagère en1994, de nouveaux signes de faiblesse de la demande sont intervenus en 1995 et 1996. Laséquence de nos épisodes conjoncturels a donc parfaitement coïncidé avec ce qui se passait enFrance et en Allemagne. Mais, contrairement à ces deux pays qui ont pu malgré tout enregistrerdes taux de croissance de l’ordre de 1 à 2%, les nôtres sont restés proche de zéro. Dans uneEurope continentale croissant à un rythme modeste, la Suisse a connu des années de stagnation.Que s’est-il passé dans notre pays pour qu’il connaisse des élans conjoncturelsinsignifiants?Ma réponse est relativement simple: la Suisse a connu avec une acuité touteparticulière un certain nombre de difficultés rencontrées également par nos voisins. Elle s’esttrouvée dans leur mouvance mais a occupé l’inconfortable situation d’être placéecontinuellement une peu plus que les autres à l’écart des pressions de la demande.Quels sont ces facteurs négatifs?BIS Review   45/1997
- 3 -2.1.Le renforcement du francLe premier facteur qui a contribué à marginaliser la Suisse sur le planconjoncturel a été l’évolution du franc. Alors que les monnaies européennes étaient déjà fortespar rapport au dollar, le franc se renforçait à leur égard.L’histoire devra juger si, à la suite de la réunification allemande et dans laperspective de l’Union monétaire, les pays de l’Union européenne n’ont pas été amenés àappliquer une politique monétaire trop restrictive en regard de leur situation économique. Lesfaits sont là: du début à la fin de 1994, le mark s’apprécie de 10% face au dollar, entraînant lefranc français et les autres monnaies du SME dans son sillage. Les raisons de cette correctiondes changes ne se situent pas que du côté européen. Il faut se souvenir que, durant les annéesprécédentes, les Etats-Unis avaient poursuivi une politique monétaire résolument expansive. Desstratégies monétaires opposées de part et d’autre de l’Atlantique créèrent un potentield’ajustement de change. La perte de compétitivité qui s’en est suivi a fait jouer au commerceextérieur européen, en 1995, un rôle de frein alors qu’il aurait dû soutenir la croissance.Les choses ne se sont pas manifestées différemment dans notre pays, mais avecune intensité particulière. Le franc s’est non seulement renforcé face au dollar, mais aussi faceaux monnaies européennes. Le coup de frein conjoncturel a donc été encore plus fort chez nousque chez nos voisins. De plus, l’atmosphère conjoncturelle s’effritant en Europe, la Suisse voyaitsa demande extérieure perdre rapidement du dynamisme.Les raisons de cette réaction excessive du franc sont vraisemblablement doubles.D’une part, notre monnaie a tendance à “surréagir” en cas de faiblesse du dollar; d’autre part, ladiscussion sur l’intégration monétaire en Europe a peut-être terni l’image du mark allemand etprovoqué le report sur le franc suisse de capitaux spéculatifs.2.2.L ’héritage de la surchauffe des années quatre-vingtLe second facteur qui a mis en difficulté l’économie suisse dans les annéesnonante a été la gestion de l’héritage des années quatre-vingt. Nous le savons maintenant, lerythme de croissance de l’économie suisse durant la seconde moitié de années quatre-vingt allaitau-delà de ce qui était soutenable en durée. Avant même le krach boursier et les injections deliquidité qui lui furent liées, les crédits augmentaient à un rythme de 8 à 9%. Des signes desurchauffe étaient apparus dans l’immobilier d’abord, dans l’ensemble de l’économie ensuite. Lerecours aux ressources productives était excessif.La fin de la période inflationniste des années quatre-vingt entraîna d’importantsajustements structurels, notamment dans l’immobilier. Des situations analogues ont pu êtreobservées en Allemagne et en France, mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous une grandeampleur en raison du rôle du marché hypothécaire. L’assainissement du secteur immobilier, audébut des années nonante, a pesé ainsi de manière toute particulière sur la demande globale enSuisse, non seulement sur la demande de construction, mais également sur la demande desménages, ceux-ci étant souvent confrontés à la nécessité de consacrer une part plus importanteque souhaitée de leur revenu disponible au service de leur dette hypothécaire ou de leur loyer.Enfin, après des années de plein-emploi, voire de “suremploi”, la montée duchômage a provoqué beaucoup d’inquiétude et d’insécurité dans le public. Cette situationnouvelle a forcément pesé négativement sur le climat de la consommation.BIS Review   45/1997
- 4 -2.3.La libéralisation du marché intérieurLe troisième facteur qui a influencé la conjoncture helvétique par rapport à cellede ses voisins est la difficile libéralisation de notre marché intérieur.I1 ne fait pas de doute que les années de haute conjoncture avaient conduit à unecartellisation excessive du marché intérieur en Suisse. Les exemples ici sont multiples. Avecl’isolement de notre pays face aux mouvements européens d’intégration, nous avons dû nousatteler nous-mêmes à la libéralisation de notre marché intérieur. Le processus dedéréglementation est engagé. Sur la courte période, ce vent nouveau de concurrence crée desincertitudes, laisse des traces en termes de croissance et d’emploi. Ici aussi, nous nous attaquonsà des problèmes que nos voisins connaissent également. Il est probable que la faible dimensionde notre marché intérieur, ses cloisonnements culturels et politiques font de cette libéralisationun exercice particulièrement difficile.3.La politique monétaire 1990 -1997Comment la Banque nationale a-t-elle intégré cette situation économique dans sastratégie monétaire au cours des dernières années?Comme je l’indiquais tout à l’heure, le début des années nonante a correspondu àla fin d’une phase inflationniste. On l’a oublié aujourd’hui, mais en 1991 notre taux d’inflationavait franchi la barre des 6%. Une certaine accélération de la hausse des prix s’était égalementmanifestée dans les pays qui nous entourent, mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous uneampleur inaccoutumée. Même l’Allemagne, qui vivait alors sa réunification, n’affichait pas destaux d’inflation aussi élevés. La politique monétaire de l’époque visait donc la restauration de lastabilité des prix, en Suisse comme chez nos voisins.Le caractère restrictif de notre politique monétaire du début des années nonantepeut être illustré par le fait - et cela était inhabituel - que les taux d’intérêt à court terme dansnotre pays se situaient au niveau des taux allemands.La fin de la phase restrictive de la politique de la BNS peut être située au milieude l’année 1992. L’inflation était encore de l’ordre de 4%, mais nos projections nous indiquaientqu’un ralentissement graduel de la hausse des prix allait intervenir. Par ailleurs, les tauxeuropéens, anormalement tirés vers le haut par les conséquences de la réunification allemande,ne nous paraissaient plus correspondre aux perspectives de l’économie suisse.En 1992, la Banque nationale a été la première banque centrale de l’Europecontinentale à baisser ses taux d’intérêt. Le différentiel de taux d’intérêt avec l’Allemagne s’estrapidement creusé pour atteindre deux points de pourcentage douze mois plus tard. Cettecorrection n’a toutefois pas pu corriger les tendances récessives qui existaient déjà chez nous etchez nos voisins européens. Comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure, l’économie suisse entraiten récession au début de 1993 et cette situation dura durant la majeure partie de l’année.La BNS aurait-elle pu assouplir sa politique plus tôt? Cette question a souvent étéévoquée dans le public. Les jugements a posteriori sont toujours dangereux car ils se basentforcément sur une connaissance des choses qui n’était pas celle des décideurs de l’époque. Jeconstate simplement que le franc était orienté à la baisse durant les premiers mois de 1992, etque l’inflation se situait encore entre 4 et 5%, aussi je comprends que la Banque nationale aitBIS Review   45/1997
- 5 -considéré que le moment n’était pas propice à donner des signes de relâchement monétaire. Lerisque aurait été d’affaiblir le franc et de relancer une pression inflationniste qui était encore viveà ce moment-là.Une fois la politique monétaire assouplie en Suisse à la moitié de l’année 1992,un relâchement prudent est intervenu en France et en Allemagne, je dis prudent car la décrue destaux dans ces pays s’est toujours située en retrait de ce qui se passait chez nous. Parallèlement, lacroissance monétaire reprenait dans notre pays, si bien que des conditions favorables à unereprise apparaissaient progressivement. Pour 1994, une croissance de l’ordre de 1,5% étaitattendue par l’institut de prévision de l’EPFZ, avec une perspective d’accélération à 2% pour1995.Le réveil conjoncturel eut bien lieu, non seulement chez nous, mais égalementchez nos partenaires européens, mais il ne dura pas. De nouvelles difficultés surgirent. En février1994, la Réserve fédérale américaine décida, après avoir maintenu longtemps une orientationexpansive à sa politique, de tirer à nouveau sur les rênes monétaires. En l’espace de douze mois,les taux à court terme sur l’eurodollar passaient ainsi de 3 à 6%, mettant un terme à la baisse destaux en Europe. Les taux longs montèrent sur un large front et le dollar fléchit. Le recul dudollar se poursuivit pendant deux ans, entraînant une appréciation des monnaies européennes,particulièrement du franc suisse qui a toujours tendance à surréagir dans de pareillescirconstances.L’année 1994 joua donc un rôle crucial dans le déroulement des événementsconjoncturels de ces dernières années car elle vit une très forte détérioration des conditionsmonétaires en Europe continentale. La reprise se fragilisa partout sans que les spécialistes s’enrendent compte; leurs prévisions conjoncturelles demeurant franchement optimistes. A la fin de1994, une accélération de la croissance était encore envisagée pour l’année suivante et uneconsolidation de ce mouvement en 1996. On le sait, les événements se déroulèrentdifféremment: le dollar continua de fléchir; la Suisse, comme ses voisins, sombra une nouvellefois en récession. La Banque nationale provoqua bien de nouvelles réductions des taux d’intérêtet un élargissement de l’écart entre les taux suisses et allemands, mais la croissance économiquedans notre pays se ralentit, puis stagna purement et simplement.Au milieu de l’année dernière, il nous est apparu évident qu’un retournement desituation conjoncturel était improbable et que les risques déflationnistes augmentaient. C’estpour cette raison que nous avons donné un accent nouveau à notre politique monétaire,provoquant une baisse des taux d’intérêt sur le marché monétaire. Parallèlement, le dollar, quiavait commencé à se redresser en début d’année, faisait un bond en avant sur le marché deschanges et le franc fléchissait par rapport aux monnaies européennes. Dans leur ensemble, labaisse des taux d’intérêt en Suisse et la baisse du franc ont corrigé les conditions monétairespour les rendre plus favorables à la reprise conjoncturelle. Mais une nouvelle fois nous nesommes pas seuls. Une amélioration semblable du cadre monétaire est aussi intervenue chez nosvoisins allemands et français. Au niveau du continent européen, les conditions monétaires ontrarement été aussi bonnes pour assurer une reprise économique.BIS Review   45/1997
- 6 -4.Le bout du tunnel?Si tel est le cas, peut-on maintenant être optimiste? Sommes-nous au bout dutunnel puisque chez nos partenaires comme chez nous les ingrédients sont là pour permettre unredressement conjoncturel?Je ne doute pas que, la machine économique européenne repartie, nous voyionsles choses rapidement bouger chez nous. Nos entreprises ont fait ces dernières années des effortsconsidérables d’ajustement afin de devenir plus compétitives, d’assurer la qualité de leur produitet de mieux répondre aux besoins de leurs clients. Les mesures de restructuration qui ont étéprises - avec leur impact douloureux sur le chômage - révèlent leur prise de conscience et leurvolonté d’aller de l’avant. Par ailleurs, il existe suffisamment de ressources disponibles pourqu’une réaction rapide de la production soit possible, et ceci sans pressions inflationnistes .Je m’associe toutefois à ceux qui ne pensent pas que la reprise se manifestera en1997 avec vigueur. En effet, tout porte à croire que si l’environnement européen sera porteur,ses impulsions demeureront modestes.Pourquoi?(a)  En premier lieu, les problèmes de l’Europe continentale - comme lieu deproduction - ne sont pas encore réglés. Les termes libéralisation, déréglementation,flexibilisation sont souvent évoqués, mais les ajustements sont loin d’avoir été pleinementopérés. Un marché du travail plus efficace, des conditions plus stimulantes pour ledéveloppement technologique et la création d’emplois sont les axes de développement surlesquels tous les Européens doivent s’engager plus fermement. I1 est frappant de constater quedepuis le début des années nonante, l’Europe occidentale a détruit environ 4% de ses places detravail alors que les Etats-Unis en ont gagné 8%. Les conditions monétaires seules n’expliquentpas le déclin de la compétitivité européenne. En arrière-plan se trouvent des facteurs plus lourdsde formation, de recherche, d’incitation à la création de valeur plutôt qu’à la gestion de l’acquis.Ces problèmes sont difficiles à aborder car ils sont de nature politique, économique et sociale.Le débat sur ces sujets est largement engagé chez nous, il l’est aussi chez nos voisins. Mais nosdémocraties européennes ne progressent qu’avec peine dans ces terrains difficiles.(b)  En second lieu, la probabilité est grande que nous observions, ces prochainsmois, un redressement des taux d’intérêt aux Etats-Unis. L’exemple de 1994 revient alors àl’esprit. Si l’Europe est entraînée dans un mouvement de hausse des taux alors que saconjoncture est encore fragile, le redressement pourrait être compromis ou, du moins, sedéployer à un rythme ralenti. Au coeur du problème se situera bien entendu la position du dollar.Si celui-ci reste orienté à la hausse, les conditions de la reprise resteront favorables. Si un nouvelaccident devait intervenir, une hypothèque supplémentaire - bien lourde celle-là - pèserait sur lecycle européen, donc sur notre pays.(c)  Enfin, il faut craindre que les incertitudes qui entourent le projet d’unificationmonétaire pèsent encore sur les décisions des entrepreneurs, voire créent un biais restrictif dansle cours de la politique monétaire européenne, avant tout allemande et française. Peut-onimaginer - avec des marchés continuellement à l’affût de ce qui pourrait être un signeBIS Review   45/1997
- 7 -avant-coureur de la qualité future de l’euro - que les autorités monétaires européennes prennentle moindre risque en matière d’expansion monétaire? Je ne le pense pas.Il faut toutefois souligner un point positif: l’incertitude européenne sembleprofiter avant tout au dollar américain. Il se peut donc que la situation de dollar fort que nousconnaissons maintenant se maintienne au cours des prochains mois, ce qui me fait égalementpenser que le franc suisse ne sera pas forcément au coeur de la tourmente si le processusd’intégration monétaire européenne devait connaître des difficultés.5.Les enseignementsQuels enseignements devons-nous tirer de ce survol de la politique monétaire desdernières années?5.1.La Suisse: un pays d’Europe continentaleLe premier enseignement est une évidence, la situation conjoncturelle de la Suissedépend étroitement de ce qui se passe à l’étranger, notamment dans les pays qui nous entourent.C’est là que se trouvent nos premiers marchés d’exportation. Depuis le début des annéesnonante, tous nos retournements conjoncturels ont coïncidé avec ceux de nos grands voisins.C’est une illusion de penser que nous disposons des moyens de nous dégager de cetenvironnement pour vivre à notre propre rythme économique. Je crois que ceux qui y songentsurestiment notre marge de manoeuvre et aussi notre capacité de mettre correctement en coursnos instruments de politique macro-économique.La réalité me semble tout autre: La Suisse est une économie dont la structure, lesressources, les orientations sont proches des autres économies du continent. Nous avons bienentendu nos spécificités, mais plus de points nous lient que nous séparent de nos voisins.Je tire tout naturellement une conclusion intermédiaire de cette constatation: notreambition dans le domaine macro-économique ne doit pas être de vouloir donner à la Suisse unautre destin conjoncturel que celui de l’Europe, mais d’essayer de la placer au mieux dans lesillage du grand navire qu’est l’économie d’Europe continentale.5.2.La nécessaire autonomie monétaireLe deuxième enseignement se réfère à la politique monétaire: Pour tenter de tirerle meilleur parti de notre situation dans la mouvance de l’économie de nos voisins, nous devonschercher à jouer le plus souvent possible la carte de notre autonomie monétaire. Cetteconclusion, un peu surprenante étant donné notre intégration économique, vient du fait que, auxyeux des marchés, le franc suisse n’est pas perçu comme une monnaie européenne typique. Lesréactions du franc aux variations du dollar sont plus exacerbées que celles du DM ou du francfrançais. I1 en résulte une volatilité qui peut entraver l’activité économique, peser sur laconjoncture.A première vue, on pourrait penser que si tel est le cas, ce n’est pas l’autonomiemonétaire, mais bien plus l’alignement qui serait la réponse stratégique appropriée. Je ne lepense pas. Tant que la Suisse ne fera pas partie des institutions européennes, le franc suisseBIS Review   45/1997
- 8 -continuera d’être considéré comme un élément particulier sur le marché. Dans ce cas,l’alignement de notre politique monétaire sur celle de l’Europe - aujourd’hui celle de laBundesbank, demain celle de la Banque centrale européenne - nous priverait de nos possibilitésde réactions en cas de perturbations des marchés. L’autonomie monétaire me paraît donc être labonne stratégie tant que l’intégration économique et politique de la Suisse en Europe n’est pasdéfinitive.5.3.Apprécier les conditions monétaires élargiesLe troisième enseignement se rapporte à la stratégie monétaire. Dans un paysplacé aussi fortement sous l’influence des humeurs des marchés des changes que le nôtre, lapolitique monétaire ne peut être rigide mais doit essayer de tenir compte. au mieux, desdifférents types de chocs auxquels il est soumis. Un certain dogmatisme est évidemmentnécessaire. Pour les banquiers centraux, le lien entre l’évolution tendancielle de la liquidité et leniveau général des prix est une relation fondamentale qu’ils ne peuvent pas perdre de vue sur ladurée. Mais dans la conduite des opérations de court terme, ce que l’on appelle les “conditionsmonétaires”, c’est-à-dire un juste équilibre entre les conditions de taux d’intérêt et de cours dechange, se révèlent être un guide opérationnel utile. Dans notre cas, c’est bien dans le butd’améliorer ces “conditions monétaires” que nous avons relâché notre politique au milieu del’année dernière. Je ne vous cacherai pas que ce relâchement est allé au-delà de ce que nousattendions car nous avons bénéficié également d’une phase de redressement du dollar. Si latendance du dollar avait été différente, notre action n’aurait certainement pas produit des effetscomparables.5.4.Disposer de structures efficacesLe dernier enseignement que je tire des événements conjoncturels de ces dernièresannées est que, dans l’incertitude financière et monétaire qui caractérise l’Europe d’aujourd’huiet qui continuera de la caractériser dans les années à venir, nous devons absolument jouer à bonescient les cartes “structurelles” que nous avons dans notre jeu. L’environnement internationalest trop contraignant pour que nous puissions nous permettre de ne pas créer sur le plan interneun cadre conduisant à une gestion efficace de nos ressources. Je sors ici évidemment de lapolitique monétaire pour rappeler l’importance essentielle de nos efforts en matière deformation, de recherche, d’intégration de l’innovation dans les processus de production, maisaussi de flexibilisation des conditions-cadre au niveau du marché du travail et de la créationd’entreprises.6.ConclusionPolitique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous?Au cours des derniers mois, d’importants points positifs sont apparus, qui fontespérer un réchauffement prochain de l’activité économique. La baisse des taux d’intérêt, lacorrection du franc et des monnaies d’Europe continentale face au dollar ont créé desconditions-cadre propices au développement de l’activité économique. Par ailleurs, le fait que lapolitique monétaire soit expansive depuis près de deux ans, que des efforts considérables aientété consentis en matière de restructuration d’entreprise, nous incite à un certain optimisme.BIS Review   45/1997
- 9 -Mais, j’ai essayé de vous le montrer, notre destin économique dépend étroitementde celui de nos voisins européens. Ces pays, comme le nôtre, sortent d’une période de croissanceinsuffisante, marquée par une augmentation du chômage et par une morosité ambiante. Chez euxaussi, l’atmosphère est plus à la délocalisation qu’à l’investissement. Nous connaissons desproblèmes conjoncturels et structurels analogues aux leurs.Ce qui nous sépare de nos voisins, c’est notre relative ouverture vers le monde, ladensité de notre production dans des secteurs de pointe, mais aussi notre absence du processuseuropéen d’intégration économique et monétaire. Dans de nombreux cas, nous devons relever,de nos propres forces, les défis qu’ils affrontent ensemble. C’est peut-être une chance, mais lesobjectifs à atteindre sont très ambitieux; ils réclament toutes nos énergies.Sans aucun doute - nous le sentons déjà maintenant -, la conjoncture seréchauffera et s’améliorera ces prochains mois. Il faut s’en réjouir, mais ne pas crier victoire. Nenous laissons pas bercer d’illusion. La Suisse ne retrouvera un sentier de croissance durable etpourra résorber son chômage que si elle est capable de préserver ses avantages et mêmeaugmenter ses attraits. Cela lui demandera non seulement de bonnes conditions monétaires - surla durée, la stabilité des prix -, mais également des ajustements en profondeur de ses structureset, au-delà, peut-être une nouvelle manière de gérer ses affaires.*       *       *NB   This BIS Review is available on the BIS World Wide Web site(http://www.bis.org)._____________________________BIS Review   45/1997
Mr. Padoa-Schioppa reviews his experience in central banking over the lastthirty years   Text of the remarks by Dott. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a Deputy Director General ofthe Bank of Italy, at the Governors' Dinner held in Basle on 7/4/97.1.To have been invited to attend and address the Governor’s dinner is a verygreat honour for me as I step down from the chair of the Basle Committee and leave the communityof central bankers.When Governor de Larosière proposed my name to succeed Gerry Corrigan, headmitted, so I have been told, that my curriculum vitae was not that of a full-time bank supervisor.Presenting this handicap as an advantage, he suggested that my previous involvement in a variety ofcentral banking activities could be useful because of the growing interaction between monetarypolicy, payment systems and banking stability. You were generous enough to accept that view. Thatwas an act of confidence. As words like confidence, trust and credibility are the very essence of thevocabulary of banking, I am deeply grateful for the confidence you granted me four years ago.2.In view of my mixed background, I shall focus on central banking, rather thanjust banking supervision, and try to sum up what I have learned and what I have witnessed over thelast thirty odd years: first about the tasks of central banking and then about the context in which suchtasks are performed.3.A person of my generation is inevitably struck by the difference betweenwhat he was taught at university in the sixties and the reality he faced in the two following decades.In the lecture room central banking had just one pole, monetary policy. In the real world I found itwas triadic, as monetary policy was combined with involvement in the payment system and bankingsupervision.At the Bank of Italy, for instance, more than half the staff of just over 9,000 isdevoted to the operation of the payment system (the note issue, clearing systems, Treasuryinpayments and outpayments, interbank funds transfers, etc.); around 15 per cent is engaged inbanking supervision; less than 5 per cent is concerned with monetary policy. Although not all centralbanks have primary responsibility for banking supervision, the three tasks are inextricably linkedbecause there is a close relationship between them and the three practically indivisible functions ofmoney as numeraire, means of payment and store of value.Dealing with the complexities of triadic central banking has been for me both afascinating professional experience and an intellectual adventure bringing new insights nearly everyday.4.Not only was monetary policy the sole task highlighted when I was a student,but the word “monetary” was overshadowed by the word “policy”. Monetary policy had alwaysexisted, of course, but the rise of fiat money greatly increased the room for manoeuvre. The centralbanker came to be seen in the fifties and sixties as a demiurg able to choose between inflation andunemployment, and to do so almost on a quarter-by-quarter basis.So delicate and powerful was the policy choice entrusted to the central banker that hecould not be left to make it alone. Few central banks were truly independent. The intellectualparadigm that followed the demise of the Gold Standard, with its emphasis on discretionary goalBIS Review   41/1997
- 2 -setting, implicitly suggested that elected politicians should have the last word. Future historians willperhaps see this view of the role of central banks as having characterized only two or three of thetwenty or so decades of their modern history, which began when convertible paper superseded coinsas the main means of payment.5.After a long period of neglect, payment systems have gradually returned tothe centre of the stage. When advances in data processing and telecommunications brought a newrevolution, we suddenly realized how much our monetary institutions, practices and even theoryowed to the previous revolution. Until the eighties the term “payment system” was almost completelyabsent from central bank reports. Today, there are many who argue that monetary policy functionswould not have developed in the way they did without the first revolution in payment technology.The raison d’être for central bank involvement in payment systems is to avoid, or atany rate minimize, systemic risk, while fostering their efficiency through an appropriate blend ofcooperation and competition in the industry. Is there also a policy, or even a political, dimension?Perhaps not. The issue of central bank independence would be a much less burning one if onlypayment system tasks were considered. And systemic risk itself could become much less important inthe years to come with the shift from net to gross settlement that new technologies are makingpossible. It is possible that payment system issues will move to the back of the stage again onceappropriate arrangements are in place to cope with the new technological environment.6.Chronologically, if not logically, the task of supervising banks came after thatof running the payment system and before the advent of fiat money and discretionary monetarypolicy. From a monetary angle, it was the consequence of the spread of deposit banking, whichultimately resulted in bank money accounting for the bulk of the money stock. Runs on deposits canbe seen as collapses of confidence about the stability of the rate of exchange between a unit of centralbank money and a unit of commercial bank money. Commercial banks had to have soundfundamentals if one-to-one convertibility was to be preserved  hence, the need for bank supervision.In the short run interventions, i.e. lending of last resort, could be - and was - used to support the rate.But, as in the more familiar case of foreign exchange interventions, they were no substitute for soundpolicies; credit provided too easily and too generously could even generate the risk it was meant toavoid; today we call it moral hazard.The ambivalent relationship between supervising banks and lending to them(surveillance and conditional lending, in IMF language) explains why there is no clear-cut answer tothe question whether the central bank or a separate agency should be responsible for supervision.Seven of the twelve Basle Committee countries have a separate agency, as against about 10 per centof countries in the world as a whole. More importantly, even where this solution has been adopted,the centrality of the banking system, and of its money creation prerogatives, in the monetary policytransmission mechanism means that no central bank disregards the “state of health” of its banks orcompletely rules out lending of last resort in extreme circumstances.7.The other, perhaps more important, change concerns the context of centralbanking. This can be seen in terms of both time and space. I began my career in a world of annualaccounts and quarterly or monthly statistics, in which paper was the medium and mail the carrier. Forthe bulk of financial transactions the two parties, the intermediary, the currency of denomination, therelevant laws and courts, and the central bank all belonged to the same jurisdiction. And thatjurisdiction was not only economic, as it included the political jurisdiction from which publicBIS Review   41/1997
- 3 -institutions derive their legitimacy through the democratic process. This simple description neverfully coincided with the state of the world, of course, but twenty-five years ago it was still a workableapproximation. Today, that is no longer true. The advance of data processing and telecommunicationstechnology has been the most powerful single driving force of this change. But the low cost oftransportation, the evolution of economic ideas, the desire for closer and more peaceful relationshipsamong nations have also been crucial.8.The time dimension of our world has shifted from the long and mediumwaves of the year and the quarter to the short and micro waves of the day and the intra-day. Thedirect credit controls many of our countries still used ten or fifteen years ago called for compliance atthe end of the month, as did most other prudential requirements. Payment finality at the close of theday, achieved through clearing and settlement in central bank money rather than correspondentbanking, was considered sufficient. Monthly figures (not monthly averages of daily data) werejudged adequate for the purpose of computing compulsory reserves. The exchange rate and otherprices were “fixed” once a day.The reality of the monetary and financial world is becoming that of the intra-day, themicro wave; we are moving towards a continuous-time economy. We do not yet have markets for“one-hour money”, real-time accounting and reporting, and other similar devilries. But they willcome. The Basle Committee has stated that “although regular reporting will in principle take placeonly at intervals (in most countries quarterly), banks are expected to manage the market risk in theirtrading book in such a way that the capital requirements are being met on a continuous basis. i.e., atthe close of each business day”. Naturally, cost considerations will set a limit to the process, but theeffects will be - and to some extent already are - sufficient to upset many of the operational andregulatory instruments on which central bankers rely. Indeed, market players have so far been muchmore at their ease in the new microcosm than public authorities.9.As regards the space dimension, markets have grown bigger thanjurisdictions. A single transaction is now likely to involve a multiplicity of “nationalities” in terms ofcurrencies, players, authorities and legal systems. We used to regard the “State” as the universalcontainer providing the grounds and the rules for the game played by profit-driven players. Today,we sometimes have the impression that no one is responsible for maintaining the grounds or makingthe rules and even that central banks are the balls some round, some oval - being hit or kicked aroundin a free-for-all of baseball, golf, cricket, soccer, rugby and American football.10.Even the most independent, best equipped and highly reputed national centralbanks are hard put to perform their triadic task effectively in the new conditions of time and space.The new context has been created by the market, evolves in response to market forces and basicallymeets the needs of private interests. It is a creature of the market much more than of publicauthorities.Partly because of this evolution central banks and governments have become muchmore respectful of market forces, even humble. They are much more conscious that wealth andwelfare are created primarily in and by the market. They know that this is a much more powerfulbeast than its would-be tamer. The effectiveness of both the instruments on which central bankersrely - banking operations and regulatory provisions - have been eroded by the innovation in marketpractices and the blurring of national frontiers.BIS Review   41/1997
- 4 -To some extent this is healthy. Market players are not there to serve us, we are here toserve the economy. Yet, this downsizing of our role should not be carried too far. There is still apublic interest to be promoted that private actions cannot be counted upon to serve. There are stillgrounds for being proud to serve the public interest and for claiming that central banks should havethe means to achieve their ends. The fact that markets are powerful, global and fast-moving, whilecentral bank operations and regulations are national, intrusive and burdensome, does not mean themonetary system can do without a central bank or a bank regulator.11.Basle, the BIS, the meetings of the community of central bankers, from theGovernors down to junior officials, are where our profession has strived, largely successfully, tomaintain the upper hand over the reality that calls for its public function. The task is being performednotwithstanding the wide diversity of national laws, traditions, operational practices and institutionalconstraints.I am a convinced institutionalist, because I believe that without a “Rule of Law”liberty and peace - the key prerequisites for economic activity - cannot survive for long. And mybasic training, as well as much of my professional experience, have been in the European arena,which is a highly institutionalized cooperative system.In international monetary cooperation Basle stands at the “soft” end of the spectrum -no legal basis, no written terms of reference, no extensive minutes. Mostly personal contacts andwork based on the key words of banking and central banking: confidence, trust, credibility,confidentiality.12.Although I started to attend BIS meetings well before this tower wasconstructed (in the old hotel building of the Centralbahnstrasse), it was only when you called me tothe Basle Committee that I fully realized how strong this soft approach could be. Lawyers say that theBasle Committee “does not legally exist”. When I was appointed to its chair, my secretary had to takemy word for it because she could not find any written evidence of the decision. Yet the Committeerules, once endorsed by you, are adopted by the markets, followed by national legislators and spreadto all countries worldwide.When considering the working methods of the Basle Committee, I have often thought thatinternational cooperation among central banks can be compared to Italo Calvino’s “NonexistentKnight”. When Charlemagne, reviewing his paladins before the battle against the Infidels, reachedthe last knight, Agilulf, clad entirely in white armour, the cavalier refused to show his face to theemperor. The explanation he gave was simple: “Sire, because I do not exist”. Charlemagne insistedand when the knight finally raised his visor, the helmet was empty. “Well, well! Who’d have thoughtit!” exclaimed Charlemagne. “And how do you do your job, then, if you don’t exist?”. “By willpower and faith in our holy cause!” said Agilulf. He fought with valour and bravery. His specialstatus assisted him in the accomplishment of his duty and indeed he proved to be one of the bestpaladins.BIS Review   41/1997
BIS Review   64/1997Mr. Tietmeyer emphasises that monetary stability is a perpetual challengeSpeech given by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, at the1st European Equity Traders Convention of the Federation of European Stock Exchanges inFrankfurt/Main on 19/6/97.IThe old German folk tale about the stars that fall from the sky as thalers is adream that, on the European stage, has largely come to an end. The single currency will not fallinto the lap of the nations of Europe - at least not as a stable payment medium.The arduous struggle for strict and lasting compliance with the convergencecriteria - precisely here in Germany, too - shows that a stable euro is more like a valuabletreasure buried in a field. At present, some work is still needed to uncover it. And it will requirefurther energy to guard the euro’s stability on a lasting basis. In saying that, the realisation that itis not possible to make good policy with bad money has, in fact, gained some ground over thepast few years.There has been a growing general recognition of the fact that as stable a generalprice level as possible is an indispensable precondition for long-term growth which promotesemployment and fosters social cohesion. Stability and employment are not mutually exclusive.Indeed, I am pleased that the Amsterdam summit seems to have realised this.The encouraging increase in price stability in Europe is also a result of thepreparations for monetary union, however. In 1996, the average rate of inflation in the EUcountries was no more than 2.5 %, for example, and is likely to be even less in 1997. Thefinancial markets react very sensitively nowadays to political and economic changes that heraldrisks of inflation. It is possible that higher interest rates and exchange rate reactions will thenquickly follow. As a consequence, the globalised financial markets are increasingly alsobecoming guardians of stability. Since price stability is simultaneously making headwayworldwide, too, there are some commentators who already go as far as pronouncing inflation tobe “dead”. Does that mean that safeguarding monetary stability is not a perpetual challenge afterall?IIAn animated debate is taking place, not only in the United States, on the questionof whether moving even closer to a stable price level might do more harm than good inmacroeconomic terms. The losses in output and employment during the course of a furtherreduction in inflation might, in the view of some, be higher than the gains in stability that arestill to be achieved. It is also argued that a moderate inflation rate might promote employment,given, say, that the labour markets are not very flexible and that nominal wages show a certainratchet effect. It might additionally contribute to lower real interest rates.From my point of view, these arguments point in the wrong direction. Firstly, therightly deplored distortions due to time-lags in wage and price formation are seldom long-termin nature. And, secondly, attempting to use monetary means to solve problems in the realeconomy inevitably leads to an inflationary dead end. Such an attempt overrates the ability ofeconomic policy to control real processes and, at the same time, unwarrantably underestimatesthe controllability of inflationary processes once they have been set in motion.
- 2 -BIS Review   64/1997The advantages of lasting price stability are obvious, however. Fundamentally,they accrue without any time limit and every year. That is also true when a high degree ofstability has already been achieved. Overall economic costs arise, even in the case of inflationthat is fully anticipated. That is because any monetary erosion has the effect of a tax on cashheld. Prices and contracts, too, have to be adjusted regularly. Even a moderate rise in the generalprice level may imply appreciable uncertainty for economic agents. It is only with difficulty thatthe future rate of inflation can be assessed. The risk involved in long-term nominal contractsincreases. An inflation premium is added to interest rates in the capital market.In a system of taxation that is based on nominal variables, moderate monetaryerosion also makes the tax burden rise. With increasing rates of taxation, even growth in revenuethat is merely inflation-induced is subject to increasingly higher taxation (so-called “cold”progression). And the nominally constant exemption limits lose their value in real terms. Aboveall, that places a strain on capital income and leads to significant growth losses as a result oflower savings, as has been established by Martin Feldstein, for instance.The costs associated with hedging financial transactions against inflationary risksis likewise considerable. For you, as players in the financial markets, that may be a lucrativebusiness. You will probably agree with me, however, that - in macroeconomic terms - there aredefinitely more productive ways of investing money. In addition, stable money avoids thenegative consequences for income and wealth distribution and hence the risk of societal conflict.Whereas, given inflation, creditors make arbitrary and unearned gains, it is the recipients oftransfer income and the owners of monetary assets who are the losers. I am thinking, inparticular, of the small savers who wish to make additional provision for old age. Given 3 %inflation over a period of ten years, their monetary assets lose no less than one quarter of theirpurchasing power, for example.Thus, looked at over a longer period of time, attempts to moderate a high standardof stability are not at all worthwhile. Internal stability is and remains the sole genuine seal ofapproval for a good currency. That is the sole basis on which confidence in the monetary systemwill grow, on which millions of efficient processes of exchange in the goods, factor andfinancial markets can be organised every day, and on which economic relationships that aresustainable in the long term can be established. For that reason, monetary stability is - and willremain - a perpetual challenge even in the age of moderate rates of inflation.IIIThat applies quite particularly with a view to European monetary union. If theeuro is not given the stability seal of approval by the financial markets and the general publicfrom the outset, the project of monetary union will be standing - economically and politically -on feet of clay. But how can the euro be given stability from the start, apart from the future ECBpursuing a consistent and stability-oriented monetary policy?I wish to highlight three aspects.1.Fiscal policy in the participating countries must regain its room formanoeuvre.A glance at the public sector budgets in the majority of member states shows hownarrow the financial scope has become everywhere following the many years of accumulatingdebt and the expansion of the public sector. The vicious circle of growing indebtedness and ofever-higher interest burdens pushes other tasks into the background and calls for higher and
- 3 -BIS Review   64/1997higher taxes and levies. That is especially the case in those countries with retirement provisionand health care based on the “pay as you go” principle, and which are faced with considerabledemographic challenges. In a large number of European countries, the government ratio and thetaxes and social security ratio have now reached such orders of magnitude that they arethreatening to strangle the economy’s power of innovation, and putting more and more jobs atrisk. This process must be corrected if prospects for growth and employment are to be improvedon a lasting basis.For that reason - irrespective of monetary union - sustained consolidation is apressing need. Short-term one-off actions or a relaxation of the Maastricht fiscal criteria would,in may view, give the wrong signals. That would only encourage the disastrous illusion that thefinancial position is still bearable or that it will improve automatically at a later date. Moreover,it would reduce the salutary pressure to reform exerted by the Maastricht process. Urgentadjustments would then probably continue to be put on hold - and place an even heavier burdenon the future.An unsound fiscal policy and a strict monetary policy do not go together in thelonger term. The distortions in the shape of economic costs, due to higher interest rates,employment and growth losses, may become very large. That is the reason why, under Article109j of the Maastricht Treaty, all the European countries must make efforts to achieve “thesustainability of the government financial position” beyond the starting date. In all probability,the supranational monetary policy of the ECB will, in the event of a conflict, find it difficultenough as it is to withstand the political pressure of fiscal, economic and pay-rate policies whichremain national in Europe.For that reason,2.the independence of the European System of Central Banks enshrined in theMaastricht Treaty must not be infringed.By dispensing with the exchange rate, the participating countries will be doingwithout the mechanism which they were previously able to use to cushion differences betweencountries in terms of inflation, productivity or the growth of government debt. In the eurocurrency area, there will be no comprehensive financial adjustment scheme in support ofeconomically weaker countries. The countries lack the money and probably the willingness forlarge-scale transfer payments. The burden of adjustment in the case of changes in productivityand demand will lie almost exclusively with national labour costs. Wages and wage-relatedlevies must be geared to differences in productivity, otherwise unemployment will easily occur.If wages are not sufficiently flexible, however, there will be a great danger that pressure foractionism will soon be directed to the single monetary policy. That is because experience teachesus that policy makers easily fall prey to the temptation to side-step the pressure of structuralproblems by means of a little extra inflation. Given differing trends between countries, however,that could also easily lead to conflicts between them.In Germany, the Bundesbank has always been able to rely on its anti-inflationarypolicy having the broad support of the general public, and to defend its independence againstany political pressure. That has become apparent again during the past few weeks. And theconfidence which the markets have always shown in the Bundesbank is based on suchexperience. The European Central Bank still has to earn that confidence, however. As Iunderstand things, this will be all the easier, the greater is the stock of confidence introduced bythe national central banks from their own countries. In other words: the more persistently policy
- 4 -BIS Review   64/1997makers in all the participating countries champion the independence of the European CentralBank and then also respect its monetary policy decisions.For the euro to be successful, however, it is also important for3.the European countries to solve their structural problems and to face up tothe new challenges.The resolution of the European Council on growth and employment states that“... it should be a priority aim to develop a skilled, trained  and adaptableworkforce and to make labour markets responsive to economic change.Structural reforms need to be comprehensive in scope ...”That statement is actually true. Apart from that, it has little to do with monetaryunion per se. Those problems and challenges exist anyway:-persistently high unemployment, for example, which - even with a cyclicalupturn - is unlikely to fall significantly without structural changes;-in a large number of countries, the welfare state is increasingly reaching - orhas already reached - the point where it cannot go any further in terms offunding;-demographic trends call for timely adjustments in health care and retirementprovision;-advancing economic globalisation is intensifying competition and calls fornew thinking and action.Those are undoubtedly only some of the tasks. We are all aware of the pressingproblems in our own countries.Each country must find its own, nationally appropriate  solution. For it is certainthat the euro will, if anything, further intensify competition to win inward investment withinEurope. At the same time, Europe’s structural weaknesses will be revealed more starkly in aninternational comparison. No one should indulge in any illusions. The euro cannot pay off pastdebts nor can it eliminate unemployment that has already been created. On the contrary,increasing demands will be placed on the participating countries as a result of them dispensingwith their own exchange rate and interest rate policies. The problems that exist must therefore besolved, if possible, before entry into monetary union.It is precisely in the case of economic divergence in the euro area that eachparticipating country must be adaptable enough to manage without the emergency escape routeof altering the exchange rate. It is only if each participating country is competitive on its ownterms that the single Europe will be able to assume a leading role as an economic region in thefuture.In Germany, the realisation that change is necessary is gradually beginning togain acceptance. The road which leads from realising that to the necessary reform is still anarduous one at times, however - especially during the run-up to the elections:“We do not have a problem of perception,but rather a problem of implementation.”
- 5 -BIS Review   64/1997That statement by the Federal President, Roman Herzog, puts the present situationin Germany in a nutshell.What we now need more than anything, therefore, is the courage and thedetermination to redefine the priorities of government and the public sector. Reliable underlyingconditions politically in the longer term are important for giving investors certainty. Furthersteps must also be taken towards labour markets that are more flexible, even if management andlabour have already made some moves in that direction. And, overall, we need a greater degreeof personal responsibility and private initiative in order to find innovative solutions to structuralrigidities.Without doubt, those countries under the umbrella of a single currency that actquickly and fully on the basis the lessons that have been learned will be those which are bestable to hold their own. Anyone who puts off the necessary reforms might easily fall behind evenfurther in competing as an industrial location. I hope that all the countries which are pushing forentry into monetary union are aware of that fact.IVThe European financial markets are under pressure to adjust, too, of course. Somecountries - such as Germany with the D-Mark as the second most important reserve andinvestment currency in the world - will lose their currency-related “bonus”, whereas others willstrengthen their position, which was weaker hitherto because of their currency.In the monetary union, the formerly national European capital markets will drawmuch closer together. Currency and interest rate differentials will no longer matter.Despite that, it is unlikely that a completely uniform market will come intoexistence. Certain special national regulations will still be in force - in the case of taxation ofinvestment income, for instance. Nevertheless, I still hope that there will be a growingrecognition that further progress in harmonisation is an urgent necessity. In practice, issueshaving the same terms are still likely to show limited differences in yields. Yield differentialswill then mainly be due to the differences in the standing of the issuers and the differingliquidity of the issues.Higher demands will be placed on public sector national debt managementbecause currency will no longer act as a “screen”. Even now, the globalisation of the financialmarkets is calling for a widespread application of international standards. The euro is likely toencourage that trend. A reliable political regulatory framework and an efficient structure in thenational financial markets will then become crucial assets in competing for capital that is in shortsupply.What implications do these developments have for the European financialmarkets? At present, there are still a large number of stock markets and futures exchanges in theEuropean Union which have a wide variety of market models and trading systems. As in thefinancial industry as a whole, the pressure of competition and advances in communicationtechnology will lead to a process of adjustment and concentration. But the debate on the futureof Europe’s financial centres is also connected with questions concerning the set of instrumentsthat the European System of Central Banks will have at its disposal.
- 6 -BIS Review   64/1997The Bundesbank attaches great importance to the monetary policy strategy -including the instruments belonging to it - being implemented in a way that leaves competitionunaffected, and which does not discriminate against any financial centre in the euro area. We donot want any privileges for Frankfurt, but we do not want any disadvantages either. Along withthe national central banks, which will carry the main weight of operational activities, theEuropean Central Bank must itself have its own limited field of operations. That is because,from our point of view, competition between the stock market centres and trading systems whichare not bound locationally is the best means of finding the appropriate financial market structurefor the larger currency area.The greater breadth and depth of the euro market compared with the formernational markets can also bring new business, of course. The euro - especially if it is enduringlystable - is likely to be particularly attractive for internationally operating demanders andsuppliers of capital. The euro, however, will still first have to earn its position in the portfolio ofpublic and private investors by competing with other currencies. In saying that, it ought to bebeyond dispute that a euro which is weak inwardly in terms of its purchasing power will not beable to take a leading position externally. For that reason, too, safeguarding monetary stability isa perpetual challenge for the euro.VPolicy makers must now create confidence by taking credible decisions so that thegeneral public and the markets accept the future euro. The aim must be a smooth changeoverfrom the national currencies to the euro. Turbulence in the financial markets due to volatileexchange rates or to institutional investors abruptly adjusting their portfolios might place aconsiderable strain on the euro at its inception.In Dublin, the European Council made a major contribution to planning and legalcertainty for all concerned with the two regulations on the adoption of the euro. Happily, theAmsterdam summit endorsed those drafts. But it is also necessary for the markets to know ingood time how the final exchange rates are fixed. That is something which is still underdiscussion at present. It is very much my hope that the ministers of finance and central bankgovernors will arrive at a common opinion on this question at the next Informal Ecofin inLuxembourg in September.The choice of the countries starting with monetary union will naturally be ofcrucial importance. In accordance with the schedule, that decision will be taken in spring 1998on the basis of the economic data for 1997. In my view, speculating now about the group ofparticipants is inappropriate. Such speculation could ultimately do more harm than good,because it increases overall uncertainty. For that reason, I shall also continue to refrain fromengaging in it. In my opinion, neither political calculation nor short-term success in meeting thecriteria should decide the choice of participants to be made, ultimately, by the heads of state andof government acting by a qualified majority. Rather, sustained convergence and credibility interms of anti-inflation policy will be crucial. It will undoubtedly be possible to gauge howcredible that decision is by how the financial markets behave, too.VIA stable euro will indeed be a valuable treasure. That is why the architects ofmonetary union must not forget that monetary stability is a perpetual challenge. And on noaccount must they forget that confidence in a currency is established only with difficulty, but
- 7 -BIS Review   64/1997squandered incredibly quickly. Even if the euro will not fall into the European nations’ lap like astar falling as a thaler from the sky, at least the efforts undertaken to obtain it must not be invain. Monetary union must not be achieved by gaining the euro and losing stability. Instead, weneed a euro which - like the D-Mark now - is a byword for lasting stability.
BIS Review   65/1997Mr. George discusses the framework of monetary policy in the UK andEurope   Text of the Sixteenth Mais Lecture delivered by the Governor of the Bank of England,Mr. E.A.J. George, at the City University Business School in London on 24/6/97.I was delighted to have been invited to deliver the Sixteenth Mais Lecture - untilsome two or three months ago when you asked me to suggest a title! I confess that, at that stage,I had not really thought about what I should talk about - so I offered you the portmanteau title of“Monetary policy in Britain and Europe”, hoping, like Mr Micawber, that something would turnup - either here or on the Continent - to give some topicality to what I might say. Well happily,Vice Chancellor, it has. On 6 May, just four days after taking office, the Chancellor of theExchequer announced some radical changes to the monetary policy framework in this country -including changes to the role and constitution of the Bank of England. I should like to discusssome of those changes this evening against the background of the monetary policy frameworkbeing developed in Europe, in preparation for the introduction of the euro, including the role ofthe future European System of Central Banks (ESCB). But I should like to discuss them in thecontext of the approach to economic management more generally in Europe and this country andperhaps I might start with that.Overall economic managementSweeping generalisations are of course always dangerous. But from my particularvantage point at least, there has, over the past decade or more, been a clear change of emphasis -across Europe but much more widely internationally - away from short-term, macro- economic,demand management as the means of promoting the agreed end-objectives of economic policy,of growth of output and employment, and of rising living standards, and towards the need formacro-economic stability in the medium and longer term. Where before the implicit assumptionappeared to be that the supply side of the economy would respond relatively flexibly toincreasing demand, there is now the perception that over-ambitious short-term demandmanagement, which attempts to push capacity to its limits or even beyond, can generateinstability and uncertainty, damaging capacity growth in the longer term by distorting economicdecision-making in relation to investment, for example, or in relation to resource allocation.The result is a broad consensus - across countries but also across a wide part ofthe political spectrum within countries - on the need for macro-economic policy to be directedtowards stability and sustainability in the medium and longer term. This consensus is reflected inthe Maastricht Treaty - through the famous convergence criteria. It is reflected, too, in thearrangements for the conduct of macro-economic policy now being put in place for theintroduction of the single European currency - including the monetary preparations for theEuropean Central Bank (ECB), and the agreement on the fiscal Stability and Growth Pactrecently confirmed by the European Council in Amsterdam.But alongside this collective commitment to macro-economic stability, there is agrowing recognition that stability, on its own, is not enough. While it may be a necessarycondition for achieving sustainable growth of output and employment, and rising livingstandards - the truly good things in life - and while stability may indeed be the most thatmacro-economic policy can contribute in the longer term to those agreed end-objectives, it is notin itself a sufficient condition for achieving them. So attention everywhere is now focusingincreasingly on the structural characteristics of our economies which essentially determine theirunderlying, supply-side, rate of capacity growth.
- 2 -BIS Review   65/1997The issue is starkly illustrated by the fact that despite very substantial progresstowards macro-economic stability within the European Union as a whole in recent years -including real progress towards effective price stability (with measured inflation now below 2%)and strenuous efforts everywhere to cut back public sector deficits as required by the Maastrichtconvergence criteria - output has stagnated, growing at an average annual rate of only 1% or soover the past five or six years, and unemployment has risen inexorably, to around 11% acrossthe Union as a whole. And while it is true that activity may now be beginning to recover, thepick-up is very largely driven by external demand - with the domestic economy stilldepressingly weak.Against this background, the need for greater supply-side flexibility withinEurope is increasingly widely acknowledged. And there are elements of a common approach tobringing it about. These were reflected, for example, in the Resolution on Growth andEmployment adopted at the European Summit in Amsterdam a week ago, which talks of theneed to improve European competitiveness - with special attention to be given “to labour andproduct market efficiency, technological innovation and the potential for small andmedium-sized enterprises to create jobs”. It talks, too, of improving “training and educationsystems, including life-long learning, work incentives in the tax and benefit systems andreducing non-wage labour costs, in order to increase employability”. But these policyapproaches are not well-defined across Europe, and it is probably at this stage stretching a pointto speak of even a “broad” consensus on specific approaches in this area. Even where particularneeds for change have been identified nationally, recent experience in some countries suggeststhat there can be formidable resistance to bringing it about.The new Government in this country is clearly joined in the European consensuson the need for macro-economic stability; and it too emphasises the importance of supply-sideflexibility, indeed its thinking on supply-side issues clearly influenced the AmsterdamResolution which I have just mentioned. To quote a recent article by the Chancellor:“The Labour Government is committed to monetary stability so that businessesand families can plan for the future; to fiscal stability; and (on the supply side) tohigher levels of investment in both people and business; to a modernisation of ourwelfare state, and, not least, to free trade and a constructive engagement inEurope.”This country’s approach overall to economic management is, therefore, whollyconsistent with that of our European partners; and we start from a somewhat more comfortableposition, in which our own recent progress towards greater macro-economic stability has in factbeen accompanied by somewhat stronger growth of activity - averaging over 2½% over the pastfive years - and by a sustained fall in unemployment to around 7¼% on a comparable ILO basis.Monetary managementWithin this overall economic policy context, there is a particular commitment,throughout the European Union, to monetary stability; and I should like now to consider some ofthe very recent changes to our own monetary policy framework against that background.
- 3 -BIS Review   65/1997(i) ObjectiveI begin with the objective of monetary policy which, both here and on theContinent, is allocated specific responsibility for achieving and maintaining price stability.The Maastricht Treaty states that “The primary objective of the ESCB shall be tomaintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shallsupport the general economic policies of the Community....”In his statement to the House of Commons on May 20th, the Chancellor said:“The Bank (of England)’s monetary policy objective will be to deliver price stability, and,without prejudice to this objective, to support the Government’s economic policy, including itsobjectives for growth and employment.”At this level, our respective missions are effectively identical. But it is importantto understand that price stability is not simply an end in itself, but a means to the end ofsustainable growth. What in fact we are, in principle, trying to do in maintaining price stabilityis to keep the growth of monetary demand more or less continuously broadly in line with theunderlying capacity growth in the economy - in effect using price stability as an indicator ofstability in the economy as a whole. And although we cannot hope to achieve that in practicewith any great precision, we can reasonably aspire to help to moderate the economic cycle ratherthan aggravate it, as so often in the past.The Maastricht Treaty makes no provision for any further definition of the ECB’sprimary objective. It is left for the ECB’s Governing Council to determine how to interpret“price stability” in any particular circumstance. Indeed, the ECB will need to decide whether ithas a specific target for inflation at all, or whether, operationally, it adopts an intermediatemonetary target, or elements of both.In the case of the United Kingdom it is the Chancellor who determines the preciseinflation target, which he has subsequently set at 2½% for the Retail Price Index excludingmortgage interest payments; and the Chancellor reserves the right, in extreme economiccircumstances, to override the Bank of England’s operational independence in seeking toachieve the Government’s target.In practice, in either case, the degree of latitude that these arrangementsapparently provide is likely to be limited by the need to maintain the credibility of thecommitment to price stability, with financial markets and with the public at large. But in theUnited Kingdom at least, where public support for monetary stability is more recentlyestablished than it is, for example, in Germany, the elected Government’s public and explicitcommitment to low inflation may provide reassurance, and help to secure greater acceptance ofthe policy.In any event the Bank’s remit under the new arrangements is unmistakably clear.We are charged with delivering the Government’s inflation target. Operationally, that means thatwe are to aim consistently to achieve 2½% on RPIX as a mid-point, so that, with a balanceddistribution of risks, there should be an even chance of outturns - at the end of our two-yearforecasting horizon - either above or below 2½%. The measure of our success will be how closewe in fact come to 2½%, not on any particular date, but on average over time.
- 4 -BIS Review   65/1997(ii) Transparency and accountabilityThe clear separation of responsibility for setting the inflation target (the politicaldecision) from responsibility for achieving it (the technical decision) also helps to ensure that theGovernment and the Bank are separately accountable for their respective roles in the monetarypolicy process. And in this area of accountability, too, there are considerable differencesbetween the arrangements that will apply to the ECB and to ourselves.In the case of the ECB, the Treaty requires that it “shall address an annual reporton the activities of the ESCB, and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year,to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and also to the European Council.The President of the ECB shall present this report to the Council and to the EuropeanParliament, which may hold a general debate on that basis.” In addition, the ECB President andthe members of its Executive Board may be invited, or volunteer, to appear before the competentCommittees of the European Parliament.In the case of the Bank of England:(i) The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) meetings todetermine interest rates will be published, identifying how each member voted,with an explanation of why the individuals who voted against were opposed tothe majority decision.(ii) The MPC’s performance will be reviewed regularly by a reformed Court ofDirectors, and the Bank’s Annual Report will be debated in the House ofCommons.(iii) The Bank will continue to publish its quarterly Inflation Report, reviewingboth the outturn and the prospect for inflation in relation to the target; and theTreasury Select Committee will take evidence from the MPC on the InflationReport.(iv) And, as Chairman of the MPC, the Governor is required to write an openletter to the Chancellor if inflation strays by more than 1 percentage point eitherside of the 2½% target. The letter would refer as appropriate to the InflationReport, and explain why inflation was adrift, how long the divergence wasexpected to last, and the action taken to bring it back on course.Taken as a whole, these arrangements provide for greater transparency of, andgreater accountability for, the technical monetary process than anywhere else in the world.Now I do not suppose, quite honestly, that anyone would particularly enjoy thisdegree of public scrutiny. But it will certainly help to concentrate the minds of the MPCmembers, and it is, I believe, a necessary feature of our new arrangements.The technical implementation of monetary policy - even with a very clearlydefined objective - is not at all easy at the best of times. We have in practice a singleinstrument - the short-term interest rate - the precise effects of which on the economy are by nomeans perfectly understood, including by ourselves. We do know that it can take up to a coupleof years or more to have its full effects. So we have to rely substantially on uncertain forecaststhat are subject to unforeseeable shocks. Policy judgements in these circumstances are
- 5 -BIS Review   65/1997necessarily an art rather than an exact science, no matter how much we apply science toinforming those judgements. And the judgements themselves need to be constantly reviewed andfrequently revised as relevant new information becomes available.Transparency in these circumstances can only encourage a better informed publicdebate and a more sophisticated public understanding of the issues. That in turn can only help tostrengthen confidence in the process - unless of course we make a frightful hash of it! I shall besurprised - and somewhat disappointed - if the ECB Governing Council does not go toconsiderable lengths to explain its policies to the public at large, for similar reasons, even if it isnot actually required to do so by statute.(iii) The decision-making frameworkReflecting its multinational character, the policy-making body of the ECB, theGoverning Council, will comprise the Governors of the participating country central banks plusthe six members of the Executive Board. Our own MPC will comprise four “outside” membersdirectly appointed by the Chancellor, together with five Bank executives - the Governor, twoDeputy Governors, and two Executive Directors. The common characteristic is that in each casethe decision-makers will be professional experts rather than representatives of particularinterests. Any doubts that this would in fact be the case in relation to the outside appointments tothe MPC were certainly immediately dispelled when the names were announced: together withour inside appointees, they are, as a team, as well qualified professionally for the task we havebeen set as I can imagine anywhere in the world - and we certainly need all the help we can get.The processes of the Committee are inevitably still evolving. It will, as you wouldexpect, be supported by the whole, considerable, range of the Bank’s monetary, economic,statistical and market expertise, supplemented by intelligence from the Bank’s network ofregional agencies, with further front-line input both from the non-executive members of Courtand from our wide range of industrial, commercial and financial contacts.The Committee will be closely involved in the preparation of the quarterlyInflation Report, contributing to both the analysis and the forecasts. And, of course, it will meetregularly on pre-announced dates each month - the dates determined by the monthly cycle ofstatistical information - to take its decisions on monetary policy. These monthly meetings arespread over three days: a whole-day meeting to receive briefings from the Bank staff on thelatest developments; an afternoon meeting to identify and discuss the important underlyingissues, and any tactical considerations there may be; and a final morning meeting to decide uponany necessary policy action. The Committee will need also to provide for emergency meetings inthe event of a crisis, but if we are successful in our task of achieving permanent, long-term,stability I would hope that that will prove to be a very rare occurrence.(iv) Implementation of policyCompared with the complexity of the decision-making process in relation tointerest rates, implementation of those decisions is relatively straightforward.In the case of the ECB, the short-term interest rate will basically be containedwithin a corridor, bounded, at the top, by an overnight lending facility to the commercial banks,and, at the bottom, by an overnight deposit facility in which the banks can place surplus funds.Within the corridor the market interest rate will be steered by means of open market repurchaseoperations. The ECB may also require commercial banks to hold with the system minimum cash
- 6 -BIS Review   65/1997reserves; and it will offer a limited amount of longer-term credit to commercial banks at marketrates; neither of these features appear to us to be necessary for monetary policy purposes, butthey represent an element of continuity from the arrangements which currently apply in someprospective member countries.In our own case the arrangements are even simpler. The decision on interest rateswill be announced at noon following the final, morning, meeting of the MPC, and the choseninterest rate will be applied in our daily money market operations - mostly these days throughrepurchase operations in gilt-edged securities. Limited facilities for late lending to the remainingdiscount houses and the settlement banks are available to ensure the smooth functioning of thepayments system at the end of the day.Looking at the monetary policy arrangements, planned for Europe and as theynow are in this country, as a whole, it is clear that while there are significant differences of detail- such that our own arrangements would certainly require considerable further modification tomake them compatible with membership of the ESCB - the essential similarities are muchgreater than the differences. Crucially, the primary monetary policy objective of price stability isthe same, and the responsibility for achieving that objective is in each case entrusted to a broadlybased group of technical experts not subject to political influence. That does not of courseguarantee that we will, here or in Europe, succeed in achieving permanently greater stability but,perhaps presumptuously, I do think it gives us every chance of doing so.Concluding remarksMr Chairman, what I have tried to do this evening is to draw attention to what Isee as a very striking coincidence of basic approach to economic - and in particular monetary -management within Europe but also between Continental Europe and this country. We areclearly, it seems to me, on parallel tracks as far as our commitment to macro-economic, bothfiscal and monetary, stability is concerned, though we may be travelling at different speeds whenit comes to supply-side flexibility.That coincidence of basic approach is a prerequisite for sustainable economicconvergence within Europe - without it I do not see how monetary union could be on theagenda. But the question that is often then put to me is, if in fact we are on parallel tracks - interms of our basic approach - why then do we not get on the same train and commit ourselves tojoining monetary union. So let me conclude with just a few remarks on that subject.The potential attraction of travelling together with our European partners is veryclear. There would, other things equal, be real economic advantages in exchange rate certaintyacross the single market area, which can only be realised through the single currency. The samecertainty cannot be achieved by the countries of Europe independently pursuingmacro-economic discipline, although that should over time help to minimise the degree ofintra-European exchange rate volatility.But there are real risks.We are not all starting from the same station. Domestic demand in this country,for example, is currently growing at a rate which we cannot sustain for very long without theemergence of inflationary pressures. In the major countries of Continental Europe, on the otherhand, domestic demand remains, as I say, relatively subdued. The possibility of such cyclicaldivergences will not simply disappear on January 1st 1999 and they would seriously complicate
- 7 -BIS Review   65/1997the operation of a single monetary policy. So too would a variety of possible internal or externalshocks which affected euro member countries in different ways or to different degrees.But more fundamentally - and I can’t keep up the railway analogy - I am franklynervous at the prospect of introducing the euro at a time of very high and very different rates ofunemployment across Europe. It is not that I think unemployment can be addressed directly bymore expansionary macro-economic polices - that ought to be clear from my earlier remarks. Ishare the view that unemployment needs to be addressed fundamentally through supply-sidepolicies - though it may be that the problem is currently being aggravated in the short term bythe heroic attempts being made to meet the fiscal criteria according to the Maastricht timetablein a context of cyclical weakness. The problem is that we cannot be confident how individualcountries may respond to this situation. My concern is that the persistence of these whollyunacceptable levels of unemployment across Europe, and the very real difficulty ofimplementing appropriate supply-side reforms, could begin to undermine public support formacro-economic stability in some countries - even though significant relaxation on this frontwould provide at best only short-term relief. In that case, economic convergence, if it wereachieved, could prove difficult to sustain. There are perhaps some suggestions that this may bebeginning to happen; and it may be for this reason that the foreign exchange markets areimplying that they expect relative euro weakness - to our own considerable embarrassment as aresult of the corresponding strength of sterling’s exchange rate. I have no doubt that, if the eurogoes ahead, the ECB would in fact seek determinedly to exercise its statutory responsibility formaintaining price stability within the euro area. But its job would be enormously more difficultif this came to be seen, at least in some countries, within the euro area - however mistakenly - asan obstacle to the end-objectives of economic policy, including particularly increasingemployment.My conclusion, Mr Chairman, from all this is that whether or not the europroceeds on the present timetable, and whether or not the UK is a part of that, the reallyimportant thing for European prosperity is that the present broad policy consensus holdstogether. But if we are to be able to hold on to macro-economic stability - as we must - then wehave to find answers to the urgent problem of European unemployment. That involvesaddressing the problems of supply-side flexibility as an immediate priority. And that, ViceChancellor, is the message that the new Government has recently carried to Europe.
Mr. McDonough examines recent developments and trends in the foreignexchange markets   Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,Mr. William J. McDonough, before the 39th International Congress of the Association CambisteInternational, The Financial Markets Association in Toronto on 30/5/97.I am delighted to be invited to address the 39th International Congress of theAssociation Cambiste Internationale (ACI) -- The Financial Markets Association. I must confessto a certain affinity for the foreign exchange community, stemming, no doubt, from mycommercial banking experience and my time overseeing the foreign exchange desk at theFederal Reserve Bank of New York. I’ve long believed that, more so than in most other sectorsof the finance industry, there is a real community among those engaged in foreign exchange -- acommunity that relies on close personal ties and contacts. It is this spirit of community thatmakes events such as these ACI meetings today and tomorrow so enjoyable and important,giving us the opportunity to renew old friendships and build new relationships that will enableus to do our respective jobs that much better.In my remarks to you this morning, I would like to highlight some recentdevelopments in the foreign exchange market and share with you my view, as a central banker,of what has been driving some of the trends we’ve been observing. We heard a lot of talk in theforeign exchange markets in 1996 about the “end of volatility.” As the market performance ofthe last few weeks has demonstrated, such commentary was a bit exaggerated. However, evenwith the spike in volatility we’ve seen in recent weeks, there is no question that we havewitnessed a remarkable period of relative stability in foreign exchange rates over the past sixquarters or so.What accounts for this relative stability in the foreign exchange markets since late1995? Economic fundamentals are certainly one factor -- we have had a period of relative pricestability in the major world economies, and a general absence of severe market shocks.However, I would argue that what we’ve been observing is also, in part, a by-product ofcontinuously greater transparency that has characterized the foreign exchange market over thepast several years. Moreover, I am convinced that the increased transparency in the foreignexchange markets is beneficial: for the foreign exchange community, for financial markets ingeneral, and for the global economy as a whole.Before explaining what I mean by greater transparency and why I believe it is sobeneficial, I would like to take a quick look at the record itself. Is the talk about decliningvolatility reflected in hard evidence? Yes, it largely is. Thirty-day dollar-mark and dollar-yenhistorical volatility remained below 10 percent throughout most of 1996 and the first quarter of1997, and, even with the price action we saw in May, the spike in thirty-day historical volatilitywe’ve observed is not particularly dramatic when compared with similar periods in past years.Similarly, implied volatility on dollar-mark and dollar-yen options traded to near record lows in1996.But, as this month has shown, volatility has not been eliminated. There also havebeen a number of days in the past year and a half with considerable volatility in the foreignexchange market. And, I have no doubt that we’ll have many more of these days -- at times, forexample, when markets rapidly adjust to new information or when periods of poor liquidityresult in exaggerated price swings.What is clear is that this is a market that is constantly evolving. None of us cansay with any certainty whether we’re observing the beginning of a trend or an anomalous periodBIS Review   60/1997
- 2 -that will ultimately be viewed as a brief lull in volatility. However, I don’t think many of youwould disagree with me when I say that the foreign exchange market over the past six quartersor so has changed significantly from that in 1994 and 1992. For those of you who, like me, wereinvolved in this business in the 1970s and 1980s following the collapse of the Bretton Woodssystem, the contrast is very dramatic.Given these realities, we must ask ourselves what has changed to alter the wayforeign exchange rates fluctuate in the global marketplace? It is obvious that this is not a case ofdeclining volume. The foreign exchange survey most recently published by the Bank forInternational Settlements in 1996 shows that daily volume in foreign exchange grew by almost50 percent between 1992 and 1995, and we have no reason to think that anything has changedsince then to alter this trend.What has changed, however, is the new, higher level of transparency that hasbeen introduced in recent years into the foreign exchange market. When I speak of transparency,I am actually referring to a combination of several factors. Broadly speaking, I definetransparency in this market as the degree to which its participants have equal and simultaneousaccess to the inputs necessary to price assets and their associated risk accurately. By reducingguesswork and uncertainty, transparency helps to smooth price adjustments and eliminate someof the shocks that can result when market participants discover they have “priced in”assumptions that are inaccurate. In my view, the current move toward greater markettransparency is reflected in four broad categories: policy, information, pricing, and riskmanagement.The increased transparency of central bank policy -- which is a product ofdeliberate steps taken by policymakers -- is an important aspect of the move toward moretransparent overall market conditions that we’ve been observing. Over the past several years,central banks in a number of countries, most notably in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and theUnited Kingdom, have become increasingly convinced of the value of making a publiccommitment to an articulated and transparent policy standard, usually price stability. By settingclear policy objectives, the makers of monetary policy can eliminate much of the guesswork thatcentral bank watchers must engage in to figure out what the central bank will do next. In sodoing, they can help anchor inflation expectations over the long term, and thereby fostereconomic growth by ensuring a stable price environment.Many central banks are also increasingly coming to realize that much of thesecrecy and cautious signaling that once characterized monetary policy decisions is, to someextent, counterproductive. In recent years, a number of central banks have taken measures tofurther open up their policy processes to the public. For example, prior to February 1994,changes in monetary policy in the United States were signaled to the market through openmarket operations. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has publicly announced changes inpolicy, typically following each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.Some policymakers had been concerned that this shift in procedure for communicating policydecisions might create additional market volatility. In fact, a recent study by some of mycolleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found just the opposite -- that announcingpolicy changes has not led to increased volatility in the federal funds rate. By makinginformation on monetary policy decisions available quickly and broadly, we at the FederalReserve have helped level the playing field and, I believe, contributed to smoothing the processby which new information on FOMC policy is incorporated more quickly and efficiently in assetprices.BIS Review   60/1997
- 3 -Other central banks have similarly increased transparency in their monetarypolicy processes. One example is the Bank of England’s move to publish the minutes of themonthly policy meetings between the Chancellor and the Bank of England Governor, a practicethat is to continue under the new monetary policy council. The Bank of Canada, too, has takensteps to increase the level of transparency in its markets. It now publishes a semiannualmonetary policy report and sets an explicit level for its bank rate.National governments also have contributed to greater transparency in monetarypolicy by increasingly recognizing the value of endowing their central banks with greaterindependence. Moves of this sort have occurred in several Western European countries andmany emerging market economies, especially in Latin America, over the past several years.A second area where recent developments have resulted in improved transparencyin the foreign exchange market is information technology. Easy and inexpensive access to a vastarray of information has changed the way financial markets absorb new data. Most of us in thisroom sit in offices or trading rooms with keyboard access to data, analysis, and news that oncetook huge resources to manage. And, neither bankers nor traders have a monopoly on thiscapacity -- corporate treasurers and institutional investors can pull up most of the same screenswe can. At one time, a presence in a local market and access to early newspapers could provide atrading advantage for a large market maker. Today, news from that market is availableelectronically worldwide with almost no lag. Information is cheaper and easier to come by thanever before. The result? A global market that reacts quickly and efficiently to new data, andparticipants who have more time to analyze information because they need to spend less timegathering it. One consequence of this improved transparency in information technology is thatinformation gets reflected in asset prices more quickly and more smoothly than ever before.A closely related development that has also contributed to increased transparencyin the foreign exchange market has been the rapid evolution of the price discovery process in thepast several years. Electronic brokerage and electronic interbank dealing systems have evolvedthat have smoothed the dissemination of current pricing and improved market liquidity. Whereastruly competitive pricing was once the province of only the largest market makers, smallerinterbank dealers -- and even some foreign exchange end-users -- now also have access tonarrow bid-ask spreads. The result so far has been a deeper market and, again, a more levelplaying field for all market participants, with pricing no longer dominated by a few largeplayers.The final area in which recent innovations have improved market transparency isrisk management. While we are far from being able to rest on our laurels, there is no denying thefact that financial institutions, their customers, and their investors have become moresophisticated over the past several years at evaluating, monitoring, and controlling market risk.If market participants better understand the risk of the positions they put on their books, they aremore able to react effectively and efficiently when their assumptions are challenged or unwound.Although it is crucial that rapid innovations in trading and risk management practices continue,most of the institutions represented here have already made important progress along these linesin recent years.What needs to be stressed, however, is that it is not enough for a firm todevelop -  for internal purposes alone -- sophisticated new techniques to assess, price, andmanage increasingly refined components of financial risk. If financial markets are to functionmost efficiently, shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of these firms also must be able toBIS Review   60/1997
- 4 -assess the risks when they make their evaluations. In order for them to do this, meaningfulinformation about risks and risk management performance must be available.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been actively involved inencouraging an evolution of disclosure practices that will improve the functioning of financialmarkets. As you may know, Peter Fisher, an executive vice president of the New York Fed,chaired a working group of the Euro-Currency Standing Committee of the G-10 central banks,which published a discussion paper on “Public Disclosure of Market and Credit Risks byFinancial Intermediaries” in September 1994. This so-called Fisher report described how tradingand financial risk management practices had developed far beyond the public disclosure offinancial information, creating a gap between the precision with which a firm’s managementcould assess and adjust the firm’s own risk exposures and the information available to outsidersto help them assess the riskiness of that firm’s activities.Recognizing that such an asymmetry of available information could cause themisallocation of capital among firms and amplify market disturbances, the Fisher reportrecommended that all financial intermediaries -- regulated and unregulated -- move in thedirection of publicly disclosing periodic quantitative information. The information requestedwould provide estimates relied upon by the firm’s management of:the market risks in the relevant portfolio or portfolios, as well as the firm’s actualperformance in managing the market risks in these portfolios; andthe counterparty credit risks arising from the firm’s trading and risk managementactivities.By and large, these proposed measures for reporting risk have been adoptedvoluntarily by many major banking institutions around the world, with many others moving inthat direction. As such, they have contributed importantly to improved transparency in financialmarkets.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has also been deeply involved in effortsto reduce foreign exchange settlement risk -- efforts that should further serve to improve marketefficiency and overall financial stability. In October 1994, the New York Fed-sponsored ForeignExchange Committee issued a major report on “Reducing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk.”The Bank has also been working actively in this area with other central banks through the G-10central bank Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, or CPSS, which I have had thepleasure to chair in recent years. Building upon the work of the New York Foreign ExchangeCommittee, the CPSS published a document in March of last year, often referred to as theAllsopp report, that contains a comprehensive strategy outlining how the public and privatesectors can work together to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. The strategy was endorsedby the G-10 central bank governors and calls for specific action on the part of individual banksand industry groups.A survey conducted by the CPSS last autumn indicates that individual banks areanswering the G-10 governors’ call for action. Many banks have made a good start in improvingtheir ability to measure, manage, control, and net their bilateral settlement exposures, and theyplan to push these efforts even further over the next year. While this is a very encouragingbeginning, we can’t ignore the fact that more work must be done by individual banks. With thisin mind, the CPSS will continue to closely monitor progress over the next year for any signs ofslippage.BIS Review   60/1997
- 5 -The search by individual banks for efficient ways to reduce their foreignexchange settlement risk has brought about important progress at the industry-group level aswell. The Allsopp report noted the efforts of FXNET, S.W.I.F.T, ECHO, Multinet, and theGroup of 20 banks to offer various types of risk-reducing services, and these ongoing efforts arevery encouraging. Some banks are also exploring the elimination of settlement risk altogether byshifting the market to trades that simply settle the gain or loss associated with exchange ratemovements -- called “contracts for difference” -- instead of requiring delivery of the underlyingcurrencies.We are well aware that many market participants are currently debating whatconstitutes the most efficient multi-currency netting and settlement services. While there will bepotential winners and losers, I believe that the market as a whole should ultimately benefit fromthis rigorous competition. At the same time, settlement risk reduction should not be used tojustify the concentration of market power. The G-10 central bank governors have long been onrecord in favor of fair and open access to services that permit participation by a broad range ofinstitutions, consistent with the prudent management of risk. Such access was formally adoptedas a requirement for multilateral netting systems, and I am convinced that the G-10 central bankswould apply a similar standard when evaluating the start-up of any major multi-currencysettlement service.In sum, the evolution toward more transparent foreign exchange markets thatwe’ve observed in the past several years is largely a product of both technological progress inthe private sector and conscious policy decisions in the public sector. None of the policydecisions, I should stress, were taken with any explicit or implicit intention of reducing marketvolatility. On the contrary, the policy community has viewed moves toward increasedtransparency as desirable ends in and of themselves for a number of reasons.For one, transparency promotes a more level playing field for all marketparticipants. In other words, transparent markets tend not to be dominated by just a few players.Rather, they are open to new entrants, large and small. In such markets, no one group ofinstitutions or type of institution can develop a monopoly on information or competitive pricing.As in most industries, competition in the area of financial services spurs innovation, betterservice for customers, and a more efficient allocation of resources.Second, transparency in these markets also promotes investment. If money andinvestment fund managers or corporate CFOs can better understand the risks entailed in variousinvestment alternatives, they are more likely to make the investment decisions best suited totheir needs. The result, again, is a more efficient allocation of global capital than wouldotherwise be possible.To the extent, therefore, that reduced volatility in the foreign exchange marketstems from improved transparency, I would view this result as a beneficial by-product -- onethat also contributes to the ultimate goal of economic and monetary policy: namely, sustainedgrowth and a stable price environment.The move toward increased transparency in global markets and the accompanyingrelative decline in foreign exchange market volatility and trading ranges that we have observedin the last year and a half have posed considerable challenges to market makers, spot traders, andbrokers, on both an institutional and a personal level. There is an axiom in these markets thatvolatility is good for market makers. I believe that this is a short-sighted view. On the contrary, IBIS Review   60/1997
- 6 -would submit that excessive volatility not only frightens investors, but also potentiallyundermines growth and, in so doing, benefits none of us.As a result, I cannot help but conclude that stable -- and not volatile -- markets arein the best interests of both central banks and the financial community. Stability in foreignexchange and other financial markets, along with price stability, is vital to the promotion ofsustainable economic growth and rising living standards for everyone. Reducing the diversion ofresources to deal with uncertainty and volatility allows resources to be directed toward moreproductive uses and, in so doing, promotes long-term growth by increasing the resource baseavailable to the economy.We have seen in high-inflation economies how the transfer of resources awayfrom productive activities and into financial transactions geared toward dealing with inflationuncertainty can negatively affect growth. We have also seen how a proliferation of tax codedodges can decrease the available resource base. If individuals must spend more time engagingin financial maneuvers because of uncertainty, then more of the economy’s productive capacityis transferred to the activity of handling transactions. An expansion of the financial sector thatstems from an increasing number of people employed to handle distortions arising from inflationand its attendant uncertainty is growth that diverts resources better employed elsewhere. Bycontrast, an expansion of the financial sector that stems from growth of productivity is growththat offers benefits to all.The same basic principle applies to the foreign exchange market. Foreignexchange rates are fundamentally determined by market forces and should be free to fluctuate asa vital adjustment mechanism for the global economy. However, excessive volatility, like priceinstability, can diminish resources otherwise available for productive growth. The economy inwhich we live and work is a global one, and becomes more so every year. Regions and industriesin need of private capital and investors requiring adequate returns benefit when money can moveacross national boundaries without excessive risk or hedging costs. Foreign exchange marketsthat are more stable and more transparent ultimately will better allow investors to allocate theircapital efficiently, thereby improving global economic growth.Change is difficult in any industry and can put enormous stress on individuals.I’m not ignoring this dynamic. However, I am persuaded that, in the long run, what is good foreconomic growth is in the best interests of the financial community, and, in turn, benefits theindividuals that make up that community. Just as U.S. industries went through enormous stressin the 1970s and 1980s in coping with a new era of expanding international trade and emerged inthe 1990s as among the most competitive in the world, so too must global financial institutionsadapt and find new ways to add value and share in the larger benefits that transparency andreduced volatility can bring.We central bankers can contribute to this process. While we can do little to limitmarket volatility directly, we can work toward more transparent markets supported by soundinfrastructure, and by these means lay the groundwork for market stability. And, while we’re notin the business of determining market rates or the ranges in which rates should trade, what weare trying to do is move increasingly toward improving the transparency of our own operationsas an end in and of itself.Our collective efforts, along with developments in information technology andrisk management techniques, have already contributed to improved market stability. Thegrowing, and successful, commitment of central banks to the achievement of price stability asBIS Review   60/1997
- 7 -their primary goal is another crucial and positive contribution toward market stability.Moreover, where we as central banks see gaps that develop in the global financial system, as wedid in the areas of market risk and settlement risk management, we play the role of facilitator toprivate sector solutions. As central bankers, we tend to view our role in the global financialmarkets as ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to promote well-functioningmarkets for all players. Then we step aside and let the markets take care of themselves.BIS Review   60/1997
Mr. Thiessen looks at flexible exchange rates in a world of low inflationRemarks by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Gordon Thiessen, to the FOREX ’97Conference held in Toronto on 30/5/97.There is a good deal of discussion these days about Economic and MonetaryUnion (EMU) in Europe -- about the benefits and difficulties of organizing such a union.However, today I would like to examine a somewhat different issue, one that is at the other endof the spectrum; namely, How is the international system of flexible exchange rates workingthese days?This is not to denigrate or deny the importance of the challenges surrounding theEMU initiative, nor its relevance for those who will be directly or indirectly affected by itsdebut. But while many European countries have operated under a fixed exchange rate regimeduring the post-Bretton Woods period, most other industrial economies have chosen to operateunder a flexible currency arrangement. The three major currencies, those of the United States,Japan, and Germany, float against one another. So I thought what I might do this morning isfocus on flexible exchange rates and discuss, in particular, how they have performed over thepast few years.The main message I would like to convey to you is that, when all is said anddone, the flexible exchange rate system has not done badly over the past 25 years. And in thelast three or four years, it has done rather well in an environment characterized by low inflationand improved fiscal performance across the major industrial countries. Exchange rates have, forthe most part, moved in the “right direction.” And short-run exchange rate volatility hasdiminished, notwithstanding some evident cyclical swings of the U.S. dollar.Why are the major currencies floating?The initial reason for adopting floating exchange rates was more a matter ofcircumstance than a considered choice. The Bretton Woods system, which was establishedshortly after the Second World War, collapsed in the early 1970s, forcing most industrialcountries onto a flexible exchange rate regime as an “interim measure.” Attempts to rescue theBretton Woods system in the summer of 1971 and the fall of 1973 proved unsuccessful.The reputed reasons for the collapse of the system were the inflationarymacropolicies pursued by the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s and theunwillingness of other countries either to inflate their economies to the same extent or to allowthe U.S. dollar to devalue. But the true reasons for its demise were more deep-seated. Thissystem, which had been viable, although prone to periodic crises, throughout the 1950s and1960s, was clearly unable to cope in a world of liberalized trade and international capitalThe main problem was that the imbalances that the system was supposed toaddress, through discrete changes in the parity value of the affected currencies vis-à-vis the U.S.dollar and gold, proved to be much larger and more intractable than the architects of the systemhad ever envisaged. Moreover, countries were reluctant to adjust their currencies, even when theproblems were shown to be fundamental. Thus, authorities would often subvert domesticeconomic objectives, such as price stability, economic growth and full employment, in order toprotect outdated parities. As a result, the system was in disequilibrium more often than not. Andits adjustable nature did not prove flexible enough to help countries deal with the shocks thatregularly hit the international financial system.BIS Review   57/1997
- 2 -While the adoption of floating exchange rates may have been more a matter ofnecessity than choice, floating rates did promise greater independence in the conduct ofmonetary policy and better insulation from external shocks. Advocates of a floating regime,partly influenced by Canada’s favourable experience with such a system in the 1950s, suggestedthat exchange rates would automatically adjust to correct external imbalances in an orderly andcontinuous manner. And this would give domestic policymakers greater freedom than under thepegged rate system as well as obviate the need for official intervention and large internationalreserves.Experience with the floating rate systemNeedless to say, experience under the floating rate system has not beenproblem-free. Events did not unfold quite as its proponents had suggested, and the past 25 yearshave been characterized by volatile short-term movements and sizable long-term swings in mostof the major currencies.The magnitude of these currency movements and our evident inability to explainthem in a comprehensive, precise manner, led many observers to presume that such movementswere driven by market speculation and that they were largely disconnected from economicfundamentals.There is no simple way to resolve this issue. Nonetheless, it is possible to identifysome of the forces that have influenced exchange rates through this period, either by shapingtheir broad movements or, at times, by contributing to uncertainty and hence to excessivevolatility in these rates. I would stress, in particular, the uncertainty over the future course ofmonetary and fiscal policies, which made it difficult for financial markets to cope with themacroeconomic pressures of the day.What forces am I talking about? In the 1970s, we had the two oil shocks, one atthe beginning and one at the end of the decade. These may have been precipitated by politicaldevelopments in the Middle East, but the initial shock was encouraged by the pursuit, among themajor industrial countries, of higher output and employment through monetary ease and awillingness to tolerate increased inflation. Subsequently, the monetary accommodation of theprice effects caused by the oil shocks added to the turbulent environment that followed. The1970s and early 1980s turned out to be a period of high and variable inflation in many countries.High inflation, balance-of-payments difficulties arising from the oil shocks, andthe large fiscal transfers necessary to support economic activity in energy-dependent countries,were the catalyst for much of what followed in the 1980s. Excessive government spending andrising public indebtedness were coupled with tighter monetary policy, as authorities struggled tomaintain social services, restore full employment, and dampen the inflationary pressures that hadbeen allowed to grow in the 1970s. The effects of this uncomfortable policy mix hit the majorindustrial countries with varying severity and triggered a debt crisis in the developing world.Success on the inflation front was mixed, adding to the strains that the exchange rate system wasexpected to cope with.While the problems in the industrial countries were generally less severe thanthose in the developing world, they nevertheless caused serious dislocations. Because ofdifferences in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies in the United States compared withGermany and Japan, the U.S. dollar appreciated sharply against the deutschemark and the yenthrough the first part of the 1980s. In turn, these developments led to an accumulation of veryBIS Review   57/1997
- 3 -large current account imbalances among these three major countries. In these circumstances, theflexible exchange rate system did not perform as well as it might have. But it is not obvious thatany other alternative would have been practicable, and I doubt very much that a fixed exchangerate system for the U.S. dollar, the mark, and the yen could have survived these strains.The three major currencies were not the only ones subjected to tensions.Uncertainty about whether and how fiscal imbalances might be corrected, and considerablecross-country differences in actual and expected inflation contributed to major exchange ratepressures among other currencies in the 1980s and early 1990s. By 1992-93, these pressures hadreached the breaking point in continental Europe and the United Kingdom, putting extremestress on the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). As well as causing the United Kingdom andItaly to leave the arrangement, the situation necessitated a widening of the ERM interventionbands.What is the current situation?Although it is still early days, conditions in exchange and asset markets haveimproved considerably since 1993. Short-term exchange rate volatility, and even the trendmovements in bilateral rates, while still significant, are much smaller than those of the previoustwo decades.I believe that this improved perfomance has a lot to do with the convergence wehave seen in recent years towards low and stable rates of inflation among the major industrialcountries. But progress on the fiscal front has also been essential, helping to reduce riskpremiums and stabilize expectations, both with regard to the long-run viability of the fiscal trackin many countries and the prospects for continued low inflation.Thus, I would argue that consistently low inflation and improved fiscal positionshave brought about more stable, “better behaved” exchange rates, just as theory would havepredicted. This is not to say that exchange rates have remained absolutely stable over the pastfour years. They have not. But movements have been more orderly, unlike those of the earlierperiods, and most of the observed trends can be explained by the different cyclical positions ofcountries, the different monetary and fiscal responses, and by changes in world commodityprices.Exchange rate movements have, at times, appeared to contribute to tradeimbalances or exacerbate existing ones. But this should not be interpreted as evidence thatmarkets are pushing rates in the wrong direction. Indeed, imbalances often reflect the fact thateconomies are at different points of the business cycle. For example, Japan has, until veryrecently, seen the value of its currency decline, on balance, against the U.S. dollar, even thoughthe country is running a large and growing trade surplus. It is obvious that much of the recentmovement in the U.S. dollar/yen exchange rate has been driven by the different cyclicalpositions of the two countries. Thus, the relatively low yen has been helping to rejuvenatedemand in Japan. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar has been helping the United States to counterinflationary pressures that would otherwise require stronger doses of interest-rate medicine.Of course, it is possible for exchange rates to overreact, even in the benignenvironment I described a moment ago. But the chances of a serious misalignment are muchlower when markets are operating in a climate of greater predictability, provided by a monetarypolicy grounded in domestic price stability. When exchange rates are not anchored by a credibleBIS Review   57/1997
- 4 -commitment to price stability, it is difficult, if not impossible, for markets to perform the tasksthat are expected of them.The operation of the flexible exchange rate system in CanadaAs you know, Canada has been one of the strongest proponents of a flexibleexchange rate system. We were the only major industrial country to operate under such a systemin the 1950s and early 1960s, and we were the first major country to adopt it again in the 1970s.As a medium-sized open economy that relies on exports of primary commodities more than ourprincipal trading partners, we are vulnerable to external shocks and appreciate the ”shockabsorber” effect provided by a flexible exchange rate.Let me tell you briefly how the Canadian economy has performed under theflexible exchange rate system and describe the main forces that have been acting on ourexchange rate. The most significant trend movement occurred over the 1976 to 1986 period,when the Canadian dollar experienced a large depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, falling fromroughly parity to a low of 69 cents (U.S.) in February 1986. During this time, annual inflationrates in Canada exceeded those in the United States by about one per cent, on average. While ona yearly basis this may not sound like much, cumulatively the differential was rather significantand can explain most of the trend depreciation in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate over thisperiod.As for the cyclical swings that accompanied the trend depreciation of theCanadian dollar, they reflected a number of factors. Among these, the most significant has beenthe variability in the world prices of primary commodities, which remain an importantcomponent of our exports. But the most worrisome factor during the 1980s and 1990s was thegrowth of the fiscal deficit and the destabilizing effect that this had on financial markets,including the foreign exchange market. Rising public debts and deficits contributed importantlyto the risk premiums in interest rates on Canadian dollar assets and were the catalyst, if not thecause, of unsettling episodes in 1986, 1992, and 1994. Fiscal policy concerns, at times coupledwith political uncertainty, proved to be a volatile mix and led to serious financial marketturbulence and speculative pressures, complicating the task of monetary policy.Fortunately, the situation has recently improved considerably. Inflation in Canadais stable, at its lowest level in decades. And it has been somewhat below that in the United Statessince 1992. This implies a potential appreciation of the Canadian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollarover time, if the inflation differential persists.But other factors also tend to favour a stronger Canadian dollar. First, deficitreduction by Canadian governments has eased the uncertainty that had pervaded financialmarkets, thereby shrinking risk premiums in interest rates and reversing the currency weaknesscaused earlier by these premiums. Second, Canadian industries are in a stronger competitiveposition than they have been for years, and this has contributed to a sharp reduction of thepersistent deficit in the current account of our international balance of payments. Third, primarycommodity prices are firm and likely to move higher with the pickup in global economicactivity.In light of all this, it is not surprising that several analysts, as well as the Bank ofCanada, expect a stronger Canadian dollar in the future and think that the currency is currentlyundervalued relative to its longer-term fundamentals.BIS Review   57/1997
- 5 -Why, then, has the Canadian dollar not been stronger? The explanation liesmainly in the different cyclical positions of the Canadian and U.S. economies. The moreaccommodative monetary conditions pursued in Canada during the past two years have beenconsistent with the needs of an economy characterized by considerable excess capacity and aninflation rate that has tended to be in the lower half of the current 1 to 3 per cent target range.Thus, lower interest rates and a relatively low Canadian dollar have been temporarilyappropriate for economic reasons.While no central bank ever wishes to have a weak currency, since late 1995, theBank of Canada has encouraged easier monetary conditions -- conditions that, at times, havetaken the form of lower interest rates and a somewhat softer dollar. Put another way, the Bankdid not purposely push the dollar lower, but simply aimed for the path of monetary conditionsthat seemed appropriate given sluggish domestic economic conditions. The particular mix ofinterest rate and exchange rate adjustments necessary to achieve the desired path of monetaryconditions is not under the direct control of the Bank of Canada. It is essentially determined bythe markets.However, the Canadian economy has been gathering momentum lately, andprospects are good for continued robust expansion through 1997 and into 1998, in response tothe substantial past monetary easing. With the margin of excess capacity in the economy stillfairly wide, there is ample room for strong growth in coming quarters without a resurgence ofinflation. However, as the slack is absorbed, the Bank will need to pursue less stimulativemonetary conditions, consistent with a durable, low-inflation economic expansion.In other words, for cyclical as well as for more fundamental reasons, theprospects are good for a stronger Canadian currency.***************In summary, I would say that the exchange market for the Canadian dollar hasworked rather well in recent years, interpreting and responding to both the fundamental trends inour economy and the cyclical differences between Canada and the United States. I believe thatfiscal discipline and a credible commitment to low inflation are key ingredients of that goodperformance.BIS Review   57/1997
Mr. Meyer looks at the role of US banks in small business finance  Remarksby Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Conference on Small Business Finance held at the Leonard N. Stern School ofBusiness, Berkley Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and New York University Salomon Centerin New York on 23/5/97.It is a pleasure to be here to meet with you at New York University for thisConference on Small Business Finance. It is clear from the conference program that there is anexcellent mix of academics, government representatives, and practitioners here to study howsmall business is financed. Indeed, I am glad to see so much attention being paid to thisimportant topic. Small business is a vital and energetic part of our economy that plays a key rolein the generation of jobs, new ideas, and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity. Withoutdoubt, a thriving small business sector contributes to the well-being of our nation.Today, I would like to share with you some thoughts about the role of banks insupplying credit to small business. The part played by banks in small business finance is not anew topic for the Federal Reserve. In fact, for many years we have been devoting substantialresources to collecting and analyzing data on small business finance generally, and the creditsupplied by banks in particular. We collect data from small businesses on how they obtainfinancing -- or in some cases fail to obtain financing -- using the National Survey of SmallBusiness Finance and the Survey of Consumer Finances. We also gather information directly onthe small business credit extended by individual commercial banks. We have collectedinformation on the contract terms of bank loans to both small and large businesses since 1977through the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business. Since 1993, the banking agencieshave required all commercial banks to report their quantities of loans to businesses by size ofloan on the June Call Reports. Lastly, as part of revised Community Reinvestment Actprocedures, the banking agencies have just this year begun to collect data on small businessloans by local geographic area. When these data become available, they should prove to be arich source of new information.A number of economists have used the existing data in research that has helped usto better understand the potential effects on the supply of small business credit of public policiesregarding bank mergers and acquisitions, financial modernization, and prudential supervisionmay be reducing the supply of credit to small business, since larger banking institutions tend todevote smaller proportions of their assets to small business lending. Solid economic researchapplying modern econometric techniques to accurate data is needed to evaluate such claims andto determine the likely effects of policy actions in order to improve future policy decisions.The Importance of the Bank-Small Business RelationshipAccording to our survey information, commercial banks are the single mostimportant source of external credit to small firms. Small businesses rely on banks not just for areliable supply of credit, but for transactions and deposit services as well. Because of their needsfor banking services on both the asset and liability sides of their balance sheets, small businessestypically enter into relationships with nearby banks. The data show, for example, that 85 percentof small businesses use the services of a commercial bank within 30 miles of their firm, and thatsmall businesses typically obtain multiple different services from their local bank. The 30 milesactually overstates the distance that small businesses are willing to travel for most of their basicfinancial services. For example, the median distances from a small business’ offices to theBIS Review   57/1997
- 2 -institutions where it obtains deposit, credit, or financial management services are all 5 miles orless.One of the reasons why the banking relationship is so important to small businessfinance is that banks can efficiently gain valuable information on a small business over thecourse of their relationship, and then use this information to help make pricing and creditdecisions. The financial conditions of small firms are usually rather opaque to investors, and thecosts of issuing securities directly to the public are prohibitive for most small firms. Thus,without financial intermediaries like banks it would simply be too costly for most investors tolearn the information needed to provide the credit, and too costly for the small firm to issue thecredit itself. Banks, performing the classic functions of financial intermediaries, solve theseproblems by producing information about borrowers and monitoring them over time, by settingloan contract terms to improve borrower incentives, by renegotiating the terms if and when theborrower is in financial difficulty, and by diversifying the risks across many small businesscredits.Some recent empirical research suggests that this characterization of thebank-small business borrower relationship is accurate. For example, as the relationship matures,banks typically reduce the interest rates charged and often drop the collateral requirements onsmall business loans. In short, the bank-borrower relationship appears to be an efficient meansfor overcoming information and cost problems in small firm finance, and for allowingfundamentally creditworthy small firms to finance sound projects that might otherwise gounfunded.One implication of the importance of the bank-small business relationship is thatit may impose limits on the migration of small business finance out of the banking sector. Overthe last two decades, many large business loans left the banking sector as improvements ininformation technology, increased use of statistical techniques in applied finance, and theglobalization of financial markets have allowed nonbank and foreign bank competitors to gainmarket share over U.S. banks. For example, over the 1980s and first half of the 1990s, the shareof total U.S. nonfarm, nonfinancial corporate debt held by U.S. banks fell by about one-quarterfrom 19.6 percent to 14.5 percent. Banks compensated somewhat for these on-balance sheetreductions in a variety of ways. Many banks expanded their participation in off-balance sheetback-up lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and the securitization and sale of some largeloans. Other adaptations included a shift in focus toward fee-based services and derivativesactivities.The types of developments that might similarly reduce bank market share in smallbusiness lending are proceeding rather slowly at present, but may accelerate in the future.Improvements in analytical and information technologies such as credit scoring may decreasethe cost of lending to small businesses and make it easier for nonbank lenders to enter thismarket. These developments are already contributing to more competition for small businessloans within the banking industry and between bank and nonbank lenders. Similarly, asignificant secondary market for securitization of loans to some small businesses may develop inthe future. Those small businesses among current bank borrowers whose information problemsare the least severe -- that is, those that are the least informationally opaque -- would presumablybe the most likely to be funded outside of the banking system.Nevertheless, no matter how many advances there are in information processingand no matter how sophisticated financial markets may become, there will likely remain asignificant role for bank-borrower relationship lending to solve the information and otherBIS Review   57/1997
- 3 -financing problems of small businesses. That is, in the foreseeable future it seems very likelythat there will remain many small business borrowers with sufficient problems that only bankinformation gathering, monitoring, and financing can overcome, although this group ofborrowers will almost surely differ somewhat from current relationship borrowers. Astechnology and markets improve to the point that some relatively transparent small businessborrowers can be financed outside the bank, other, more opaque potential borrowers thatpreviously had information and other problems too serious for even a bank loan will enter thebank intermediation process. Put another way, the relationship lending process will fund smallbusiness borrowers with increasingly difficult information problems as the technology forresolving these problems improves. In my view, this should only increase the efficiency and thecompetitiveness of small business finance. For example, the improved ability of banks to lend tomore opaque borrowers should provide some increased competition for the venture capitalistsand angel financiers that were discussed at the conference yesterday.The value of gathering information through the relationship between banks andsmall businesses also bodes well for the survival of small community-based banks that tend tospecialize in these relationships. Most forecasts of the future of the U.S. banking industry predictthat thousands of small banks will survive. I hasten to point out that these are not my personalforecasts. I stick to predicting interest rates, GDP growth, and inflation -- items over which Ihave more control and inside information -- and I leave the banking forecasts to others! But theforecast of thousands of small banks continuing to operate and do well makes sense to me. Theyhave information advantages, knowhow, and local community orientations that are hard toduplicate in large organizations.The importance of relationship lending to small business also raises prudentialconcerns about bank risk taking. When a bank fails, the losses to society exceed the book valuesinvolved because of the loss of the value of the bank’s customer relationships. Even if smallbusiness borrowers are able to find financing after their bank fails, it may be at a higher interestrate and with additional collateral requirements until the new bank has had a chance to learnabout the borrower’s condition and prospects. When many banks fail during a crisis, this cancreate a credit crunch or significant reduction in the supply of credit to bank-dependent smallbusiness borrowers. For example, research on the Great Depression suggests that the loss ofbank-borrower relationships in the 1930s may have deepened and prolonged the economicdownturn. More recently, it appears that the weak capital positions of many banks in the late1980s and early 1990s, not to mention the outright failure of over 1,100 banks during thisperiod, contributed importantly to the sharp slowdown in bank commercial lending during theearly 1990s. While the ability of small businesses to find alternative sources of funds isconsiderably greater today than in the 1930s, and will likely be even greater in the future than itwas in the early 1990s, such arguments do reinforce the importance of the connection betweenmacroeconomic and bank supervisory policy.Financial Modernization and Bank Small Business LendingIn the remainder of my remarks, I will touch on three additional concerns aboutthe potential effects of financial modernization on the supply of bank credit to small business. Iwill first discuss the effects of increases in market concentration created by bank mergers andacquisitions within a local market; second, the effects of consolidation of the banking industry asa whole; and third, the possible impacts of the increased complexity of financial service firms inwhich banking and other organizations may provide a multitude of traditional banking andnonbanking services.BIS Review   57/1997
- 4 -At the outset, I would emphasize that the overriding public policy concernregarding these issues is not the quantity of small business lending, but rather economicefficiency. If some banks are issuing loans to finance negative net present value projects, thensuch loans should be discouraged. If consolidation of the banking industry or the increasedcomplexity of financial services firms reduces such lending, then economic efficiency ispromoted by freeing up those resources to be invested elsewhere, even though the supply ofsmall business credit to these borrowers is reduced. Similarly, a lack of competition or poorcorporate control may currently be keeping some positive net present value loans from beingmade. If modernization increases the supply of loans to creditworthy small business borrowersto pursue financially sound projects, then economic efficiency is also raised as the supply ofcredit to these small businesses rises.Antitrust analysis in banking has typically been based on the concentration ofbank deposits in local markets like Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or non-MSA ruralcounties. Under the traditional “cluster approach,” small business loans and other products areassumed to be competitive on approximately the same basis as bank deposits in local markets.While on-going technological and institutional changes seem likely to erode the usefulness ofthis assumption over time, evidence continues to generally support this assumption. As I notedearlier, small businesses typically get their loans and other financial services from a local bank.Additional research finds that the concentration of the local banking market is a key determinantof the rates that are charged on small business loans. For example, it is estimated that smallbusiness borrowers in the most concentrated markets pay rates about 50 to 150 basis pointshigher than those in the least concentrated markets. This exceeds estimates of the effects of localmarket concentration on retail deposit rates of about 50 basis points.Research has also suggested that high local-market deposit concentration maylead to reduced managerial efficiency, as the price cushion provided by market power allows a“quiet life” for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable. Managers inthese concentrated markets may choose to work less hard or pursue their own personal interestsbecause the lower rates on deposits and higher rates on small business loans raise profits enoughto cover for inefficient or self-serving practices.These findings support the need to maintain competition in local banking marketsto deter the exercise of market power in pricing consumer deposits and small business loans, andto ensure that the local banks are under sufficient competitive pressure that they are operated in areasonably efficient way.When bank mergers and acquisitions involve banks operating in different localmarkets, the issues raised are typically quite different from those I have just discussed. Since thelate 1970s, states have been liberalizing laws that previously restricted mergers and acquisitionsbetween banks in different local markets, including allowing holding company acquisitionsacross state lines. The U.S. banking industry has responded strongly and has been consolidatingat a rapid rate over the last 15 years. Consolidation has picked up even more in the first half ofthe 1990s -- each year bank mergers have involved about 20 percent of industry assets. Thistrend is likely to continue or accelerate under the Riegle-Neal Act, which has already allowedincreased interstate banking, and which will allow interstate branching into almost all states thissummer.Importantly, an increase in local market concentration is not a major issue in mostof these mergers and acquisitions, as they are primarily of the market-extension type. As such,these consolidations, and sometimes merely the threat of such actions, may be pro-competitiveBIS Review   57/1997
- 5 -and reduce the market power of local banks over depositors and small business borrowers in themarkets that are invaded. They may also improve the diversification and efficiency of theconsolidating institutions. Research generally suggests that most mergers and acquisitions, byimproving diversification, allow the consolidating institutions to make more loans and improvetheir profit efficiency.Mostly as a result of these mergers and acquisitions, the mean size of bankingorganizations has approximately doubled in real terms in the last 15 years. As I mentionedearlier, a frequently voiced concern about this consolidation is whether the supply of credit tosmall business may be decreased, since larger banking institutions tend to devote smallerproportions of their assets to small business lending. To illustrate, banks with under $100 millionin assets devote about 9 percent of their assets to small business lending on average, whereasbanks with over $10 billion in assets invest only about 2 percent of assets in these loans.While such a simplistic analysis may sound appealing on the surface, it is clearlyincomplete. It neglects the fundamental nature of mergers and acquisitions as dynamic eventsthat may involve significant changes in the business focus of the consolidating institutions. Thatis, banks get involved in mergers and acquisitions because they want to do something different,not simply behave like a larger bank.The simplistic comparison of the lending patterns of large and small banks alsoignores the reactions of other lenders in the same local markets. Other existing or even new localbanks or nonbank lenders might pick up any profitable loans that are no longer supplied by theconsolidated banking institutions. These other institutions may also react to M&As with theirown dynamic changes in focus that could either increase or decrease their supplies of smallbusiness loans. Thus, even if merging institutions reduce their own supplies of small businessloans substantially, the total supply of these loans in the local market need not decline.There have been a number of recent studies of these dynamic effects of bankmergers and acquisitions, some of which we heard about this morning. The results suggest thatthe dynamic effects of mergers and acquisitions are much more complex and heterogenous thanwould be suggested by the increased sizes of the consolidating institutions alone. For example,mergers of small and medium-sized banks appear to be associated with increases in smallbusiness lending by the merging banks, whereas mergers of large banks may be associated withdecreases in small business lending by the participants.On average, mergers appear to reduce small business lending by the participants,but this decline appears to be offset in part or in whole by an increase in lending by other banksin the same local market. These other banks may pick up profitable loans that are dropped bymerging institutions, or otherwise have dynamic reactions that increase their supplies of smallbusiness lending. Moreover, these results do not include the potential for increased lending bynonbank firms. The bottom line is that small business loan markets seem to work quite well.Creditworthy borrowers with financially sound projects seem to receive financing, although theysometimes have to bear the short-term switching costs, such as temporarily higher loan rates andcollateral requirements, of changing banks after their institutions merge. On-going technologicalchange in small business lending should only help to improve the efficiency of this process.Again, I would emphasize that it is not the quantity of small business loanssupplied that is most important, but rather the economic efficiency with which the marketchooses which small businesses receive credit. To the extent that mergers and acquisitions arepro-competitive and improve corporate control and efficiency, the supply of credit to someBIS Review   57/1997
- 6 -borrowers with negative net present value projects may be reduced, as it should be. That is, theprotection from competition provided by interstate and intrastate barriers may have allowedsome firms with market power to be inefficient or make uneconomic loans. Similarly, anyimprovement in competition and efficiency may increase the supply of credit to borrowers withpositive net present value projects that inefficient lenders previously did not fund. In either ofthese cases, economic efficiency is improved.As promised, the final issue I will discuss is that aspect of the modernization offinancial markets in which financial service firms are likely to become more complex, providingmore types of financial services within the same organization. At the present time, we do notknow if and when the Glass-Steagall Act will be repealed, whether nontraditional activities willbe provided by bank subsidiaries or bank holding company affiliates, and in which activitiesbanking organizations will be allowed to engage or choose to engage. However, similar to thearguments regarding consolidation of the banking industry, concern is sometimes expressed thatsmall business borrowers may receive less credit from these larger, more complex financialinstitutions.There is much less research evidence available regarding the potential effects onsmall business lending of this type of financial modernization than there is about theconsolidation of the banking industry, so my remarks here are substantially more speculative.However, I believe there are several reasons for optimism regarding adequate supplies ofservices to creditworthy small businesses. First, a limited amount of research suggests that thereis little if any effect of the current organizational complexity of U.S. banks on their treatment ofsmall businesses, other things equal. In particular, banking organizations with multiple layers ofmanagement, those that operate in multiple states, those with Section 20 securities affiliates, andthose with other organizational complexities tend to charge about as much for small businesscredit as other banks of their same size. Second, the research results for the consolidation ofbanks alone suggest that if profitable loans are dropped by the newer universal-like banks, othersmall banks or nonbank firms will be standing by to pick up these loans. Finally, the additionalinsurance, securities underwriting, or other financial services provided by the new institutionsshould provide greater opportunities for small businesses to have access to these nontraditionalservices.I want to leave time for questions, so let me conclude with a few summarycomments. It is gratifying to see all of this attention being paid to the financing of smallbusiness, which is a vital part of our economy, and the Federal Reserve is working actively tostay abreast of the issues with its data collection and research efforts. Small businesses tend torely on banks for their credit needs and other financial services, and relationships between banksand small businesses are important and efficient means of distributing these services. Whiletechnological and institutional changes are and undoubtedly will in the future affect theserelationships, it seems unlikely that the core bank-small business relationship will be replaced.The continued heavy dependence of small businesses on local banks also suggests an on-goingneed for bank supervisors to be sensitive to antitrust issues when considering mergers andacquisitions of banks in the same local market. In contrast, cross-market mergers rarely raiseantitrust concerns; indeed, such mergers can be quite pro-competitive. Finally, while someobservers have argued that banking consolidation and other aspects of the modernization of thebanking industry and financial markets raise concerns about the supply of credit to smallbusiness, the market for small business loans in fact seems to work rather well. If there is amerger or other event that reduces the supply of profitable loans to small businesses, other banksseem to step in and provide this credit, and there is every reason to expect that such responseswill continue in the future.BIS Review   57/1997
Mr. Yam looks at Asian banking in a regional and global context  Address bythe Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Joseph C.K. Yam, at theADB-IIF Forum on Developing Asian Financial Markets held in Fukuoka, Japan, on 10/5/97.I am pleased to be here this morning to address you on the subject of Asianbanking in a regional and global context. I will be speaking particularly about banks in the EastAsia region.The importance of banking stability2. There is increasing international recognition of the importance of a soundbanking system in promoting macroeconomic stability, sustainable economic growth and theefficient intermediation between savings and investment. The last few months have seen a seriesof initiatives by international financial institutions and groupings to devise principles, standardsand strategies for the promotion of financial stability. While these initiatives have been directedprincipally at emerging markets, they also have application to the more developed marketswhich have been by no means immune from banking problems in recent years. A number ofAsian economies, including Hong Kong, have participated in this work. This is a practicalrecognition that the setting of international regulatory standards must be a broadly-basedprocess, in keeping with the global nature of today’s financial markets.3. I do not need to belabour the point about the debilitating and disruptive effectswhich banking problems can have on economic and monetary management. The need to restorethe capital of failed banks can impose a heavy fiscal burden. In many cases this has amounted to10% or more of GDP. Monetary policy may be side-tracked by the need on the part of theauthorities when determining interest rates to take account of the possible implications onbanking stability and on other, often more political, policy objectives.4. Furthermore, in nursing weak banks, the main priority for these banks is likelyto be to repair the damage to their balance sheets and they may have little appetite for newlending. This leads to the “credit crunch” phenomenon where even good-quality borrowers findit more difficult to obtain loans when banking stability has been undermined. As the Japaneseexperience has shown, this weakened ability of banks to lend can frustrate the authorities’ effortsto get the economy moving again after a downturn.The role of bank borrowing in funding growth5. This possible impairment of the intermediation role of banks would be aparticular cause for concern in Asia where the banks have played a substantial role in financingeconomic growth. By the standards of developed economies, this role for banks in Asia issignificantly more important than that of other channels of financial intermediation. This partlyreflects the lack of highly developed bond markets in the region, which in itself is also areflection of the predominance of the banks.6. Let me digress a little in this connection. There is clear consensus on the needfor encouraging the development of bond markets in Asia. Like a number of other central banks,we in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have taken a number of initiatives in this direction inHong Kong in recent years. We now have a fairly liquid bond market with a sophisticated butuser-friendly market infrastructure. We have also taken initiatives in the regional dimension topromote the networking of Asian bond markets through encouraging bilateral linkages of debtclearing systems.BIS Review   55/1997
- 2 -7. It is hoped that these efforts could help the expansion of the role of the Asianbond markets and hence facilitate more effective financial intermediation in the domestic,regional and global context. The region’s investment needs over the next decades are huge. TheWorld Bank has estimated that private gross domestic fixed investment will amount to a total ofUS$ 5 trillion over the ten years to the year 2004, a large part of it associated with infrastructuraldevelopment1. The share of bonds in financing these needs is projected to grow from only 9% to26% by 2004.8. I hope this can be realized for this would enable the banks’ role in Asia toconsolidate into more prudent proportions at least in the eyes of the regulators. It would help toachieve a more diversified and therefore a more stable framework for financial intermediation.Indeed, on the World Bank’s projections, the share of bank borrowing is expected to declinecommensurately from 40% to 30% over the same period.9. But turning back to banking in the region, even if this scenario is realized, andthere must of course be much uncertainty on this, the amount that banks would be called upon tofinance would remain very substantial in absolute terms. For the foreseeable future, therefore,the banks will still be playing a key role in mobilizing savings in the region and channeling thisinto investment. And this makes it even more important that banking systems in the regionremain healthy. Of course, foreign banks will play an important financing role, in particularthose based in Hong Kong which is the major centre in the region for the arranging ofsyndicated loans. But within most of the banking systems of the region it is the local bankswhich predominate in terms of share of assets.The position of Asian banks10. So let us take a look at the current position of the Asian banks. It is in factvery difficult to generalize because the banking systems in the region are not homogeneous. Butcertainly if we look at what the World Bank has called the eight “high performing Asiancountries”, the Asian banks have been at the heart of the Asian success story2. This is partly dueto the emphasis laid by governments on trying to ensure the stability of banks, throughprudential supervision and other means, to encourage confidence among savers. While therehave been periods of financial distress in individual banking systems in the region in past years,such incidents have generally been fewer and less severe than in other emerging markets. Asianbanks were able to meet the Basle Committee’s recommended 8% minimum capital adequacyratio with comparative ease. Moreover, despite the fact that barriers to entry in some economieshave protected the Asian banks from the full forces of competition, they have managed tosurvive on lower interest margins and achieve a higher level of operating efficiency than theircounterparts in other regions.11. The Asian banks have of course benefited from operating in the fastestgrowing region in the world, and one where the macroeconomic environment in terms of GDPgrowth, inflation and exchange rates has been much less volatile than in, say, Latin America3.More recently, however, growth in some economies in the region has slowed. I hope that thiswill turn out to be a cyclical, rather than a structural, phenomenon. At any rate, the economicenvironment is currently somewhat less benign, and this has brought into sharper focus some ofthe challenges which banks in the region are now facing.                                                  1The Emerging Asian Bond Market, World Bank 1995.2The East Asian Miracle, World Bank 1993.3BIS Annual Report 1996.BIS Review   55/1997
- 3 -The challenges faced by Asian banks12. Let me attempt to describe what these challenges are. There are obviouslymany, but I will focus on four main categories, namely:global integration of financial markets;financial liberalization and increased competition;maintenance of asset quality;innovation and technological change.Global integration of financial markets13. The trend of global integration of financial markets is clear. The increase incapital flows into the emerging markets has been one of the dominant features of the 1990s.During the period 1990-95, inflows into the Asian economies amounted to US$ 360 billion4.The effect of this has been to bind individual economies even more tightly into the globalmarket place. While this has brought major benefits to the recipient economies in terms ofencouraging increased investment and development of capital markets, it has also left them moreexposed to external shocks and loss of confidence. The macroeconomic instability caused bylarge-scale inflows and by their subsequent reversal will clearly have an adverse impact on thebanking system. The risk of this is less if inflows take the form of more stable longer-term directinvestment. To a significant extent, this has been the case for the Asian economies. But for someeconomies short-term inflows have been relatively large, and there are doubts about theirsustainability.14. Inflows of hot money also create more direct problems for the banks as wellas affecting the macroeconomic environment. In particular, they will tend to add to the liquidityof the banking system and encourage expansion of lending. Rapid growth in lending such as wehave witnessed in a number of Asian economies can be a warning sign because it tends to beassociated with a lowering of credit standards as banks lend to customers whose creditworthinessis more marginal. Moreover, much of this lending may find its way into the property market andstock market, adding to the upward pressure on asset prices arising from the inflows themselves.Reversal of inflows or a slowing down of the economy, as in Thailand, thus exposes the banks toboth credit risk and market risk as asset prices fall.15. With large capital inflows, banks may also find themselves incurringsubstantial net foreign currency liabilities. They will thus additionally be exposed to substantialforeign exchange risks if the domestic currency weakens.Financial liberalization and increased competition16. Associated with, and leading to the global integration of financial markets isthe trend of financial liberalization and increased competition. The trend has increasingly freedbanks from direct controls on interest rates and on their permitted business activities in manyAsian economies. We can see this in banking systems as far apart as those in China where theprocess of commercialization of the banking sector is now underway and in Japan which isplanning its own version of Big Bang in the next few years. This new freedom can bringincreased opportunities for the banks and can be a powerful incentive to increased efficiency in                                                  4International Capital Markets, IMF 1996.BIS Review   55/1997
- 4 -the banking sector. But it can also bring new risks if the banks do not use their new freedomswell - in particular if they do not develop the credit skills and risk management techniques whichare required in the kind of lending boom that may develop after deregulation.17. The pressures on the existing banks is increased if liberalization also allowsnew entrants into the market. Competition in some Asian economies has already intensified as aresult of the granting of new domestic banking licences and more liberal policies on theadmission of foreign banks. The need to meet WTO obligations will give further impetus to thisprocess. But while the long-term impact on the efficiency of the banking system may befavourable, the short-term impact can be to narrow interest margins and erode franchise value.This can drive the local banks to take on more high risk business.18. I should stress, however, that the answer to this dilemma is not to stop orreverse the process of deregulation. There are examples around the region of bad debt problemsembedded in banks which are either owned by the government or, even if they are privatelyowned, have been granting policy loans on behalf of the government. Such banks should beencouraged to develop their own credit judgment in order to play an effective role in the processof credit allocation in the economy. So liberalization is the right approach. It must, however, beproperly handled if the problems of the banking sector are not to intensify during the transitionto a more commercialized system. In particular, the supervisory framework should bestrengthened in advance of liberalization.Maintenance of asset quality19. Let me turn to the challenge of the maintenance of asset quality. This appliesacross a wide spectrum in Asia from banks that are emerging from tight state control to thosethat operate on a fully commercial basis. A particular focus of concern, as I have alreadyindicated, is that banks in some economies may have lent too freely to booming property sectorswhich are now suffering from over-supply. It remains to be seen whether the fears will berealized. A number of supervisory authorities around the region have tried to take measures tolimit their banks’ exposure to the property sector. This is a sensible move, though the difficultiesof enforcing limits should not be underestimated.20. However, property lending is not the only problem area. In Korea, forexample, the slowdown in export demand in industries such as semiconductors and in economicgrowth has exposed fragility in those companies which have over-extended themselves by takingon too much debt. Banks which have become used to years of buoyant economic growth may beill-equipped to deal with these problems. There is also a perception that in some Asianeconomies the accounting rules and loan classification systems are not telling the whole storyabout the scale of the bad debt problem. Lack of transparency can result in delay in tackling theproblem and erode public confidence in the soundness of the banking system.Innovation and technological change21. Asset quality is thus one main issue which Asian banks have to tackle. Butone of the results of globalization is that even banks in relatively undeveloped banking systemsare now having to cope with the challenge of product innovation and new technology. This canaccelerate the transformation of such banking systems: modern computer systems can beinstalled and banks can make the jump straight from cash to smart cards. The downside is thatbanks may have less time to build up the skills properly to use the new technology and the newproducts which their counterparts in developed banking systems have taken many years toBIS Review   55/1997
- 5 -acquire. Derivatives are a case in point. While the derivatives markets in the region other thanTokyo are still quite small, these products are certainly being sold to, and in some cases beingtraded by, local banks in the region; and a number of them have suffered losses as a result.22. Looking further ahead, the opportunities provided by new technology willpose important strategic challenges for the banks. To what extent, for example, should theyinvest in new delivery mechanisms such as telephone or internet banking? These channels offerthe potential to bring down dramatically the cost of transactions compared with the traditionalbranch network. Obviously this will depend on the availability of telephone lines and personalcomputers. There is also the crucial issue of public acceptance of the new technology. Suchissues mean that a wholesale shift to electronic banking will not happen overnight. However,banks would be unwise to ignore the longer-term opportunities as well as the threats. If the newdelivery mechanisms do develop, this will result in increased competition including from newentrants as barriers to entry are reduced. The potential for foreign banks to provide cross-borderbanking services, such as private banking, through the internet will also increase. In other words,foreign banks may no longer need to be physically located in a particular country in order to tapits market. This will pose interesting challenges to regulators as well as the banks.The response to the challenges23. What then should be the response of banks to these challenges? Despite thediversity of banking systems around the Asian region, I think it is possible to draw some broadconclusions.24. The key point is, I think, for banks to realize that, even if they are state-owned, they are ultimately responsible for their own destiny. The Commercial Banking Law ofthe People’s Republic of China sums up the point well in its Article 4. To quote an Englishtranslation:“A commercial bank operates independently, takes up responsibility for all risksthat it may encounter and for its own profits and losses it may bear, and exercises self-regulatingmechanisms on the management principle of economic efficiency, safety and liquidity.”25. What this means is that the board of directors and senior management ofbanks have the main responsibility to ensure that effective systems of internal governance are inplace to plan for the future, to identify and manage the risks to which they are exposed and tocontrol the operations of the bank on a day-to-day basis. I believe that this point is appreciatedaround the region - from our contacts with fellow supervisors, we know that in many bankingsystems there is a heightened awareness of the importance of sound risk management. But thedifficulty is in turning this into actual changes in behaviour, which requires great efforts to bedevoted to the training of staff, for example in credit skills, as well as more fundamental changesin culture in some banks.26. This change in culture may require some banks to wean themselves offproperty lending which is sometimes seen as an easy option, given that it is based on collateraland on expectations of ever-rising property values. This can prove to be a fallacy, as theJapanese example shows only too well. Banks need therefore to develop a broadly-based lendingbusiness where the borrower’s ability to repay is the first consideration and collateral is there asthe second line of defence. More generally, it will usually be sensible for banks to try todiversify their business into areas which offer the ability to earn fee income and thus reduce theirBIS Review   55/1997
- 6 -dependence on the interest-rate cycle. I hasten to add, however, that this should only be done ifthe necessary systems and controls are in place.27. In some cases, the changes required by banks to meet the challenges of a morecompetitive environment may be too great for them to meet on their own. Mergers may berequired to produce fewer and stronger banks, and I am aware that in some countries this processis being given official encouragement.28. This points to the fact that the regulators also have their part to play inencouraging the process of change in banks. While the prime responsibility for prudentmanagement of banks does rest with the banks themselves, the authorities do have a role to playin ensuring that effective systems of supervision are in place. These should include incentives todiscourage the excessive taking of risk by banks, including that owners should be required tohave a significant amount of capital at risk and to bear the losses should a bank fail. Theinfrastructure of business laws, accounting rules and public disclosure requirements must also beconducive to prudent management and market transparency. Payments systems must beenhanced to reduce the risk of systemic instability.29. These are all areas where progress is being made throughout the region. Idetect few signs of complacency among my fellow regulators or of a tendency to rest on pastsuccesses. We all recognize that banking stability is something that requires constant attention tokeep up with changes in the economic environment and with market developments. There isalso, I believe, a strong appreciation of the need to work together to promote stability. This isshown by the regional initiatives, through groupings such as EMEAP, to promote cooperation insupervision and in other financial sector issues. International institutions such as the AsianDevelopment Bank also have an important role to play in encouraging financial marketdevelopment. I am sure that this Forum will be helpful in addressing some of the issuesinvolved, and I am grateful to the ADB and the IIF for organizing the event and for giving methe opportunity to speak.BIS Review   55/1997
Mr. Carse reviews the progress being made towards global regulationAddress by Mr. David T.B. Carse, a Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAurthority, at the Bankers’ Association for Foreign Trade 75th Anniversary Annual Meetingheld in Florida on 6/5/97.I am pleased to be here this morning to talk to you about the Hong Kongperspective on the trends in global regulation.I have been asked particularly to talk about our experience of being a hostsupervisor - in other words, what it is like to be on the receiving end of consolidated supervision.This is quite appropriate because, although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the homesupervisor for a number of local banks with overseas operations, the distinguishing characteristicof Hong Kong is that it is the host to almost 500 banks from over 40 different countries. This isin keeping with its role as one of the leading international financial centres in the world with thethird largest representation of foreign banks and the fifth largest total of external assets.Hong Kong after 1997Of course, Hong Kong’s other distinguishing characteristic is that it willexperience a reversion of sovereignty to China in less than two months’ time. This has naturallyaroused much interest and speculation among the foreign banks based in Hong Kong about thelegal and regulatory environment which will apply after the handover on 30 June, and I willtherefore try to explain to you briefly the main features of the arrangements that will apply.These arrangements are laid down in the Basic Law which establishes the post-1997 constitutionfor Hong Kong. It is based on the “one country, two systems” concept under which Hong Kongshall enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a Special Administrative region of China. In thebanking and monetary areas, this means that:Hong Kong shall retain the status of an international financial centre. TheGovernment of Hong Kong shall be responsible for monetary policy and practice in Hong Kongand for regulation of financial markets and institutions. There shall be free flow of capitalwithin, into and out of Hong Kong. The HK dollar, as the local legal tender, shall continue tocirculate and remain freely convertible. It must be backed by a 100% reserve fund. TheExchange Fund which holds the foreign currency reserves of Hong Kong shall be managed andcontrolled by the Government of Hong Kong, primarily for regulating the exchange value of theHK dollar.The framework that will apply after 1997 is therefore quite clear. The questionwhich then follows is whether the framework will be applied in practice. I think that there are anumber of good reasons to believe that it will be. In the first place, we now have institutionalarrangements in Hong Kong to put the financial sector provisions of the Basic Law into practice.In particular, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which I represent, has the legal powers,monetary instruments and financial resources - including US$ 63 billion of foreign currencyreserves - to fulfill its role as the central bank of Hong Kong and to maintain the value of the HKdollar. During the four years of its existence, the HKMA has built up a good workingrelationship with the People’s Bank of China which has made it clear in public that it will nottake over the role of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong after 1997. The separate role forHong Kong after 1997 is underscored by its separate membership alongside China ofinternational organizations such as the Bank for International Settlements and the AsianDevelopment Bank, and its participation in the IMF’s New Arrangements to Borrow.BIS Review   55/1997
- 2 -Of course, what matters is not what I say but what the market actually thinks.Judged by this criterion, there is genuine confidence about the future. This is shown by theconsistent stability of the HK dollar; the strength of the stock market, though it has its ups anddowns in line with expectations about US interest rates; the growth in HK dollar deposits ofabout 20% over the last year; and the decline in the margin of our 10-year Exchange Fund Notesover US Treasuries to around 50bp compared with 90bp at the end of 1996. So far as foreignbanks operating in Hong Kong are concerned, Hong Kong political risk largely seems to havedisappeared as an issue. We have seen no exodus of banks from Hong Kong; rather, we haveseen an increased appetite among the foreign banks to take on long-term HK dollar assets,including residential mortgage loans and syndicated credits. Although the margin on these havecome down significantly over the last year, they are still attractive compared with the marginsavailable to foreign banks in their home countries.The importance of international regulatory standardsWe do not anticipate any radical changes in Hong Kong’s system of bankingsupervision after 1997, nor in its attitude to the entry of foreign banks. No doubt, however, thesewill evolve in line with trends in global regulation. This reflects the guiding principle of oursupervision in Hong Kong which is to follow international standards. There are a number ofpractical reasons for wanting to do so. First, it is in keeping with Hong Kong’s role as aninternational financial centre. Reputable foreign banks will only want to do business in a marketwhere the rules of the game are familiar and credible. Their home supervisors will certainly feelthe same way. There is thus absolutely no advantage for centres such as Hong Kong to competeon laxity or to market themselves as places where dubious transactions can be conducted andconcealed. Second, when trying to enforce new supervisory guidelines and rules on our localbanks, one of the first questions they will ask is what is being done elsewhere. It is thus veryhelpful to be able to point to the relevant international standard in order to confer legitimacy onwhat we are trying to achieve.Of course, this presupposes that international standards are relevant to individualcountries and territories. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has played a major rolein setting standards which do have such relevance. In particular, the Basle capital adequacy ratio,which is still called the “Cooke ratio” in parts of Asia in deference to our chairman here today,has become the de facto capital standard in most supervisory systems around the world despitethe fact that it was originally intended to apply only to internationally active banks. Despite thisenormous achievement, however, it can be argued that the subsequent work of the Committeedid become somewhat too narrowly focused on issues which are of principal interest tosupervisors from G-10 countries. This is only natural since these are the people who comprisethe Basle Committee but it perhaps left something of a vacuum in the setting and promulgationof standards with more global relevance.In particular, much of the work of the Basle Committee has been dominated inrecent years by the formulation of its recommendations to extend the capital adequacy regime tocover the market risk arising from trading in derivatives and other financial instruments. I amnot denying that a capital regime to cover market risk is necessary, particularly for thosecountries like the United States whose banks are heavily involved in trading activities. We areintending to introduce the regime in Hong Kong by the end of this year, and a number ofcountries in the Asian region are intending to do the same. However, they are doing so largely tobe seen to be adhering to international standards, rather than because their banks are runningsubstantial trading risks. Even in Hong Kong, which has the fifth largest foreign exchangeBIS Review   55/1997
- 3 -market in the world and the seventh largest derivatives market, the incorporation of market riskwill have only a minor impact on most banks’ capital adequacy ratios.The concentration on market risk has perhaps led to other supervisory areas notreceiving the attention which they deserve. In particular, credit risk still remains the main riskfacing most banks, and it is therefore disappointing that there are still no internationally agreedguidelines in areas such as loan classification, bad debt provisioning and non-accrual of intereston non- performing loans. Most countries in Asia, including Hong Kong, do have their ownrules in these areas but the lack of an agreed standard makes it difficult to undertakecross-country comparisons of asset quality. I hope, therefore, that this is an area which can beaddressed by the Basle Committee in the near future.I am encouraged by the fact that the Basle Committee has recently intensified itsefforts to reach out beyond the G-10 countries and to take a more proactive leadership role inhelping to strengthen banking supervision in all countries. In particular, the recently issuedconsultative paper on Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision is an importantmilestone. The Core Principles are intended to establish minimum requirements which wouldapply in all supervisory systems. It is intended that supervisory authorities around the worldshould use them as an agenda against which to assess the adequacy of their own systems and topress for changes to address any deficiencies. The Core Principles will also increasingly becomethe standard by which outside commentators, including other supervisors, judge the supervisoryframework of individual countries. This external discipline will help to provide an additionalincentive to improve supervisory systems.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is proud to have been one of the supervisoryauthorities which participated in the drafting of the Core Principles. We were also members ofthe Working Party of both G-10 and non-G10 countries which recently prepared a report onmeasures to foster financial stability which was submitted to the meeting of G-7 FinanceMinisters last month in Washington. This includes recommendations not only on the formulationof sound principles and practices, but also on how these can be effectively implemented,including the role of international financial institutions in this respect.Regulatory cooperation in AsiaThese initiatives are being supplemented in Asia by regional cooperation on botha bilateral and multilateral basis. There have been a number of factors driving this. Theaftermath of the Mexican crisis in January 1995, which saw speculative attacks on a number ofAsian currencies, encouraged the view that there was a need for countries in the region tostrengthen their defences in this area. We have thus seen the arrangement of an interlockingseries of bilateral repo agreements using US Treasuries between Asian central banks, includingthe Hong Kong Monetary Authority. These agreements are intended to provide additionalliquidity for exchange rate stability purposes.More generally, there has also perhaps been a feeling among the Asian countriesthat the existing arrangements for central bank cooperation were somewhat “euro-centric” anddid not take adequate account of the growing importance of the Asian region where over 40% ofthe world’s foreign currency reserves are now held. This feeling has to some extent beenaddressed by the more participative approach now being adopted by the Basle Committee andthe BIS. But there is nonetheless a view that greater regional cooperation among Asian centralbanks is both necessary and desirable. This has been summed up in the concept of an “AsianBIS”, though this is somewhat misleading as there are no immediate plans to move towards theBIS Review   55/1997
- 4 -institutional structure which the name would imply. Rather, the current emphasis is onpromoting an informal grouping of central banks called EMEAP (“Executives’ Meeting of EastAsia and Pacific Central Banks) which is exploring opportunities for cooperation in areas suchas payment systems, reserves management and banking supervision. Among other things, thismay provide the opportunity over time to develop a more distinctive and focused regional voiceon international supervisory issues.Consolidated supervisionI will now return to the topic which I raised at the beginning of my speech, whichis how we view consolidated supervision from the receiving end. I suppose that it goes withoutsaying that we are in favour of the concept of consolidated supervision. As an internationalfinancial centre, we are vulnerable to adverse developments in banks abroad and we rely heavilyon the consolidated supervision of the supervisors of those banks. The ability to conductconsolidated supervision is a key factor in whether we regard the home supervision of aparticular bank as adequate - which is one of the criteria for granting a banking licence in HongKong. Within the legal framework in Hong Kong we try to cooperate with overseas regulators toensure that they can effectively undertake consolidated supervision. In particular, we allowhome supervisors to carry out on-site examinations of their institutions in Hong Kong subject toobtaining our prior consent - which we have not hitherto withheld. In addition, the Hong KongMonetary Authority itself has the power to pass on information to foreign regulators to assistthem in the exercise of their functions. At present, however, this power to disclose does notextend to information about individual customers, though this is an area which we are intendingto review in the light of the recommendations of the Basle Committee. In the meantime, we donot impose constraints on access to customer information in the course of on-site examinationsin Hong Kong by overseas regulators.What reservations I have about consolidated supervision therefore relate mainly tohow the system operates in practice:first, it may of course be difficult in practice to assess the adequacy ofconsolidated supervision by a home supervisor and how much reliance should be placed on it bythe host supervisor. As mentioned above, the Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision will provide a useful checklist in this respect, but there will still be the problem ofwhether the Principles are being effectively implemented. A more active monitoring role by theInternational Monetary Fund may help in this respect. But in some cases the best judgment thatit may be possible to make is that the supervisory authority is actively working to establish thenecessary capability - which is essentially the view that we have taken in relation to the People’sBank of China in licensing banks from the Mainland;second, it is important to realize that, in undertaking consolidated supervision, theprimary responsibility of the home supervisor will be to safeguard the interests of the parentbank. While this should hopefully help to promote the safety and soundness of the bankinggroup as a whole, including overseas banking subsidiaries, the interests of home and hostsupervisor may not necessarily coincide. Despite this, the various regulators should, of course,try to cooperate to the maximum extent possible; third, and related to the previous point,cooperation will only be possible if there is an adequate two-way flow of information. However,the main focus of consolidated supervision sometimes appears to be for the home supervisor toobtain information from the host supervisor. There is less emphasis on reciprocal flows. Forexample, in the recent paper prepared jointly by the Basle Committee and the Offshore Group ofBanking Supervisors on Supervision of Cross-Border Banking, only four paragraphs out ofBIS Review   55/1997
- 5 -forty-three are devoted to information flows from home supervisor to host supervisor. In ourexperience, home supervisors can be reluctant to share information with us, either at the time ofauthorization or, more particularly, if serious problems arise in the parent bank. In some cases,however, the situation is improving and the recent more proactive approach of the Japanesesupervisory authorities deserves a commendable mention in this respect.I stress again that I am not intending to cast doubt on the value of consolidatedsupervision, but rather to point out that the reality does not always match the rhetoric. Theanswer can only be for individual supervisory authorities to build up a relationship of trustwhich allows for a free flow of information in both directions, adequate safeguards on theconfidentiality of information received and an avoidance of over-hasty and disruptivesupervisory action based on that information. At the end of the day the effectiveness of globalregulation depends in large measure on cooperation among regulators. As a major internationalfinancial centre, Hong Kong will continue, after 30 June 1997 as it has done before, to play itspart in fostering such cooperation.BIS Review   55/1997
Mr. Stals looks at the effects of the changing financial environment onmonetary policy in South Africa   Address by the Governor of the South African ReserveBank, Dr. C. Stals, at the Annual Dinner of the Pretoria branch of the Economic Society ofSouth Africa held in Pretoria on 15/5/97.1. The objectives of monetary policyThe Gerhard de Kock Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System andMonetary Policy in South Africa laid the foundation for the monetary policy model applied inSouth Africa over the past decade. Although the De Kock Commission’s final report onmonetary policy was submitted in May 1985, it was only since 1986, when money supply targetswere first introduced, that the implementation of the model took its course. Indeed, fullimplementation only came about after the untimely death of Gerhard de Kock in August 1989.In line with monetary policies applied in most developed economies, the SouthAfrican monetary policy model is firmly directed towards the overall objective of creating andmaintaining a stable financial environment. For central bankers, the ultimate price of a stablefinancial environment is a low rate of inflation -- a rate that, in the words of Alan Greenspan,will have no material effects on the macroeconomic decisions of consumers, investors, traders,producers and all other participants in total economic activity.This monetarist approach to monetary policy does not imply that central bankershave no interest in or sympathy for the national objectives of economic growth, job creation andthe improvement of the living conditions of the people. On the contrary, central bankers believethat maximum economic development can only be achieved and sustained in an environment ofstable financial conditions. The efforts of monetary policy must therefore be directed towardswhat central bankers can do best in support of the national objectives, and that is to manage themoney system of the country in the interest of overall economic development.A stable financial environment is a precondition for sustainable economicdevelopment, but provides no guarantee that the real economy will indeed perform at maximumcapacity. There are too many other macroeconomic (and non-economic) factors that will in theend determine the actual economic growth performance. There is, however, convincingtheoretical logic and much empirical evidence to confirm that persistent unstable financialconditions are detrimental for growth, particularly in a country with an economy based on theprinciples of the market mechanism.The De Kock Commission therefore in 1985 summarised its findings as follows:“(The Commission) does not believe, for example, that anything can be gained inthe long run in terms of real growth or employment by accepting higher inflation rates. Theopposite is more likely to be true. Higher inflation will in the long run militate against growthand job creation. The objectives of external balance, growth and employment will over time beserved best by creating and maintaining a climate of reasonable domestic price stability”. (Par47)2. The changing financial environmentThe deliberations of the De Kock Commission took place in an overall socio-political and economic environment that was completely different from what we have to contendwith in South Africa today. With his wisdom and his foresight, Gerhard de Kock may haveBIS Review   54/1997
- 2 -envisaged, and surely wished for, an environment in which monetary policy could be appliedwithout the shackles of sanctions, boycotts, exchange controls, high inflation, social unrest andpolitical distortions that characterised the period of his domain.Over the past decade, the situation has changed dramatically. The majorsocio-political reforms of the early 1990’s opened up the way for a normalisation of SouthAfrica’s position in the world environment. Also in the field of economic and financial relations,South Africa has been reintegrated in the international community from which it was excludedover the preceding two decades. The international economic punitive actions against SouthAfrica were repealed in great haste after the Government of National Unity took power in April1994, and South Africa took its rightful place again in international forums such as the UnitedNations, the Bretton Woods Institutions (IMF and World Bank), the Organisation of AfricanUnity, and the British Commonwealth of Nations.South Africa became reintegrated into a world financial system that was vastlydifferent from the one it had left in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. The explosivedevelopments during its absence in electronics and in communications, and the revolutionarytrans-formation from mainly manufacturing/trading economies to a new service/informationbased culture, led to a strong movement of globalisation in financial market activity. Thisprocess forced the liberalisation of domestic and international financial markets in manycountries, led to the abolition of exchange controls and exposed countries more directly to thedisciplines of international markets.Today in South Africa, there are more than 60 foreign banks that competethrough representative offices, branches and subsidiaries with the domestic banks to providefinancial services to the South African community. We are in the process of gradually removingour exchange controls to join the other approximately 60 (out of 185) countries of the world,that have already succeeded in removing all restrictions on current and capital accountinternational transactions. Non-residents participate very actively in the South African marketfor foreign exchange and in the domestic money and capital markets. Prices on the JohannesburgStock Exchange and the Bond Exchange of South Africa are affected almost instantaneously bydevelopments in the rest of the world. Volumes in these markets have exploded to a level that aDe Kock Commission of fifteen years ago could not anticipate, not even in the wildest flight ofthe imagination.Recent changes in the South African community led to the more active absorptionof many South Africans in the market economy. Latent demands were stimulated by the reformsand many expectations were created by the new political dispensation. The emphasis in fiscalpolicy has changed dramatically, with the retention, fortunately, of basic sound disciplines.The South African banking sector had to be restructured to provide for thousandsof informal savings clubs (Stokvels) and for community banking. There is even pressure on theReserve Bank to legalise fraudulent pyramid schemes such as those that recently brought thecountry of Albania to anarchy.3. The implications for monetary policyThe question does arise whether all these changes did not make the findings of theDe Kock Commission irrelevant. Should monetary policy still hold onto the same objective, andhas the task and the functions of the central bank perhaps not also changed over the past fewyears?BIS Review   54/1997
- 3 -The Reserve Bank believes, however, that the main objective of monetary policyas defined by the De Kock Commission is as important and warranted today as it was in themid-1980s. Indeed, in the environment of a greater involvement of international participants inthe South African financial markets, it is of even greater importance that South Africa shallmaintain overall financial stability, that our rate of inflation shall be brought more in line withthe average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners, and thatinternationally recognised sound monetary and fiscal policies shall be applied at all times. Themain objective of monetary policy in the new South Africa must remain to protect the value ofthe currency.Critics of this unbending attitude of the Reserve Bank often confuse the objectiveof monetary policy with three other aspects of Reserve Bank operations, namely the strategyfollowed by the Bank in pursuance of its objective, the operational procedures applied by theBank, and the instruments used to achieve its objective. There may be a need at this juncture, inlight of the major changes of the past few years, to reconsider some of these aspects of monetarypolicy that have more to do with the implementation of the policy, and not with the objective.The strategy of a central bank can be described as the model it uses to pursue thenon-negotiable objective of protecting the value of the currency. On recommendation of the DeKock Commission, the South African monetary policy model was based on monetary targetingwhich anchors monetary policy decisions to changes in the money supply. This model workedextremely well, particularly in the times of South Africa’s economic isolation from the outsideworld. It is doubtful, however, if this model is still the most effective strategy to maintain in thenew environment. It has, for example, become much more difficult for the Reserve Bank tocontrol the money supply in a situation where so many foreign banks operate in South Africa,and where South African banks have so much easier access to financial resources fromcorrespondent banks in the rest of the world.It is also a debatable issue whether the demand for credit in South Africa is not inthe new environment less sensitive to interest rate changes than before. And, furthermore, therelationship between changes in the money supply and eventual price changes may have becomemuch weaker now that the volumes of transactions in the financial markets have increased somuch relative to turnovers in the markets for goods and services.There is no doubt that the money supply has lost some of its usefulness as ananchor for monetary policy. With South Africa not yet being ready for direct inflation targeting,and with our inability to fix the exchange rate of the rand because of a lack of foreign reserves,the Reserve Bank is gradually moving to a more ecclesiastic approach where a wider range ofmonetary indicators are being used as a basis for monetary policy decisions. This wider range ofindicators includes changes in bank credit extension, the overall liquidity in the banking system,the level and the yield curve of interest rates, changes in the official foreign reserves and in theexchange rate of the rand and, of course, actual and expected movements in the rate of inflation.The operational procedures of the central bank include the methods used forproviding accommodation to banking institutions, open market operations, intervention in theforeign exchange market, the manipulation of interest rates, and the signalling to markets ofpolicy intentions. The South African Reserve Bank’s main operational procedures over recentyears have been what the De Kock Commission described as the “classical cash reserve systemas a means of controlling bank credit creation, rather than the socalled American cash reservesystem”. (Par. 76)BIS Review   54/1997
- 4 -Without going into the details, in the South African system the Reserve Bank usesits open market operations and other instruments of monetary policy to force banking institutionsto borrow more from the discount window whenever it is regarded as necessary to apply a morerestrictive policy. At some stage, the Reserve Bank will then also raise the Bank rate which, in asituation of great dependence on the central bank, will force the private banks to follow withincreases in their lending and deposit rates.Many other central banks operating in sophisticated financial markets are nowinfluencing short-term interest rates more directly with their operations in the markets. Instead ofovernight loans provided at the discount window, they enter into repurchase transactions withbanking institutions, with the added advantage that it can be coupled with a tender system forcentral bank money, and a variable Bank rate.The South African Reserve Bank will also have to introduce greater flexibility inthe operating procedures for the implementation of monetary policy if we want to cope with thevolatile international capital flows, exchange rate changes, and financial assets price movements.It is of some concern to the Reserve Bank that over the past year interest rates in the SouthAfrican money market seem to have become more rigid. In the present system, the Bank nolonger gets reliable signals from market interest rates on changes in the underlying financialconditions. If necessary, the operational procedures of the Bank will have to change to bringmore interest rate flexibility into the money market.Finally, the instruments used for monetary policy may also have to be adapted tothe changing financial environment. In the past, the Reserve Bank, for example, often used theExchequer Account of the Government for the short-term withdrawal of surplus funds from themoney market. The recent introduction of an improved system for tax and loan accounts held byGovernment with private banks, rules out the extensive use of this instrument for monetarypolicy purposes. Similarly, arrangements now under negotiation with the Department of Financeto relieve the Reserve Bank of the responsibilities for the primary issue of Government bonds,and for the development of the secondary market in these bonds, will also change the Bank’sposition in the capital market. It opens up the way for the Bank to have a more single-mindedopen market policy approach.The introduction of repurchase transactions in strictly defined acceptableunderlying financial assets will also provide an instrument of monetary policy that is moremalleable and can be adapted easier to the needs of the new financial environment of whichSouth Africa is now rapidly becoming an integral part.4. ConclusionThere is much room for a continuing debate in South Africa on monetary policy,but not so much on the issue of what the objectives of monetary policy should be, or whetherinflation is bad or good for the overriding objective of creating more jobs in the country. Thedebate should rather concentrate on the effectiveness of the strategy, the operational proceduresand the instruments used in the pursuance of a monetary policy objective that has in any casebeen casted in iron in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.BIS Review   54/1997
BIS Review   53/1997Mr. Macfarlane reviews monetary policy, growth and unemployment inAustralia   Talk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to theAustralia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on 15/5/97.It is a pleasure to be here in Melbourne, and to be speaking to the Australia-IsraelChamber of Commerce. I was very pleased to be invited to address this distinguished group sosoon after I was appointed. If at the end of this address, you feel that I have still left someimportant questions unanswered, my suggestion is that your next guest be my opposite numberfrom Israel. Jacob Frenkel, the Governor of the Bank of Israel, is a distinguished economist, buta very busy man. My invitations to him to visit Australia have so far been unsuccessful - perhapsthis Chamber can swing the balance.I want to take this opportunity today to talk about the economy, monetary policy,and some aspects of unemployment. I propose to do this by looking over a longer period thannormal. Most economic commentary concentrates on very current events and focuses on thelatest monthly or quarterly economic statistics. This is an inevitable result of the news-gatheringprocess and the need for financial markets to reassess after each new piece of information. Inthis environment, the outlook for the year ahead is considered a long time. In my view, even thatis too short - for monetary policy purposes, we should be looking at a period as long as aneconomic expansion. That may not be a lot of immediate help to most people because theywould be unsure of what time span was encompassed by an economic expansion. As a point ofreference, the last two expansions have lasted for about six-and-a-half years, but I think we cando a lot better on this occasion.Lengthening the expansionThe current expansion in Australia has been going on for about 5½ years, whichis similar to the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and a fair bit longer thanfor countries in continental Europe or Japan. Table 1 shows that over that period we have grownat an annual rate of 3½ per cent and had inflation of 2½ per cent. Our growth rate has beenhigher than nearly all OECD countries, although not as strong as for the countries of east Asia.Our inflation rate is also very good and close to the average for OECD countries.The results are pretty good by international standards, particularly since thereshould be a lot more expansion still to come. The main reason that I think we still have a lotmore to come is that this has been a low-inflation expansion and remains so.An important reason why inflation has remained low is that monetary policy hasbeen determined to keep it low this time. The centrepiece of our monetary policy approach is amedium-term inflation target endorsed both by the Government and the Reserve Bank. It wasalso endorsed by the Treasurer in the previous Government and was incorporated into theAccord Mark VIII agreed in June 1995. It is not just something we dreamt up at the ReserveBank; it has enjoyed wide bipartisan support. And recently, the Industrial Relations Commissionmade it clear that they felt their own decision had to take note of this framework.The statement agreed between the Treasurer and myself at the time of myappointment saw low inflation as a requirement for sustained growth, which is another part ofthe Bank’s Charter. Containing inflation is not an end in itself; it is one of the pre-conditions forsustained growth. It is not the only one, but it is obviously the one for which central banks haveto accept most responsibility.

This is not true - as I havepointed out on a number of occasions.  In fact, the reverse is true: we are interested in sustaininga good inflation performance because we are interested in growth. Let me make two points Ihave made before:(a)  The other way of looking at an inflation target is to say that the aim is togrow as fast as possible consistent with maintaining low inflation, but no faster. We say nofaster because post-war history has taught us that allowing inflation to rise actually harmsgrowth prospects in the longer term. Strong growth and long expansions have always gonehand-in-hand with low inflation. Weaker growth and short expansions have occurred in thehigh-inflation era, particularly the 1970s but also in some parts of the 1980s. This “nofaster” idea does not mean that we will panic at unexpectedly strong growth over a shortperiod. It does mean we intend to avoid a “full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes”approach to policy.(b)  As I said at the start of the talk, we want a long expansion this time. Wedo not want the expansion to last only six-and-a-half years and be followed by a recession.The damage, particularly to unemployment, occurs during recessions. The net rise inunemployment in Australia over the past 25 years has not been due to prolonged periods ofweak economic growth; it has been concentrated into three relatively short periods ofrecession (see Diagram 1). The best thing monetary policy can do to improve our
- 3 -BIS Review   53/1997employment prospects is to prolong the expansion and delay and reduce the size of anysubsequent recession. On occasion, that means easing the growth rates back a bit tocounter inflationary pressures early, as an alternative to more vigorous application of thebrakes when inflation has built more momentum.Diagram  10369036903690369Unemployment Rate1997199319891985198119771973%%Ideally, we should try to eliminate the business cycle (and recessions) altogether,but that would be too utopian an aspiration. The business cycle has been declared dead before,only to re-assert itself. I do believe, however, that if inflation is kept under control, thisexpansion will be a lot longer than its predecessors and any subsequent downturn kept milderthan in the past. Less pressure would be placed on monetary policy in a late-cycle situation if theaim were only to slow the economy, than if it were necessary both to slow the economy and toreduce an entrenched inflation, as has been the case in the past.Speed limitsSome people would characterise our approach to monetary policy asincorporating “a speed limit”. In a very broad sense this is true. We do not want the economy togrow so fast that it pushes up wage and price inflation to unacceptable rates. I have alreadyexplained the reason for that.However, the concept of a “speed limit” is unhelpful if we try to use itmechanistically. It has been claimed that the Reserve Bank has a rule that the economy cannotbe allowed to grow faster than 3½ per cent. I have seen this claim on a number of occasions, butcan assure you that it is not true. I do not know where it came from; perhaps from observinghistorical growth rates, or perhaps from some  misinterpretation of things that the Bank has saidon occasion. The figure of 3½ per cent is also sometimes regarded as the Government’s target.Again, I do not know where this claim came from, but it is probably derived from the fact thatgovernment projections, such as those underlying the Budget forward estimates, often assumeaverage growth rates like this, particularly for the out-years of multi-year projections. Theseassumptions should be seen as what they are - an attempt to base government planning on
- 4 -BIS Review   53/1997prudent, conservative assumptions rather than wishful thinking - not as iron-clad limits togrowth or short-term “targets”.There are a number of reasons why it does not make sense to specify a particularnumber as the “speed limit” for the coming year. Among those reasons are the following:(a)  Even if we have a clear idea of a long-term average rate of growth, an economycan clearly grow faster than that when it is taking up excess capacity. This wouldbe the case if it was coming off a year when growth was a bit on the soft side (aswas 1996, for example) and where inflation was very well contained.(b)  It is not possible to “fine-tune” an economy to grow at the rate you want over thespace of one year. Neither forecasting accuracy, nor the monetary policy process,permits that degree of accuracy. Even with very good economic policy, theeconomy will grow faster than average half the time and slower the other half.(c)  Just because the economy averaged a particular figure in the past, it does notmean that this average is the one we should project into the future when thinkingabout potential growth. There is some evidence, as is shown in our Semi-AnnualStatement on Monetary Policy, that productivity growth has increased, and henceit is possible that potential growth may have risen. On the other hand, populationand labour force growth may well be slower than in the past and this would workin the opposite direction.I hope I have made it clear that we do not regard economic growth as excessivebecause it has breached a particular figure - say, 3½ per cent. We would regard it as excessive ifit is pushing up wages and prices in a way which would cause our medium-term target to beexceeded.  Obviously, the faster is growth in any particular period, all other things equal, thehigher the risk of that problem becomes. But we do not have, and it is not sensible to have, adoctrinaire view of particular growth thresholds which, if breached, are assumed to generateproblems.  The policy process is rather more pragmatic than that, and proceeds by the rathersimple technique of examining the evidence for what it says about inflation pressures in theperiod ahead.That, to repeat, is the test: not whether a growth rate matches or exceeds aparticular pre-determined figure, but whether low inflation performance is being maintainedover time. At any point in time we are constantly monitoring wages and prices and making anassessment of the outlook over the next year or so. If we get good news and our assessment isfor lower growth in wages and prices, we can, other things equal, let the economy run faster.This may be done by reducing interest rates or, depending on the circumstances, refraining fromraising them. If on the other hand we are getting bad news, we may have to tighten or forego aneasing.This idea is not all that novel.  It is very similar to the way the monetary policyprocess is described in the United States. Our newspapers are full of the latest speculation aboutwhat Alan Greenspan - the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board - is going to do this month,next month and thereafter. The big story of 1996 in the United States was that nearly everyoneexpected monetary policy to be tightened. The US economy was already at full capacity and stillgrowing strongly, people expected that inflationary pressures would soon emerge, and the Fedwould have to tighten. On three occasions - July, September and December - the markets wereconvinced it was going to happen, but on each occasion the Fed was able to sit on its hands.Why was it possible to delay the tightening for nearly a year? It was not because the economy
- 5 -BIS Review   53/1997weakened; in fact, it grew faster than initially anyone had forecast, expanding by over 3 per centin 1996, well above previous forecasts and economists’ estimates of its long-run potentialgrowth rate. It was because the Fed continued to receive constant feedback from the economyindicating that rises in prices and wages remained moderate. None of this means that the USeconomy is somehow entirely freed from all the constraints it has experienced in the past; onlythat, to date, inflation performance has been a bit better than they expected. To that extent, theFed has been able to allow the growth to run just a little longer.No-one would be more pleased than the Reserve Bank to see a similar outcomefor the Australian economy over the next 12 or 18 months - that is, continuing good news onwages and prices, allowing us to grow faster for longer. It was an assessment of improvingprospects for inflation, and the associated scope for additional growth, that lay behind the threeeasings in the second half of 1996. We would like to have seen that pattern of news continued,but the latest data on wages seems to have been a setback to that expectation.Other viewsOf course, not everyone agrees with this approach. There are those who think amuch higher figure for growth is achievable and should be pursued. Their approach would be tonominate a figure - I have seen 5 per cent mentioned - and expect the Reserve Bank to adjustmonetary policy to achieve it in the long run (not just for one year).The trouble with this approach is that it amounts to a gamble with rather poorodds. While we do not wish to take too strong a view on what is “too much” in any particularshort period, we need to keep a reasonably sober perspective on what is likely to be feasible overthe long run. A growth rate of 5 per cent, for example, is so far above our historical performancethat unless you can specify how improvements on the supply side of the economy have lifted thepotential growth rate dramatically, it cannot be taken seriously. Now there may well be somesignificant benefits coming through on the supply side as a result of structural changes andmicro-economic reform. For example, reductions in tariffs and increased competition within thedomestic market are two that spring to mind. We may also be getting something out of increasedflexibility in some parts of the workforce, though the jury is still out at present on exactly howfar that process has brought us. But even though there is some tentative evidence of higherproductivity, I think we have still got a lot further to go before we could be confident thatsupply-side reforms have significantly lifted our potential growth rate.More importantly, our current monetary policy procedures, consistently applied,should guide us to the right answer without having to take such a gamble. If the economy reallyis capable of much faster non-inflationary growth than in the past, constant evaluation of thefeedback we receive from the data should enable us to detect this change. If we receive a flow ofinformation pointing to lower pressures on wages and prices, for example, we can let theeconomy run faster than earlier relationships might have suggested, as in the Greenspanexample. This may not satisfy those with a liking for a punt, because the feedback process takeslonger. But it carries less risk of miscalculation.Longer-term aspects of unemploymentSo far, we have been talking about monetary policy in relation to the businesscycle. I have argued that we should try to maintain the economy in a position of growth for aslong a time as possible. This is best achieved by seeking to remain free of major imbalances, andaddressing those which do emerge as quickly as possible.
- 6 -BIS Review   53/1997But there is a bigger dimension to Australia’s unemployment problem thanmanaging the business cycle. It becomes clear from a consideration of the longer-term historyboth of our own economy and those of other countries. What I want to suggest is that a commonperception that if we could only grow faster, unemployment would go away, is missing animportant part of the story.Consider the data in Table 2, which is for the same group of countries as shownearlier in Table 1. The table sets out the average growth rate per capita in these countries andtheir unemployment performance. This latter concept is measured by seeing how much highertheir current unemployment rate is than it was in the first half of the 1960s. There is one countrywhere the unemployment rate is now lower, namely the United States. At the other end of thespectrum, we have the large European countries where the unemployment rate is enormouslyhigher than it was in the 1960s. We are somewhere in the middle - better than the largeEuropeans, but not as good as the United States, the United Kingdom or New Zealand.We can then pose the question: have the Europeans suffered because their growthrates were inferior to the United States? Is that the reason for their higher unemployment rates?The answer seems to be no, because column 1 shows that most of the major European countrieshad quite respectable growth rates over this period; for example, Germany, France, Italy andSpain all grew faster than the United States (or the United Kingdom, New Zealand or us). Theirperformance on unemployment has been dismal, not because of their growth performance, butdespite it. Diagram 2 shows that, over this relatively long period, there is no systematicrelationship between the growth of the economy and the change in the unemployment rate (ifthere was, the dots would be clustered around a downward sloping line).Table  2:  Growth  Rate  and  Change  in  UnemploymentGDP per capitaUnemployment RateAverage Growth1960-1996Early 1960sLatestDifferenceUnited States2.15.74.9-0.8Norway3.21.73.51.8Japan4.51.33.21.9Canada2.36.09.63.6United Kingdom2.01.76.14.4Switzerland1.50.05.65.6Netherlands2.30.56.25.7New Zealand1.20.16.46.3Denmark2.31.58.06.5Australia2.22.08.76.7Ireland3.75.011.76.7Sweden2.01.68.46.8Italy3.03.512.38.8France2.61.412.811.5Germany2.40.711.210.5Belgium2.72.212.910.7Finland2.71.415.113.7Spain3.42.321.719.4
- 7 -BIS Review   53/1997There are, no doubt, many aspects to this story, which I cannot go into here. But itseems reasonably apparent that while good economic growth is a very important part of reducingunemployment, growth alone will not be the whole answer. If it was, Europe’s unemploymentrates would be much more like that of the United States. There is something in the Europeansystem which means that growth is not converted into jobs in the same way as it is in the UnitedStates.People who have spent a great deal of time studying these issues have come to theconclusion that the highly regulated labour markets that form part of the continental Europeanworld can often work against the interests of job creation. Such labour markets usually have aninstitutional framework which promotes job security, imposes relatively strict minimum wagesand conditions, provides easily accessible sickness and unemployment benefits, and increasestrade union involvement in decisions.Diagram  2Growth and Unemployment in OECD CountriesGDP per capita (average annual growth, 1960 to 1996)••••••••••••••••••-505101501234%%As a result, these systems tend to be good at protecting the interests of those inwork - the insiders, but are often not helpful to the longer-term interests of the outsiders - thoselooking for work. Employers are less keen to offer new jobs because of the higher costs and thedifficulty of reversing the decision if it becomes necessary. The unemployed, while having amore generous safety-net than under a US-type system, are less likely to be offered a job andless likely to look for one. A high proportion of long-term unemployed is a feature ofcontinental European countries. Ironically, it seems that measures designed to promote securityof employment may well have the effect of limiting the extent of employment.I think we know that there are elements of this story in our own case too. It is notas though the Australian economy has suffered particularly bad growth in the last twenty years.It grew more slowly than in  the 1960s, but everyone suffered that slowdown. We have hadseveral periods of reasonably solid growth by international standards. On each occasion, wehave, unfortunately, found the limits to growth. But we still have high unemployment by the
- 8 -BIS Review   53/1997standards of the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and, more importantly, bythe standards of what we ourselves regard as acceptable.Why does our unemployment performance have rather more in common with thecontinental European countries than we would like? Is it perhaps because our labour marketinstitutions also have much in common?  Our labour market was never as deregulated as theUnited States and we have not gone through recent deregulations to the same extent as have theUnited Kingdom and New Zealand. Last year the Government enacted some changes to increaseflexibility through the Workplace Relations Act.  These changes, simplifying and streamliningarrangements and making it easier to strike bargains, seem to be a move in the right direction.  Itis too early to judge how substantial the beneficial effects of these changes will be (and it will ofcourse depend on how much use the parties choose to make of the flexibility on offer).  On thesurface, these reforms were less ambitious than those in the United Kingdom or New Zealand.Changes to labour market arrangements are, of course, politically difficult. Onereason is that the insiders have to give something up. Job security is clearly reduced, and somehard-won entitlements may have to be relinquished. More flexibility in wage setting almostcertainly entails a wider dispersion of wage rates - that is more wage inequality - and reform ofunemployment benefits would place tougher conditions on the unemployed. It is understandablethat many people are unwilling to make these changes and why they foresee such worryingphenomena as the “working poor”.Most people in our society, in other words, see general fairness as a relevantcriterion in choosing policy outcomes. As a result, we would not want to go completely downthe US route, with such extreme differences in incomes between senior executives of companiesand the shop floor. But we do not have to go as far as the United States - there is a happymedium in this, as in most things. All I am suggesting is that we should re-examine our labourmarket institutions to see whether they are protecting those in jobs at the expense of thoselooking for jobs.At the same time, while income inequality may not seem fair, unemployment isnot very fair either.  Some of our labour market regulations, and many of our attitudes towardslabour market outcomes, indeed some of our very ideas about fairness, stem from a time whenthe unemployment rate was 2 or 3 per cent. It was inconceivable then that unemployment wouldhave an upward trend over twenty years, or that labour market regulation would have anysignificant role in that process. But the world has changed, and our ideas about what sorts oflabour market arrangements are appropriate need to change too. This is already happening, asevidenced by recent reforms. My guess, however, is that this will not complete the process.ConclusionI began by talking about the need to lengthen the economic expansion. This,achieved by keeping inflation at bay, is the best contribution monetary policy can make to thelong-term health of the economy. That long-term focus does not mean that we are too cautious,that we never take a risk; it simply means that we weigh the risks and rewards of policy actionsover longer time horizons than many of the commentators on the economic scene which fill ournewspapers and airwaves each day.We want an expanding economy, and low inflation. That offers the prospect thatprogress can be made in addressing the rate of unemployment, which remains too high by anystandard in Australia. We fear, however, that the debate about whether unemployment will or
- 9 -BIS Review   53/1997will not reach supposed “targets” over the next year is missing the main point. Faster growthover the next year or two will help reduce unemployment. But it would be a great shame if thatdecline obscured the longer-term aspect to unemployment, which endures beyond the businesscycle.
Mr. Stals examines the role of financial cooperation in the development ofthe Southern African Development Community   Lecture by the Governor of the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank, Dr. C. Stals, presented to the Harvard Institute for InternationalDevelopment in Boston on 1/5/97.1. Background to the formation of SADCThe Southern African Development Community found its origin in 1980 whennine1 countries in Southern Africa decided jointly “to pursue policies aimed at economicliberation and integrated development of our national economies”. One of the main objectives ofthe association at that stage was to make the economies of these countries less dependent onSouth Africa -- a country that was then an unwanted ally because of its unacceptable internalpolitical and social policies.After major political and social reforms in South Africa led to the fullydemocratic election of a Government of National Unity in April 1994, South Africa also joinedSADC, to become the eleventh member, after a newly-independent Namibia already joined in1990. Mauritius was the next country to join SADC, which now has twelve members with a totalpopulation of about 136 million people.In August 1992, a revised Treaty for SADC was approved by a Summit Meetingof the Heads of State of the participating countries. Included in the main objectives of theCommunity are the following economic goals:To achieve development and economic growth, alleviate poverty, enhance thestandard and quality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa, and support the sociallydisadvantaged through regional integration; To promote and maximise productive employmentand utilisation of resources of the region, and to achieve sustainable utilisation of naturalresources and effective protection of the environment.To achieve its objectives, SADC shall•Harmonise political and socio-economic policies and plans of memberStates.•Mobilise the peoples of the region and their institutions to take initiativesto develop economic, social and cultural ties across the region, and toparticipate fully in the implementation of the programmes and operationsof SADC and its institutions.•Develop policies aimed at the progressive elimination of obstacles to freemovement of capital and labour, goods and services, and of the peoples ofthe region generally among member States.•Promote the development of human resources.•Promote the development, transfer and mastery of technology.•Improve economic management and performance through regionalco-operation.The Treaty provides for other political, social and cultural objectives which arenot of direct relevance for the enhancing of financial co-operation in the region.                                                  1Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.BIS Review   52/1997
- 2 -2. South Africa’s position within SADCThe South African economy is by far the most advanced in the region. Althoughthe total South African population of 42 million people accounts for but 31 per cent of the totalpopulation of all SADC countries together, the South African economy contributes about 80 percent of the total gross domestic product of about $170 billion produced in the twelve memberstates. South Africa also accounts for almost 70 per cent of the combined total exports of $43billion of the SADC region.South Africa’s dominance is even more pronounced in the financial markets.South Africa is about the only country in the region with well-functioning and independentspecialised financial institutions such as banks, long- and short-term insurers, private sectorpension funds, mutual funds, participation mortgage bond schemes and mining and industrialfinance houses. With a total market capitalisation of about $280 billion, the Johannesburg StockExchange dominates the capital markets of the region, and with a daily turnover of about $7billion, the foreign exchange market in Johannesburg is providing an increasing service forinternational settlements for a number of other countries of the region. With a turnover of morethan $700 billion last year in the South African bond market and a growing market forderivatives, South Africa is in a favourable position to provide sophisticated financial servicesfor the whole SADC region.This dominating position of the South African economy has certain advantages,but at the same time makes harmonious regional co-operation more complex. Some of the otherpartners in SADC hold an understandable fear that their economic independence will bejeopardised by a too aggressive policy of economic integration of the region.The role that South Africa plays within SADC must therefore be approached withtact and ingenuity. South Africa was given the responsibility for managing and developing theFinance and Investment Protocol2. For this purpose, there is a Council of Ministers of Financethat meet from time to time under the chairmanship of the South African Minister of Finance togive guidance to a programme for closer financial co-operation amongst the participatingcountries in SADC. Two sub-committees were also established, one a Committee of TreasuryOfficials, and the other a Committee of Governors of Central Banks and their officials, withclearly defined terms of reference for each one of these Committees.3. The work and functions of the Committee of Governors of Central BanksWhen South Africa was given the special task of administering the Finance andInvestment Protocol for SADC, the South African Reserve Bank saw in this arrangement a greatopportunity for closer co-operation amongst the central banks of the region. In the beginning,however, it proved a major task to get recognition from the political leaders for the need of anindependent Committee of Governors of Central Banks. In many of the participating countriesthe central bank is regarded, and often unfortunately also used, as just an extension of theTreasury Department of the central government. In succeeding to get the approval for theestablishment of this Committee of Governors an important seed was sown in each one of these                                                  2There are a number of other Protocols, co-ordinated by other countries, for example: Inland Fisheries(Malawi), Marine Fisheries and Resources (Namibia), Livestock Production and Animal Disease Control(Botswana), Environment and Land Management (Lesotho), Energy (Angola), Mining and Labour andEmployment (Zambia), Tourism (Mauritius), Industry and Trade (Tanzania), Food, Agriculture andNatural Resources (Zimbabwe), Human Resource Development (Swaziland), and Culture andInformation as well as Transport and Communication (Mozambique).BIS Review   52/1997
- 3 -countries for the acceptance of the undeniable advantages, also for the politicians, of anindependent central bank.A second major obstacle was overcome when approval was granted for theestablishment of a small specialised Secretariat and Research Facility within the South AfricanReserve Bank to serve the Committee of Governors. This avoided the need for adhering to thecumbersome procedure of communicating within the central banking fraternity through theconduit of the SADC Secretariat, based in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana.The SADC Finance and Investment Sector was formally established only in 1995,and the Committee of Governors held its first meeting on 24 November 1995 in Pretoria. Now,eighteen months later, this Committee can already look back on a number of accomplishments,and can report good progress with a number of projects being pursued in the interest ofpromoting economic development in the Southern African region. A number of TechnicalSubcommittees and Working Groups have been formed, consisting mainly of officials of theSADC central banks, to work on specialised projects.4. The basic philosophy behind financial co-operation in the regionBefore the Governors’ Committee was established, SADC approached financialco-operation in the region on the basis of proposals made by European advisers, and was basedmainly on the model of financial integration in the European Community. The folly of thisapproach was immediately grasped by the Governors at their first meeting. The divergencies inthe stage of economic development of the members of SADC are so vast that there can be notalk at this juncture of a European type of economic integration in Southern Africa. TheGovernors’ Committee therefore had to design its own model for sensible financial co-operationin the region. In drafting its own mission statement, the Committee designed a model forfinancial co-operation that was described as a “bottom-up” approach. This approach is based onbuilding financial co-operation by laying an appropriate foundation in the form of an effectiveinstitutional framework for the financial system in each country. More grandiose schemes for theharmonisation or integration of macroeconomic monetary polices can be considered once centralbanks, private banking sectors and financial markets have been established and are functioningeffectively in most of the participating countries.A second challenge that had to be faced was the diverse roles and functionsassigned by their Governments to the various central banks in the region. In finding an answer tothe question of what contribution central banks can make towards the achievement of the goalsof SADC, a consensus had to be found on what the task of the central banks should be inpromoting optimum economic development and growth. There may not yet be full agreement onthis daunting question, but the majority view now favours the contemporary approach of themore advanced economies that the central bank’s responsibilities should be restricted to thecreation and maintenance of a stable financial environment that will be conducive for sustainableeconomic growth. Central banks must protect the value of the currency. This is gospel, not onlyin more industrialised, but also in developing and emerging economies. Overall financialstability may not be a guarantee for, but certainly is a precondition for, sustainable economicgrowth.5. The framework for financial co-operation within SADCIn terms of the bottom-up approach, the Committee of Governors kicked-off itswork programme by exchanging views on the nature, structure and functions of each centralBIS Review   52/1997
- 4 -bank in the region. In many developing countries, central banks, acting as extensions ofGovernment Finance Departments, are often directly involved in normal commercial anddevelopment banking, and in many other macroeconomic activities such as export promotion,social upliftment programmes, and financing of government budgetary shortfalls. This, ofcourse, often creates a conflict with the prime objective of central banking, and that is to protectthe value of the currency. The powers of the central bank in such countries must first be reducedto improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.In the second phase of its deliberations, the Committee of Governors isconcentrating on the quantity and quality of private banking in the region. The establishment ofsound and well-managed privately-owned banking institutions must be encouraged to providefinancial services in a competitive environment. The two tiers of banking, that is central bankingand private banking, must be separated on a clearly-defined basis.In the third phase of financial co-ordination, the central bank Governors areworking together in a joint effort to develop compatible and inter-linkable national payments,clearing and settlement systems for financial transactions. Eventually, the national systems mustbe linked to each other to provide for more effective cross-border settlement of inter-regionalfinancial transactions. This project requires some co-operation in the development of compatibleelectronic data processing and technology systems in the twelve participating central banks.In a fourth phase, more attention will be focused on the development of financialmarkets in the region. A lot of research work must be done on the introduction of appropriatelegal institutional frameworks, the introduction of financial instruments and the improvement oftechnological systems and human resource skills in the foreign exchange, money and capitalmarkets. Some rationalisation in the use of the existing markets to the advantage of the wholeregion will be necessary.Only then will it become possible to consider greater harmonisation and evenintegration of macroeconomic financial policies such as interest and exchange rate policies, themanagement of bank liquidity and credit extension on a regional basis, and operations by centralbanks in a more integrated financial market environment.6. The practical implementation of the programme for financial co-operationThe SADC Committee of Governors is determined gradually to implement itsplan for greater financial co-operation over the next few years in the whole region. On theAfrican Continent, many ambitious plans for economic co-operation exist on paper, but arenever executed. The Governors’ Committee has already embarked on the implementation stage,and is now actively involved in a number of the ground-work projects:1.  It has become necessary for the twelve Governors to have a betterunderstanding of the regional economic environment within which they operate. For thispurpose the Secretariat of the Governors’ Committee established a statistical data base foressential economic time series from the twelve countries in the computer capacity of the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank. It is the intention to connect all the central banks in due course with real-time on-line linkages to the data base.2.  To enable Governors to learn from the experiences of each other, a data bankwith information on issues such as legislation, relationships with Governments, functions andresponsibilities, management, policy objectives, procedures and instruments of monetary policy,BIS Review   52/1997
- 5 -and administrative structures for each central bank, has been compiled and is now available toall the Governors.3.  Programmes are encouraged for the establishment of efficient and well-managed privately-owned banking institutions in all SADC countries. Assistance is beingprovided for the revision of the banking laws in some countries, and central banks areencouraged where necessary to withdraw themselves from private sector banking activity.4.  The South African Reserve Bank is playing a leading role in the developmentof the quality of, and capacity for, proper bank regulation and supervision. Some harmonisationis encouraged on policies such as bank licensing, minimum financial prudential requirements,and regular auditing of banking institutions. A joint effort is also being made to take thenecessary action against illegal banking activities in the region, such as money laundering andpyramid schemes.5.  There is a great need for training and the development of skills in centralbanking in the region. The South African Reserve Bank has introduced a specialised TrainingInstitute for Central Banking, and is now providing specialised courses in central banking andfinancial management for its own staff and officials of other central banks in the SADC region.The central banks of the region also formed an East and Southern Africa BankingSupervisors Group (ESAF) to standardise bank regulation and supervision in the region. ESAFis providing specialised courses for the development of the financial regulatory capacity in theregion.There is also a more ambitious training programme provided through theMacroeconomic and Financial Management Institute (MEFMI). A number of Southern Africancountries, but not all members of SADC, participate in this venture. With its headquarters inHarare, MEFMI’s operational mandate covers two broad areas:“(i) In-depth capacity building, involving training, institutional development,networking and technical support, to strengthen countries’ ability to manage their debt andexternal reserves;” and“(ii) a training programme for public officials with duties relating tomacroeconomic and financial management, providing courses in a wide range of high-priorityfields.” MEFMI has the support of a number of international institutions, such as the WorldBank, and has the potential to make an important contribution to the development of desperatelyneeded skills for the management of the economic transformation of African countries.6.  The removal of remaining exchange controls in the region is a major priorityof the Governors’ Committee. Arrangements have been introduced for the unrestrictedrepatriation of notes and coin used in participating countries amongst the members of SADC,and the movement towards an unrestricted flow of capital in the region is being promoted. SouthAfrica is lifting its remaining exchange controls in respect of SADC countries faster than for therest of the world. Two members, namely Zambia and Mauritius, have already removed allexchange controls in their countries.7.  Reference has already been made to the work that is being done in the area ofelectronic data processing and the development of a cross-border network for financial clearing,payment and settlement transactions. International assistance is now sought (through the WorldBIS Review   52/1997
- 6 -Bank) for the development of the national payment and clearing systems in the less-developedeconomies of the region.7. The road aheadThere is growing enthusiasm in Southern Africa for a regional approach toeconomic development issues. There are, unfortunately, more than one initiative for multi-national regional economic co-operation arrangements in Sub-Saharan Africa, initiatives thatoften compete with each other. In Southern Africa itself, the SADC and COMESA (theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa), groupings provide many overlappingservices and some countries belong to both organisations, and others to only one of the two. Thetime has come for Governments in the region to consider a merger of the two competingregional groupings in a more viable single regional association.Both SADC and COMESA have their own Secretariats with a strong bureaucracythat often inhibits initiatives because of unnecessary rigid procedural requirements. In the caseof the Committee of Governors of SADC, we often live in sin because of non-compliance withthe prescribed procedures of the SADC Secretariat. Forgiveness, however, can easily beextorted, as long as progress and successes can be claimed.There is among some governments still a strong suspicion of the motives behindcloser economic co-operation in the region. The question arises whether it is perhaps not a realdanger that the powerful South African economy will exploit the smaller economies for its ownadvantage: South Africa has to act with great discretion in performing its role in the programme.South Africa obviously has a vested interest in the economic development of the region as awhole.Internally, South Africa still has many serious economic problems that must beresolved to improve the living conditions of its own people. Unemployment is high, manycommunities live in great poverty, and there is a relatively wide spread between high and lowincomes earned in the country. Many people therefore believe that South Africa shouldconcentrate all its resources on the development of its own economy. There is, however, a basicfallacy in this approach. Whenever South Africa makes some progress in solving its owneconomic problems without a parallel development in other countries in the region, theunemployed from the other countries get sucked into the South African system. If South Africais not prepared to accept more exports from other African countries and does not want to allowpart of the South African savings to be invested in these countries, the country will have toabsorb great numbers of unemployed people from the rest of the region.The region of SADC is gradually becoming an attractive place for foreigninvestors. Its potential for economic development is vast, and undeveloped human resources andthe exploding demand for goods and services emanating from people who are now beingabsorbed for the first time in a real market economy, must lure many multi-national institutionsto the Southern Africa region. It depends on us how attractive we can make our own region forthe outside world as a place for long-term, durable, and productive investment.BIS Review   52/1997
Mr. Greenspan discusses technological change and the design of banksupervisory policies   Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Conference on Bank Structure and Competition ofthe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on 1/5/97.For more than three decades, this conference has focused our attention on keyissues facing banks, their customers, and regulators. Its proceedings have chronicled aremarkable and ongoing transformation of the U.S. financial services industry. At the time of thefirst gathering in 1963, our financial system was highly segmented, with commercial banks,savings and loans, investment banks, insurance companies, and finance companies providingdistinctly separate products. Statutes and regulations greatly restricted competition betweenbanks and nonbanks, and among banks themselves.Today, the marketplace for financial services is intensely competitive, innovative,and global. Banks and nonbanks, domestic and foreign, now compete aggressively across abroad range of on- and off-balance-sheet financial activities. It is noteworthy that, for the mostpart, this transformation has not been propelled by sweeping legislative reforms. Rather, theprimary driving forces have been advances in computing, telecommunications, and theoreticalfinance that, taken together, have eroded economic and regulatory barriers to competition, defacto. Technology has fundamentally reshaped how financial products are created and how theseproducts are delivered, received, and employed by end-users.In my remarks this morning, I plan to discuss two aspects of this process oftechnological change. First is the recurring theme of financial products being unbundled intotheir component parts, including the unbundling of credit, market, and other risks. Thesedevelopments have worked to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the financialsystem and, at the same time, to provide financial institutions and their customers with bettertools for managing risks. A byproduct is that our largest and most complex financialorganizations increasingly are measuring and managing risk on a centralized basis. This trendseems irreversible, and in my view provides a compelling reason for maintaining some type ofumbrella supervision over banking organizations, especially as we contemplate repeal of Glass-Steagall and other restrictions on the activities of banking organizations.The second theme I want to explore is the large element of uncertainty underlyingtechnological progress. Reflecting this uncertainty, it is inherently very difficult to predict theextent to which government policies may distort the private sector’s incentives to innovate. Thisargues for supervisory and regulatory policies that are more “incentive-compatible”, in the sensethat they are reinforced by market discipline and the profit-maximizing incentives of bankowners and managers. To the extent this can be achieved, and I believe we have taken someinnovative steps in this direction, supervisory and regulatory policies will be both lessburdensome and more effective.Unbundling of Financial ServicesThe unbundling of financial products is now extensive throughout our financialsystem. Perhaps the most obvious example is the ever-expanding array of financial derivativesavailable to help firms manage interest rate risk, other market risks, and, increasingly, creditrisks. Derivatives are now used routinely to separate the total risk of more generic products intocomponent parts associated with various risk factors. These components frequently arerepackaged into synthetic products having risk profiles that mimic financial instruments in otherBIS Review   50/1997
- 2 -markets. The synthetic products can then be resold to those investors most willing and able tobear the associated risks.Another far-reaching innovation is the technology of securitization -- a form ofderivative -- which has encouraged unbundling of the production processes for many creditservices. Securitization permits separate financial institutions to originate, service, fund, andassume the credit or market risks of a portfolio of loans or other assets. Thus, a financialinstitution may specialize in those activities where it has particular expertise or othercomparative advantages. For example, to reduce the costs of originating and securitizing certaintypes of household loans, the underwriting processes used by some financial institutions rely onhighly automated credit-scoring models developed by third-party vendors. These models, inturn, typically are linked to huge databases on borrower characteristics maintained independentlyby national credit bureaus.Numerous types of assets are now routinely securitized, including residentialmortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, and credit card loans. In addition, medium- andlarge-size businesses, including some that are below investment-grade, regularly access thecommercial paper market by securitizing their trade accounts or other assets. Recently,securitization and credit-scoring are beginning to be applied to small business lending.These and other developments facilitating the unbundling of financial productshave surely improved the efficiency of our financial markets. One benefit is greater economicspecialization, as banks and other financial institutions are able to create market niches, forexample, in cash management, investment management, or the origination or servicing of certainloans. Moreover, by lowering the costs of hedging and financial arbitrage, derivatives andsecuritization work to enhance market liquidity and reduce both absolute risk premiums anddisparities in risk premiums across financial instruments and geographic regions.Unbundling also has lowered economic barriers to competition, affordinghouseholds and businesses a greater choice of potential providers for financial products. Theability to unbundle permits potential competitors to target highly specific product- or market-attributes, for which existing providers are earning excessive “rents.” Through credit-scoring anddirect-mail marketing, for instance, a financial institution can identify and recruit potentiallyprofitable credit card customers over a wide geographic area, without incurring the costsassociated with a large branch network. According to our Survey of Consumer Finances, forexample, 84 percent of general purpose credit cards held by U.S. households in 1995 wereissued by financial institutions from which the card holder received no other financial service.In addition, unbundling has helped erode legal barriers to competition, byenabling one or more attributes of a product to be modified in order to exploit statutory orregulatory “loopholes.” A classic example, of course, is the introduction of money marketmutual funds, which ultimately forced the removal of Regulation Q interest rate ceilings ondeposit accounts.It is important to recognize that these developments would not have been possiblewithout complementary advances in technology across several disciplines. First, innovations infinance theory, such as the principle of financial arbitrage and models for pricing contingentclaims, provided a conceptual framework for understanding and modeling financial risks.Second, advances in computer and communications technologies have made these conceptualinnovations economically feasible, by lowering the costs associated with information processingand with the transmission of large volumes of data over long distances.BIS Review   50/1997
- 3 -Besides promoting competition and improved products and productionefficiencies, these same technological advances have spawned a sea-change in the riskmanagement practices of financial institutions. The largest and most sophisticated bankingorganizations increasingly have centralized their risk management at the parent level -- cuttingacross legal entities and financial instruments.This new management paradigm is grounded in the same conceptual techniquesemployed by financial engineers to unbundle the total risk of an individual asset. Suchtechniques rely on the financial engineer’s ability to model the relationship between anindividual asset’s economic value and a number of separate risk factors. Carrying this processfurther, the relationship between these risk factors and the value of an overall portfolio can beobtained by summing the relationships for the individual underlying assets. With the processingpower of modern computers, it is now possible to estimate the joint probability distribution ofmany risk factors and, given this distribution, to simulate the probability distributions of lossesfor large, complex portfolios.Over the past decade or so, the largest banking organizations have investedsubstantial sums to hire the staff and to create the software, databases, and related managementinformation systems to carry out such computations. Most of you are aware of the application ofthis technology in VAR, or “value-at-risk”, models, which are used to estimate loss distributionsfor trading portfolios. More recently, many large banking organizations have begun usingsimilar technologies to measure the credit risk in their loan portfolios. In both applications, themeasurements of overall portfolio risk are used to determine the prices for loans and otherproducts needed to achieve hurdle rates-of-return on shareholder equity, to assess the adequacyof an organization’s overall equity capital, as well as for other management purposes.These efforts to develop more centralized risk management systems are beingdriven by normal competitive pressures to maximize synergies within financial organizations,such as joint-production and cross-selling opportunities involving multiple subsidiaries. This, inturn, is the logical outcome of the organization’s desire to produce and market its products mostefficiently and to achieve the highest risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. Such synergiescannot occur if the parent is merely a passive portfolio investor in its subsidiaries. Reflecting thiseconomic reality, virtually all large bank holding companies are now operated and managed asintegrated units.The trend toward centralized risk management raises some fundamental policyissues for how we should regulate and supervise large, complex banking organizations. Chiefamong these, this trend raises serious doubts regarding suggestions that we rely solely ondecentralized “functional regulation” as we move to expand further the permissible activities ofbanking organizations. The traditional view of the functional approach to regulating a bankingorganization would involve a bank regulator supervising the insured bank, the SEC supervisingany broker/dealer subsidiary, a state insurance department supervising any insurance subsidiary,and so on. Each functional regulator would look only at the risk management practices of theregulated entity under its supervision; unregulated subsidiaries, including the parent, would beunsupervised.Before technology advanced to a point where substantial oversight and control oflarge banking organizations could be consolidated at the parent level, functional regulationconformed with practical limitations on the abilities of managers to coordinate resources, andevaluate risks, for the organizations as a whole. In essence, a decentralized approach toBIS Review   50/1997
- 4 -regulation followed from the decentralized financial decisionmaking process of its day. Toborrow a concept from architecture: form followed function.In today’s world, however, the “form”, decentralized regulation, no longerfollows the “function”, centralized risk management. Almost by definition, the synergies uponwhich centralized management is predicated imply that neither a subsidiary’s economiccondition on a going-concern basis nor its exposure to potential risks can be evaluatedindependently of the condition and management policies of the consolidated organization.Regulation must fit the architecture of what is being regulated.To give one example, it is common for complex banking organizations to managethe relationships with large customers centrally, even though the underlying cash management,credit, or capital markets services provided to the customer may transcend several subsidiaries.Under this framework, the way the organization’s internal transfer pricing system allocatescosts, revenues, and risks to a specific regulated entity may be somewhat arbitrary, or evenmisleading. Yet, a functional regulator -- looking only at the entity under its supervision --generally would have insufficient information to validate the reasonableness of these allocations.A purely decentralized regulatory approach would also greatly diminish ourability to evaluate and contain potential systemic disruptions in the financial system, since noregulator would be responsible for monitoring the consolidated banking organization. We shouldremember that one of the primary motivations of a society having a central bank and a safety netis precisely to limit systemic risk. Partly in recognition of the fact that financial organizationsare managed on a consolidated basis, financial markets generally view them as single economicentities. Thus, troubles in the nongovernment-regulated portion of a bank holding companycannot be expected to leave the government-regulated subsidiaries unscathed. In a worst casescenario, problems in one part of an organization could precipitate a run at a healthy affiliatebank and could even generate spillover effects onto nonaffiliated banks.It is worth noting that recent deposit insurance and depositor preferencelegislation may increase these concerns, by exposing uninsured creditors of banks to a greaterrisk of loss than in the past. While these new initiatives have the significant benefit ofstrengthening market discipline, they may also induce some additional systemic risks, even forhealthy banks, in periods characterized by heightened levels of economic uncertainty. We don’thave much experience, yet, in operating under these new ground rules.For all of these reasons, I believe we must continue to have some type of umbrellasupervision for banking organizations, especially for the largest and most complex organizationsthat pose the greatest systemic risk concerns. In my judgment, therefore, the critical challenge isto develop approaches to implementing umbrella supervision that are effective in limitingsystemic risk without distorting economic incentives or being unduly burdensome to bankingorganizations.Innovation, Uncertainty, and Bank SupervisionIf history is our guide, market innovations -- with or without supportinglegislation -- will continue to stimulate financial modernization. As this process unfolds, we canexpect banking organizations to undertake an increasing number of financial activities. Underthese circumstances, policymakers face a very difficult tradeoff: namely, balancing the need forfinancial stability and umbrella supervision, on the one hand, against our desire to avoidextending bank-like regulation and the safety net over these new activities.BIS Review   50/1997
- 5 -In addressing this tradeoff, policymakers also have an obligation to consider thepotential effects of their policies, unintended as well as intended, on the process of financialinnovation. Technological progress has been a critical element in rising living standards. This isnot surprising, because the creation and diffusion of innovations have represented voluntarydecisions by individuals and firms acting in their own self-interests. Government policies alwayspose some risk of misdirecting or distorting this process by interfering with normal competitivemarket mechanisms. This concern is particularly relevant to the financial sector, whoseinnovations seem to be especially attuned to the risk-return incentives created by the safety netand regulatory policies.Designing government policies that minimize the potentially disruptive effects onprivate incentives to innovate is complicated by how little we really understand the process ofinnovation and technological change. Forecasting the direction or pace of technological changehas proved to be especially precarious over the generations, even for relatively mature industries.While uncertainty is inherent in any creative process, Nathan Rosenberg ofStanford suggests that even after an innovation’s technical feasibility has been clearlyestablished, its ultimate effect on society is often highly unpredictable. He notes at least twosources of this uncertainty. First, the range of applications for a new technology may not beimmediately apparent. For instance, Alexander Graham Bell initially viewed the telephone assolely a business instrument -- merely an enhancement of the telegraph -- for use in transmittingvery specific messages, such as the terms of a contract. Indeed, he offered to sell his telephonepatent to Western Union for only $100,000, but was turned down. Similarly, Guglielmo Marconiinitially overlooked the radio’s value as a public broadcast medium, instead believing itsprincipal application would be in the transmission of point-to-point messages, such as ship-to-ship, where communication by wire was infeasible.A second source of technological uncertainty reflects the possibility that aninnovation’s full potential may be realizable only after extensive improvements, or aftercomplementary innovations in other fields of science. According to Charles Townes, a NobelPrize winner for his work on the laser, the attorneys for Bell Labs initially refused, in the 1960s,to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field oftelecommunications. Only in the 1980s, after extensive improvements in fiber optics technology,did the laser’s importance for telecommunications become apparent.It’s not hard to find examples of such uncertainties within the financial servicesindustry. The evolution of the OTC derivatives market over the past decade has been nothingless than spectacular. But as the theoretical underpinnings of financial arbitrage were beingpublished by Modigliani and Miller in the late 1950s, few observers could have predicted howtheir insights would eventually revolutionize global financial markets. This is because, inaddition to their insights, at least two complementary innovations had to fall into place. The firstwas further conceptual advances in contingent claims theory, such as the Black-Scholes optionpricing model. The second was several generations of advances in computer andcommunications technologies that were necessary to make these concepts computationallypracticable.Given the high degree of uncertainty inherent in the development of new productsand processes, policymakers should be cautious when attempting to anticipate the future path ofinnovation, or the effects new regulations may have on innovation. There are several aspects tothis interaction between government policies and market innovation. First, bankingorganizations may develop new products or innovations to exploit regulatory “loopholes”, orBIS Review   50/1997
- 6 -they may decline to develop new products whose likely regulatory treatments are viewed asburdensome or unclear. Another unintended consequence is that a policy action may establish aninappropriate unofficial government standard for how certain activities should be conducted. Incontrast to government standards, which can be extremely difficult to change, when the privatesector adopts a standard that subsequently becomes outmoded, market forces generally can beexpected to remedy the situation.The history of retail electronic payments provides a useful illustration. In the1970s, when many were heralding the advent of a “cashless society”, the Federal Reserve andthe Treasury played an important role in developing and promoting what was seen as a keycomponent of this vision -- the automated clearinghouse system. Now, twenty years later, weknow that while the ACH has been successful in some areas, it has failed to replace a substantialportion of the daily flow of paper checks in the economy. This experience leads me to concludethat the experimentation with innovative electronic payment methods that we are seeing today inthe private sector is likely to have a much better chance of meeting the needs of consumers andbusinesses than did the government-led initiatives two decades ago.Within the context of banking regulation, concerns about setting a potentiallyinappropriate regulatory standard were an important factor in the decision by the bankingagencies several years ago not to incorporate interest rate risk and asset concentration risk intothe formal risk-based capital standards. In the end, we became convinced that the technologiesfor measuring and managing interest rate risk and concentration risk were evolving so rapidlythat any regulatory standard would quickly become outmoded or, worse, inhibit private marketinnovations. Largely for these reasons, ultimately we chose to address the relationship betweenthese risks and capital adequacy through the supervisory process.I believe that in many cases, policymakers can reduce potential distortions bystructuring policies to be more “incentive-compatible” -- that is, by working with, rather thanaround, the profit-maximizing goals of investors and firm managers. In light of the underlyinguncertainties illustrated in my earlier examples, I readily acknowledge this is often easier saidthan done. Nevertheless, I believe some useful guiding principles can be formulated.The first guiding principle is that, where possible, we should attempt to strengthenmarket discipline, without compromising financial stability. As financial transactions becomeincreasingly rapid and complex, I believe we have no choice but to harness market forces, asbest we can, to reinforce our supervisory objectives. The appeal of market-led discipline lies notonly in its cost-effectiveness and flexibility, but also in its limited intrusiveness and its greateradaptability to changing financial environments.Measures to enhance market discipline involve providing private investors theincentives and the means to reward good bank performance and penalize poor performance.Expanded risk management disclosures by financial institutions is a significant step in thisdirection. In addition, Congress has undertaken important initiatives, including a nationaldepositor preference statute and the least-cost resolution and prompt corrective action provisionsof the FDIC Improvement Act. Of course, the value of these initiatives will depend on thecredibility of regulators in implementing the legislative mandates consistently over time.A second guiding principle is that, to the extent possible, our regulatory policiesshould attempt to simulate what would be the private market’s response in the absence of thesafety net. Such a principle suggests that supervisory and regulatory policies, like marketresponses, should be capable of evolving over time, along with changes in institutional practicesBIS Review   50/1997
- 7 -and financial technologies. Almost certainly, such a principle implies that we avoid lockingourselves into formulaic, one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring and affecting bank safety andsoundness. For example, as a bank’s internal systems for measuring and managing market,credit, and operating risks improve with advances in technology and finance, our supervisorypolicies should become more tailored to that bank’s specific needs and internal managementprocesses.Recently, we have taken several steps that attempt to operationalize this concept,including the introduction of an internal models approach to assessing capital for market risks inlarge banks’ trading accounts. Also, as I am sure most of you are aware, the Board is currentlypilot-testing with the New York Clearing House Association an alternative capital allocationprocedure for market risk, called the “pre-commitment” approach. The pre-commitmentapproach would permit capital requirements for market risk to reflect not only the estimates ofrisk derived from a bank’s internal market-risk model, but also other features of the bank’strading risk management system that help limit its overall risk exposure -- such as theeffectiveness of its internal controls and other risk-management tools.ConclusionsOver the last three decades, the folly of attempting to legislate or regulate againstthe primal forces of the market is one of the most fundamental lessons learned by bankingregulators. If those market forces are driving financial firms toward centralized decisionmakingregarding risk, pricing, and other operational issues, it will be difficult, at best, to implement adecentralized approach to prudential regulation, however attractive its apparent simplicity.Similarly, in the face of continual market-driven innovations in banks’ risk measurement andmanagement systems, regulatory approaches based on rigid, one-size-fits-all rules are likely tobecome quickly outdated, ineffectual, and, worse, potentially counterproductive.Incentive-compatible regulation, flexibly constructed and applied, is the logicalalternative to an increasingly complex system of rigid rules and regulations that inevitably haveunintended consequences, including possible deleterious effects on the innovation process.While I have discussed some examples of incentive-compatible regulation that appear to beworking, we have a very long way to go. For example, banking regulators have yet to reach aconsensus on some of the most basic questions associated with prudential supervision --questions such as what is an appropriate conceptual basis for assessing a financial institution’soverall risk exposure, how should such risk exposures be measured, and if we use internalmanagement models for such measurements, how can these models be validated? The revolutionin risk measurement techniques makes the answers to these questions approachable but notwithout significant effort on the part of the regulators and the financial industry itself.I am confident that all parties are both willing and able to solve the challengesthat confront us. It is clearly in our mutual self-interest to do so. Our success will preserve notonly the benefits of the most competitive and innovative financial markets in the world, but alsothe benefits of financial stability that are critical to our economy.BIS Review   50/1997
Mr. Greenspan discusses financial reform and the importance of the StateCharter   Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the annual meeting and Conference of State Bank Supervisors held in SanDiego, California on 3/5/97.I am pleased once again to address this annual meeting of the Conference of StateBank Supervisors. Before I begin, I would like to join his colleagues in wishing Bob Richard well.Over the years, it has been a pleasure to work with him. He will be sorely missed.Today, I shall concentrate my remarks on the current debate in Congress andelsewhere on how best to accomplish financial reform. This subject has been a recurring theme inFederal Reserve comments, speeches, and testimonies during the first part of 1997 and, I suspect, thesubject will continue to engage us for some months ahead. My remarks today will reemphasize someof the points made at other venues this year, although I will attempt to place these arguments in thecontext of the impact of financial reform on the state-chartered banks and on the roles such banks,and their regulators, play in maintaining the overall well-being of our banking system and oureconomy.To begin, there does appear to be general agreement on the need for financial reform.Permitting various financial businesses to be conducted jointly should provide the benefits ofincreased services and/or lower prices to financial customers, improved risk reduction, and costsavings for financial firms. More broadly, it should improve the efficiency and stability of thefinancial system that underlies our economy. These benefits are expected to flow primarily fromopportunities for diversification, non-interest cost reduction, and cross-marketing for those banks,investment banks, and insurance companies that find ways to profitably merge their businesses in thewake of legislation permitting expanded powers for banking organizations.But the longer financial reform is delayed, the less important and useful it will be. Putin economist’s jargon, the longer the delay the lower the marginal economic benefits produced byreform legislation, and the more we should be concerned instead with possible unintended negativeeffects that might outweigh those marginal benefits. Let me explain.Financial markets, as we all should know by now, have a way of effectivelycircumventing uneconomic barriers or bottlenecks created by inefficient legislation or regulation.Today, it has become possible, through the judicious use of derivative instruments, for a financialfirm engaged primarily in one kind of financial activity to mimic the risks and returns of any otherfinancial activity. Banking, investment banking, and insurance can no longer be viewed, from arisk-return perspective, as separate and distinct lines of business. To cite just one example, banks areprohibited from underwriting insurance, yet the writing of a put option -- a form of derivative activityengaged in widely by large banks -- is, in economic substance, a form of insurance underwriting.Other derivative markets, including the emerging credit derivative instruments, now permit banks todiversify their credit and market risks as if they had been permitted to merge with investment banksor insurance companies. Thus, some of the long-sought-after economic benefits resulting from therepeal of legislative barriers between and among different “types” of financial firm already have beenachieved through the creativity of the marketplace. Nevertheless, by not being able to engage directlyin the impermissible activity, a banking company cannot achieve the production or marketingsynergies, and therefore the cost reductions, that may flow from joint operations and that may benefita bank’s shareholders as well as its customers.In addition to the actions of the marketplace, banking regulators have acted, within theconstraints of statute, to facilitate economic combinations of banking and nonbanking financialactivities. Specifically, the Federal Reserve has adopted both liberalization of Section 20 activitiesand expedited procedures for processing applications under Regulation Y. The OCC, meanwhile, hasBIS Review   49/1997
- 2 -generated some controversy by liberalizing banks’ insurance agency powers as well as proceduresgenerally for establishing operating subsidiaries of national banks that may engage in activities notpermitted to the bank.This is not to say that financial reform legislation will have no marginal benefit.Clearly, in addition to the benefit of lowered costs, much remains to be accomplished in the form ofimproved management efficiency. These benefits, which will accrue both to the banks and the generalpublic, probably can be maximized only within the context of clear legislative authority forcombining financial firms of various types. We must be careful, however, in our efforts to achieve thebenefits of financial reform, not to violate the tenets of good public policy. In this regard, the FederalReserve believes that any financial reform should be consistent with four basic objectives:(1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risk;(3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard andthe subsidy implicit in the federal safety net. I have spent a good deal of time of late on the fourthobjective. Therefore, today I will concentrate on the first three and how, in particular, financialreform must be careful to preserve the role of the state-chartered bank in meeting our economy’smacroeconomic objectives and our concerns regarding systemic risk.The importance of the state-chartered bankSome erroneously dismiss state-chartered banks as representing only the down-scaleend of the banking market and, therefore, being not particularly worthy of careful policyconsideration. State-chartered banks indeed are smaller on average than national banks, and aredisproportionately represented within the very smallest size class. Nevertheless, state-chartered banksaccount for about a third of our superregionals, not to mention a few state banks that are among thevery largest money center institutions. Even the preponderance of small, state-chartered banks,however, play a critical role within our financial system, for several reasons.First, having large numbers of community-sized banks, be they state-chartered ornational banks, is a major contribution to the stability of the banking system and the well-being of themacroeconomy. Just as a more highly diversified loan portfolio reduces risk to the individual bank, amore highly diversified banking structure reduces risk to the banking system as a whole. Indeed, ourdecentralized and diverse banking structure was arguably the key to weathering the financial crisis ofthe late 1980s. During those dark days, our system was able to absorb more than a thousand U.S.bank failures. And yet here we are, less than a decade later, with loan loss reserves and bank capitalat their highest levels in almost a half century, and the insurance fund restored to its maximumcoverage ratio -- all without cost to the taxpayer. Of course, the bank failures of the past decade,combined with the current wave of mergers and acquisitions, have served to reduce significantly thetotal number of banking organizations in the U.S. But the more than 7,000 separate bankingcompanies that remain are more than sufficient to maintain our highly decentralized and flexiblebanking structure.Large numbers of small banks go hand in hand with a macroeconomy characterizedby large numbers of small, entrepreneurial nonfinancial businesses. Smaller banks traditionally havebeen a major source of capital for small businesses that may not have access to securities markets. Inturn, small businesses account for the major portion of new employment and new ideas, therebyplaying a major role in fueling economic growth.This connection running between small banks, small business, and the macroeconomy-- indeed the role of banks generally in funding business expansion -- is so important that we must besensitive to the tradeoff between risk-taking and bank solvency. Risk-taking -- prudent risk-taking tobe sure -- is the primary economic function of banking. All wealth is measured by its perceivedability to produce goods and services of value in the future. Since the future is fundamentallyBIS Review   49/1997
- 3 -unknown, endeavoring to create wealth implies an uncertain expectation of how the future willunfold. That is, creating wealth is risky.Hence banking, to further its primary economic purpose of financing the economy,cannot and should not avoid prudent risk-taking. Bank supervisors, in turn, need to recognize that theoptimal bank failure rate is not zero. A zero failure rate over time implies either extraordinary insightby bankers, a notion I readily dismiss, or an undue and unhelpful degree of conservatism in bankingpractice. In taking on risk, of course, some mistakes will be made, and some banks will fail. Even if abank is well-managed, it can simply become unlucky. Failure should occur, indeed does occur, aspart of the natural process within our competitive economy. It should not be viewed as a flaw in ourfinancial system, and certainly we should not attempt to eliminate it. Only when the failure ratethreatens to breach a prudent threshold should we become concerned.Just as large numbers of smaller banks are a key to the robustness of our economy,the state charter is a key to the robustness of our banking structure. The dual banking system hasfostered a steady stream of banking innovations that have benefited consumers and bank shareholdersalike. For example, the NOW account, as I like to point out, was invented at a state-chartered bank;and the NOW account was the opening shot in the campaign to remove national deposit interest ratecontrols and allow banks to compete on common ground with nonbank institutions such as moneyfunds. The 1994 interstate branching statute likewise has its origin in the state laws that permittedcross-border banking, beginning with the rewriting of the Maine banking laws. Adjustable ratemortgages are another innovation that began at the state level, and of course, the National BankingAct itself has its origin in the states’ “free banking” laws of the nineteenth century.The dual banking system not only fosters and preserves innovation but alsoconstitutes our main protection against overly zealous and rigid federal regulation and supervision. Abank must have a choice of more than one federal regulator, must be permitted to change charters, toprotect itself against arbitrary and capricious regulatory behavior. Naturally, some observers areconcerned that two or more federal agencies will engage in a “competition in laxity”, and we mustguard against that; but the greater danger, I believe, is that a single federal regulator would becomerigid and insensitive to the needs of the marketplace. Thus, so long as we have a federal guarantee ofdeposits, Federal Reserve guarantee of intraday payments over Fedwire, and other elements of thesafety net -- and, therefore, so long as there is a need for federal regulation of banks -- suchregulation should entail a choice of that regulator at the federal level.As you are well aware, the Federal Reserve has long been a strong supporter of thedual banking system in the context of efficient supervision. That is why we, along with the FDIC,have sought examination partnerships with the state banking regulators. Currently, the Fed hascooperative agreements with about three dozen states, calling for either joint examinations oralternate year exams. Overall, our experience with these programs has been quite positive, in partbecause of the quality of state supervision in the states with the cooperative agreements. Indeed, theevidence suggests that safety and soundness of state banks compare quite favorably with nationalbanks, possibly reflecting the benefits of having both state and federal supervision. For example,during the banking crisis of the late 1980s, when the failure rate by any measure breached the prudentthreshold I mentioned earlier, the national bank failure rate was considerably greater than for statebanks. While bank failure is determined by more than just the supervision process, these datanevertheless speak well of the quality of the state supervisory process and the ability of the state andfederal regulators to function together efficiently.The dual banking system, however, despite its advantages and achievements, is underattack. This attack is neither particularly intentional nor particularly coordinated, but rather consistsof the unintended consequences of statutory and regulatory changes aimed at achieving broaderpolicy objectives. I am referring primarily to the consequences of the 1994 interstate branchingBIS Review   49/1997
- 4 -legislation, coupled with the OCC’s recent liberalization of regulatory procedures for operatingsubsidiaries of national banks. These events may have served to tip the balance in favor of nationalbanks, so to speak, in a manner that weakens banks’ ability to switch federal regulators withoutincurring prohibitive real economic costs. In particular, while most state-chartered banks willcontinue to operate on an intrastate basis in local markets, regional and nationwide banks may findthat state charters are burdensome to the extent that the banks are forced to operate under varyingregulatory rules and procedures across multiple states. If that burden were to become excessive,banks with interstate operations -- especially interstate retail operations -- would likely turn to thenational charter on grounds of simple expediency. For example, I am struck by the fact that the verylargest state-chartered banks among the money center institutions are without significant retailoperations or without announced intentions to expand retail banking beyond their home states. Therest of the large state-chartered banks, those with assets over $10 billion, consist mainly of lead banksin multi-bank, multi-state holding companies. It seems likely that some of these institutions will seekto consolidate their interstate retail operations under a national bank charter after interstate branchingbecomes fully operational, unless countervailing forces emerge.The evident superiority of the national charter is not a foregone conclusion, however.For example, the Federal Reserve this past month approved an application by a superregional bankingcompany to consolidate its retail branches in four states under a single state-chartered bankheadquartered in Alabama. The consolidation would become effective on or after June 1, 1997, whenthe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act becomes operational. Another positive indication of theresiliency of the state charter has been the establishment of the State-Federal Working Group. Thiscooperative effort involving the states, the CSBS, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC is contributingimportantly to the strengthening of the supervision of state-chartered institutions through a number ofinitiatives, including the adoption of the State/Federal Protocol. The Protocol and the NationwideSupervisory Agreement of 1996 spell out the principles and specific actions that would lead to aseamless supervision and examination of interstate, state-chartered banks. Other initiatives of theState-Federal Working Group include greater examination emphasis on bank risk managementprocesses, a more formalized, risk-focused approach to examination, and expanded and moreeffective use of information technology. It would also be extremely helpful, especially if enactedprior to interstate branching becoming fully operational, if the Congress were to pass the so-calledhome state rule, which would place state-chartered banks on an equal footing with national bankswith regard to permissible activities of branches in a host state.Systemic Risk and the Role of the Federal ReserveBy now, we are all acutely aware that the process of “financial reform” is a complexone, with intended and unintended consequences flowing from almost every act of the legislator orregulator. I have focused today on only two aspects of the debate over financial reform, albeit twovery important aspects -- the need to maintain our uniquely decentralized banking system, with itsreliance on large numbers of relatively small institutions, and the desirability of retaining the dualbanking system, with its implicit choice of regulator. Let me conclude by turning to another importantfacet of the debate over financial reform -- the role of the Federal Reserve in containing systemic risk.It is critical that we guard against diminution of this role as yet another unintended consequence offinancial reform.The risk of systemwide disruptions, for better or for worse, is importantly determinedby the actions or inactions of our largest, most complex banking organizations. The architects offinancial reform, therefore, must necessarily consider how best to supervise risk-taking at these largeorganizations and, in particular, whether there should be significant umbrella or consolidatedsupervision of the banking company.BIS Review   49/1997
- 5 -In the past, holding company supervision was concentrated at the bank level, not onlybecause the bank tended to constitute the bulk of risk-taking activities but also because the holdingcompany tended to manage the bank separately from the various nonbank activities of theorganization. More recently, however, the focus of supervision of holding companies by the FederalReserve has been modified to reflect changes in management procedures -- holding companies nowtend to manage risk on a consolidated basis across all their bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Risk andprofitability measurements, including, for example, risk-adjusted return on capital calculations, mostoften are made by business line rather than on a subsidiary basis. As banks engage in new orexpanded nonbanking activity in the wake of financial reform, it is likely that these activities toowould be managed on a consolidated basis. For this reason, and because supervisors recognize thatscarce examination resources are often most effectively employed by focusing on risk managementprocesses, our determination of an institution’s safety and soundness increasingly will be based on ananalysis of the decisionmaking and internal control processes for the total organization.Such umbrella supervision need not be in any significant way “intrusive”, nor shouldfinancial firms be burdened by the extension of bank-like regulation and supervision to their nonbankactivities. For some time, the focus of the Fed’s inspections of nonbanking activities of bank holdingcompanies has been to assess the strengths of the individual units and their interrelations with oneanother and with the bank. Emphasis is placed on the adequacy of risk measurement andmanagements systems, as well as internal control systems, and only if there is a major deficiency inthese areas should the inspection of the nonbank activities become at all intrusive. We intend that thisphilosophy of holding company supervision will not change as banks are granted extended powers.Finally, I should note that some have questioned not only the need for umbrellasupervision but also the need for the Fed’s involvement in such supervision. It is primarily theresponsibility of the Federal Reserve to maintain the stability of our overall financial system,including the interconnections between the domestic financial system and world financial markets.This obligation to protect against systemic disruptions cannot be met solely via open marketoperations and use of the discount window, as powerful as these tools may be.If the past is any guide, financial crises of the future will be unpredictable and uniquein nature. The globalization of financial and real markets means that a foreign crisis can impact on thedomestic financial system, and vice versa. Our ability to respond quickly and decisively to anysystemic threat depends critically on the experience and expertise of the central bank with regard tothe institutional detail of the U.S. and foreign financial systems, including our familiarity withpayments and settlement systems. Thus, in order to carry out our systemic obligation, the FederalReserve must be directly involved in the supervision of banks of all sizes and must, in particular, beable to address the problems of large banking companies if one or more of their activities constitute athreat to the stability of the financial system.ConclusionsThe concerns I have outlined today demonstrate the necessity that the central bankmaintain appropriate supervisory authority and, as I hope I have made clear, this authority is bestexercised within the current context of the dual banking system, a system that has served us so wellover the generations. Financial reform clearly is needed, but financial reform should not beinterpreted to mean regulatory reform for its own sake. I am hopeful that reasoned financial reform,based on sound tenets of public policy, can be achieved in a manner that preserves the bestcomponents of the current system while introducing the improvements that are long overdue.BIS Review   49/1997
Mr. Duisenberg discusses the comparisons between the structures andmethods of the European System of Central Banks and the US Federal Reserve SystemAddress held by the President of the Netherlands Bank and of the Bank for InternationalSettlements, Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, at the Spring Meeting of the Institute of International Financein Washington on 29/4/97.1. Only twenty months to go before EMU takes off; before then, in the summer of1998 at the latest, the ESCB will be established.  The preparations for this turning-point in thehistory of Europe are in full swing.  Next year it will be decided which Member States are to bein from the outset, a decision to be taken as you know by the Heads of Government on the basisof the measure of sustained convergence achieved.  Although the stability-oriented traditionwhich has grown up over the years is to be continued within EMU, there will be a fundamentalchange in the way monetary policy will be determined centrally.  Here questions arise, such as:how will the centre, i.e. the ECB, and the existing national central banks relate to each other insuch a context, and how can the skills and expertise of those national central banks best be used,without impairing the single nature of monetary policy?  It is these questions that I would like tofocus on today.  As the ESCB will have a federal structure comparable to that of the FederalReserve System, it may be useful to take a look at the experience of the United States, all themore so as the underlying economies will be comparable in size.  In particular, what lessons canEurope learn from this experience?2. Let me emphasize a few points at the outset.  On its own, monetary policy isnot equipped to counter an unfavourable macro-economic development.  That calls for theconcerted employment of all available macro-economic policy instruments.  In the Americansituation, the Fed is expected to operate within the framework of the general economicobjectives set by the Administration.  Coordination is facilitated by the centralized formulationof monetary policy.  In a monetary union such as the United States and the future EMU, policycan only be pursued centrally.  It is indivisible by its very nature, for one thing because of itsofficial interest rates, subjecting all regions making up the union to uniform financial conditions.As to the question how monetary policy can best be conducted, there is no unequivocal answer.That question relates to issues such as the economic variables on which policy should focus, orin other words, the choice of intermediate objective.  In some countries, Germany among them,policy is targeted at a monetary aggregate, while in others a strategy of direct inflation targetingis pursued.  Alternatively, monetary authorities may focus on a range of economic indicators, asis done in the United States.  I will not go into the pros and cons of these methods here today.  Inthe European context, the EMI has concluded that in practice the differences between the variouspolicy strategies that could be pursued by the ESCB are not as large as in theory.  A decision isto be taken by the ECB on this point next year.3.  Looking at the structure of the Fed, we see three components, specifically theBoard of Governors, the regional reserve banks and the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC).  The FOMC issues a periodic guideline for monetary policy, while the Board serves asthe executive body.  It is empowered to adjust policy, within the mandate provided by theFOMC, when necessary in the period between FOMC meetings.  Thanks to a rotation system,the reserve banks are involved in FOMC decision-making on an alternating basis.  TheAmerican legislature obviously meant the Fed to have a decentralized structure, in which theregional reserve banks can each have their say.  The aim was to prevent Fed policy-makers fromcatering unduly to the wishes of either the financial centre, i.e. New York, or the political hub,i.e. Washington.  In spite of the decentralized nature of the Federal Reserve System, however, acertain specialization tendency has increasingly developed over the years, due in part totechnological innovations and market developments.  Take, for instance, the operations ensuingBIS Review   46/1997
- 2 -from the Fed’s monetary tasks, such as money and foreign exchange market interventions.These are effected in their entirety in New York.  In other areas, too, such as the paymentssystem, the reserve banks have developed their own specializations.4.  In determining monetary policy, the Fed relies on regional input.  The reservebanks contribute to policy through their role in the discussions and the number of votes they cancast (five out of a total of twelve) at FOMC meetings.  At these meetings no fixed policyproposals are presented in advance, the aim being an open discussion where the various partiesreach agreement through mutual persuasion. Any decision should, after all, be endorsed by asmany parties as possible.  Obviously, in this American context, the chairman must be someoneof considerable stature.  I believe that involving the reserve banks in policy-making and in theefforts to expound that policy to the folks back home is the right way to go about things,reinforcing as it does the cohesion within the system.5.  In short, the Fed operates what is in my view a well-balanced model ofmonetary decision-making.  Though policy is conducted centrally, the various interests of theseparate regions are not overlooked.  The System is furthermore capable of reacting adroitly, asevidenced by the United States’ long-term record of strong economic growth and modestinflation.6.  How does everything I have just said translate to the future situation inEurope?  As in the United States, policy in Europe will be determined centrally andimplemented, where possible and appropriate, decentrally.  In Europe, too, an institutionaldivision into three components will be instituted.  Specifically, the ESCB will be made up ofthree elements, the ECB Executive Board, responsible for day-to-day policy, the ESCB Council,made up of this Board and the governors of the national central banks, and the national centralbanks themselves.  There are considerable similarities between this structure and that of the Fed,made up of the Board of Governors, the FOMC and the reserve banks.  Yet the emphasis will,on some issues, be placed differently.7.  One difference concerns voting arrangements within the ESCB Council, whichare not the same as those within the FOMC.  In the ESCB Council the votes of the nationalcentral banks, represented by their governors, will predominate over those of the ExecutiveBoard.  In the FOMC, it is the votes of the centre, i.e. the Board of Governors, which representthe majority.  This means that if effective decisions are to be arrived at in Europe, the nationalcentral bank governors will have to be like-minded; in other words, policy-makers will have toabandon their purely national outlooks, exchanging them for a “European perspective”.  Theexperience of the FOMC shows that is can be achieved.  The ESCB will have the important taskof helping to foster such a European perspective, with the centre taking the initiative.  TheEuropean outlook will furthermore have to be disseminated among the general public.  AnESCB making an effort to explain and seek understanding for its policy decisions will generatesupport for its actions.  This is a task for the national central banks, whose historical ties to theirown peoples are deeply rooted.  In this respect it should also be kept in mind that the Fed’saccountability to Congress has no equivalent in Europe.  Although the President of the ESCB isexpected to appear periodically before the European Parliament, the latter does not have thesame powers as the US Congress, which can in principle amend the Federal Reserve Act.Furthermore, any discussion of the European policy mix will be different in nature becausebudgetary policy will remain the province of the European Member States.  This policy will,however, be subject to the limitations set out in the Stability Pact recently agreed by the MemberStates, which as you know aims to foster sustained sound public finances in Europe.BIS Review   46/1997
- 3 -8.  What I have just said about the need to develop a “European” perspective hasimplications for monetary and economic analysis.  The centre will need to have at its disposalconsiderable analytical machinery in order to be able to perform this pioneering rolesuccessfully.  As a system of European statistics and analysis cannot be set up overnight, no timeshould be lost.  Indeed, the preparations being made at the EMI in this area are proceeding at fullsteam.  Of course, these new statistics will take getting used to.  But, at the same time, somethings will remain unchanged.  National analyses will continue to play an important role so longas Europe has not been transformed into a single economy.  After all, if we wish to understandwhat is happening at the European level, we would be well advised also to look at the underlyingnational economic relationships.  With respect to these analytical tasks, the division of labourbetween the centre and the national central banks is likely to evolve of its own accord.  At firstglance, this division seems likely to reflect that the national central banks know their owneconomies best.9.  Contrary to the US situation, the implementation of monetary policy in Europewill not take place at one location away from the centre but, where possible and appropriate,decentrally.  That has to do with the fact that Europe’s central banks and financial markets havea rich and extensive history.  A decentral approach makes allowance for differences in Europeanpractices and market conditions.  In this context it should be noted that the formulation chosenfor decentralization in Europe in principle allows for the ECB to play a role in policyimplementation.  There is no knowing in advance how the tasks will be divided among thenational central banks themselves, and between them and the centre in the more distant future.The American example shows us that such matters cannot be laid down in a blueprint foreternity.  Decentralization is a sound principle to cater to initial national differences in thefinancial markets, but it must not stand in the way of further integration.  In other words, policymust accommodate the disappearance of national financial market characteristics and theemergence of a single integrationa European money and capital market.10.  EMU will remain a union of different countries.  This means, among otherthings, that the differences prevailing among the various central banks regarding theirnon-monetary tasks can, in principle, continue to exist.  I am referring here, for instance, tobanking supervision, surveillance of payment systems, and the fiscal agent function for thebenefit of the Government.  It is interesting to see that in the United States, where such mattershave been organized in a uniform manner, some degree of specialization has emerged among theregional reserve banks.  Owing to the continuing existence of national responsibilities andpractices, this extent of specialization will not be feasible in Europe.11.  I have arrived at the conclusion of my address.  Like the Federal ReserveSystem, the ESCB will be characterized by central and decentral elements.  However, the mixwill not be the same, due to differences in the starting position, as well as in social and politicalconditions.  Yet the experience of the Federal Reserve System offers instructive insights.  Ithighlights the importance of “homogenous” thinking  within the system, and of focusing on theEuropean perspective, without disregarding regional developments.  It will be a challenge for usin Europe to ensure that a similar balance is achieved within the ESCB.BIS Review   46/1997
Bank of Japan presents its quarterly economic outlook for spring 1997BANK OF JAPAN, QUARTERLY BULLETIN, May 1997 (advance summary).1.Japan’s economy continues on a recovery trend despite some fluctuationscaused by the rise in the consumption tax rate, with private demand showing underlyingfirmness.  Among final demand items, public-sector investment has decreased, and housinginvestment has declined reflecting the reversal in the stepped-up demand which took place aheadof the rise in the consumption tax rate.  However, net exports have continued on an increasingtrend, and business fixed investment has been rising steadily.  Personal consumption is on amoderate recovery trend.  Meanwhile, inventories are generally at appropriate levels.  In thesecircumstances, industrial production has been strengthening since autumn 1996.  Labor marketconditions have been improving moderately on the whole.Prices have stopped declining. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonalelectricity rates) increased in early April 1997 reflecting the rise in the consumption tax rate.However,  the downward pressures remain strong on those such as electrical machinery.  Despitethese pressures, domestic wholesale prices have remained unchanged or have increasedmarginally.  This reflects the yen’s depreciation and the higher oil prices to date, as well as themoderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions.  The year-to-year declines incorporate service prices are narrowing, and consumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables)are marginally above the previous year’s level.  With respect to commercial land prices, pricesof large and well-located land suited for major developments have stopped declining, whilethose of land less suited for use have continued to decline.  As for residential land, prices havegradually stopped declining.  On the balance of payments, the real trade surplus has been on anincreasing trend, and the nominal current-account surplus has also increased, albeit verymoderately.2.In the financial markets, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) rosetemporarily around the fiscal year-end, but has since declined to the level slightly below theofficial discount rate of 0.5 per cent.  The 3-month CD rate has continued at around 0.50 - 0.55per cent except for the fiscal year-end.  The long-term government bond yield has beendeclining since summer 1996, and has recently moved at a low level of 2.1 - 2.2 per cent.  Stockprices plummeted between the end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997, and have recently stayedat somewhat over  ¥18,000.  On the foreign exchange market, the yen has been depreciatingagainst the U.S. dollar since mid-1995, and has recently moved at around  ¥125 - 126.Lending by private financial institutions has continued to be lackluster.  Growthin monetary aggregates has continued at around 3.0 - 4.0 per cent, but it has declined somewhatcompared to summer 1996.3.Looking at individual components of final demand, public-sectorinvestment is expected to follow a declining trend, although it may be supported for the timebeing by implementation of the government’s supplementary budget for fiscal 1996.  While bothexports and imports will expand reflecting the progress in international division of labor, netexports are expected to continue increasing owing partly to the yen’s depreciation since mid-1995.With respect to the growth of domestic private demand, corporate profits of largemanufacturing firms are improving steadily, helped partly by the positive effects on exportprices and export volume stimulated by the yen’s depreciation.  Recovery in corporate profitshas spread to nonmanufacturing firms which are closely related to business activities, as well asBIS Review   47/1997
- 2 -to small manufacturing firms.  Business fixed investment is thus expected to increase steadily inmonths ahead, mainly reflecting 1) this improvement in corporate profits, 2) the progress incapital stock adjustments, and 3) the rise in information-related investment.  However, the paceof growth in business fixed investment is unlikely to accelerate significantly as balance-sheetadjustment pressures, for one, remain strong.With respect to the household sector, growth in compensation of employees hasbeen accelerating, mainly in bonus payments and overtime payments.  Although the negativeimpact of the rise in the consumption tax rate is yet uncertain, consumer confidence willstrengthen if growth continues to spread from the corporate sector to the household sector.Personal consumption will thus continue to recover, despite the reversal in the stepped-updemand that occurred prior to the rise in the consumption tax rate.  Meanwhile, any drasticdecline in housing investment is unlikely given present low interest rates, albeit with somereversal of the demand that peaked before the rise in the consumption tax rate.4.Turning to the outlook on prices, there is potential upward pressure onprices reflecting the yen’s depreciation, but they are expected to remain stable for some time.This is because, 1) crude oil prices have begun to weaken, 2) the recovery in domestic supplyand demand conditions has been moderate, and 3) there remains a strong downward pressure onprices owing to technological innovations, particularly in electrical machinery.  However, pricedifferentials between home and abroad have narrowed, and the general sense of weak supply anddemand conditions for products has receded.  Thus, the Bank will monitor more closely futuredevelopments in domestic and overseas supply and demand conditions, as well as in the foreignexchange market.5.In sum, private demand has firmed in a virtuous cycle as growth inproduction is accompanied by growth in incomes, supported partly by the yen’s depreciationwhich augmented corporate profits and net exports.  Thus, although economic growth will slowdown temporarily in the first half of fiscal 1997 with the reversal in the stepped-up demandahead of the rise in the consumption tax, chances are improving that economic recovery turnsout to be sustainable.  However, the extent of the negative effects caused by the rise in theconsumption tax rate, including the reversal in the stepped-up demand, has yet to be confirmed.Also, balance-sheet adjustment pressures may continue to restrain the economic recovery.  Inthese circumstances, promoting effective reforms of Japan’s economic structure is an importantingredient in the efforts to strengthen the basis for recovery in private demand as well as thebasis for a medium to long-term growth in Japan’s economy.BIS Review   47/1997
Mr. Erçel reviews central bank operations in 1996 and discusses thephilosophy of central banks   Remarks by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic ofTurkey, Mr. Gazi Erçel, on the occasion of the 65th Shareholders’ Ordinary General Meeting inAnkara on 15/4/97.I expressed my views concerning the main functions of a central bank in myspeech to last year’s General Assembly. Today I would like to summarize the past year’soperations and share with you my thoughts on the philosophy of central banking.You will find detailed assessments of economic developments in Turkey andabroad in the Bank’s Annual Report for 1996, which has already been distributed to you. Insteadof repeating these details, I will describe the implications of the events of 1996 for theoperations of the Central Bank.The most important circumstance affecting the economy last year was thelong-lasting period of political uncertainty. After the general elections, it took the first sixmonths of the year to put together a coalition government. Political instability, Turkey’s entryinto the Customs Union, and lack of the political determination needed to fight inflation createduncertainty in the financial markets. The Central Bank responded by aiming its monetarypolicies at achieving and protecting stability in the financial markets instead of aiming them atdecreasing the rate of inflation.While withholding announcement of its targets for the second half of 1996, theCentral Bank implemented a monetary program in keeping with its inner discipline. The mainpoints of monetary policy under this program were as follows:·The Central Bank set a ceiling on increases in net domestic assets.·The Central Bank paid close attention to keeping increases in reserve moneyin line with increases in demand. Open market operations were actively usedduring the year to mop up excess liquidity created by the increases in our netforeign assets.·The Central Bank monitored exchange rates throughout the year, with specialattention to maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market.·Continuous domestic borrowing by the Treasury made a positive contributionto achieving all targets.·Turkish lira interests rates were determined mainly by the borrowing strategyof the Treasury. The Turkish Central Bank has played no direct role in thedetermination of interest rates.In an economy with market-determined interest and exchange rates, where apersistent public deficit is being financed mainly through the domestic markets, the monetarypolicy tools available to the central bank are few and of limited effectiveness. As noted above,interest rates are determined primarily by the borrowing activities of the Treasury. By the sametoken, foreign exchange rates are determined as a function of the external trade deficit (itself afunction of growth) and the level of interest rates. Under these conditions, the central bank isabsolutely obliged to keep the items on its balance sheet under careful control.BIS Review   47/1997
- 2 -I would like to point out that efforts since the second half of 1980 to keep thecentral bank’s balance sheet healthy have greatly streamlined control over the items on thatbalance sheet. In 1998, the evaluation account held 45 percent of the assets of analytical balancesheet. In 1996, when it showed a negative balance for the first time, the evaluation account’sshare in the assets of the balance sheet fell to zero. Similarly, foreign assets accounted for 30percent of total assets in 1988, compared to 76 percent in the balance sheet for 1996. In short,the principal source of the increase in central bank assets shifted from increased domestic assetsto increased foreign assets, mainly borrowed.The Central Bank considers controlling the increase in domestic assets to be themost important aspect of its monetary program. Only by controlling the increase in domesticassets can we keep the increase in Turkish lira liabilities in line with increasing demand. The1994 law requiring the Central Bank to gradually phase out its advances of short-term credit tothe Treasury, formerly the main source of domestic assets, has been of great assistance incurbing their increase.The continued lowering of this ceiling in coming years will certainly make itmuch easier for the Central Bank to implement its monetary policy.It is my wish that in the near future, the Turkish Central Bank will see thispractice abolished altogether, as it has been in other modern central banks. The elimination ofCentral Bank credit to the public sector will go far to create the confidence needed to launch thecrucial struggle with inflation.Central banks are responsible for keeping prices stable as well as for ensuring thatthe financial system runs smoothly. A stabilized financial system and stable prices are essentialconditions for steady economic growth in the medium term because only a stable financialsystem can provide the necessary link between savings and investments. Price stability is neededto reduce uncertainties for investors and encourage investments.In the long run, stabilizing prices is likely to increase both living standards andproductivity. For this reason, the price stability that is the main goal of central banks is valid andurgent not only in the short run, but also in the long run. And once countries like ours haveachieved price stability after long effort, they must continue the effort to maintain it. For centralbanks, price stability is a permanent goal.Inflation inflicts several burdens on a society:·Overall, it introduces uncertainty into economic decisions and profit seeking.·It reduces the discipline of price and market systems.·It has negative effects on the cost of capital.·It directs resources to unproductive activities. In periods of high inflation,investments in real estate and financial investments become more desirable.·Growth declines as inflation rises.In countries with high inflation, it has been observed that most resources aredirected to the financial system. It is also known that the financial system undergoes a relativeexpansion during such periods. Resources which have accumulated in the financial systemcannot be rechannelled by the financial system to more productive sectors.BIS Review   47/1997
- 3 -A stable financial system and stable prices therefore represent the normalenvironment that central banks are committed to pursue and maintain. A central bank thatstabilizes prices increases its credibility.A central bank that protects the value of the currency also helps increase thecredibility of the country.The success of the monetary policy implemented to stabilize prices depends onwhether or not the financial system is stable. And the price stability and financial systemstability that are the primary responsibilities of the central bank are necessary for achievingeconomic growth in the medium term.Let me mention some qualities that a central bank should have:·It should have continuity. Central banks should not be diverted from theirpermanent goal of price stability by short-term political pressures.·It should be competent. A central bank should be completely professional. Itshould be technically dedicated in its structure, thorough and clear in itsexpression, and transparent in its actions.·It should be a responsible institution. In other words, it should be an institutionthat is reliable and able to justify its monetary manoeuvres.These are the characteristics of a modern central bank. Central banks that havethese qualities will unquestionably occupy a distinguished place in the international environmentof the 21st century. I am sure that its long experience, accumulated knowledge and proficientstaff make the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey an institution that can fulfil theseexpectations. I am proud of this institution. I owe a great debt of gratitude to my colleagues, whohave greatly contributed to our accomplishments and to our policy implementation.BIS Review   47/1997
Mr. Wellink looks at European economic and monetary cooperation from anhistorical perspective  Address by A.H.E.M. Wellink, an Executive Director of the NetherlandsBank ,on the occasion of AEGEE’s EMU campaign 1997, delivered in Rotterdam on 16/4/97.If everything goes according to schedule, the Economic and Monetary Union -EMU, in short - will start on 1st January 1999. As of that date, the central banks of countrieswhich are part of EMU at that time will join the European Central Bank (ECB), to be located, asyou know, in Frankfurt. From then on, this institution will conduct a monetary policy aimedprimarily at stabilising the internal value of the future single European currency, the euro.When the euro is officially initiated on 1st January 1999 - and I have no doubtthat it will - a process will have been completed which can be considered unique from variouspoints of view. Firstly, because the euro will become the pre-eminent symbol of economic andmonetary union which is taking shape between sovereign states abolishing their nationalcurrency in exchange for a single currency. Secondly, because when it is introduced, the eurowill not immediately be both a unit of account and means of payment: on 1st January 1999 theeuro will become the unit of account, whereas it will not begin to circulate as a concrete,physical means of payment until three years later, on 1st January 2002. Finally, and befitting theage we live in, because the euro will be the first single currency which is available in electronicform right from the start.Hence, the euro marks the completion of a process which is unique from ahistorical perspective. It is this process which I want to discuss with you this afternoon. Not somuch because I was asked to give an outline of economic and monetary cooperation as from theTreaty of Rome to the present day, but particularly to outline the near future. Outlines which areessential to make the euro a lasting success.Travelling from Rome to Amsterdam, where the Maastricht Treaty will shortly bereviewed, we will have to make several stopovers.1.         From Rome to The HagueThere is nothing new about the pursuit of a single European currency. Ideas abouta single currency are mainly rooted in idealistic-political motives. When a single Europeancurrency was propagated in the past, this was usually done in the form of a plea in favour of apolitically united Europe. This idea was also expressed shortly after the end of World War II. Itwas Winston Churchill, who in 1946 in Zürich, argued in favour of “a kind of United States ofEurope”. In April of that same year, the need for a single European currency was voiced by thenew post-war President of the Nederlandsche Bank, Marius Wilhelm Holtrop, who wanted astrong and sound guilder which in due course would merge into one European currency.The past fifty years have shown, that the advent of a single European currencywill certainly not include the “United States of Europe” that Churchill was talking about. Soonafter 1946, Europe became politically divided into Eastern and Western hemispheres due to theCold War. With the foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, WesternEurope took the lead by starting economic cooperation. The objective of the Treaty of Rome, onwhich the EEC was based, was to create a common market between France, West Germany,Italy and the Benelux countries. This objective resulted in a customs union which becameeffective on 1 July 1968. However, the Treaty remained vague about other aspects of economiccooperation. Economic policy, for example, was considered a matter of common interest. AsBIS Review   42/1997
- 2 -regards monetary cooperation, coordination was recommended, the exchange rate policy beingregarded as a matter of common interest as well. The plan for economic integration designed inRome was not an objective in itself. It was based on political grounds. After all, the Treatyaimed at achieving an “ever closer union among the European peoples” through economicintegration.During the 1969 summit in The Hague, representatives of the six Member Statesagreed with the idea of the newly elected German Chancellor Willy Brandt that this had to berealised via Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The then Prime Minister of Luxembourg,Paul Werner, came up with a detailed plan that was named after him. According to this plan,EMU would be materialised in stages. In the final stage, monetary and budgetary competencesof the national states were to be transferred to Community bodies established for that purpose.And so, Werner’s ideas were considerably more far-reaching than the agreements reached inRome thirteen years earlier. Nonetheless, the philosophy of economic integration advocated inRome remained the moving spirit behind political cooperation: “it is true that we need notachieve a European confederation or federation tomorrow. But to arrive at this ultimate goal, wemust first take the step of creating an economic and monetary currency union”, Werner said at apress conference at the time.In the Europe of the Six, France and Germany played a leading role right fromthe start. Nonetheless, during the preparation of the Werner Report, both countries differed inview about the aim of integration. So there is nothing new under the sun. For the GermanMinister Karl Schiller, EMU was inextricably connected to the idea of a political union. France,personified by Raymond Barre, considered this idea of political union far too drastic. Fixing theexchange rates was as far as he wished to go for the time being, hoping that this would makeeconomic integration inevitable. Due to political pressure exerted by France, the final date ofEMU was left open in the end. On 1 January 1971, the first phase commenced. It was to lastthree years, and in this period the Member States would aim at narrowing the fluctuation marginof the exchange rate between their currencies.The first phase however started under unfavourable circumstances. In August1971, turmoil on the international foreign exchange markets forced the US Administration tosuspend the convertibility of the dollar. This jeopardised the international exchange rate systemof Bretton Woods. At the end of 1971, it was agreed to devalue the dollar and to broaden theexchange rate margins of the currencies participating in the international exchange rate systemfrom 0.75 to 2.25% on either side of the dollar parity. Needless to say that under thesecircumstances, it became extremely doubtful, whether the first phase of EMU could be heralded.For that reason, the EC Member States agreed in March 1972 to limit the exchange ratefluctuations between their currencies vis-à-vis each other to 2.25%. This is how the “snake in thetunnel” originated, soon to become the “snake in the lake“ when the dollar started to float asfrom August 1973. This was the final blow to the Bretton Woods System.2.         From The Hague to MaastrichtIn the 1970s, cooperation in Western Europe was characterised by the prioritygiven to enlarge the Community over deepening. At the beginning of 1973, the UnitedKingdom, Ireland and Denmark joined the Economic Community. Reviewing policycoordination between the original Six at that time, the European Commission came to theconclusion that it had been insufficient in this first stage. Therefore, “the“ second phase waschanged into “a” second stage in early 1974. In the following years, the lack of policycoordination frequently led to new exchange rate crises, although these were fuelled by externalBIS Review   42/1997
- 3 -circumstances as well, including two oil crises. The most striking reaction came from France,which left the snake in early 1974, returned to it in July 1975, and left again in March 1976. Theseriousness of the situation was aptly described by the Frenchman Robert Mariolin, whocharacterised the integration process as follows: “... if there has been any movement, it has beenbackward: national economic and monetary policies have never in 25 years been morediscordant, more divergent than they are today”.The discussion about how Europe should proceed was set off in early 1978 byRoy Jenkins, chairman of the European Commission at the time. After it appeared that acommittee established by Jenkins made little progress, the German Chancellor Helmut Schmidtand the French President Giscard d’Estaing joined forces. These two politicians demonstratedhow quickly plans can be turned into action when backed up by political will and determination.In March 1979, only a few months after they had met, the European Monetary System (EMS)entered into force, which aimed at creating a “zone of monetary stability”.The EMS marked the introduction of the European Currency Unit (ECU) assingle unit of account and as starting point for the new exchange rate system. Yet it was no morethan a technical arrangement. After all, monetary stability has a chance to succeed only if theeconomies of the participating countries achieve sustainable convergence and the governmentsof these countries pursue stability-orientated macroeconomic policies. However, that point hadnot been reached yet. By conducting a policy which gave high priority to fightingunemployment, France opposed the primacy Germany had attached to price stability since 1945.A large number of exchange rate adjustments were required to make France realise in 1983 thata radical turnabout was necessary. France’s adoption of a policy of the “hard” franc was a movein the direction of the German objective of price stability. The calming effect of this turnaboutwithin the EMS, was enhanced when an agreement was reached in the Danish city of Nyborg onmonetary policy adjustments which were needed in the event of exchange rate tensions. In themeantime, the expansion of the Community had widened further. Greece joined in 1981,followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986.In the decision-making process regarding the EMS, EMU was not explicitlyformulated as the system’s objective. The Delors Report, which was published in April 1989,contained concrete proposals to that end. According to Delors, fixed and unchangeable exchangerates should be the core of EMU. This implied a single monetary policy, to be conducted by aEuropean central bank which had to ensure that domestic price stability would be maintained.The road to EMU was to be completed in three stages which were, however, not subject toexpiry dates. As did Werner, Delors thought that EMU could be realised within a period of tenyears. An important difference was that Delors did not propose a transfer of national fiscalcompetences to the Community. Delors’ plan had a sequel in June 1989, when it was agreed thatan Intergovernmental Conference would be held to decide about the necessary amendments tothe Treaty of Rome. Six months later, the French-German proposal to hold a conference aboutpolitical cooperation was accepted in Dublin. At both conferences, preparations were made thatled to the Treaty on European Union (EU) at the end of 1991, better known as the MaastrichtTreaty.From the tensions that characterised the EMS in the early 1990s, it seemed to beclear that the first stage of EMU did not go entirely as planned. The uncertainties in countriessuch as Denmark and the United Kingdom which hesitated to sign the Maastricht Treaty, theinterest-increasing effect of the unification of Germany, and the fact that the exchange rates ofsome currencies had become overvalued since Nyborg, culminated in August 1993 in theBIS Review   42/1997
- 4 -decision to broaden the fluctuation margins of the EMS currencies from ± 2.25% to ± 15%,except for the Deutsche Mark and the guilder which maintained the original margin of ± 2.25%. Despite this setback, the European leaders were determined not to allow furtherdelays on the road to EMU mapped out by Delors. This determination was also prompted byexternal circumstances which, contrary to the 1970s, now had a positive impact ondevelopments. The collapse of the Berlin Wall in October 1989 ended the political division inEurope. This opened the door to the reunification of East and West Germany, of which theDeutsche Mark had meanwhile become the anchor of stability within the EMS. These changes,which coincided with worldwide deregulation of capital transactions, increased the necessity offorming a front in Western Europe. At rapid pace, the Member States of the Community workedto realise the single market, which was as good as completed on 1st January 1993. A logicalcomplement to this single market was the single currency.However, the acceleration of the integration process was not based on economicmotives alone. In political terms, the Maastricht Treaty has sometimes been interpreted as a kindof trade-off: West and East Germany were allowed to unite provided this locomotive wouldcontinue to pull European economic and monetary unification at a rapid pace in order to hedgethe feared German supremacy in the new Europe. Be this as it may, the Treaty officially enteredinto effect in November 1993, harbouring the prospect of a single European currency. On 1stJanuary 1994, Europe stepped into the second stage of EMU and the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI), the forerunner to the ECB, was established in Frankfurt. The EMI’s primarytask is to strengthen the coordination of monetary policy between the EU Member States - inearly 1995, Finland, Austria and Sweden joined the EU - and to prepare the third stage of EMU. As mentioned, EMU cannot be seen separate from the wish to establish, in thelonger term, a politically unified Europe as well. In order to prevent economic reality from beingsubordinated to this more than honourable wish, stringent entry requirements were set. These socalled convergence criteria pertain to permissible values for inflation rates, interest rates, publicdeficits and public debts. The Maastricht Treaty does not hold the ultimate wisdom. Economictheory has not yet advanced to a level where it can objectively and accurately determine theoptimal size of public deficits and debts. It probably never will. The Maastricht budgetarycriteria, which are criticised from various sides - some arguing that the entry requirements aretoo stringent, others believing them to be too lenient - are based on practical experience and, putin a longer historical perspective, are too lenient rather than overly stringent. This is anotherreason why these criteria must be stringently applied.3.         From Maastricht to AmsterdamThe last stage that I want to complete in this introduction, is the journey fromMaastricht to Amsterdam. On 16 and 17 June, Amsterdam will host the biannual Europeansummit, where the Maastricht Treaty could well be transformed into the Amsterdam Treaty. It isworth mentioning to foreign guests present here this afternoon that, from a geographicalperspective, Maastricht is the last and only real mountain to be conquered on the road toAmsterdam. In other words, the journey from Maastricht to Amsterdam is free of obstacles. Ihope that the same applies to the last stage of EMU. The likelihood of obstacles has beenreduced considerably because, as I have explained, stringent entry requirements were set inMaastricht. Gradually, a group of countries is emerging in Europe which may be able to meetthese criteria. In the spring of 1998, they will be formally appointed as EMU participants. Inorder to give sufficient weight to this core group, the participation of France and Germany -forming as they do the axis of Western European cooperation - is a prerequisite. But with a viewBIS Review   42/1997
- 5 -to the credibility of EMU, France and Germany, in particular, have to strictly observe theconditions of accession.The creation of a core group gives rise to continuous speculations about thequestion which countries will join it. In this stage of EMU, such speculations are not productive.Instead of excluding countries in advance, each country should be stimulated to do its utmost tocomplete the budgetary consolidation process. Of course, this does not call for tricks or non-recurring measures, but requires, - as stated in the Maastricht Treaty - a sustainable and thereforepermanent consolidation, not only in the interest of EMU but also in the interest of the countryinvolved.Apart from the question which EU countries will be in the core group,participation in EMU implies at any rate that the country involved transfers its monetary policypowers to an independent ECB. In that field, we will continue to see rearguard action, becausethe tradition of central bank independence is not equally rooted across the whole of Europe. Onthe other hand, one should not worry about these recurring discussions too much, as the Treaty isrock-solid with regard to the prohibition to exert political influence on the ECB GoverningCouncil. Obviously, the independence of the European Central Bank should not be confusedwith a lack of democratic legitimacy. After all, the democratic legitimacy of the ECB has beensafeguarded in many ways. For example, the designated ECB-President can be questioned by theEuropean Parliament and the chairman of the Council of Ministers plus a member of theEuropean Commission may participate in meetings of the ECB Executive Board without, it istrue, voting rights. But apart from this, it should be kept in mind that the Masstricht Treaty hasbeen ratified by the national parliaments. In other words, the ECB’s task to achieve pricestability is based on a democratic decision of the national parliaments.The fact that the other forms of policy will remain the responsibility of nationalauthorities may make EMU unique, but fragile too, e.g. if no measures are taken to guaranteethat national competences are not abused. Fortunately, European leaders have agreed to thestability pact proposed by Germany. This pact will enable EMU to impose sanctions on EMUMember States whose public finance is not in order. The Netherlands has always been a strongproponent of this proposal, because it is an important instrument to guarantee budgetarydiscipline. After all, the budgetary policies of the participants will have to be aligned in such away that they may be used to strengthen the European currency. But even then major efforts willhave to be made to clear the road to EMU of any remaining obstacles. The IntergovernmentalConference which started a year ago and will be completed in Amsterdam, will have to providean answer to the question how the EU can remain institutionally manageable when a number. ofEastern European countries accede in the near future. Answers are also required to the questionsregarding more effective decision-making and the role which the European Parliament couldplay in that respect. Of course, these issues do not have to stand in the way of establishing EMUin 1999. Nevertheless, they show that the long-term success of EMU as part of the EU is notguaranteed until, more so than in the past, the widening of the Union runs parallel to a deepeningin the direction of an “ever closer union among the European peoples”, as envisaged by thesignatories to the Treaty of Rome.Ladies and GentlemenWith Amsterdam as the last station on this trip, I have arrived at the conclusion ofmy address. In short, it may be argued that the process of European economic and monetarycooperation from 1957 to the present has been one of trial and error or - analogous to our trainjourney - of stopping and moving on. Nonetheless, the fact remains that the journey, also thanksBIS Review   42/1997

This, I think, is the power underlying the post-war European drive towards integration andit is this power which makes me confident that the euro will arrive in due time. If the Treaty ofAmsterdam is realised, the switches are definitively turned and the signal will be at clear for thefinal stage of EMU, which will lead to Frankfurt and can be completed on a beaten track in thehigh-speed train.BIS Review   42/1997
Mr. Matsushita discusses payment and settlement systems with regard tocurrent issues in Japan   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Yasuo Matsushita,held at the Japan Center for Economic Research on 28/2/97.I. Introduction I am greatly honored to have been invited by the Japan Center for EconomicResearch to address this distinguished audience.  I wish to take this opportunity to first brieflydiscuss the recent monetary and economic conditions, and then address the current issuesregarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan. There have not been many opportunities to discuss payment and settlement onoccasions such as this, despite the fact that they are important to all the economic activities ofhouseholds and firms, and that as a central bank, we are very much involved in thedevelopments in this area.  I have not addressed this area partly due to its technical nature, butrecently several developments have attracted much attention to the payment and settlementissues in Japan, as in other countries: specifically, pilot projects of electronic money productsand the Bank’s plans to abolish the designated-time settlement mode to make real-time grosssettlement the only way of settlement on the Bank of Japan Financial Network System(BOJ-NET). The role of the central bank in ensuring a smooth and stable operation of paymentand settlement systems has become clearly recognized through the deliberations on the revisionof the Bank of Japan Law that have been taking place since last year.  The “Report on theRevision of the Bank of Japan Law,” released recently by the Financial System ResearchCouncil, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance, states one of the objectives of theBank of Japan to be “to ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions, therebycontributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system." I wish therefore to discuss today the current issues regarding the payment andsettlement systems in Japan and also refer to the role of the central bank in those systems,bearing in mind the domestic and overseas trend in these areas.II. Domestic Monetary and Economic Conditions I would like to start by reviewing the recent economic condition and the thinkingbehind the Bank’s current monetary policy management. With regard to the domestic economic condition, the Bank of Japan judges that amoderate economic recovery continues and that the recovery is gradually becoming firmer. A notable change in the economic condition since the latter half of 1996 is thatthe decline in external demand, which had been a factor constraining the economic recovery,halted in autumn 1996 following the depreciation of the yen.  Recently there has been an upwardtrend in external demand.  In addition, inventory adjustment in some raw materials andsemiconductor industries had almost reached completion by the end of 1996.  As a result,production has started to grow at an accelerating pace, reflecting fully the increase in finaldemand.  Personal consumption continues to grow moderately but steadily, supported by thebuoyant sales of passenger cars, and the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to awider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed, reflectingimprovements in corporate sales and profits. BIS Review   43/1997
- 2 -It should be borne in mind that increase in demand ahead of the rise in theconsumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the recent improvement ineconomic indicators, as in housing investment, and these improvements need to be seen in thislight.  However, despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of1996, the virtuous circle - in which increased production leads to a recovery in business fixedinvestment and personal consumption through improved corporate profits and employmentincome - is gradually becoming more apparent.  This improvement is encouraging. In contrast to these recent improvements in economic indicators, the beginning ofthe year saw a significant fall in stock prices and this, together with the decline in long-terminterest rates in the financial markets, indicates that the confidence of the market participants inthe economic outlook is still slow to improve. Various causes can be considered for the market’s uncertainty as to futuredevelopments in the economy.  While the renewed concern over the nonperforming-loanproblem of financial institutions may be one important factor, the strong awareness of the effectsof the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year is also significant. From spring to summer this year, a temporary slowdown in economic recoveryseems inevitable due to a reaction to the boost in demand that is occurring ahead of the rise inthe consumption tax rate.  However, given the strengthening of the virtuous circle, it is morelikely than before that the recovery trend of the economy will be sustained.  In addition, stockprices appear to have stabilized.  Therefore, in considering whether the economy can overcomethe effects of fiscal tightening to sustain the trend of recovery, it is important to examine macro-and micro-economic data, including the economic indicators that will be released in the future,signals from financial markets, and firms’ business plans for the next fiscal year. I will now turn to the environment surrounding domestic prices.  The depreciationof the yen has continued since the beginning of the year, and a rise in the consumption tax rate isplanned for April.  The raising of the tax rate will be passed on to product prices, pushing up theprice index accordingly.  However, as long as the price hike does not surpass the increase causedby the raising of the consumption tax rate, the price rise will only reflect a single priceadjustment, and will not indicate any fundamental change in the situation underlying prices.Therefore it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy to counter such superficialchanges in price indexes. From the viewpoint of monetary policy management, that is, the viewpoint ofensuring stable economic development through price stability, the issue of concern is whetherthe rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes that take advantage of the increase or will lead toinflationary expectations, which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediateeffects of the tax rate increase.  Whether such a general price increase will occur depends onvarious factors, including the prevailing domestic supply and demand conditions and consumerconfidence.  It is thus necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and the possiblenegative developments, including overreaction by consumers, resulting from the rise in theconsumption tax rate, rather than focusing attention on the superficial hikes in prices. Although the decline in prices began to slow from the end of 1996, there is only alimited possibility that domestic prices will take a clear upward path given that improvement inthe supply and demand conditions in the domestic economy is expected to remain moderate fornow.  However, in view of the accelerating rise in import prices reflecting the yen’s depreciationand higher crude oil prices since the latter half of 1996, together with the strengthening of theBIS Review   43/1997
- 3 -recovery in private demand, it remains necessary to pay careful attention to the developments indomestic prices. In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue tomonitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening thefoundation of an economic recovery.III.  Current Issues Regarding the Payment and Settlement Systems in JapanA. Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan I would now like to move on to the main theme of today’s speech: payment andsettlement systems.  The expression “payment and settlement systems” may sound somewhattechnical and may indeed be unfamiliar to you.  In a market economy, however, every economicactivity conducted by firms and households - be it production or consumption - is concludedwith settlement.  Payment and settlement systems, or mechanisms for clearing and settlingpayments, are therefore used directly or indirectly by every economic entity.  People may not beconscious of the functions of the systems when they operate smoothly and efficiently.  However,once a problem arises, great difficulties are encountered. The means of payment used by firms and households vary from cash - that is,banknotes and coins - to checks and bills, funds transfers between bank accounts, and creditcards.  When payment is made by cash, settlement is final there and then.  However, whenpayment is made by other means such as checks or bills, the mere handing over of the checksand bills will not complete the settlement of the transaction.  When a check is drawn, forexample, settlement is final only when the check is collected and the stated amount of money istransferred from the deposit money in the bank account of the payer to the bank account of thepayee.  If such transfers are not effected between accounts for some reason, for example, thereare insufficient funds in the payer’s account, the transaction will remain unsettled.  When thepayer and the payee hold accounts at different banks, interbank settlement is needed, andsettlement will be completed only after the corresponding debit and credit entries are made tothe current accounts held by each bank with the Bank of Japan. Although various means of payment are available to firms and households,settlement is ultimately made either by a handing over of cash issued by the Bank of Japan or bya transfer of funds between bank accounts using deposit money, which are liabilities of privatefinancial institutions.  “Money” in a modern society therefore comprises cash and depositmoney, and is reliant on the confidence of the public that bank deposits can be converted intocash at any time. When a large number of relatively small-value payments, such as those usingchecks and bills, need to be settled between banks, they are not settled one at a time between theaccounts held by the banks at the Bank of Japan.  Rather, payment instruments such as checksand bills are collected and exchanged at clearing houses, where the credit and debit positions ofeach bank are calculated, and then the net positions are settled between the BOJ accounts.  Thiscalculation process is called clearing, and is operated by private institutions.  Specifically, thereare three major private clearing systems in Japan: the bill and check-clearing system; the ZenginData Telecommunications System (Zengin System) for funds transfers between bank accountsand for credit card payments; and the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System for yen paymentsarising from foreign exchange and Euro-yen transactions. BIS Review   43/1997
- 4 -BOJ accounts are used to settle the net positions resulting from various clearingsystems, as well as to directly settle large-value interbank funds transactions, such as call-moneytransactions, which do not go through clearing processes.  The value of funds transfers at theBank of Japan totals approximately ¥300 trillion per day, which is equivalent to approximately60 percent of Japan’s annual GDP.B. The Role of the Central Bank in Payment and Settlement Systems Bank of Japan thus plays an important role in both the settlement made by cashand the settlement made by deposit money.  The duty of central banks is to issue and controlmoney - that is, to ensure the public’s confidence in the holding and the using of money. To this end, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the value of money must bestable - that is, price stability must be maintained; and (2) the circulation of money and thefunctioning of payment and settlement systems must be stable and efficient.  If it were notpossible to use cash and deposits as desired for settlements, people would not be able to holdmoney with confidence.  The mission of central banks, therefore, is to make the currencies theyissue more convenient to use and to thereby enable firms and households to confidently engagein daily transactions and funds settlements.  Bank of Japan thus plays a vital role in thesettlement process in Japan as a whole. Bank of Japan serves two specific functions in securing the stability andefficiency of the country’s payment and settlement systems: (1) providing the means ofsettlement to the public; and (2) attending to the smooth execution of payments and settlementsin Japan. As a provider of the means of settlement, the Bank issues Bank of Japan notes andensures their smooth circulation.  As I mentioned earlier, cash payments immediately completethe settlement of a transaction by delivering a means of payment directly to the counterparty.This on-the-spot completion of settlement, whereby the payee is able to secure the monetaryvalue received, is described as “settlement with finality.” In order to maintain the finality of cash payments, it is essential to secure theconfidence of the people in the soundness of the central bank’s assets, which underpins the valueof the banknotes.  The Bank thus pays close attention to the soundness of its assets.Furthermore, any circulation of counterfeit notes would undermine people’s confidence inholding money.  To prevent such an occurrence, the Bank examines the authenticity of the largevolumes of banknotes that are returned to the Bank of Japan every day from financialinstitutions.  Careful attention is also paid to the cleanness of each of the banknotes incirculation.  The Bank also exerts itself to the utmost to improve anti-counterfeiting measures,and has recently been engaged in joint research with overseas central banks on the prevention ofbanknote counterfeiting using color copiers.  Through such efforts, the Bank aims to precludethe circulation of counterfeits. The Bank also provides current accounts at the Bank as another means ofsettlement.  The Bank offers accounts to private financial institutions, and the funds in theseaccounts, or deposit money, are equivalent to banknotes in their function as a means ofsettlement with finality.  In order to improve the safety and efficiency of settlements using theseBOJ accounts, the Bank has made various efforts, including the introduction of the BOJ-NET -the Bank of Japan Financial Network System, which is an on-line system for funds transfersamong the current accounts held by private financial institutions with the Bank of Japan.  TheBIS Review   43/1997
- 5 -Bank intends to further improve the system in cooperation with those concerned by making real-time gross settlement the only settlement mode, which I shall discuss in detail later. The second function of the Bank of Japan with regard to the payment andsettlement systems is to attend to the safety and efficiency of payments and settlements  inJapan, and to provide adequate liquidity when necessary.  As I mentioned earlier, the importanttasks of the Bank include ensuring a smooth supply of banknotes throughout the country, andmonitoring the stability of daily settlements across the BOJ accounts.In addition, the Bank, in coordination with the operators of the private clearingsystems such as the bill and check clearing, plays an important role in preventing any troubles inthe systems or participants from jeopardizing the entire payment and settlement systems inJapan. In any settlement system, there is the risk that a failure of one bank to meet itsobligations will trigger a chain reaction of defaults, eventually paralyzing the entire system.  Inaddition, both payment and settlement systems and individual banks constituting the systems aresupported by the market’s confidence.  As this confidence is in large part a psychological factor,a failure of a single bank could lead to a run on deposits at other banks.  Such risk is referred toas systemic risk.  Materialization of systemic risk will disrupt not only settlements betweenbanks but also those between firms and households, having a profound impact on the economyand on the society as a whole.  Such systemic risk inherent in the network of settlements is whatdifferentiates the banking sector from other industrial sectors. The role of the central bank is to constantly monitor the institutional frameworkand the operation of payment and settlement systems, working in coordination with the partiesconcerned to thereby prevent the materialization of systemic risk.  The central bank must alsoensure that the system can be provided the funds to break the chain reaction of defaults shouldsome emergency occur.  Another important task of the central bank is to attend to the soundnessof the private financial institutions, which are the participants in the payment and settlementsystems and which settle the payments between firms and households.  To summarize theseroles, an important mission of the central bank is to maintain the safety and efficiency of theentire settlement process, a process which involves (1) private financial institutions which acceptthe deposits of firms and households; (2) private clearing organizations processing interbankpayments; and (3) the central bank which discharges interbank settlement obligations resultingfrom private-sector clearing systems.C. Measures to Improve the Safety of Payment and Settlement Systems Payment and settlement systems have not necessarily been an issue of publicinterest reflecting the general perception that these systems are mechanical processing units fordischarging obligations by inputting transaction data.  The fact that there had been no financialinstitution failures until recently and that payments have been settled safely may have supportedthis perception.  However, financial institutions have actually failed and the speed at whichsystemic risk is transmitted within and beyond international borders has increased significantlyowing to technological innovations in finance and telecommunications, and financialglobalization.  Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to view payment and settlementsystems as merely mechanical processing units.  These systems must be resilient againstsystemic risk, and the establishing of such systems is an extremely important challenge for boththe private financial institutions and for the central bank.  It becomes apparent that variousincidents and studies have raised the awareness of the need to improve the safety of payment andsettlement systems among private financial institutions and central banks both in Japan andabroad. BIS Review   43/1997
- 6 -In various countries, new safety standards have been applied to private clearingsystems.  These standards include limits on each participant’s net debit position and collateralrequirements to ensure the provision of adequate backup liquidity in the event of an inability tosettle by the participant having the largest single net-debit position.  These standards weredevised by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries as minimum standards to be satisfiedby cross-border and multi-currency netting schemes, and are referred to as the Lamfalussystandards, after the chairman of the committee on this study.  As these standards can apply todomestic clearing systems, they are being used recently in many countries as guidelines forimproving the integrity of private clearing systems. In Japan, it has recently been decided to enhance the safety measures of theForeign Exchange Yen Clearing System so as to satisfy the Lamfalussy standards.  The Bankwill continue to actively support the initiatives to improve the safety of the payment andsettlement systems.D.Improving the Safety of the Central Bank’s Settlement System -Real-Time Gross Settlement The need to improve safety applies not only to private clearing systems but also tothe settlement systems operated by central banks.  In this regard, an increasing number of centralbanks have been adopting real-time gross settlement for current account settlements at thecentral bank.  Real-time gross settlement - called RTGS for short - is a system in which thecentral bank processes and effects every payment instruction sent by private financial institutionsin real time and on an order-by-order basis. Most central banks, including the Bank of Japan, have typically conductedinterbank settlements on a designated-time basis rather than by RTGS.  In the conventionaldesignated-time settlement, payment instructions are accumulated until designated settlementtimes instead of each one being settled immediately.  At the designated time - at present, 9 a.m.,1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. in Japan - the net settlement position of each financial institution iscomputed and its account is credited or debited simultaneously. In designated-time settlement, financial institutions need only the fundsequivalent to their net debit positions at the time of settlement, and thus, it is an efficient systemfrom the viewpoint of fund management.  However, if a single financial institution in the systemwere to fail to meet its obligations, all payments would inevitably be suspended, in order that allthe payment instructions sent or received by that financial institution could be revoked torecompute the settlement obligations of each financial institution.  In addition, such failure couldcreate a shortage of funds at the financial institutions which had planned to make payments withthe funds they had expected to receive from the failed financial institution.  This may lead to aseries of liquidity shortages or defaults - that is, the materialization of systemic risk.  The effectsof this risk could be grave, considering that the amount of funds handled by the central bank’ssettlement system is substantial. With RTGS, the smooth execution of settlements solely depends on the ability ofthe parties concerned to meet their obligations, as every payment instruction is processed in realtime on an order-by-order basis.  Therefore, even if a bank were to suddenly become unable tosettle, disruption to the system would be limited: suspension of the operation of the entiresettlement system, which can occur under designated-time settlement, can be avoided.  TheBIS Review   43/1997
- 7 -introduction of RTGS in many countries around the world, including some Asian countries, is aresult of the efforts of central banks to improve their settlement systems to contain systemic risk. Against this background, the Bank of Japan also decided at the end of 1996 tomake RTGS the only mode of settlement via BOJ accounts.  Specifically, by the end of the year2000, the Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and make all funds transfers on thebasis of RTGS.  This may require market participants to establish new transaction and settlementpractices.  To ensure the smooth operation of RTGS, the Bank intends to directly supplyintraday liquidity, which is indispensable for smooth settlements, to cover liquidity shortagesthat might arise in the system despite the efforts of participant financial institutions. Last December, the Bank announced its policy to realize RTGS as the onlysettlement mode on the BOJ-NET with some specific proposals for design features andrequested comments from the public.  The Bank was fortunate to receive many valuablecomments and recognized the increasing awareness of settlement risk among marketparticipants.  The Bank believes that it has been able to gain strong support from the privatefinancial institutions for RTGS, and plans to publish in the near future its policies along with thecomments received.  The Bank strongly hopes to receive constructive opinions and suggestionsin deciding the details of the design of the system.  The Bank will also solicit views from abroad range of market participants whenever making a major change in the operation of theBank’s settlement system, as a change in the system could have a significant impact on themarket practices and the daily business of the financial institutions participating in the system. It should be noted that realization of RTGS does not necessarily mean theelimination of all the risks in payment and settlement systems.  Moreover, RTGS on the BOJ-NET will produce the desired effects only when the safety of the private clearing systemsconnected to the Bank’s system is ensured.  To illustrate this point, suppose that the privatefinancial institutions, for some reason, switched from direct settlements via BOJ accounts toindirect settlements using private clearing systems given the introduction of RTGS.  The totalamount of risks in the payment and settlement systems as a whole would not decrease if therewere inadequate management of risks in the private systems.  In this respect, it is indispensablefor the private financial institutions, the private clearing organizations, and the central bank towork together to enhance the efficiency and safety of the payment and settlement systems inJapan. Such efforts of the private sector and the central bank to improve theinfrastructure for settlements will also contribute to the strengthening of the globalcompetitiveness of Japan’s financial markets, which is indeed the aim of the Japanese “BigBang” deregulation package proposed by Prime Minister Hashimoto.E. Improvement in Securities Settlement Systems In addition to the safety of funds settlements, much attention has been paidglobally to the safety of settlements of securities such as government securities and stocks. Although I do not have enough time today to discuss this issue in detail, theestablished guidelines for risk management in securities settlements are the recommendations setout in 1989 by the Group of Thirty, an international group of experts in finance. In accordance with the recommendations, significant progress has been maderecently in Japan toward improving the settlement systems for securities.  For the settlement ofBIS Review   43/1997
- 8 -Japanese government securities (JGS), for example, an on-line network and delivery-versus-payment system have been established.  Delivery versus payment, known as DVP, is amechanism which links the delivery of JGS with the corresponding funds transfer so that bothare executed simultaneously.  In such a way, a failure to collect payments or receive securitiescan be avoided.  In addition, rolling settlement was introduced in October 1996.  Here,settlements are made on every business day for the contracts that were agreed on a specificnumber of business days previous to that settlement date (currently seven days).  This replacesthe prior arrangement where contracts made over a certain period were accumulated before theywere settled on one of the six designated settlement days of each month (the 5th, 10th, 15th,20th, 25th, and the last day of the month).  The system will be improved further in April 1997 tocomplete settlement on the third business day after the date of contract. Regarding settlement of corporate bonds, which may be familiar to many of youhere, delivery of bonds has conventionally been made by a document called registrationcertificate and the corresponding payment has been settled separately through clearing of bills.At the end of 1997, however, on-line delivery of corporate bonds will be brought into effect.  Adelivery-versus-payment service is also envisioned for the future by connecting the settlementsystem for corporate bonds with the BOJ-NET. Various efforts are thus under way in Japan to enhance the safety of securitiessettlements.  However, much remains to be improved.  A large volume of stocks and othersecurities continues to be delivered physically, and DVP systems are yet to be established forsuch securities.  Furthermore, the lag between the contract and the settlement, that is, the finaltransfers of securities and funds, needs to be shortened for various securities.  In this respect, theBank intends to contribute actively and expects further efforts on the part of the private sector.F. Developments in Electronic Money I would now like to briefly discuss the developments in electronic money, whichmight become a popular means of settlement in the future. The term electronic money is used to refer to payment mechanisms in whichelectronic records of funds are stored in devices such as IC cards - with microprocessor chip(integrated circuits) embedded - or in computer networks and then transferred safely from onecustomer to another.  Many pilot projects are under way in various countries, making use of therecent technological innovations in IC cards and computer networks as well as in such securityfeatures as encryption.  In Japan as well, financial institutions and firms have begun variousprojects individually or jointly.  For example, some banks are individually using IC-card basedelectronic money on trial within certain buildings in Tokyo.  A joint project by a credit cardcompany and several banks on card-based electronic money is also being planned for summer1998 in a certain area of Tokyo.  It is said to be of the largest one of its kind in the world,involving approximately 1,000 stores and 100,000 cards. When electronic money products become prevalent, they may be used as newmeans of settlement replacing cash and deposits.  People may settle various retail transactions bytransferring the electronic values between IC cards or on networks instead of banknotes andcoins.  To prepare for this possibility, central banks are keenly interested in the soundness andthe implications of electronic money developments.  From this viewpoint, the central banks ofthe Group of Ten countries have been studying various aspects of electronic money: securityfeatures to prevent fraud and counterfeiting, implications for the effectiveness of the centralbank’s monetary policy, and the stability of payment and settlement systems. BIS Review   43/1997
- 9 -At present, however, it is very difficult to project how electronic moneytechnology will develop, to what extent electronic money products will be used by the public asa substitute for cash or deposit money, and at what pace these developments will proceed.  Thepace of the developments will depend on how the reliability of electronic money products issecured and how conveniently these products are utilized.  Under these circumstances, it is noteasy to reach a verdict on the various relevant issues, nor would it be appropriate to jump toconclusions.  Developers and operators of electronic money schemes can be expected to exerciseingenuity on such aspects as security and legal matters, and the innovative capabilities of theprivate sector should not be discouraged.  The basic stance that the Bank should maintain atpresent is to be flexible to the various possibilities concerning the future course of developmentin electronic money. Regarding the implications of the development of electronic money on monetarypolicy, monetary policy will, in theory, continue to be effective, provided that the situation doesnot become one where electronic money extensively substitutes not only for cash as a means ofretail payment but also for deposit money for large-value transfers.  Although the spread ofelectronic money products might affect the stability of monetary indicators, this will beadequately managed by identifying the amount outstanding of electronic money issued and bydevising monetary policy management.  Therefore, I wish to state that the Bank of Japan doesnot intend to put a brake on the development and introduction of electronic money inconsideration of its effects on monetary policy. Maintaining this stance, the Bank intends to continue research on electronicmoney while observing the developments in the private sector in Japan and abroad.  It willrelease the results of the research, as it has done in the past, wishing to support the efforts of theprivate sector.G. The Necessity of Risk Management by Individual Financial Institutions I have so far discussed the developments regarding payment and settlementsystems to contain systemic risk.  It is obvious, however, that establishing an appropriate systemstructure alone is not enough to secure the safety of the systems.  It is also important for thesystem participants, or individual financial institutions, to improve risk control measures byestablishing a system for identifying and managing settlement risk. In a modern society, monetary systems, as mentioned earlier, are based on thepublic’s confidence in: (1) cash issued by the central bank; and (2) deposit money offered byprivate financial institutions.  In order for monetary systems to function smoothly, it is necessaryfor the financial system as a whole to function with stability and, to that end, financialinstitutions themselves need to be responsible for securing sound management, includingmanagement of settlement risk. It is evident that financial institutions should manage their risks rigorously.Compared to credit and interest rate risks, settlement risk tends to cause greater losses anddisruptions once it materializes, and yet they are difficult to identify and manage.  In fact,settlement risk constantly fluctuates significantly, and thus identification and management of therisk require comprehensive understanding of technical details related to processing.  Forexample, it is necessary to know how the payment and settlement systems of different currencieswork, and what risks arise from time lags.  Such information and skills cannot be acquiredovernight.  However, in view of the impact settlement risk could have on financial institutions, itBIS Review   43/1997
- 10 -is indispensable to establish a system which makes possible the identification and measurementof settlement risk and the immediate reduction of risk following decisions by the management. I would like to emphasize that a financial institution equipped with an efficientrisk management system will be able to acquire new business opportunities in the area ofpayment and settlement services.  In fact, many European and U.S. financial institutions arecreating and offering new business out of settlement operations.  They are putting in largeamounts of resources to establish adequate internal risk management, and are developing safeand efficient settlement services to provide to financial institutions and other customers.  Thefact that such operations are viable as business is an indication that European and U.S. financialinstitutions and firms actively use new innovative payment and settlement services to realize safeand efficient settlements.IV. Conclusion In summarizing today’s discussion on payment and settlement systems, I wouldlike to address the basic issues from a somewhat different point of view. Firstly, payment and settlement systems play an extremely important role in theeconomy as an infrastructure supporting all economic activities, although this is rarelyacknowledged in our daily lives.  When firms purchase raw materials and sell products, or whenhouseholds receive wages and salaries, purchase goods, and remit money, all these activities arebased on the assumption that payments and settlements of money are effected smoothly - in amanner that people would not even be conscious of it.  To satisfy this requirement, modernsociety has developed a complex and precise mechanism comprising the central bank and theprivate sector.  The expressions “financial institutions” and “financial system” may generallybring to mind the function of intermediating savings and investment through the borrowing andlending of money.  Providing safe and efficient settlement services, however, is an equallyimportant function that the central bank and the private financial institutions serve. Secondly, efforts to further improve the utility and safety of the settlementsystems are becoming all the more important as economic transactions become increasinglycomplex and globalized and as technological innovations in finance including the payment andsettlement systems progress.  The Lamfalussy standards, RTGS, and the recommendations of theGroup of Thirty are indeed part of such efforts. As technology continues to progress, however, there is no final goal for thedevelopment of payment and settlement systems.  In addition, financial globalization isintensifying cross-border linkages, with settlement troubles in one country affecting thesettlement systems of other countries.  It is therefore important for the private sector and centralbanks to work together to improve the payment and settlement systems by reviewing the safetystandards as necessary from a global perspective.  We at the Bank of Japan shall continue ourefforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of the BOJ-NET, and shall support the efforts of theprivate sector to improve their systems. Thirdly, it is important to ensure the soundness of the financial system in abroader sense.  As I mentioned repeatedly, the functioning of modern monetary systems has itsfoundations in the public’s confidence in the central bank and the private financial institutions.In order for monetary systems to function properly, the entire financial system needs to operatewith stability. Sound management founded on the responsibility of the financial institutions isfundamental in establishing the confidence in private financial institutions.  It is necessary forBIS Review   43/1997
- 11 -the central bank to function as the lender of last resort should a trouble which emerged in onepart of the settlement system be anticipated to spread throughout the entire system - although itis important to contain such risks in advance, sometimes it may unfortunately becomeimpossible to prevent an incident from having impact on the entire system - so that people’severyday lives will not be seriously affected.  In order to prevent the materialization of systemicrisk, it is essential for the central bank to assess, through regular on-site examinations and dailymonitoring, whether the soundness of individual financial institutions is secured, whether thereis excessive concentration of risks in the financial system as a whole, and whether the series oftransactions between financial institutions is being settled smoothly. In summary, payment and settlement systems are vital to every economic entityincluding the firms and individuals represented here.  As the central bank, one of whosemissions is to secure the soundness of the financial system, the Bank of Japan will continue itsefforts to improve the safety and efficiency of Japan’s payment and settlement systems.

Mr. Greenspan looks at the evolution of banking in a market economy    Remarks bythe Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Dr. Alan Greenspan, at the annualconference of the Association of Private Enterprise Education, in Arlington, Virginia on 12/4/97. I am quite pleased and gratified to receive the Adam Smith Award this evening. Havingbeen  a bank regulator for ten years, I need something to remind me that the world operates just fine  witha minimum of us. Fortunately, I have never lost sight of the fact that government  regulation canundermine the effectiveness of private market regulation and can itself be  ineffective in protecting thepublic interest. It is most important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated in that the  self-interest of participants generates private market regulation. Counterparties thoroughly  scrutinize eachother, often requiring collateral and special legal protections; self-regulated  clearing houses andexchanges set margins and capital requirements to protect the interests of  the members. Thus, the realquestion is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather, it is  whether government interventionstrengthens or weakens private regulation, and at what cost.  At worst, the introduction of governmentrules may actually weaken the effectiveness of  regulation if government regulation is itself ineffectiveor, more importantly, undermines  incentives for private market regulation. Regulation by governmentunavoidably involves  some element of perverse incentives. If private market participants believe thatgovernment is  protecting their interests, their own efforts to do so will diminish. No doubt the potential effectiveness of private market regulation and the potentialineffectiveness of government intervention is well understood by those attending this  conference onzero-based government. However, I am sure that you will not be taken aback  to hear that many here inWashington are skeptical of market self-regulation and seem  inclined to believe that more governmentregulation, especially in the case of banking,  necessarily means better regulation. To a significant degree, attitudes toward banking regulation have been shaped by aperception  of the history of American banking as plagued by repeated market failures that ended onlywith the enactment of comprehensive federal regulation. The historical record, however, is  currentlyundergoing a healthy reevaluation. In my remarks this evening I shall touch on the  evolution of theAmerican banking system, focusing especially on the pre-Civil War period,  when government regulationwas less comprehensive and less intrusive and interfered less  with the operation of market forces. Arecent growing body of research supports the view that  during that period market forces were fairlyeffective in assuring that individual banks  constrained risktaking to prudent endeavors. Nonetheless, thethen nascent system as a whole  proved quite vulnerable to various macroeconomic shocks essentiallyunrelated to the degree  of banking regulation. I shall conclude by drawing some implications for howbanking  regulation needs to evolve in the future, with greater reliance on private market regulation. The Roots of BankingMany of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness totake  risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage, in  theform principally of taking deposits, banks perform a critical role in the financial  intermediation process;they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers  with a greater range of sources ofcredit, thereby facilitating a more efficient allocation of  resources and contributing importantly to greatereconomic growth. Indeed, it has been the  evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shapedthe development of our financial  systems from the earliest times--certainly since Renaissance goldsmithsdiscovered that  lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable. When Adam Smith formulated his views on banking, in the Wealth of Nations, he hadin view  the Scottish banking system of the 1760s and 1770s. That system was a highly competitive  onein which entry into the banking business was entirely free. Competitors included a large  number ofprivate, that is, unincorporated, bankers who discounted commercial paper and  issued bank notes. Thoseprivate bankers sought no government assistance.BIS Review   44/1997
- 2 - Chartered Banking (1781-1838)From the very beginning the American banking system has had an entirely differentcharacter.  Although some private individuals undoubtedly circulated limited volumes of bank notes,those seeking to circulate a significant volume of notes invariably applied for a corporate  charter fromstate or federal authorities. Entry into the banking business was far from free.  Indeed, by the early 1800schartering decisions by state authorities became heavily influenced  by political considerations. Asidefrom restrictions on entry, for much of the antebellum  period state regulation largely took the form ofrestrictions inserted into bank charters, which  were individually negotiated and typically had a life of tenor even twenty years. The regulations were modest and appear to have been intended primarily to ensure thatbanks  had adequate specie reserves to meet their debt obligations, especially obligations on theircirculating notes. Nonetheless, the very early history of American banking was an impressive successstory. Not  a single bank failed until massive fraud brought down the Farmers Exchange Bank in RhodeIsland in 1809. Thereafter, a series of severe macroeconomic shocks--the War of 1812, the  depression of1819-20, and the panic of 1837--produced waves of failures. What should be  emphasized, however, isthe stability of banking in the absence of severe macroeconomic  shocks, a stability that reflected thediscipline of the marketplace. A bank’s ability to circulate  its notes was dependent on the public’sconfidence in its ability to redeem its notes on  demand. Then, far more than now, there was competitionfor reputation. The market put a  high value on integrity and punished fly-by-night operators. When confidence was lacking in a bank, its notes tended to exchange at a discount tospecie  and to the rates of other, more creditworthy banks. This phenomenon was evident as early as  thelate 1790s in Boston, where large amounts of notes issued by New England country banks  circulated. In1799 the Boston banks agreed to accept notes of certain country banks only at  discounts of one-halfpercent. Several years later they began systematically sending back  country notes for redemption, andthey eventually refused for a time to accept such notes,  even at a discount. Early in the 1800s privatemoney brokers seem to have made their first  appearance. These brokers, our early arbitrageurs,purchased bank notes at a discount and  transported them to the issuing bank, where they demanded parredemption. Difficulties in redeeming the notes of New England country banks eventually producedthe  first notable example of cooperative self-regulation in American banking, known as the  SuffolkBank System. The Suffolk Bank was chartered in 1818 and entered the business of  collecting countrybank notes in 1819. In effect, the Suffolk Bank created the first regional  clearing system. By doing so, iteffectively constrained the supply of notes by individual  banks to prudential levels and thereby allowedthe notes of all of its associated banks to  circulate consistently at face value. In the 1830s, there was alarge expansion of  state-chartered banks, many of which were severely tested and found wanting duringthe  panic of 1837. However, very few banks failed in New England, where the Suffolk Bank  continuedto provide an effective, and entirely private, creditor discipline. Free Banking (1837-1863)The intense political controversy over the charter renewal of the Second Bank of theUnited  States and the wave of bank failures following the panic led many states to fundamentallyreconsider their approach to banking regulation. In particular, in 1838 New York introduced a  newapproach, known as free banking, which in the following two decades was emulated by  many otherstates. The nature of free banking and the states’ experience with this approach to  regulation have beenthe subject of profound misconceptions. Specifically, many seem to  believe that free banking wasbanking free from government regulation and that the result was  a series of debacles. They conclude thatBIS Review   44/1997
- 3 -the experience with free banking demonstrates that  market forces cannot effectively constrain bankrisktaking. In fact, the “free” in free banking meant free entry under the terms of a general law ofincorporation rather than through a specific legislative act. The public, especially in New  York, hadbecome painfully aware that the restrictions on entry in the chartered system were  producing a numberof adverse effects. For one thing, in the absence of competition, access to  bank credit was perceived tohave become politicized--banks’ boards of directors seemed to  regard those who shared their politicalconvictions as the most creditworthy borrowers. In  addition, because a bank charter promised monopolyprofits, bank promoters were willing to  pay handsomely for the privilege and legislators apparentlyeagerly accepted payment, often  in the form of allocations of bank stock at below-market prices. If free banking was not actually as free as commonly perceived, it also was not nearly asunstable. The perception of the free banking era as an era of “wildcat" banking marked by  financialinstability and, in particular, by widespread significant losses to noteholders also  turns out to be wide ofthe mark. Recent scholarship has demonstrated that free bank failures  were not as common and resultinglosses to noteholders were not as severe as earlier  historians had claimed. In addition, failure rates andloss rates differed significantly across  states, suggesting that whatever instability was experienced wasnot inherent in free banking  per se. In particular, widely cited losses to holders of notes issued by freebanks in Indiana,  Illinois, and Wisconsin appear to have resulted from banks in these states being forcedto hold  portfolios of risky state bonds that were not well-diversified, were not especially liquid, and  toooften defaulted. It was, in short, state regulation that caused the high failure rates. During the free banking era private market regulation also matured in several respects.Particularly after the panic of 1837, the public was acutely aware of the possibility that banks  wouldprove unable to redeem their notes. Discounting of bank notes was widespread.  Indeed, between 1838and the Civil War quite a few note brokers began to publish monthly or  biweekly periodicals called banknote reporters that listed prevailing discounts on thousands  of individual banks. Research based on datafrom these publications has shown that the notes  of new entrants into banking tended to trade atsignificant discounts. If a bank demonstrated  its ability to redeem its notes, over time the discountdiminished. The declining discount on a  bank’s notes implies a lower cost of funds, the present value ofwhich can be considered an  intangible asset, the bank’s reputation. Banks had a strong incentive to avoidoverissuing  notes so as not to impair the value of this intangible asset. Throughout the free banking erathe  effectiveness of this competition for reputation imparted an increased type of market  discipline,perhaps because technological change--the telegraph and the railroad--made  monitoring of banks moreeffective and reduced the time required to send a note home for  redemption. Between 1838 and 1860 thediscounts on notes of new entrants diminished and  discounts came to correspond more closely toobjective measures of the riskiness of  individual banks. Another element of the maturation of private market regulation in banking was theemergence  of full-fledged bank clearing houses, beginning with the establishment of the New YorkClearing House in 1853. The primary impetus for the development of clearing houses was the  increasingimportance of checkable deposits as a means of payment. Large merchants were  making payments bychecks drawn on their deposit accounts as early as the 1780s. But in the  1840s and 1850s the use ofchecks spread rapidly to shopkeepers, mechanics and  professional men. The clearing house reduced thecosts of clearing and settling the interbank  obligations arising from the collection of checks andbanknotes, and thereby made feasible  the daily settlement in specie of each bank’s multilateral net claimon, or obligation to, the  other banks in the clearing house. By itself, such an efficient clearingmechanism constrained  the ability of individual banks to expand their lending imprudently. From thevery beginning,  however, clearing houses introduced other important elements of private, self-regulation. For  example, the New York Clearing House’s 1854 constitution established capitalrequirements  for admission to the clearing house and required members to submit to periodic exams ofthe  clearing house. If an exam revealed that the bank’s capital had become impaired, it could beexpelled from the clearing house.BIS Review   44/1997
- 4 - National Banking (1863-1913)One compelling piece of evidence that contemporary observers did not regard freebanking as  a failure is that the National Banking System, established by an act of Congress in 1863,incorporated key elements of free banking. These included free entry and collateralized bank  notes.However, unlike the state laws, the federal law interfered with private market forces by  imposing anaggregate limit on note issues, along with a set of geographic allocations of the  limit that produced aserious maldistribution of notes. Although the aggregate limit on note issues was repealed in 1875, the collateralrequirement  for note issues continued to unduly restrict the longer-term growth of the money supply,eventually producing a significant price deflation and, in the 1890s, very poor economic  growth. Inaddition, the restrictions on note issues precluded the accommodation of temporary  increases in demandsfor currency. The inelasticity of the note issue produced strains in  financial markets each spring and fallas crops were planted and then brought to market. More  seriously, when depositors periodically becamenervous about the health of the banks, the  demands to convert deposits into well-secured bank notessimply could not be met in the  aggregate, and attempts to do so resulted in withdrawals of reserves fromthe money centers  that severely and repeatedly disrupted the money markets. Private markets innovated in ways that tempered the adverse consequences resultingfrom  these flaws in the government regulatory framework. Most notably, the New York Clearing  Houseeffectively pooled its members’ reserves by issuing clearing house loan certificates and  paying them outas substitutes for reserves in interbank settlements, first in the panic of 1857  and in every subsequentpanic. By 1873, clearing houses in many other cities were following  the same policy. In addition, theclearing houses accepted as settlement media other currency  substitutes issued by their membersincluding certified checks and cashier’s checks. In effect,  the clearing houses were assuming some of thefunctions of central banks. But a true central bank was perceived through most of the 19th century as aninfringement of  states’ rights. A central bank, in any event, was deemed by many as superfluous giventhe  fully functioning gold standard of the day. It was only with the emergence of periodic credit  criseslate in the century and especially in 1907, that a central bank gained support. These  crises were seen inpart as a consequence of the inelastic currency engendered by the National  Bank Act. Even with theadvent of the Federal Reserve in 1913, monetary policy through the  1920s was largely governed by goldstandard rules. Fiscal policy was also restrained. For most of the period prior to the early 1930s,obligations  of the U.S. Treasury were payable in gold or silver. This meant the whole outstanding debtof  our government was subject to redemption in a medium, the quantity of which could not be  altered atthe will of the government as it can with today’s fiat currency. Hence, debt issuance  and budget deficitswere constrained by the potential market response to an economy inflated  with excess credit, whichwould have drained the Treasury’s gold stock. Indeed, the United  States skirted on the edges ofbankruptcy in 1895 when our government gold stock shrank  ominously and was bailed out by a lastminute gold loan, underwritten by a Wall Street  syndicate. In the broadest sense, the existence of a goldstandard delimited the capability of  the banking system to expand imprudently. Creation of the Federal Safety NetWhen the efforts of the Federal Reserve failed to prevent the bank collapses of the 1930s,the  Banking Act of 1933 created federal deposit insurance. The subsequent evidence appears  persuasivethat the combination of a lender of last resort (the Federal Reserve) and federal  deposit insurance hascontributed significantly to financial stability and has accordingly  achieved wide support within theCongress. Inevitably, however, such significant government  intervention has not been an unmixedblessing. The federal safety net for banks clearly has  diminished the effectiveness of private marketregulation and created perverse incentives in  the banking system.BIS Review   44/1997
- 5 - To cite the most obvious and painful example, without federal deposit insurance, privatemarkets presumably would never have permitted thrift institutions to purchase the portfolios  that broughtdown the industry insurance fund and left future generations of taxpayers  responsible for huge losses. Tobe sure, government regulators and politicians have learned  from this experience and taken significantsteps to diminish the likelihood of a recurrence.  Nonetheless, the safety net undoubtedly still affectsdecisions by creditors of depository  institutions in ways that weaken the effectiveness of private marketregulation and leave us all  vulnerable to any future failures of government regulation. As the history ofAmerican  banking demonstrates, private market regulation can be quite effective, provided thatgovernment does not get in its way. Indeed, rapidly changing technology is rendering obsolescent much of the old bankexamination regime. Bank regulators are perforce being pressed to depend increasingly on  ever morecomplex and sophisticated private market regulation. This is certainly the case for  the rapidly expandingbank derivatives markets, and increasingly so for the more traditional  loan products. The lessons of earlyAmerican banking should encourage us in this endeavor. In closing, I should like to emphasize that the rapidly changing technology that isrendering  much government bank regulation irrelevant also bids fair to undercut regulatory efforts in amuch wider segment of our economy. The reason is that such regulation is inherently conservative. It endeavors to maintainthe  status quo and the special interests who benefit therefrom. New ideas, new products, new  ways ofdoing things, all, of necessity, raise the riskiness of any organization, riskiness for  which regulators havea profound aversion. Yet since the value of all wealth reflects its future  productive capabilities, allwealth creation rests on uncertain forecasts, which means every  investment is risky. Or put another way,you cannot have wealth creation without risktaking.  With technological change clearly accelerating,existing regulatory structures are being  bypassed, freeing market forces to enhance wealth creation andeconomic growth. In finance, regulatory restraints against interstate banking and combinations ofinvestment and  commercial banking are being swept away under the pressures of technological change.Much the same is true in transportation and communications. As we move into a new century, the market-stabilizing private regulatory forces shouldgradually displace many cumbersome, increasingly ineffective government structures. This is  a likelyoutcome since governments, by their nature, cannot adjust sufficiently quickly to a  changingenvironment, which too often veers in unforeseen directions. The current adult generations are having difficulty adjusting to the acceleration of theuncertainties of today’s silicon driven environment. Fortunately, our children appear to thrive  on it. Thefuture accordingly looks bright.BIS Review   44/1997
Mr. Ingves discusses retail trade, EMU and the Euro with respect to SwedenText of a speech by Mr. Stefan Ingves, a Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, held on14/4/97. First a word of thanks for the invitation to speak about EMU. Less than  twelvemonths have passed since the Riksbank last attended a meeting of  the Swedish Retail Federationwith information about EMU. Perhaps some  of you were present on that occasion. Whereas theissue of EMU was still  fairly new a year ago and not much discussed by most people, thesituation today is different. In the interval we have experienced a marked  increase both in whatpeople know about EMU and in their interest in the  matter. This naturally has to do with therapid approach of the starting date.  Today the move to Stage Three lies fewer than 500 workingdays ahead.  Moreover, there is no mistaking the strength of the political determination inEurope to start on time. This was evident not least at the recent Ecofin  meeting in theNetherlands when the EU finance ministers agreed on  several important matters such as thestability and growth pact and ERM2.  Today I shall be outlining the process leading up to StageThree of EMU  and the changes that we already know will occur. I will also say somethingabout EMU's consequences for retail trade. Before considering practical  aspects of EMU, permit me to begin with a look atsome general economic  features.Sweden should join from the startThe Riksbank is in favour of  Sweden participating in the euro area right from thestart in 1999. The  reasons for this have been spelled out in our submission on the Calmforsreport, for example. As regards the economic arguments, we do not  believe that, by remainingoutside the euro area, Sweden would incur  particularly large costs for stabilisation policy; in theevent of economic  shocks, it is structural changes rather than monetary policy that should beused in the first place to counter rising unemployment, for instance.On the  political side, we share the report's assessment that the political costs ofnot participating would be substantial; as an outsider Sweden would not  belong to the innercircle of countries that will be deciding Europe's future.  It should also be realised that countrieswhich belong to the euro area from  the start will have more influence on how the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB)  develops in the crucial early years, when the forms for its work are beingestablished. Our possibility of influencing important decisions is also likely  to be reduced inother fields beside monetary policy. If Sweden were to  refrain from joining the euro area at all,there would be a risk of being  marginalised as an outsider.The preparationsWhat progress has been  made in the move to EMU? The work of preparing forStage Three is now  in full swing in every EU body and all the member states. A green paper onthe practical arrangements for a changeover to a single currency was  presented by theCommission in May 1995 and the European Council,  meeting in Madrid in December, adopteda changeover scenario which  fixed the timetable for the main decisions. It was agreed that StageThree  of EMU is to start on 1st January 1999 and that, in the light of which  member statesfulfil the convergence criteria on the basis of statistics for  1997, as early as possible in 1998 theCouncil is to confirm which countries  will participate in the European currency area. On 1stJanuary 1999  exchange rates are to be locked and responsibility for monetary policy is to  betransferred to the ECB. The euro is to be introduced as an independent  currency and all-BIS Review   41/1997
- 2 -monetary policy transactions are to be in euro. For a time  the national currencies will continueto circulate alongside the euro but  legally they will be one and the same currency. If this seemsodd,  remember that Sweden's currency, for example, can be expressed in  kronor as well as öre.Euro, however, will not be available for our wallets  from 1st January 1999; euro banknotes andcoins are to come into  circulation on 1 January 2002 at the latest. That will initiate a massiveexchange of existing national banknotes and coins. By 1st July 2002 at the  latest the krona willcease to be legal tender, though of course the  Riksbank will continue to exchange kronor foreuro.Which countries will be  included?The EU countries are now striving to fulfil the economic criteria for  participationin the euro area. This is being accompanied by strenuous  political efforts to remove anyremaining obstacles. Today I can only say  that it is not until the spring of 1998 that we willactually know which  countries will be establishing the union. The EMI and the Commissionwill  each be publishing a report and the Commission will issue  recommendations on whichcountries should participate. On the basis of  these reports and recommendations, the opinions ofthe European  Parliament and the national parliaments are to be heard, which is expected  tooccur in April. The decision about which countries will participate is to be  taken around the turnof April at a weekend meeting of the Ecofin Council  and the Heads of State or of Government.It is therefore unnecessary to  speculate about this today. As far as Sweden is concerned, it looksas  though we will in fact fulfil the convergence criteria. Whether or not we  participate willtherefore depend on the decision by the Riksdag (Sweden's  parliament).What is the Riksbank doing?The Riksbank has to contribute  to a situation whereby Sweden is able toparticipate in practice if a majority  in the Riksdag so decides. That is why preparations arealready  necessary. A basic principle in this work is that it shall be voluntary - the  requisiteadaptations are a matter for each organisation to decide. All those  concerned must of course alsosolve any problems they encounter as a  consequence of EMU. For the Riksbank, a highlyimportant task in  Sweden's preparations is information about and consultations with thefinancial sector on matters to do with the changeover. To this end we have  formed aconsultative group (SIFS) and five sub-groups to work on the  practical preparations togetherwith the financial sector. This collaboration  has led us to conclude that the financial sector cancope with a changeover  to euro on 1st January 1999. We also consider that in some respectsjoining later would make the preparations more difficult. The worst  alternative would be a longperiod of uncertainty about our participation,  what we usually call a "soft no". Costly doublesystems would then be  required in several areas. We have also observed concern in the financialsector that staying outside the euro area would entail increased costs,  competitive disadvantagesand risk various forms of discrimination."Wait-and-see" may be less attractiveA common opinion at present  seems to be that a soft no is not unlikely and wouldnot involve appreciably  higher economic costs than participation from the start. Deferringparticipation for some years would not exclude us from the euro area for  good. In ourcooperation with the financial sector, however, we have seen  that uncertainty aboutparticipation is causing many financial agents to  make preparations for handling euro as well askronor. The nub of the  matter is that euro services will be called for whether or not we join thearea. The use of euro will be directed by the market. Naturally the euro  would not replace theBIS Review   41/1997
- 3 -krona as Sweden's currency if we remained outside  but we could probably expect a demand foreuro from some agents.  According to the Stockholm Stock Exchange, trading in the shares ofmajor  companies will gradually switch to euro because handling two currencies  would be toocostly. In time the money and bond market may be affected  in that renewals and new issues aredenominated in euro and account for  a growing proportion of bond trading. According to theSecurities Dealers  Association, for instance, large companies and financial markets will alsobecome less interested in kronor. It is too early to say how this transition  from kronor to eurowill occur in detail. Neither can we foresee how quickly  it will proceed or how far. Probably itwill be gradual and ultimately also  affect private individuals. If the euro turns out to be stableand strong,  households will also prefer to have pension savings, for example, in euro  securities.Thus, this scenario points to a development where financial  markets, companies and evenindividuals are active in euro, while the  public sector continues to use kronor as declared, forinstance, in the  report from the Ministry of Finance on practical preparations for the euro.  Sucha situation would no doubt lead in time to the public authorities also  encountering a demand foreuro services, perhaps ultimately leading to the  euro being accepted to a greater extent thandesired at present. If so, the  "wait-and-see" alternative would finally amount in practice to theadoption of  the euro. We can only speculate about the practical consequences of a  gradualtransition but it would probably entail increased costs as well as  greater uncertainty for firms aswell as society. If we intend to join the euro  area in a not too distant future after 1999, therecommendation therefore  seems to be: participate from the start and avoid unnecessary andcostly  solutions for firms as well society.Still a large need of informationWhen  talking about the monetary union we should be clear that in Sweden thedebate about Europe and EMU is relatively new. Elsewhere in Europe the  issue of integrationhas been discussed much more and for far longer. The  debate in Sweden has been rather lowkey and not particularly  widespread. So it is hardly surprising that people here are hesitant andwant more information. That the discussion has now got going is all to the  good. I was thereforepleasantly surprised by the submissions to the  Ministry of Finance on the EMU report. Of 56submissions, only 4 were  negative about EMU. The proportion in favour of Swedenparticipating from  the start in 1999 was as high as 46 per cent, while 13 per cent wanted to  waitand see and 33 per cent did not voice an opinion about participation.  Many of the interestedparties are for EMU: the Federation of Swedish  Industries, the Retail Federation, the Bankers'Association, the  Confederation of Professional Associations and the Employers'  Confederation,to mention just a few. In general it seems that the  discussion of EMU has spread from thefinancial sector to companies,  authorities and large organisations but has not yet reached theman in the  street. The time ought now have come for us all to consider the matter.How does EMU affect retail trade?The details of how EMU will affect  retailing in Europe are not yet clear. We donot even know which countries  will make up the euro area from the start. Still, I shall try topresent some  general features. EMU is intended to strengthen and deepen European  integrationand promote the mobility of capital, goods and services. In time,  therefore, a single currency islikely to make retailing more efficient and  cheaper. Inside the area, prices will be moretransparent and there will be  no exchange risk. Decreased costs for currency exchange andhedging  suggest that in time retailing will benefit from EMU, an opinion I share with  theWholesale & Retail Research Institute. In the short run, however, the  union involves retail tradein a great deal of work. Shops will be in the firing  line when the euro notes and coins areintroduced. Cashiers will have to  handle kronor and euro side by side for a time and customersBIS Review   41/1997
- 4 -will no  doubt have many questions about prices and conversion rates. Besides  calling forresources as well as training, this will require a good deal of  adjustment in retail trade. I shallnow consider some of the foreseeable  changes and also take this opportunity of commenting onthe requirements  formulated by the Research Institute for a changeover to euro.Banknotes and coinsThe Madrid meeting in 1995 agreed that euro notes and coins  are to beintroduced at the latest by 1st January 2002. Many people have  reacted to an introduction at theturn of a year, which is when retailing tends  to be most hectic. The agreement, however,stipulates 1st January 2002 as  the latest date, so perhaps a start might be made in the autumn of2001.  The alternative of spring 2002 has also be mentioned. This matter is still  being discussed;the Riksbank shares the trade's opinion that the turn of a  year should be avoided and is thereforeworking for another date. The  timing of the practical changeover arrangements is to be decidedby each  country; for Sweden the Riksbank hopes that it can be managed in a much  shorterperiod than the maximum of six months. The public will be  informed in good time about howthe changeover is to be carried out.  Information about security details and appearance will alsobe made  available. We now know that there will be seven banknotes and eight coins,  which issomewhat more than Sweden's denominations at present. One  face of the coins will carry anational motif that each country decides. The  notes may also display a national symbol.Nickel in the coins?The question  of nickel in the coins has also been discussed, for instance amongfinance  ministers and central bank governors. Swedish retailers have demanded  that coinsdenominated in euro and cent are not to contain nickel; the  Riksbank and the Ministry ofFinance have both worked hard to achieve  this but are fighting rather a lone battle. Today itdoes look as though four to  six out of eight coins will be nickel-free, which must be regarded asa  major success for the Swedish position. A decision, however, is not due  until the summer.Double currenciesFor a period of up to six months there  will be two currencies to handle andretailers have demanded that the  period be limited to three months. We can understand theirargument in  principle. Much will be required of traders. Instead of the present fivedenominations of notes there will be twelve and instead of four coins there  will likewise betwelve. The value of cash holdings in retail trade (cash  liquidity) will be greater than usual, withan increased risk of counterfeit  notes and robbery, for example. Retailers will also have toconsider  temporary storage space for cash-boxes and additional transport  requirements. TheRiksbank is likewise working to make the period with  double currencies as short as possible.There are, however, other aspects  to consider. Incorporating euro in the system will take time.Just the work  of distributing the new banknotes will be time-consuming. We shall be  lookinginto what is feasible in practice. Time will also be needed to adapt  the automatic teller systems(Bankomat and Minuten) to the new currency.  Another matter to be investigated is whether thedistribution of euro to  banks, post offices and possibly retailers can start before the date onwhich the new currency becomes legal tender. Moreover, some consumer  interests, for instance,have said than many consumers would prefer a  relatively long changeover period in which toget used to the new currency.  The question of the period with double currencies therefore callsfor further  discussion in order to arrive at a solution that everyone can accept.  Retailers havealso put forward the view that it should be possible to  provide change only in euro from dayone. We believe this may be difficult  both in practice and on the grounds of the acceptedBIS Review   41/1997
- 5 -changeover principle  of "no compulsion - no prohibitions". It has been said that people ingeneral  are to be free to decide whether to use euro from the start on 1st January  1999 or towait until the changeover is completed in 2002. During this  period no one is to be compelled touse euro, though this will be  encouraged. Kronor and euro will both have the status of legaltender, so  we must be prepared to handle them both during this period. But the  discussion ofthis question should continue.Responsibility for informationThe retail trade report considers that society must be responsible for  informationabout the new currency system. At the same time the Ministry  of Interior and others considerthat information at points of sale, for  example, is primarily a business responsibility. Thismakes me somewhat  uneasy. I believe we must all be prepared to accept an additionalresponsibility for information about these matters. Otherwise there is a risk  of people feelingthey are getting insufficient guidance, with an increased  risk of the changeover being arduousfor everyone. At the Riksbank we will  try to do our bit. Brochures about the new means ofpayments will be  distributed, possibly accompanied by ready-reckoners for the conversionrates. Our Payment System Department is working on this.Price  informationRetailers will be obliged to work for a period with some form of  double pricing.The practical arrangements for this are mainly a matter for  the retail trade and consumerinterests.RoundingIn Sweden we have  grown used to having the total sum rounded to the nearest 50öre. Retailers  have expressed a wish that this should continue to be possible with the  euro, inwhich case an active introduction of the 1 and 2 cent coins would  not be called for and we couldround to the nearest 5 cents (approximately  43 öre). We appreciate this view and have promotedit at various levels but  without gaining much support. So we do not yet know the outcome. Itmust  be realised, however, that if we join the euro area, even the smallest  denominations willbe legal tender. So there is no way of entirely avoiding  the small coins in Sweden.Cash receiptsToday's cash registers are  capable of recording total sums in two currencies. Ifeach item is to be  registered in both currencies, however, it seems that all the existing cashregisters would have to be replaced. I agree intuitively with retailers that it  would hardly bereasonable to do this throughout Sweden in order to  register two currencies for a period that islikely to be shorter than six  months. Perhaps we can make do with receipts that give the total ineuro  as well as kronor together with the conversion rate. That would be much  the sameinformation as the banks have agreed to provide on statements  of account. Once again,however, this is a matter where retailers and  consumers must get together and discuss what isreasonable. As I have  said, EMU will affect each one of us. So let me conclude by mentioningsome other changes in fields where retailing is not directly involved.Other  changes: SecuritiesBIS Review   41/1997
- 6 - The countries in the euro area may, and should,  denominate new sovereignissues in euro. A country wishing to convert its  outstanding debt into euro will be allowed to dothis, too. We can also pass  national laws enabling, for instance, the Stockholm Stock Exchange,OM  and the Securities Register Centre (VPC) to switch to euro right from 1999.  Manyinstitutions and agents are in favour of this. The above institutions as  well as participants in theSwedish securities market, banks, financial  institutions and others unanimously recommend abig-bang solution - a  quick, concerted changeover from kronor to euro right from the beginningof 1999. With a single monetary policy and no exchange risk, the only factor  behind interestrate differentials for sovereign securities will be the credit  risk. The market for Swedishgovernment paper will be more or less  integrated with the euro market for governmentsecurities. Given a  reasonably similar debt situation, government bonds issued by differentcountries can then be handled in a similar way.Banks.During 1996 the  banks have worked on strategies and routines for changing overto euro. It  has been agreed that during the changeover period banks, the postal giro,  thebankgiro and the private giro will handle kronor as well as euro.  Cashiers will redenominatepayments in the currency used for the  institution's system, regardless of which currency thecustomer has used.  Bank branches will provide two versions of their forms, one for kronor andone for euro; new cheques and other forms will therefore be produced.  Statements of accountwill specify the rate at which the currency has been  converted. The automatic teller systems(Bankomat and Minuten) will also  have to be adapted. Moreover, banks must be prepared forpeople who  want to make giro payments in euro right from the beginning of 1999. Some  largecompanies may also wish to pay out wages in euro before the new  currency is available in theform of banknotes and coins. As mentioned  earlier, it is difficult to foresee the magnitude ofdemand for euro services  and how soon companies and individuals will switch from kronor toeuro.Monetary and exchange rate policy.A single currency implies a single  monetary policy, which in EMU will bedecided by the ECB. The Riksbank  and the other national central banks will have the task ofexecuting this  policy. The changes for Swedish banks and other financial institutions willprobably not be all that great. The Riksbank is likely to remain the financial  sector'scounterparty. The main differences from today for Swedish banks  are a much larger market forintra-day money and counterparties located  all over Europe. The detailed conduct of monetarypolicy is not yet clear.  The final decisions are due when the ECB has been established in 1998.Consequently it is the countries participating from the start that will be able  to influence theconduct of policy and the organisation of activities in the  new European central bank.TargetThe conduct of a single monetary  policy calls for a single system with which tohandle the associated  payments. TARGET, the payment system that is now being built up, willlink  up all the national systems. A payment from, say, Stockholm to Milan will  normally beexecuted in a matter of seconds, whereas at present it often  takes a day or more. TARGET'smain purpose is to enable the ECB to  conduct monetary policy but it also amounts to theestablishment of a new  expressway for commercial transactions. The extent to which banks andother companies use the system will probably depend on the price. What  this will be is not yetclear but costs are to be covered in full. All the national  central banks in the EU area will beBIS Review   41/1997
- 7 -entitled to join TARGET, whether or not  they are participating in the euro area. There is asignificant risk, however,  that countries outside the latter area will have more limitedpossibilities of  using TARGET, for instance due to restrictions on intra-day euro credit,  whichis important for countering fluctuations in payment flows. One of the  matters discussed is thatoutsider banks should close the system at an  earlier hour. The Riksbank has acted forcefully tooppose this threat of  discrimination. The decisions on this and certain other matters have beendeferred, however, and will now be taken by those countries that join the  euro area from thestart. TARGET is to be tested this summer and is to be  fully ready for use by 1st January 1999.Summary and conclusionsMost of  the evidence today suggests that the economic and monetary union willmove to Stage Three on 1st January 1999. For Sweden the question is  whether we should jointhe euro area from the start, wait a while or try to  remain outside for good. I hope that we willsoon be having a more lively  debate on this very important issue. The question of EMU hasnow been  largely examined and discussed by the financial sector, the authorities and  bigbusinesses. The time has come to spread the debate and information  to other groups in society.In time the krona will lose groundEven if Sweden  decides to stay outside, the single currency will affect us. Ouranalyses,  together with other organisations, of what might happen in that event point  to arelatively sizeable use of euro, particularly in the securities market. In  time, the use of euro mayspread like water rings to other parts of society.  The extent to which the euro is used will amongother things depend on its  strength relative to the krona but also on market assessments of theprobability of Sweden joining. A good guess seems to be that the shorter  the interval beforeparticipation, the quicker will be the changeover to euro.The world will not be the sameThe creation of a monetary union just  outside Sweden's borders will change theworld as we know it. Individuals  and firms will both be affected by the euro's introductionwhether we  participate or not. In our efforts to keep the financial sector informed about  EMUwe can see that good progress has been made with the  preparations. Among those concerned wealso experience a strong desire  to participate as early as possible so as not to get left behind.Swedish  banks and other companies want to have a chance of competing on equal  terms and donot wish to risk losing business opportunities. Finally I  therefore wish to underscore that sayingno to the single currency is not the  same as status quo. As I said, the euro's introduction willaffect us all,  whether or not we participate. EMU will probably accelerate the  globalisation,concentration and integration of the world's financial markets.  It is therefore of the utmostimportance that we all do what we can to find  out more about these complex matters.BIS Review   41/1997
Mr. Meyer looks at issues in financial modernization in the United StatesRemarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the seventh annual Conference on Financial Structure in Annandale-on-Hudson, NewYork, on 10/4/97.It is my pleasure to take part in what has become an important annual meeting onfinancial policy issues. It is my job to get you warmed up for a reception and dinner. Our hosts have acurious view that a discussion of financial modernization will whet your appetite for food. Maybe so,but it will almost surely increase your thirst.It seems that people have been talking about financial modernization for a long time.Indeed, in the short-run it is easy to become discouraged about how often we talk, but how rarely wedo anything, about financial modernization. However, if we step back and look over the last twentyyears, it seems to me remarkable both how much progress has been achieved and how much theconcerns of financial modernization have changed. Two decades ago we still had Regulation Q, theGlass-Steagall Act was widely viewed as requiring a virtual prohibition of combinations ofcommercial and investment banking, interstate banking and branching were barely fantasies even atthe state level, and combinations of banking and insurance were off most people’s radar screens.Today, many of the issues of 20 years ago have, blessedly, been resolved. But some remain, and newones have inevitably appeared. The contemporary concerns of financial modernization include repealof Glass-Steagall, expanded insurance activities for banking firms, the entry of insurance andsecurities firms into banking, the possibility of unlimited mixing of banking and commerce, andongoing technological changes and financial innovations.Tonight I would like to address some aspects of these concerns. I will suggest to youthat while financial modernization is still, as it was twenty years ago, a necessity, it is also the casethat in an uncertain world characterized by rapid change caution is not a dirty word.I will begin with what for me is the easiest topic: banking and commerce.The separation of banking and commerce has a long history in English-speakingcountries. Indeed, the policy can be traced back to the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. Itappears that commercial firms were concerned that the Bank’s monetary powers would give it acompetitive advantage in mercantile activities if there were no separation of banking and commerce.The young American state governments adopted, at least in principle, this separation of banking andcommerce.However, from the beginning the separation of banking and commerce was hardlycomplete in the U.S. banking system. State governments often saw the granting of bank charters as away of encouraging capital intensive development projects. As a result, pre-Civil War banks weresometimes engaged in such activities as canal building, railroad construction, and even thedevelopment of public water systems.Thus, from early on the mixing of banking and commerce was a gray area in theUnited States. This tradition continues to this day. For example, the same individual can own acontrolling share of both banking and commercial firms. Perhaps of more interest, a bank holdingcompany may acquire up to 5 percent of the voting shares of any commercial enterprise, as long asthe investment does not represent a controlling interest. In addition, the Board has permitted passiveinvestments in commercial firms of up to 25 percent of nonvoting shares, and an investment can be ashigh as 49 percent if it is made through a small business investment company. Bank holdingcompanies can own 100 percent of the equity of a small business investment company.BIS Review   40/1997
- 2 -We could all continue to give many examples, including the ownership of unitarythrifts and specialized, and not-so-specialized, finance companies by commercial firms. Indeed, someobservers use these examples to argue that since the United States already has so much mixing ofbanking and commerce, why not go all the way? In my view, such arguments exaggerate the reality.Despite all the gray areas, I think it is fair to say that to a very substantial extent banking andcommerce are essentially separate activities in the United States. Thus, we need to think carefullyabout whether we want to go even further down the road of combining banking with nonfinancialactivities.Advocates of unrestricted mixing of banking and commerce make at least fourarguments: (1) both banking and commercial firms could more easily diversify their risks, (2) aclosely related argument is that such combinations would provide opportunities for synergies incross-selling, (3) combining banking and commerce could lead to more capital in the bankingindustry, and (4) mixing banking and commerce would help to solve certain asymmetric informationand corporate control problems associated with commercial lending. Time does not permit me toaddress each of these in detail. Suffice it to say that I find each of them wanting. I can find very little,if any, in our experience as a nation that gives me real confidence about the benefits of combiningbanking and commerce. And I can find no empirical support for any benefits for combining bankingand commerce based on experience abroad.Take risk diversification. Do we really believe that in the day of stock index mutualfunds, options on individual stocks, and evolving credit derivatives that any firm must own another inorder to diversify its risks in virtually any way it cares to do so? I think not. If diversification of assetreturn risk were our only goal, financial modernization would be easy. How about synergies in cross-selling? Maybe. But I think we must be skeptical here, because the admittedly weak literature oneconomies of scope in banking has been hard pressed to find strong evidence of significant synergieseven in financial activities, although I think we all believe that there are some.The argument that we need to combine banking and commerce to attract capital tobanking seems, well, pretty silly. In a market economy, capital flows to profit opportunities. Ifbanking is viewed as a vibrant and growing industry, it is hard to see why capital will be a problem.Indeed, the banking industry just completed its fifth straight year of record profits, and it is nocoincidence that by all measures capital has been flowing into the industry. If it were not profitable, Icannot see why we would want to create a structure to attract capital to banking.The notion that mixing banking and commerce would reduce information costs inbank lending, and would facilitate monitoring and management control by the bank probably hassome merit. Banks that hold both a debt and equity stake in a firm would probably be better able todeter excessive risk taking by the other equity holders, and might even have access to betterinformation about the firm. However, the internalization of these principal-agent problems wouldcome at a price: a price that could include less vibrant money and capital markets, an unwarrantedexpansion of the federal safety net, potentially dangerous conflicts of interest, and excessiveconcentration of power. On balance, in my view, this is an area where we should be very cautiousand where we need far more research before we can come to any definitive conclusions.An additional reason for caution is the necessity of modifying supervisory techniques.I believe that all of the banking agencies can meet the challenges of expanded financial activities. Butadding commercial firms before we have digested the financial side of the business could well be abridge too far. Indeed, I believe that prudent public policy requires that, for this reason alone, we getfinancial activities right before tackling further combinations of banking and commerce.The thorny banking and commerce problem in financial modernization is thatnonbanking financial firms are already affiliated with commercial firms: some from commercial firmsBIS Review   40/1997
- 3 -creating financial subsidiaries, some from financial firms acquiring nonfinancial businesses. Iffinancial modernization allows all financial firms to affiliate, but prohibits banking and commerce,the pre-existing commercial affiliates of nonbank financial firms would have to be divested to acquirea bank, while banks could enter de novo the new nonbank financial activity without divesting anyvaluable assets. This is either inequitable or the cost of acquiring a bank, depending on your point ofview. But, it is clearly a problem that has to be addressed. The choices are divestiture, grandfathering,long-term phase outs, basket clauses, or combining of banking and commerce. It would seem to me apoor public policy that opened up banking and commerce on pure equity grounds, rather than adisinterested analysis of societal net benefits.The Impact of Technological Change on Bank Risk ManagementA strong case can be made for focussing bank reform today on the expansion ofpermissible financial activities. The prohibitions against banking and securities and banking andinsurance combinations have always, it seems to me, been difficult to support. Moreover,technological change has simply undermined the traditional distinctions among financial products andservices. In a word, the existing prohibitions are anachronistic.One thing has remained consistent: Banks are in the business of taking and managingrisk, have always been and always will be. The change that we must cope with is that technology haschanged the ways they take risk, while at the same time improving their capability for managing it.This creation and management of risk, like much of recent economic change, would have beenimpossible without the dramatically lower cost of a unit of computing power. Indeed, before thecomputer, most of the new bank products of recent years were merely concepts, concepts that couldnot become operational until they were quantifiable. That’s what the computer facilitated:quantification of risk, the necessary prerequisite to price it accurately and manage it effectively.Quantification did not change the fact that banks continue to deal with two very old-fashioned risks: credit risk--will the counterparty perform as promised?--and market risk--willchanges in interest rates or other market factors reduce the value of my portfolio? Indeed, the specialskills of banks in evaluating and taking credit and market risk is what banks have leveraged in takingpart in the financial revolution spawned by the technical revolution. Nonetheless, the nature of thenewer products and the relationship with counterparties have meant that risks now manifestthemselves in a different way and that banks can modify their risk exposures much more rapidly thanever.Technology and the enhanced ability to capture and use data have changed risk takingand its management in several areas: securitization, credit scoring, and modeling for pricing andcapital allocation, to name three. But no finer example of the revolutionary changes made possible bytechnology can be found than derivatives. Banks and other creators of derivatives can now slice anddice risks associated with a wide spectrum of underlying assets. Derivatives can be used to hedge riskfor the bank or its customers. Examples include interest rate swaps designed to make counterpartiesmore comfortable with their interest rate exposures and credit derivatives designed to reducecorrelations of risk in a loan portfolio. Of course, either of these instruments can be used to take riskif the holder opts to hold the uncovered exposure, avoiding the cost of acquiring the underlyingassets. Moreover, a bank can change its position quickly--limiting a loss, diversifying or hedging arisk, or closing out a position.Derivatives, of course, do more than allow the taking or hedging of risk. They alsopermit the holders to combine and separate risks to mimic virtually any financial activity. They thuslimit what regulators can prohibit, blur distinctions between instruments regulated by differentregulators, and virtually eliminate functional and other distinctions among commercial banks,investment banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.BIS Review   40/1997
- 4 -Supervising the Future Financial Services Holding CompanyWhen it comes to considering how technology and new products have affectedsupervision--especially of the future financial services holding company, with its wider powers--Imust begin by repeating an earlier comment: Banking organizations are still in the risk business--taking it, managing it, profiting from it, and when they make the wrong decision or have bad luck,bearing losses and perhaps even failing. And the basic risks still are credit and market risks. Thesame expertise banks used for old-fashioned loans and their funding is still what they do forderivatives, securitizations, and credit scoring.That having been said, however, one must quickly add that the new instruments andprocedures raise real questions about both managing and supervising risk by instruments and/or bylegal entity. Banking organizations are doing so less and less, and as a result supervisors arefollowing suit. Banking organizations have increasingly centralized risk management at the parent asa necessity because the credit decisions cross legal entities and certainly cross instruments. The newtechnology has already created a supervisory imperative that financial modernization--with its newpermissible activities--can only accelerate: the need to evaluate risk policies and positions centrally--most likely by one supervisor, sharing information with all legal entity regulators.But, I must say, it is not clear to me precisely what this technology implies for thelegal entity regulators. If units of an organization, through combinations of puts and calls, cansimulate all the attributes of a security, or even most of the risks and returns of certain businesses,what does the term “functional regulator” mean? Historically, when a legal entity--a unit of anorganization--was the only vehicle for participating in a certain function, the idea of separatingregulators by functions was consistent with legal form. It is increasingly less so when a syntheticasset can be created with the same risk and return characteristics of the underlying asset.Or, how comfortable should the individual regulator feel if a hedge involves ascounterparties two legal entities in the same failing organization? Will the regulator of unit A let thegains booked in his unit offset losses in unit B, regulated by another entity? Can he do so under thelaw? If the answer to either question is no, what good is such a hedge at a failing organization? Evenwithout complicating the issue by failure, how does the regulator of the unit booking the loss on thehedge feel about the hedge, no matter how desirable the hedge is for the whole organization?The new reality, it seems to me, is that supervisors have to supervise risk and notinstruments or entities. And that implies either that we keep organizations in old-fashioned straight-jackets and permit no new activities--a strategy which the market and technology has alreadyundermined--or we recognize that, over time, specialized regulators of banks, of securities firms, ofeven insurance companies--are going to have to find a new paradigm.We are, I believe, groping toward that future supervisory structure. At its center willbe an evaluation of risk management procedures and policies. Historically, bank holding companysupervision has dealt with an organization that was overwhelmingly a bank, and until Section 20s,whose affiliates were engaged in businesses that could be conducted within the bank. Thesupervisory approach was, not surprisingly, to apply bank-like supervision to the affiliates. Thedesigners of financial modernization legislation and the holding company or umbrella supervisormust consider how to change that approach as bank affiliates increasingly are engaged in businessesnot permitted to banks, and possibly even subject to regulation by a nonbank regulator. At aminimum, it is desirable to avoid redundant regulation. More basically, the necessarily intrusivesupervision of banks that comes with the safety net should not be extended to these new activities. Inpart, such supervision would reduce efficiency and flexibility. In part, it would be unnecessary. And,in larger part, it could create a moral hazard by fostering the wrong impression that a bank supervisorBIS Review   40/1997
- 5 -has confirmed the strength of the supervised affiliate. Thus, the focus of holding companysupervision, as I noted, should be evaluation of risk management policies and procedures for theorganization.Safety Net Subsidies and Organizational FormBeyond regulatory structure, financial modernization--the linkage of banks to a widerrange of financial activities--also raises organizational structure issues. This issue is closely linked tothe subsidy provided by the federal safety net, a much discussed topic in recent weeks. By the safetynet I mean deposit insurance, and access to both the Federal Reserve discount window and the Fed’spayment system. While many of the questions associated with this topic are subtle and complex, Ibelieve that some of the more basic issues regarding the safety net subsidy can be understood usingstraightforward economic reasoning. Unfortunately, much of the debate thus far has tended to bemore obscure than it needs to be.Take, for example, the question of whether a subsidy exists. Most observers agree thatthere is a gross subsidy, and that the real issue is whether there is a subsidy net of regulatory costs.But here the discussion often seems to get confused. To me, it is critical at this point to distinguishclearly between the concepts of total benefits, total costs, and marginal benefits and marginal costs.We all know, at least those of us with some training in economics should know, that profitmaximizing firms will equate marginal benefits with marginal costs. Applied to the subsidy debate,this principle implies that in equilibrium a profit maximizing bank should set the marginal benefits ofthe subsidy equal to its marginal costs. In other words, rational firms should drive the net marginalbenefit of the subsidy to zero. Importantly, this implies that, at the margin, it may be very difficult toactually observe the subsidy. I suspect that this goes a long way toward explaining why efforts toestimate the marginal value of the subsidy have, to date, proved less than successful.Even though rational firms equate marginal benefits and marginal costs, they clearlydo not equate total benefits and total costs. Indeed, standard microeconomic theory says that in acompetitive equilibrium total benefits should exceed total costs. Again applying this concept to thesubsidy debate, at any individual, profit maximizing bank the total benefits of the subsidy shouldexceed the subsidy’s total costs, even though the subsidy’s marginal net benefit is zero. This total netbenefit allows the banking industry to be larger, and perhaps riskier, than it would otherwise be. Thefact that we do not observe banks voluntarily giving up their charters suggests that it may well be thatthe safety net’s total benefits exceed its total costs, even if the value of the net marginal subsidy iszero.Consider another point that derives from the distinction between total and marginalbenefits. Today, we would expect banks to be maximizing their total net benefits from the subsidyusing all of the activities in which they are capable of engaging. Now consider what a rational bankwill do if given a new opportunity, say expanded securities powers, to maximize profit. Wouldn’t weexpect the bank to once again equate marginal benefits with marginal costs, including the marginalbenefits and costs of the safety net subsidy? But in the resultant new equilibrium, where the value ofthe net marginal subsidy is again zero, would the total net benefits of the subsidy be the same as inthe previous, more constrained equilibrium? Clearly the answer is no. We would expect total netbenefits to be larger, and the banking industry to be larger, as it rationally sought to fully exploit thenew opportunities to make profits and exploit the subsidy. Rather than focus on measuring how largethe net subsidy is today, perhaps the more appropriate focus of our discussion should be on the morespeculative question of how the expansion of bank powers would enhance the value of the safety netsubsidy, and what would be the characteristics of the resulting competitive relationships.Another key idea to keep in mind when thinking about the value of the safety netsubsidy is that we would fully expect the value of the subsidy to vary quite significantly across banksBIS Review   40/1997
- 6 -and over time. The safety net subsidy can be thought of as deriving primarily from the confidencethat investors have in the belief that banks will be supported in times of financial crisis. Thisconfidence is reflected in lower total and marginal costs of funding for banks, including lower capitalrequirements than otherwise would be the case. The economic value of this confidence is almostsurely rather low at very healthy banks during good economic times. However, the value can be verymuch greater for any bank in financial distress, and can skyrocket in times of systemic financialcrisis. As Chairman Greenspan noted in congressional testimony recently:What was it worth in the late 1980s and early 1990s for a bank with a troubled loanportfolio to have deposit liabilities guaranteed by the FDIC, to be assured that it could turn illiquid toliquid assets at once through the Federal Reserve discount window, and to tell its customers thatpayment transfers would be settled on a riskless Federal Reserve Bank? For many, it was worth notbasis points but percentage points. For some, it meant the difference between survival and failure.Empirical research on the option value of deposit insurance supports the point I amtrying to make. Estimates of the option value of deposit insurance, while subject to many caveats,show that riskier banks have considerably higher option values.What does all of this mean for the appropriate organizational form that future bankingorganizations should take? Now that is, I need not tell this audience, a complicated question! But Ithink the basic questions that we must answer are clear. First, assuming that one of the goals of publicpolicy is to not expand the safety net subsidy, what organizational form minimizes the chances ofsuch an expansion? Second, assuming that another goal of public policy is to limit the opportunitiesfor banks to exploit the moral hazard incentives inherent to the safety net, what organizational formbest ensures the safety and soundness of banks?The holding company organizational structure has a proven track record of helping toachieve both of these public policy goals. Indeed, years before I joined the Board, previous Boardsworked hard at convincing market participants that there is a clear distinction, in terms of access tothe safety net, between a bank and its affiliates. Market practice supports the view that we haveachieved considerable success at making this distinction. To me, it seems not only logical, but highlydesirable that we should build on this success as we continue to modernize our banking and financialsystem.When thinking about this issue, it is instructive to understand that in recent years bankholding companies have in fact tended to move activities from the holding company back into thebank. These activities had originally been put in the holding company to avoid geographic and similarrestrictions. As a result of this movement back into the bank, the nonbank assets held by holdingcompanies, excluding the assets of Section 20 securities subsidiaries, have declined by almost 50percent over the last decade to 5.2 percent of consolidated bank holding company assets. When askedwhy activities are being moved back into the bank, bankers often say that it is to take advantage ofthe lower funding costs available at the bank.One final point on this issue. It is certainly true that prudent managements of bankingorganizations will weigh all the relevant factors, including the value of the safety net, when decidingon the best organizational structure for their firm. However, the key point to remember is that thoseorganizations that stand to gain the most from the safety net in times of crisis--those with the highestnet subsidy and the strongest incentives to take excessive risks--are the most likely both to prefer andto take advantage of any organizational structures that allow the greatest net subsidy. These are alsothe organizations that are most likely to distort competitive relationships and expose taxpayers toconsiderable risk. Thus, while allowing organizations a choice of organizational structure certainlyincreases bank management’s flexibility, it is not clear that allowing such choice serves the publicinterest.BIS Review   40/1997
- 7 -ConclusionIn closing, let me return to where I began. Financial modernization is a process thatmust and will continue. But in the course of embracing and adapting to the future we must take careto retain what is of value in the past, and be careful that critical public policy goals are achieved. Theseparation of banking and commerce is an area where we should be particularly cautious. Once wehave mastered the art and science of supervising full service financial organizations, then perhaps weshould consider further combining banking and commerce. Technological change and financialinnovation are combining to change profoundly the way financial institutions measure, take, andmanage risk. These require that financial supervisors also adapt, and we need to move forward in thisendeavor. The development of full service financial organizations only reinforces the imperatives todo so. When designing a system that maintains bank safety and soundness and constrains extensionof the safety net, organizational structure is not irrelevant. Here again it seems prudent that we shouldbe cautious, and build on structures that have proven their worth.I am confident that a proper balance can be achieved between our sometimesconflicting and always complex goals. Indeed, I look forward to trying to contribute to the ongoingdiscussion and resolution of the challenges of financial modernization. Thank you.BIS Review   40/1997
Mr. Meyer considers the economic outlook and challenges facing monetary policyRemarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the 1998 Global Economic and Investment Outlook Conference, Carnegie MellonUniversity, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 17/9/97.Recent economic performance has been hailed on Wall Street as “paradise found” and the“best of times.” And, on Main Street, there is ample survey evidence suggesting that consumers arefeeling very upbeat about the prospects for the economy. I call the remarkable combination of healthygrowth, low unemployment, low inflation, a soaring stock market, and declining federal budget deficitthe “good news” economy.But there are challenges even in the “good news” economy and I want to focus on threeof them this afternoon. The first challenge is to avoid complacency and appreciate the policy challengesthat remain. The second is to explain how we have been able to achieve such favorable performance,given that it is better than almost anyone predicted and better than historical regularities suggested waseven possible. And the third challenge is to assess the risks in the current environment and determinehow monetary policy should be positioned to keep the good news coming.Two themes will become evident as I address these challenges. First, there are limits --limits on what policy can accomplish and limits on what the economy can achieve. Second, in assessingthe current environment and its implications for monetary policy, uncertainties require us to balancehistorical regularities and newer possibilities.Expansions, to an important degree, have common properties, what I shall refer to asregularities. Both forecasters and policymakers rely on these. Forecasters make predictions about futuredevelopments based on regularities. The same regularities allow policymakers to act pre-emptively --changing policy today in anticipation of developments tomorrow. Yet each expansion has its ownsignature that reflects the specific set of transitory influences and longer-lasting structural changes in playat the time.The current episode features the following players. Cyclical regularities clearly inevidence include accelerator effects, changing tolerances for risk, and cyclical swings in theunemployment rate and in profits. Two other regularities that I especially want to focus on today are thePhillips Curve and the trend growth in output. The latter regularities define limits - limits to thesustainable level of output, at any moment, and, once that level of capacity is reached, to the growth ofoutput over time. If these limits are exceeded, as typically happens during a cyclical expansion, theeconomy eventually overheats, inflation increases, and the expansion is undermined as policy is forced torein in demand. Transitory influences, clearly among the stars of the current episode, feature acoincidence of favorable supply shocks that have restrained inflation. Finally, structural adjustments, inthis episode, hint at a decline in NAIRU and/or an increase in trend growth. The central question ininterpreting the recent experience is whether the old limits on economic performance are no longerbinding, having been replaced by new possibilities, or are just being temporarily overruled by transitoryinfluences.Before moving to the substance of my talk, let me remind you that my remarks on theoutlook and monetary policy, today and always, are my views. I do not speak for the FOMC.Near-Term prospects in the Good News EconomyBefore addressing the challenges and developing these themes, let me briefly review thesurprisingly favorable features of recent economic performance and comment on the near-term outlook.For this audience, I can summarize recent performance in a single sentence. We have been recentlyblessed with relatively strong cyclical growth, the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, the lowestBIS Review   85/1997
- 2 -inflation in 31 years, an impressive investment boom, soaring equity prices and a 5-year decline in thefederal budget deficit that may take the deficit to below ½% of GDP in fiscal 1997.But this conference is about the next chapter in this story. And the key in the near termmay be crosscurrents that appear likely to both moderate output growth and keep inflation relatively wellcontained.In the case of output growth, the crosscurrents are the continued strength in demand andthe expected slowing in inventory investment. In the second quarter, the economy slowed to an upwardrevised 3.6% rate, from a 4.9% rate in the first quarter, a much more modest slowing than originallyreported and widely anticipated during the quarter. This, by the way, has been a recurring pattern in theexpansion -- every time I thought the economy had or was about to slow to trend, it has surprised with itscontinued strength.The fundamentals continue to look very positive. In particular, households as a group arewealthy and optimistic, businesses are profitable and confronted with dramatic technologicalopportunities, and financial conditions remain supportive. There appear to be few imbalances that are athreat to continued expansion. As a result, demand is expected to remain strong in the second half of theyear, paced by a rebound in consumer spending and complemented by continued strength in businessfixed investment.Forecasters know, however, that the composition or mix of output in one quarter --specifically the mix between final demand and inventory investment -- often provides an important hintof what is to come. While I interpret the strength of inventory investment in the first half -- including theupward revised rate of about $78 billion in the second quarter -- as largely voluntary, principallyreflecting a response to the strength in past and prospective sales, the flow rate of accumulation in thesecond quarter is almost certainly unsustainable. That is, stocks may be in equilibrium, but the flow ratewill have to slow to keep them there. The resulting slowdown in inventory investment is likely,therefore, to be a significant drag on production in the second half of this year, offsetting, at least in part,the expected rebound in final demand.On the inflation side, there are also important crosscurrents at work. I have beenconcerned about two considerations that suggest that inflation may well rise over time: the possibilitythat the economy is operating today beyond its sustainable capacity and the likelihood that the transitoryfactors that have, on balance, been restraining inflation will diminish in importance over time. However,three other influences that, in my view, have gradually become more significant considerations, are likelyto moderate the tendency for inflation to rise in the near term. First, lower-than-expected overall and coreinflation and continued modest pace of wage change over this year will encourage more restrainedincreases in wages and prices over the coming year. Lower inflation leads to lower inflation expectations,reinforcing the prospect for low inflation ahead. In this case, inertia is our friend and the result is avirtuous wage-price spiral, at least for a while. Second, some of the transitory factors, especially theappreciation of the dollar and resulting decline in import prices, appear to have longer legs and are likelyto contribute more toward restraint on inflation in coming quarters than earlier appeared likely. Third, theupward adjustment to profits in the July NIPA revisions suggests there is more of a profit cushion thatcould delay the pass-through of higher compensation to price increases.While these crosscurrents suggest moderation in both output growth and inflation,crosscurrents don’t necessarily balance. With respect to output growth, the crosscurrents do point towardslower growth in the second half compared to the first half, but is important whether the slower growthturns out to be near trend, holding utilization rates constant, or above trend, pushing utilization rates stillhigher. At the very least, the slowdown in inventory investment is likely to be accommodated withminimal disturbance to the continued expansion. But there is a risk that growth will continue to be abovetrend, pushing utilization rates up, from already high levels.BIS Review   85/1997
- 3 -With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase ininflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997. I will pay veryclose attention to the source of any rebound in inflation, specifically the degree to which it reflectssimply the dissipation of some of the favorable supply shocks that have contributed to the very lowinflation this year and the degree to which it reflects the more persistent effect of high utilization rates.As a result, I will be focusing more on core than overall inflation rates and paying particularly closeattention to labor costs, given that labor markets appear tighter than product markets and therefore morelikely to be the source of any increase in inflation pressures. Still, any increase in inflation would beginfrom a lower base and may be more modest than previously appeared likely.The bottom line is that past performance, in several important dimensions, has beenextraordinary and that prospects look favorable for continued expansion and relatively low inflation.Still, monetary policy must be alert to the potential of a developing upward trend in inflation in aneconomy that may already be operating beyond its sustainable capacity and possibly still growing at anabove-trend rate. And, as always, there are challenges, even in the good news economy.Limits on What Monetary Policy Can DoThe first challenge is to avoid becoming complacent. Even as there are good reasons forcelebrating recent economic performance, there are good reasons for avoiding complacency. Specifically,there are dimensions of economic performance which are less stellar, such as the slow average growthrate in GDP in the 1990s, a continuation of the effects of the productivity slowdown that began in theearly 1970s. There are, in addition, obvious longer-run problems that deserve to be confronted today,such as those related to the aging of the population and resulting pressures on entitlement programs. Andthere remain lingering social strains associated with a gradual increase in income inequality, interactingwith the low average growth rate in productivity to produce a long period of relatively stagnant realincome for the median income family.This less rosy perspective on the current state of the economy was suggested by severalmembers of Congress during the recent oversight hearings on monetary policy. I think the point is animportant one and I agree that we should not let the recent favorable performance of inflation,unemployment and equity prices distract our attention from the importance of confronting a slow averagerate of increase in living standards and lingering social problems that both reflect and are exacerbated bya widening in income inequality. However, other than through its pursuit of its legislative mandates ofprice stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policy cannot make a major contributionto the resolution of these problems. Monetary policy, in particular cannot remedy increases in incomeinequality, raise the trend rate of increase in living standards, or combat inadequate opportunities forupward mobility out of poverty. It is, as always, important that we carry out our traditionalresponsibilities well, accommodating the maximum sustainable growth and achieving the maximumsustainable level of employment. But we cannot do more.RegularitiesThe second challenge is to explain why performance has been so favorable, at least interms of inflation and unemployment. Before exploring explanations of the puzzle, I want to focus oncommon features of cyclical expansions. In doing so, I will focus on cyclical expansions that have notbeen dominated by dramatic external shocks, such as the two episodes that were marked by steeply risingworld oil prices -- first in the early 1970s and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While even theseexpansions share many of the patterns I emphasize later, their endings are dominated by the effects of thepowerful supply shocks and policy responses to the shocks.Expansions, by definition, begin with considerable economic slack, inherited from theprevious recession. The economy typically makes a rapid transition from declining output (the definitionof recession) to above-trend growth. In a loose way, trend growth refers to the growth in the economy’sproductive capacity. When growth is above trend, production is expanding faster than the economy’sBIS Review   85/1997
- 4 -productive capacity and, as a result, resource utilization rates rise. Rising capacity utilization rates andfalling unemployment rates are thus a typical feature of an expansion period.The natural dynamic of an expansion is for above-trend growth to continue until demandovertakes capacity, despite the best efforts of policy to avoid cyclical excesses. The end of the story isparticularly important. Expansions do not die of old age or lethargy, a spontaneous weakening ofaggregate demand, but rather of an accumulation of imbalances, specifically with demand outstrippingthe limits of sustainable level of input utilization and growth of output. The resulting rise in inflationbecomes a threat to the continued expansion. Preventive medicine is therefore the best course oftreatment.In this story, NAIRU sets a limit to how far the economy can expand before overheatingsets in and inflation rises, and the Phillips Curve traces out an important part of the dynamics ofinflation, how fast it responds to excess demand. Of course, the Phillips Curve framework has alwaysbeen much easier to describe than to implement, given uncertainties about the estimates of NAIRU, giventhe fact that empirical regularities between inflation and unemployment always left much of the variationin inflation unexplained, and given the importance of supply shocks with significant, though transitory,effects on the inflation-unemployment nexus. Nevertheless, the regularity in the cyclical sensitivity ofinflation, as embedded in the Phillips Curve, has proved to be an important guide to both forecasters andmonetary policymakers in the past.Transitory InfluencesThe consensus estimates of NAIRU as this expansion began -- about 6% -- did notprepare us for the recent surprisingly favorable performance. It is possible that the Phillips Curve andNAIRU is simply the wrong analytical framework, but I doubt it and am not aware of another model ofinflation dynamics that is ready to take its place. So my response is to update my estimate of NAIRU andadd other explanations consistent with this framework, but not to abandon this concept.One possible explanation is that one or more transitory factors, for the moment, areyielding a more favorable than usual outcome. A coincidence of favorable supply shocks is clearly, in myjudgment, an important part of the answer to the puzzle. I won’t talk at length about these factors, as Ihave done so in previous talks. I would just note that these favorable supply shocks include anappreciation of the dollar and consequent decline in import prices; a slowing in the rate of increase inbenefit costs, concentrated in a slowdown in costs for health care insurance; a faster rate of decline incomputer prices than earlier, reflecting the quicker pace of innovation; and more recently, a decline in oilprices and a slower rate of increase in food prices.A Cyclical AnomalyLet me include in my list of explanations for the current favorable economic performancean intriguing cyclical anomaly. One regularity of past expansions has been the close relationship betweentwo widely used measures of resource utilization -- the capacity utilization and unemployment rates.They have traditionally moved together over a cycle and tended to mirror one another. In this case, it didnot matter which one was used as a proxy for excess demand; and the unemployment rate could be usedinterchangeably as a measure of labor market demand pressures and overall economy-wide demandpressures. In the current episode, however, these two measures are sending different signals. Theunemployment rate is flashing a warning of a very tight labor market. The capacity utilization rate, incontrast, suggests a reasonably balanced configuration of production and capacity in the product market,at least in the manufacturing sector.Why has this divergence developed and what are its implications for the relationshipbetween inflation and unemployment? The divergence mirrors one of the other defining features of thisexpansion -- the boom in business fixed investment. The result is a high level of net investment, a morerapid rate of increase in the capital stock and hence in industrial capacity.BIS Review   85/1997
- 5 -The resulting absence of excess demand in the product market is, in my view, animportant factor explaining the frequently reported absence of pricing leverage by firms. Nothing gives afirm pricing leverage like excess demand. In addition, the resulting inability of firms to pass on highercosts in higher prices likely has altered the way firms operate in the labor market, making them morereluctant to bid aggressively for workers, contributing to a slower rate of increase in wages than wewould otherwise have expected at prevailing labor utilization rates. It is possible that the gap that hasopened between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates may be a factor that has, in effect,lowered NAIRU in this expansion. This explanation has potential, but there is no historical precedent andit is, therefore, difficult to judge its importance.PossibilitiesThe most intriguing explanations for the recent favorable performance are structuralchanges, which may have relaxed the capacity constraints that are the core of the cyclical regularitiesstory, or made these constraints more flexible than in the past, or tempered the ability and/or willingnessof firms to respond to excess demand by raising wages and prices. I refer to these collectively as“possibilities,” as they suggest an optimistic period of improved economic performance, contrasting withboth the pessimism of the previously perceived limits in the cyclical regularities story or the grudging“for the moment” concession of explanations relying on transitory influences. There are two possibilitiesthat have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate withoutrising inflation (i.e., that NAIRU has declined) and that, once capacity has been reached, the economy isnow capable of faster growth, compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier. A lot of thediscussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities --specifically, whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change, asreflected in a lower NAIRU, or to product market structural change, as reflected in a higher rate ofgrowth in productivity.Has there been a decline in NAIRU?Time varying parameter estimates of the Phillips Curve and the more casual eye bothsuggest a decline in NAIRU. Robert Gordon’s work, for example, suggests a decline in NAIRU, from6% in the decade prior to 1994, to about 5½% by the end of 1995, with NAIRU stabilizing at this levelsince that time.One possible explanation for the more moderate rate of increase in compensation perhour than would have been expected from historical experience is an increase in worker insecurity as aconsequence of the rapid pace of technological change and/or the rapid pace of restructuring anddownsizing. As a result, workers may have been willing to trade off some real wages for increasedsecurity, resulting in a more modest increase in compensation per hour than otherwise would have beenexpected. The result is a slower rate of increase in compensation at any given level of unemployment,equivalent to a decline in NAIRU. Another possible explanation is the divergence between theunemployment and capacity utilization rates in this expansion that I discussed earlier.Although a decline in NAIRU is a story of relaxed limits, the worker insecurityexplanation is not itself an optimistic story. Some workers, to be sure, gain, by opportunities foremployment that otherwise would have been denied. But a broader group of workers suffer a slowerincrease in living standards, relative to what otherwise would have been “possible.”Has there been an increase in trend productivity?Another possibility is that the trend rate of increase in productivity -- and hence theeconomy’s sustainable rate of growth in GDP -- has recently increased.There is some confusion in many discussions of productivity growth about theimplications of measurement bias. It is widely accepted that there is a downward bias in measuredBIS Review   85/1997
- 6 -productivity growth, the mirror image of the upward bias in measured inflation. But it is also widelyaccepted that a similar bias has been present over the entire postwar period. The measurement issue isrelevant to explaining the inflation-unemployment experience in the current episode only if the bias hasrecently become more serious. An increase in measurement bias could be under way, perhaps related toan acceleration in technical change, but it will be a long time before we are able to establish this with areasonable degree of certainty. Note also that if the measurement bias has increased, this would implythat both actual and potential output growth are higher than reported, with no obvious implication for thegap between actual and potential output, and hence for inflation pressures.Sources of higher productivity growth, all of which should show up in measuredproductivity, include a return on years of corporate restructuring and the increase in capital per workerassociated with the current investment boom, much of which is linked to technological change,specifically the information revolution.There are a couple of reasons why this is an attractive explanation. No other explanationhas the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity.Technological change, according to this view, has resulted in new profit opportunities which in turn haveresulted in an investment boom (heavily concentrated in high technology equipment), increased corporateearnings, and a soaring stock market. In addition, this explanation is consistent with many anecdotesfrom businesses about efficiency gains as new technology is put into place.There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for thefavorable inflation performance. First, a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle werewhy higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices. But the greater puzzle is the slow paceof increase in compensation per hour at prevailing unemployment rates. This is more clearly the caseafter the downward revision in compensation in the July NIPA revisions, bringing that measure ofcompensation per hour more in line with the Employment Cost Index. Given the rate of increase incompensation, an unchanged trend growth in productivity of 1.1%, for example, seems quite consistentwith recent price performance.Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity dataprovide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlyingproductivity growth. The growth in measured productivity over this expansion has, in fact, beendisappointing. Over 1994 and 1995, in particular, measured productivity was nearly flat. Although it hasaccelerated over the last two years, this is consistent with another cyclical regularity, the tendency forproductivity to accelerate with economic activity. And the rate of growth over the last year, even with thesharp upward revision in the second quarter, is 1.2%, just above the 1.1% average rate of increase overthe period from the early 1970s up to the beginning of this expansion.Still, there are other pieces of data and interpretations of the published data that providesome support to a more optimistic assessment. For example, the acceleration in productivity to a 1.2%rate over the last year, at a time when the unemployment rate was dropping to a level that would suggestless productive workers were being drawn on, leaves open the possibility that the productivity trend hasquickened. Perhaps the strongest case for an increase in the productivity trend comes from the higher rateof growth over the past two years if productivity is measured from the income side of the nationalaccounts.Balancing regularities and possibilitiesIn my testimony at the Congressional oversight hearings, I presented a range of estimatesfor NAIRU and trend growth from the CBO, Council of Economic Advisers, DRI, MacroeconomicAdvisers and Professor Robert Gordon. The range for NAIRU was 5.4% to 5.9% and for trend growth,2.1%-2.3%. Since my testimony, both DRI and Macroeconomic Advisers have revised down theirestimates of NAIRU-DRI from 5.8% to 5.6% and Macroeconomic Advisers from 5.8% to 5.4%. Therange of estimates is now therefore more tightly concentrated around 5½%. I presented these estimates inBIS Review   85/1997
- 7 -my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the centraltendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates oftrend growth.In short, some updating in the regularities may be appropriate, especially in the case ofNAIRU, but continued attention to their message of limits remains critical for disciplined policy. Weshould remain open minded and alert to the possibility of structural change, but cautious about reachingthe conclusion that the regularities that have been so important in the past no longer set limits that policymust respect.The challenge for monetary policySome day we shall look back on this episode with historical perspective and perhaps --and only perhaps -- have a better ability to sort out what contributed to the favorable outcome and theextent to which the prevailing coexistence of low unemployment and stable low inflation provedpermanent or transitory. Monetary policy, however, is made in real time.The appropriate stance of monetary policy should reflect both the increased uncertaintysurrounding the failure of historical regularities to predict the better-than-expected outcome in terms ofinflation and unemployment and the best judgement about regularities as we update our estimates ofNAIRU and trend growth in response to current data.At one extreme, the uncertainty about the source of the recent performance might beviewed as so great that the best course for monetary policy is a reactive posture, waiting for clear signsthat inflation is rising and only tightening in response to such evidence. I agree that the currentuncertainty encourages caution, but not to the point of paralysis.A prudent approach would continue to lean against the cyclical winds by adjusting policyin response to persistent increases in utilization rates as well as in response to changes in underlyinginflation.Summing UpWe should always have problems like today’s, struggling to explain unexpectedly goodperformance. And it is important to keep in perspective any questions about how tight labor marketsmight be or whether near-term growth might remain above trend. The economy is very healthy and theprospects continue to be bright. But as we celebrate the exceptional present, we should not forget thelessons of the past. There are limits. They may not be the old limits that disciplined policy in the past.But even if the limits are new, they must be respected. Overheating is a natural product of expansionsthat overtax these limits. Recessions typically follow overheating. Good policy must therefore balanceregularities and possibilities.BIS Review   85/1997
Mr. Brash looks at economic developments and their bearing on inflationarytrends   Speaking notes of Mr. Donald Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,on the release of the September, 1997 Economic Projections in Wellington on 17/9/97.IntroductionGood morning, and welcome to this briefing on the Reserve Bank’s September1997 Economic Projections.You will recall that, in contrast to our June and December Monetary PolicyStatements, which the Bank is obliged to produce by statute, the Economic Projections which werelease each March and September are more in the nature of ‘self-initiated’ documents. Theirprimary purpose is to assist us in assessing economic developments that have a bearing oninflation trends, and thereby to assist us in forming judgements on how monetary policy shouldevolve. In publishing our Projections, we take the opportunity to inform financial markets andthe public generally on what is driving our day-to-day policy decisions. Typically, you canexpect to see in our Economic Projections more discussion of matters such as investmentbehaviour, labour market trends, the balance of payments and so on than is to be found in ourMonetary Policy Statements, which concentrate more on assessments of past and future financialmarket conditions, and the stance of monetary policy.However, both documents require us to produce a comprehensive view of thefuture trends in the New Zealand economy, and to test our previously articulated views againstthe stream of emerging data and opinion. A key ingredient in that process is our new forecastingand policy system (FPS) -- the system of models we now utilise in developing our Projections.One important change which that new system of models has made possible wasintroduced with our June Monetary Policy Statement. Whereas we had previously projectedinflation on the basis of an assumed track for interest rates and the exchange rate, in June weshifted to a structure that constrains our Projections of inflation to converge on the mid-part ofthe 0 to 3 percent inflation target, while allowing the track of monetary conditions to vary asnecessary to produce that outcome. You can see that process at work again in these Projections .One point made in relation to FPS when it was first introduced bears repeating.While it is an important tool which helps shape our view of the economy and its likely futurepath, it is not a ‘black box’. FPS provides a coherent framework for thinking about the economy,but considerable judgement is still required to arrive at a final projection. There are clearly anumber of different paths through which the economy can evolve to essentially the same point.What is portrayed in this document is just one of those paths, but one that we feel is bothrealistic and sound as a base for our policy judgements.The real economyShortly after our June Monetary Policy Statement was published, the release ofMarch quarter GDP data seemed to suggest that the economy was significantly weaker than wehad allowed for. Our subsequent analysis indicated that there were particular factors (notablythat Easter, unusually, fell into the March quarter) which explained much of the small decline inGDP in that quarter.BIS Review   84/1997
- 2 -Since then, the emerging data have suggested that the economy is a little weakerthan we had portrayed in June, but that it is also resuming a robust growth path. Whereas wewere projecting an annualised growth rate through the first half of calendar 1997 of a little over1 percent, the estimate incorporated in these Projections is closer to 0.5 percent. Having saidthat, data released since we completed the Projections are, if anything, suggestive of strongerrather than weaker outcomes for June quarter GDP. In any event, we remain of the viewexpressed in June that activity will pick up in the second half of the year. Over the year to March1998, we expect the economy to expand by around 2.5 percent, accelerating further to 4.6percent growth in the year to March 1999.The factors driving that expansion include a robust global economy, graduallyincreasing household expenditures, improved productivity, stronger exports (partly the result ofa lower exchange rate), business investment and an expansionary fiscal policy -- both fromincreased government spending under the Coalition Agreement and from the tax cuts scheduledfor July 1998. Easier monetary conditions since earlier this year are also supportive of strongergrowth.It seems clear that, in the middle of this decade, the New Zealand economybecame somewhat over-stretched in terms of its ability to support the pace of spending. It seemsequally clear that the economy has entered a period in which there is some spare capacity. Giventhe current and imminent expansionary forces that I have described, the spare-capacity phaseshould be short-lived, but long enough to take the pressure off inflation, and long enough tomake it unlikely that we will experience the kind of destructive crunch that has so often broughtpast cycles to a shuddering halt. In this sense, we are describing a growth profile that reflects thesteadying influence of maintaining low inflation, which in turn should contribute to NewZealand’s future growth potential.We expect continued job creation throughout the period to March 2000, continuedgrowth in real disposable household income (averaging over 3 percent per annum through theprojection period), continuing modest fiscal surpluses, further declines in the government’sdebt-to-GDP ratio, and an improvement in the current account deficit from nearly 6 percent ofGDP to around 4 percent of GDP.InflationAs I mentioned earlier, our new Projections framework takes as given thatinflation should converge on the mid-part of our target range, and derives the monetaryconditions that are needed to achieve that outcome. In that sense there is no particular news inthe fact that we expect underlying inflation to be close to the middle of the target over theprojection period. But there are some aspects of the inflation track that require comment.In particular, we now expect inflation outcomes over the next two quarters to berather higher than was the case in June. There are two principal sources of that upward revision.First, the last few months have seen a 6 or 7 percent depreciation of thetrade-weighted exchange rate. The increased inflation now expected over the next two quartersis, in part, a direct consequence of that depreciation.Secondly, domestic inflation continues to be strongly influenced by the policydecisions of the Government. We now estimate that, over the next two quarters, policy-relatedincreases in Housing New Zealand rentals and tertiary education fees could well exceed theBIS Review   84/1997
- 3 -materiality threshold which is applied in determining our measure of underlying inflation. In thatevent, underlying inflation would be slightly lower than the estimates given in these Projections.Policy ImplicationsWe now view an MCI level of 725 as being appropriate for the next quarter. Thisis 100 basis points lower than the desired MCI level which has applied for the last quarter, butroughly equivalent to actual monetary conditions over recent weeks. You will recall that a 100point reduction in the MCI is equivalent to a 1 percentage point decline in 90 day bill rates, a 2percent decline in the TWI, or some equivalent combination. You may also recall that theaverage MCI for the December 1996 quarter was 1000. The extent of easing over the past ninemonths has clearly been significant, although certainly off a high base.Our Projections point to further, but quite small, easings in the first two quartersof 1998 before emerging inflationary pressures lead us to expect monetary conditions to enteranother tightening phase. However, as we make clear in our policy assessment section, whetherthose further easings eventuate in 1998 is very much dependent on how the economy developsover the next few months. Financial market participants eager to bring forward the small, andconditional, easings shown in these Projections clearly do so at their own risk! On the face of it,with inflation over the next two years, and especially over the next two quarters, being a littlehigher than we thought likely back in June, easing now by more than we foreshadowed in Junemay seem surprising. The explanation is straightforward, and relates to the lags inherent in theoperation of monetary policy. While inflation is a little higher in the short term than we hadpreviously expected, it is still well within our target range, and has been boosted by factorswhich should be essentially transitory, such as the impact of moving Housing NZ rentals tomarket. Of more relevance to the outlook in 18 months to two years’ time is the margin of sparecapacity in the economy. That now looks somewhat larger than it did previously, and warrantssomewhat easier monetary conditions. Although activity will be accelerating through 1998, it isnot until 1999 that the inflation pressures associated with strong growth begin to emerge. Agradual tightening of monetary conditions from mid-1998 fits with that profile.There are, of course, alternative paths for monetary policy that could deliverinflation within our target range. As was discussed in June, one alternative path would involvemore aggressive easing now, followed by earlier and more aggressive tightening next year.Another path would involve holding conditions relatively flat at about current levels until thelatter part of 1998 before beginning a somewhat gentler tightening beyond that date. Inevitably,there is rather more art than science in selecting the best of these alternatives. What we havechosen reflects the risks that we see around us at present, and also reflects the benefits we see inproviding a relatively smooth path for monetary conditions over time.The mix of monetary conditionsOn numerous occasions over the past year or two, I have indicated that theparticular mix of monetary conditions was unhelpful -- that the exchange rate was too high,putting excessive pressure on exporters, and that interest rates remained too low to discourageborrowing for housing purposes, or to encourage increased domestic savings.The past quarter has seen a substantial, and welcome, shift in the mix of monetaryconditions in the direction we believed appropriate. The fall in the exchange rate will boost theincomes of exporters and those competing with imports, and will ultimately increase exportvolumes. The projected improvement in the current account balance reflects that. The increase inBIS Review   84/1997
- 4 -interest rates is also helpful, given the continuing pressures we have seen in the domestic ornon-tradeables sector of the economy, and especially in real estate markets. There is no benefitto New Zealand in seeing real estate prices increase to a point where they become vulnerable toa sudden, and damaging, correction. (Anyone who has been observing events in South-East Asiaover the past couple of months will be conscious of the enormous damage that can be inflicted inthose circumstances. Our own experience post-1987 is also instructive in that regard.)The shift in the mix of conditions, while substantial, has occurred in a mannerwhich is fully consistent with our inflation target, and fully consistent with our use of an MCI inassessing the overall stance of monetary policy. It is certainly the case that the sharp decline ofthe exchange rate will boost inflation to some degree in the short term. That is already apparentin our Projections. But even with that increase, projected inflation remains well within our targetrange. And the increase in interest rates that has accompanied the exchange rate fall will work inthe opposite direction, dampening inflation in the longer-term.The MCIAt the time when the exchange rate was declining, and interest rates were rising,we heard a good deal of criticism of our MCI. It was, it was claimed, too rigid; it was forcing upinterest rates at a time when the economy was already in recession; it was based on arelationship between interest rates and the exchange rate which was no longer valid; and so on.As I made clear in my speech to the Counties Kiwifruit Growers Association on22 August, I regard those criticisms as ill-founded. I think the MCI structure has performedadmirably over the past three months. In making that assessment, I think it is important to reflecton just how volatile international exchange rates have been over that period. Any of thealternative monetary policy arrangements we could have adopted in place of the MCI would alsohave been subject to a good deal of stress. I certainly see no reason to change the MCI approachat this point.Likewise, the description I offered in June of how the Bank might react todeviations in actual market conditions from the central or ‘desired’ MCI track appears to us tohave weathered the tests of the past quarter rather well. I see no reason to modify thatdescription now, and our response to evolving market conditions over the next three months willbe consistent with my comments of June.BIS Review   84/1997
Mr. Meyer discusses the connection between policy makers and marketparticipants in the United States   Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of theBoard of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Fixed Income Summit ofPSA, The Bond Market Trade Association held in Washington, D.C. on 12/9/97.Monetary Policy and the Bond Market: Complements or Substitutes?It is a pleasure to speak this afternoon at the Fixed Income Summit. To someanalysts, a meeting of the heads of the top fifty government securities dealers would represent aconcentration of influence over the U.S. economy that perhaps even surpasses that of themeeting I will attend on September 30. Indeed, some have argued that the activities of tradersand investors in the bond market have become a major stabilizing force in the economy, even tothe point of making the FOMC redundant. This premise suggests an interesting theme for myaddress this afternoon -- the connection, or maybe more appropriately the symbiosis, betweenpolicy makers and market participants.The Importance of Market MechanismsThe Federal Reserve has been most successful over the years when it has relied onmarket mechanisms to carry out its policy intent. Regulation Q, in its fixing of ceilings ondeposit rates, distorted incentives and led to sudden and large swings in the pattern ofintermediation. Selective credit controls, in retrospect, were a blunt instrument that was toounpredictable and extreme to use effectively. And the Board of Governors has found that reserverequirements, which represent a tax on depositories because our reserves do not bear interest, arebest held steady at the lowest level consistent with the efficient implementation of policy.Instead, the Federal Reserve controls its balance sheet to influence a rate quotedby market participants any time that the reserve market is open -- the overnight federal fundsrate. In truth, as you all know, movements in that rate have little direct significance, except toreserve managers and those relatively few others concerned with the overnight cost of funds. Buthow that rate gets transmitted along the term structure to yields on longer maturity instrumentshas broad significance that ultimately affects everyone in the economy. And that is where marketparticipants come in. Policymakers’ influence is focused on the current short rate. It is the job oftraders and investors to read our intentions from the public record, form their own judgments asto the course of economic activity and inflation that are based on, in addition to monetary policy,current and prospective fiscal policies and demand and supply shocks, and translate all that intoaction as expressed in the prices of a bewildering array of debt, equity, and derivativeinstruments.Varieties of ErrorsWhile the market activities of traders and investors can importantly reinforce andstrengthen the actions taken by the FOMC in the pursuit of its broad macroeconomic objectives,they cannot replace the FOMC. Sometimes, believe it or not, they turn out to complicate, ratherthan advance, the cause of monetary policy. Before I turn to the good the market does incomplementing policy action, let me start by deflating the notion that an omniscient bond marketalways gets it right so as to render the FOMC redundant.Because many of the instruments in which you deal have long maturities, thejudgments that have to be made to price them by necessity stretch well into the future. The scopefor error can be large and the consequences costly. I think it is useful to separate the grounds forBIS Review   83/1997
- 2 -mistakes into two groups: market participants could be wrong about the economy, or wrongabout policymakers’ objectives. Two examples can make this distinction clearer.For one, we know, after the fact, that most analysts misjudged the full extent towhich unusual restraint on credit was exerting a drag on spending from around 1989 to 1993.Essentially, both households and firms recoiled from the explosion of debt in the 1980s. Theywere burdened by high interest service and took steps to bring their balance sheets into a moresustainable configuration. Lenders, too, had their own imbalances, brought on importantly bythe real estate bust. Among them, banks drew back from extending loans to a wide variety ofborrowers, including businesses. In this environment, spreads of private over public rateswidened in the market, and borrowers and lenders who went to depositories were confrontedwith far less favorable terms than they had grown accustomed to.While Chairman Greenspan and his fellow policymakers identified the creditcrunch in a fairly timely fashion, it took some time to appreciate the full force of its power. Bymy reading, in the aggregate, market participants were slower on the uptake. Thus, the policyeasings of 1991 and 1992 were greeted with some skepticism as market participants apparentlyinterpreted those actions as reflecting a lessened concern about inflation on the part of theFederal Reserve, rather than the appropriate response to a softening in aggregate demand. Theeffect of those mis-assessments was to produce a stunning steepening of the yield curve. Thespread between long and short-term rates is often viewed as one of the most reliable cyclicalindicators and a widening as a measure of the increased stimulus of monetary policy. But Iviewed the widening in this episode as evidence of the reduced effectiveness of monetary policyin an environment where actions by bond-market participants were preventing long-term interestrates from adjusting in response to the policy-induced decline in short-term rates. At its peak inmid-1992, the long-term Treasury bond yielded 475 basis points over the three-month bill rate,about three times the average for the prior three decades. True, as the full dimension of theeffects of the credit crunch became apparent, yields fell from those heights. But in the interim,monetary policy’s intentions were blunted by the market’s misreading of the economy. Thisprobably prolonged the need for ease and further accentuated the required easing of the federalfunds rate.As another example, I have spent enough of my career projecting near-termeconomic trends to be familiar with a forecaster’s favorite friend -- momentum. But momentumcan easily be misjudged. It is easy to fall into the trap of presuming that what an economic actordid last is what that actor will do next. Thus, market prices tend to extrapolate that changes inmonetary policy cluster in the same direction. This is a rule that works often enough, but, as alook back to 1994 and 1995 reminds us, not always. By mid-1994, the FOMC had substantiallyraised its intended federal funds rate, but market prices seemed to say that enough was notenough. The tightenings in May and August of that year, for example, were greeted by a roughlyparallel shift up in money market futures rates, implying that the actions had not gotten theFederal Reserve any closer to the goal line -- instead, the goal line had been pushed back. Andthe Fed indeed did continue to tighten through early 1995. But by late 1994 and early 1995, theterm structure spreads in financial markets remained very wide, implying an expectation of stillsignificant further tightening. As a result, the restraint associated with the policy action wasamplified. In retrospect, a tighter focus on fundamentals -- that policy was acting in a pre-emptive fashion to contain inflation, rather than an extrapolation of the sequence of recent policyactions -- would have helped to cap the rise in longer-term yields.BIS Review   83/1997
- 3 -The Benefits of Market MechanismsWhile I have been speaking about all manner of misjudgments, I actually do havean economist’s inherent confidence in market mechanisms. Market participants do, on average,get it right and are rewarded accordingly, to the benefit of economic efficiency. Indeed, thepattern of those rewards sharpens skills in trading and forecasting, ensuring that these benefitswill continue to accrue. For that reason, policymakers are well advised to heed the message frommarkets that are expressed in prices.What I find most intriguing is the notion that markets can carry some, and, in theextreme view, all of the load for monetary policymakers. To push it to an extreme, it’s as if theactions of the Federal Open Market Committee, of which I am a member, can be anticipated,augmented, and, perhaps, even replaced, by meetings of the Private Open Market Committee, ofwhich you are members.There are two main advantages of these meetings of the Private Open MarketCommittee. First, members meet twenty-four hours a day, every business day of the year, so thatthe POMC can respond to every scrap of information on the economy, whether it be an officialdata release, a statement by an official, or a rumor about the future course of policy. Second,every participant can express the strength of his or her belief in a particular view by the amountof capital committed to the trade.Because of the inclusiveness of the market, a broad assortment of views about theworkings of the economy can be reflected in prices. While the design of the FOMC fosters asimilar diversity of views, virtually nonstop market trading allows prices to move before officialpolicymakers can react. Of course, the FOMC delegates authority to the Chairman and, in thisage of instantaneous communication, conference calls are always possible. But, practically, witha fixed calendar of FOMC meetings, a desire on our part for a systematic review of the situationto help our deliberations, and some inertia in decision making, markets will almost always bebetter positioned to react more quickly to news than the Federal Reserve. This speedy response,when right, puts in place stimulus or restraint sooner, perhaps lessening the need for us,ultimately, to move our policy instrument as much.In general, the more forward looking the bond market is with respect to futurepolicy action, the shorter will be the lag from policy action to intended economic effect. In theabsence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates mayhave to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates andeconomic activity. Indeed, in those circumstances, the Federal Reserve would have to weighcarefully the effects on long rates of both the current and lagged levels of short rates so as toavoid the potential for an overshooting of short-term interest rates that would have adverseconsequences for the economy. However, if long-term rates move swiftly in response tocorrectly anticipated policy, the required rise in short-term rates will be smaller and there will beless risk of overshooting. Thus, for the same reasons the Federal Reserve attempts to bepre-emptive in its monetary policy decisions, we would welcome pre-emptive pricing by marketparticipants.But we must recognize that what markets are pricing is anticipated FederalReserve action. If the prices are right, we will act to validate them. If the prices are wrong - builton the base of an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will provethem wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to. It is also important to appreciatethat the anticipatory contribution of the markets cannot be sustained unless the FOMC ratifiesBIS Review   83/1997
- 4 -well-timed moves of the market. If the FOMC were to fail to do so, it would disconfirm theexpectations on which the market move was based, making it less likely in the future that themarket would play a constructive anticipatory role. Therefore, while forward-looking marketsmay change what we policy makers need to do, they will never eliminate the need for the FOMCto respond to changing economic developments.Some Lessons for Markets and PolicymakersI hope that the important question that this discussion has been pointing to isobvious by now: How can we -- the Federal and the Private Open Market Committees -- operateto deliver the greatest good for the American economy while you respect your obligation tostakeholders to maximize their return? I think that there are two parts to the answer: We shouldwork at arm’s length but with full information.By arm’s length, I mean that the information markets provide works best as anindependent check on monetary policy decisions. If the FOMC were to tie mechanically ouractions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whateverwhim that currently struck investors’ fancy. If you were to take our reading of the economy as iffrom a sacred text, the unique sources of information and skills that you have refined would gountapped. It is far better that we should treat each other warily so as to keep each other sharp.By full information, I mean that the Federal Reserve should do its best to readsignals from markets and to communicate to markets its policy intentions. The Domestic andForeign Open Market Desks of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are virtually in constantcommunication with market participants and routinely distill that information for theirpolicy-making principals. My fellow governors and I routinely receive from our staff atranslation of the term structure of Treasury yields into implied forward rates, volatility inferredfrom options prices, and paths for expected monetary policy action consistent with futuresprices.Of late, the information we receive has included inferences drawn from quotes onthe Treasury’s inflation protected securities. In principle, such information should be helpful ininterpreting all manner of economic behavior, including the pricing of financial instruments andwage setting. As yet, I must admit that, in the eight months since the first issue, the volume oftrade and the apparent lack of interest in related contracts on the futures market has beensomewhat disappointing. The Treasury’s strong commitment to this product, reflected in therange of maturities that have and will be sold and the volume of securities sold, should do muchto foster this market, as will the growing realization by market participants that indexed debtwill represent an increasing share of the nation’s debt obligations. But even after we havereliable quotes on a more complete indexed term structure, considerable analysis must still bedone before we can cull readings of inflation expectations and inflation risk from market prices.As you well appreciate, the spread of the yield on a nominal instrument over itsinflation-protected counterpart includes compensation for expected inflation, inflationuncertainty, and differential risk characteristics. Until we have a long enough history to be morecertain of the relative contributions of each, we must watch, wait, and learn.Communication must flow two ways. Over the past few years, I am pleased tosay, the FOMC has significantly enhanced the information it provides to the public. That listincludes announcing actions -- and the reasons underlying them -- within the day that thedecisions are made and providing complete transcripts of meetings with a five year lag. Wecontinue to release a comprehensive record of policy discussions six to eight weeks after eachBIS Review   83/1997
- 5 -meeting. We now report the daily size of reserve operations within minutes of their completion,and we have lifted the last veil covering the inner sanctum of policy: Rather than speaking intongues about “slight” or “somewhat” changes in reserve pressures, the FOMC now announcesthe intended federal funds rate when it is changed. In one respect, the distance covered in thatchange was not all that great, in that for most of this decade, the Federal Reserve has been ratherexplicit in signaling through its choice of open market operations whenever the FOMC electedto alter its intended rate. But compared to the borrowed reserves operating period of the latterhalf of the previous decade, the change has been dramatic. Rather than rely on Fed watchersemployed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we informeveryone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.By my reading, this is one circumstance in which virtue has proved more than itsown reward. Over the past 3½ years, a financial innovation -- sweeps from retail deposits -- hascomplicated reserve operations. On average, depositories that have adopted sweeps have beenable to reduce their effective reserve requirements by 80 to 90 percent. When aggregated overthe entire banking system, the scale is staggering. By year-end, transactions deposits willprobably have been reduced by nearly $¼ trillion as the result of the cumulative effect of retailsweeps, which is big even by Washington standards. Going by a simple rule of thumb, requiredreserves will be lower by about one-tenth that total.This innovation has made the technical job of implementing monetary policyfrom day to day more difficult. Simply, reserve requirements are no longer necessarily thebinding determinant of reserve demand for many banks. When reserve requirements are inexcess of clearing balances, volatile movements in clearing balances will have a small effect onthe reserves market. However, when desired clearing balances dictate short-run movements inthe demand for reserves, the reserve market, and therefore the federal funds rate, may become abit more volatile late in the trading day. However, to the credit of my colleagues charged withdetermining daily open market operations and of market participants who have adjustedoperations to the new environment, that volatility has been quite muted. Still, if markets hadonly daily open market operations to discern the FOMC’s intentions, the scope formisimpressions in this environment would be large. Because you can read press releases to learnour policy stance rather than the pattern of reserve additions or drains, there is much less chancefor confusion. For pricing any instrument beyond overnight, market participants apparently findthe intended federal funds rate to be more informative than the noisy effective federal funds rate.Nonetheless, it would be helpful to prevent a further increase in the volatility ofthe effective federal funds rate that might result from a further sweep-induced decline inrequired reserves. And a means is available to the Congress today to accomplish that end: TheFederal Reserve should be permitted to pay interest on reserves. As it stands now, depositoriesresort to complicated means to evade our reserve requirements -- such as retail sweeps --because our reserves are sterile and to do less would put them at a competitive disadvantage in amarket where profit margins are paper thin. By paying interest on reserves, the incentive toengage in sweeps would be sharply reduced and the practice would likely diminish over time, ifnot end entirely. As a result, bankers could devote their attention to more productive pursuits,and reserve markets would be easier to read.ConclusionI can assure you that I view financial markets as a national resource. To be sure,they do not light the way to proper policy making as perfectly as true believers may assert. Butthere is information to be gotten, and it has been my experience that policy makers do try toBIS Review   83/1997
- 6 -extract it. For our part, we will try to preserve those benefits. For your part, the Private OpenMarket Committee does public good -- even if it is the by-product of the pursuit of personalprofits -- when it views policy making with a skeptical eye. After all, it is only the best offriends who have the courage to point out the most sensitive of faults.BIS Review   83/1997
BIS Review   82/1997Bank of Japan’s August review of monetary and economic trends in JapanBANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 26/8/97.Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend.  Production andincome are showing firmness although the effects of the consumption tax hike remain.  Withrespect to final demand, public-sector investment has been on a decreasing trend, and housinginvestment has declined.  Meanwhile, net exports have recently been on an increasing trend, andbusiness fixed investment has been rising steadily.  Despite the continued influence of theconsumption tax hike, the recovery trend of personal consumption does not seem to have beenhindered given the improvement in labor market conditions and income formation. Industrialproduction has been firm.  Meanwhile, prices have remained stable on the whole, and the growthof monetary aggregates has continued at around 3.0 per cent year to year.With regard to personal consumption, outlays for travel have continued toincrease moderately.  However, passenger-car sales marked the fourth month of consecutivedecline year to year from April and sales of electrical appliances are also negative year to year.Sales at department stores and supermarkets continued to be below the previous year’s level.These reflect some temporary factors, such as the typhoons which hit Japan in June and July, inaddition to the continued reaction to the surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike.However, given that labor market conditions as well as income formation are improvingsteadily, albeit moderately, the recovery trend in personal consumption does not seem to havebeen hindered.Among leading indicators of business fixed investment, machinery orders havebeen increasing steadily, although at a somewhat slower pace compared to the sharp rise in thesecond half of 1996. The increase in the construction floor area has recently been weak, but it isfollowing a moderate recovery trend.With respect to housing investment, housing starts in terms of the seasonally-adjusted annual rate reached a substantially high level in the fourth quarter 1996, partlyreflecting the stepped-up demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate.  Later, theydeclined in reaction.  Housing starts recorded around 1.5 million in spring 1997, but fell to 1.34million in June, the lowest level recorded since January 1993.Regarding public-sector investment, the amount of public works contracted hasrecently picked up somewhat from the level recorded in early 1997 owing to orders included inthe supplementary budget for fiscal 1996.  However, public-sector investment has beenfollowing a declining trend on average, reflecting the restrained budget for fiscal 1997.Against the background of the steady overseas demand and the yen’s depreciationto date, real exports stayed firm in July after having increased significantly in the second quarterreflecting some additional temporary factors.  Real imports had been stagnant since April, butrose in July reflecting the rise in imports of foodstuffs and airplanes, in addition to the increasingtrend of information-related goods.  As a result, the real trade surplus stopped rising in July afterthe significant increase in the second quarter.  The nominal current-account surplus showed alarge expansion in the second quarter 1997, partly reflecting the decline in crude oil prices sinceearly 1997.Industrial production in the second quarter has been firm and remained virtuallyunchanged after recording high growth during the second half of 1996 and the first quarter 1997.Despite the decline in demand following the surge ahead of the consumption tax hike, factors
- 2 -BIS Review   82/1997such as the substantial increase in exports and the rebuilding of inventories have supportedproduction.  Production is expected to increase slightly in July and August compared to thesecond quarter.  Meanwhile, inventories are at appropriate levels on the whole, despite someaccumulation in industries such as in automobiles.Labor market conditions have continued to improve on the whole.  Although theunemployment rate remains at a high level, the growth in nominal wages has been increasingand the year-to-year employment growth has started to gather pace, albeit gradually, reflectingthe increase in production and corporate profits.Prices remained stable on the whole, excluding the effect of the consumption taxhike.  Although downward pressures remain, including that from the decline in import prices, aswell as that from technological innovation in electrical machinery, domestic wholesale prices(adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have remained virtually unchanged.  This reflects themoderate improvement in overall domestic supply and demand conditions.  The year-to-yeardeclines in corporate service prices are narrowing steadily on the whole, partly owing to theimprovement in supply and demand conditions, particularly for real estate rents and informationservices, although leasing charges continue to decline.  Consumer prices (nationwide, excludingperishables) overall are marginally above the previous year’s level mainly because the year-to-year declines in goods prices have narrowed.The growth in monetary aggregates, measured in terms of the year-to-year growthof M2 + CDs average outstanding, has been growing at around 3 per cent.Regarding money market rates, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) hasmoved at a level slightly below the official discount rate.  The 3-month CD rate has stayed ataround 0.55 - 0.60 per cent.  Meanwhile, the long-term government bond yield rose to 2.65 -2.70 per cent in late May.  Later, it started to decline as the market confirmed the moderate paceof the economic recovery, and reached a historically low level below 2.1 per cent in mid August.With respect to bank lending rates, the short-term prime lending rate hasremained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995.  The long-term primelending rate was raised by 0.6 percentage points in May, and was then lowered by 0.2 percentagepoints both in June and July to 2.7 per cent. (The record low level is 2.5 per cent.)  In thesecircumstances, short and long-term contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts (up toJune) have moved at record low levels.On the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average moved at around¥20,000 - 21,000 between May and July 1997, but later declined, reflecting such factors as thefall in U.S. stock prices.  Recently, it has been moving at around ¥19,000.In the foreign exchange market, the yen appreciated to ¥110 to the U.S. dollar inthe first half of June.  The yen later depreciated slightly, and has recently stayed at around¥115 - 120.  Meanwhile, the yen has also been appreciating against the Deutsche Mark sinceMay, and recently has moved at around ¥63 - 65.
BIS Review   80/1997Mr. Grenville discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia and the business cycle*Talk by Mr. Stephen Grenville, a Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to theMelbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research Conference on “Business Cycles:Policy and Analysis” held in Melbourne on 5/9/97.“Real output … fluctuates around a rising trend.” (Solow 1997, p. 230). Thisseemingly innocuous statement encompasses much of what practical, operationalmacro-economics is about: how to raise the trend; and how to reduce fluctuations around thistrend.This talk focuses on what monetary policy might do to reduce fluctuations aroundthe trend. The Governor spoke only a few weeks ago about what monetary policy might do forgrowth (Macfarlane 1997). In a nutshell, price stability will be generally helpful to long-termgrowth because it ensures resources are deployed more efficiently, but the main sources ofgrowth are to be found in increases in labour inputs and productivity.What about monetary policy and the cycle? The starting point is that life would bemore comfortable all around if the cyclical swings are not too big and if the bumps in variousparts of the economy are not too coincident. It seems likely, too, that however convenient it isanalytically to separate trend from fluctuations, there will be a link between the cycle and eitherthe level of GDP or its trend growth rate. If the severity of the downturns is reduced and theeconomy operates with a smaller output gap, then the level of income over time is, on average,higher. As well, big swings (such as 1982 and 1990) risk hysteresis: the process of windingunemployment down again has proved to be slow and difficult.Is there anything to be said on the other side of the argument? You will recall theSchumpeterian argument that cycles have some cathartic, cleansing function. I have more faithin competition to ensure that the benefit of technology is introduced as quickly as it should be,and so I do not see a vital need for the Schumpeterian cleansing process. But, in any case,however successful policy may be, enough of a cycle seems likely to remain, in order to ensurethe Schumpeterian process has the opportunity to take place.1So let us take as given that it is desirable to have as little cycle as possible, andexamine two aspects of this. First, the role of monetary policy in the cycle, and secondly, howthe cycle may have changed over time to alter the way monetary policy impinges on the cycle.Characteristics of monetary policyA thumb-nail sketch of history serves as a reminder that the role of monetarypolicy in the cycle has been the subject of changing views over the years.• For the first couple of decades of this century, the gold standard was theundisputed centre-point of monetary policy, anchoring prices. Incomesmoothing was not an objective of monetary policy. The result --unsurprisingly -- was that price level stability was maintained (in the sense                                                  * David Gruen, John Hawkins and Amanda Thornton helped greatly in the preparation of this paper.  Theusual disclaimer applies.1 To explore the issues raised by Real Business Cycle theory, with its implication that cycles are the resultof optimal responses to supply-side shocks, would take us too far afield here.  Let me put my biases on the recordby agreeing with Solow’s comment:  “This explanation has been an empirical failure, or at best a non-success”(Solow 1997, p. 230).
- 2 -BIS Review   80/1997that there was a longer-term anchor which forced the price level backtowards its starting point), but there was considerable variation (both inprices and in output) in the short term.• The Depression forced a re-appraisal, but fiscal policy became theinstrument to smooth the fluctuations in output -- monetary policy was seento be caught in the infamous liquidity trap. This idea has not entirelydisappeared, and the notion of “pushing on a string” still has currency.• Somewhere in the ensuing decade or two, monetary policy emerged as acounter-cyclical co-player, on a par with fiscal policy. There was noparticular, specialised difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy(at least in the eyes of most policy-makers) -- inflation control and cyclicalsmoothing were more or less the same task. Inevitably, in time, the attemptwas made to squeeze more out of the Phillips curve trade-off than wasavailable.• By the 1970s, a clear specialisation had developed (most preciselyenunciated in the academic literature, but reflected also in operationalmonetary policy). The over-use of the Keynesian tools had unanchoredprice expectations, and the OPEC oil price shock contributed to thereassessment. Most central banks in industrial countries adopted a monetarytarget, specifically aimed at achieving price stability.• The high water of this monetarist view occurred around 1980. Over the nextfive years, it rapidly lost its pivotal role, because the key relationship in thisview-of-the-world broke down -- the relationship between money andnominal income turned out to be unstable.2 With the breakdown of theanchor of a stable money demand function, practitioners were forced tolook elsewhere. In our own case, it has taken us, eventually, to an inflationtarget. But others have put forward the view that monetary policy shouldonly care about price stability, without any direct concern with output. Theorigins of this can be found in Friedman’s monetarism (he was, of course,concerned above all with price stability). It seems only a minor elision toslip from monetarism to a single objective for monetary policy. But thepoint to note here is that the old monetary rules had an important element ofincome smoothing built into them -- when output slowed in the course ofthe cycle, money supply rules produced a more-or-less automatic easing ofmonetary policy, because the central relationship was between money andnominal income. As the stability of the monetary demand relationship brokedown, it would have been logical enough to focus on the next link of thecausal chain, and replace money by nominal income as the target.                                                  2 There were lasting legacies of this period.  An important and useful element of the thinking at the timewas the replacement of the earlier “control theory” approach to policy (i.e. the belief that the central point was tofind an appropriate spot on the Phillips curve and to stay there), towards a “game theoretic” view, in which thecritical issues related to behaviour -- the interaction between the monetary authorities and the public.  InAustralia, the Reserve Bank never accepted the degree of policy instrument specialisation found in the academicliterature, particularly as wages policy was also addressing inflation control.  Partly because most inflationproblems were demand-driven over the course of the cycle, there was a continuing belief that if the cycle could besmoothed, inflation would be contained, and both fiscal or monetary policy were available instruments inaddressing the cycle.
- 3 -BIS Review   80/1997Curiously, however, the de facto inheritors of this stream of thought tookprice stability -- the long-term element of monetarism -- and made it ashort-term target. In this view of the world, there was no role at all formonetary policy as a cyclical buffer.How was this justified? The arguments put forward were:• the classical dichotomy between prices and activity: money does not affectactivity;• what might be called the “Tinbergen proposition”: with one instrument,only one goal can be achieved;• political economy reasons -- usually associated with “time inconsistency”arguments;• a simple, unambiguous commitment to price stability anchors priceexpectations most effectively, and this benefit is worth the cost that mightcome from ignoring activity;• the lags in recognition and implementation of policy are so long thatactivity stabilisation is futile or even counter-productive.I have looked at these in some detail in an earlier paper (Grenville 1996), so I willbe brief here. The classical dichotomy between prices and activity reminds central bankers oftheir long-term priorities, but even though the long-run Phillips curve may be vertical, theshort-run curves are certainly not. The Tinbergen proposition is superficially attractive, but notmuch help in practical decision-making. Trade-offs between various objectives are common topolicy-making (and just about every aspect of life), and these trade-offs have to be handled by aweighing of the conflicting objectives, not by ignoring one of them.The “political economy” aspects have been prominent in the academic literature,and some very neat models can be built to illustrate the issues of time inconsistency. The modelsusually involve the “monetary authorities” (no distinction is made between governments andcentral banks) making an ex ante commitment to price stability, but reneging on this to squeezehigher activity in the short term, in the form of an “inflation surprise” (Kydland and Prescott1977). The simple versions of the arguments have never appealed much to central bankers whobelieve that their own reputation is at stake and who, because of this, are unlikely to exploit theshort-term Phillips curve trade-off. To see central bankers as congenitally inclined to administer“inflation surprises” does not seem to capture their true character.3 If there is a problem here, itseems more likely to lie in the political interaction of policy-making between governments andcentral banks and it is best addressed by greater independence, not by imposing a singleobjective on the central bank.What about the role of a simple single price objective in anchoring priceexpectations? A decade or so ago, there was a realistic hope that the clear enunciation of a targetfor prices would stabilise price expectations. It would have to be said that the experience of thelast decade would suggest that expectations are to a very large degree backward-looking. Centralbanks give prominence to their price stability objective in an attempt to influence price                                                  3 Blinder (1997, p. 13) describes this as:  “One place where academic economists have been barking loudlyup the wrong tree”.
- 4 -BIS Review   80/1997expectations in this way, and it seems sensible for them to do so. But it would be a mistake tothink that there is a big dividend waiting to be reaped here.Whether the lags in recognition and implementation are so long as to make theoperation of monetary policy perverse in relation to the business cycle is something that can beestablished only empirically. Like most empirical matters, there is room for considerabledifference of opinion. While the lags seem to be (as Friedman promised) “long and variable”, apolicy which leans against the business cycle with a view to containing demand-driven inflationwill generally affect activity beneficially rather than perversely.4 At the other end of thespectrum is the view that “central bank manipulation of financial variables has seeminglyexaggerated, not smoothed, economic fluctuations” (Makin 1993, p. 12). One problem in thissort of assessment is that we do not know the counter-factual. What we do know, however, isthat cycles are endemic to all economies. So the counter-factual is not straight-line growth. Weknow, too, that Australia’s cycles are broadly the same as those in other similar countries. In aworld where cycles are universal and endemic, it is easy to blame the authorities for the failureof the economy to proceed along a steady path, perfectly aligned with trend growth. As theupswing accelerates, policy is tightened: it is then blamed for being too slow to react. When theinevitable downturn comes, the firm policies that are in place at that time are pronounced “guiltyby association”. The appropriate counter-factual should specify an alternative policy regime, andcompare the performance under this rule.5One relevant issue here is: how strong are the “self-righting” forces which tend totake unemployment back towards its natural rate? If these are strong, the case for an activitycomponent in policy-making is weaker. To put this more specifically, will the in-built stabilisingforces operate more quickly than the lags in monetary policy?The important empirical issue here is the lags in policy, interacting with theuncertainty of forecasts. Most estimates of the lags suggest that a change in interest rates has itsmaximum effect on activity after about four to six quarters. This is often popularly interpreted tomean that nothing happens, after the monetary policy lever is pulled, for four or six quarters. Ofcourse, this is quite wrong. Even with these estimates, there is a fair bit of action during the firstyear, and provided forecasts are sufficiently accurate, it is possible for policy to be effective overshorter lengths of time -- for instance, if it was desired to have an effect for the next year only,policy could be reversed some time during the year to achieve rough neutrality beyond theperiod of a year (Gruen, Romalis and Chandra 1997).6                                                  4 For some econometric support of this view, see Dungey and Pagan (1997, pp. 31-34).5 Makin’s alternative is money-base targeting.  The Bank has written extensively on money rules (thewidest variety of tests appears in de Brouwer, Ng and Subbaraman (1993)).  Makin’s model is Switzerland (theonly major central bank that has tried to implement a money-base rule) in the 1980s, but this hardly seems asupporting example.  Switzerland still has business cycles and experienced inflation of nearly 7 per cent in the late1980s.6 I should record, very much in parentheses, my own biases that these lags are consistently over-estimated,and that when we find more subtle techniques of econometric testing, we will find that the lags are shorter.  Thisis based on pure, intuitive observation, particularly of the 1994 experience, where the effect of monetary policyseemed to be quite quick.  This is a reminder that there are, essentially, two problems with the econometricmethod used to establish lag lengths.  The first is the implicit assumption that the lags are much the same lengthfrom episode to episode (occasionally there are tests for changing lag length, as in Gruen et al. (1997)), whereas itmay be that the lag depends very much on the particular episode.  Where actors in the economy quickly come tobelieve that the authorities are determined to slow a speeding economy, it may well be that the lags are quiteshort.  The contrast here is between 1988 (long lags) and 1994 (short).  The other problem is the classic one ofseparately identifying the policy reaction function and the effect of policy on the economy.  Relatively early in theupswing, policy is tightened, but there is no discernible response because the upswing still has a good deal of
- 5 -BIS Review   80/1997Perhaps a more telling argument is that it is simply not sensible -- or evenpossible -- to ignore the cycle, unless a suitable “neutral” operating rule can be found for settingmonetary policy. The monetary aggregates were, in this sense, a “neutral” rule. They couldprovide an operating rule for monetary policy which could be relied on to influence activitybeneficially in the face of demand shocks: a monetary rule exercises some degree ofcounter-cyclical influence, without any overt discretionary action. But with the breakdown of theclose relationship between money and nominal income, such a monetary rule is not a satisfactory“automatic pilot” for policy, and no similarly neutral rule suggests itself. One possible “neutral”monetary policy would be to leave real interest rates unchanged, but it is hard to see that, inpractice, this would be sustainable in the face of an economy either running abnormally quicklyor slowly -- there would be continuing questions about whether the real interest rate that hadbeen chosen was neutral or was, in fact, skewed in one direction or the other. Also, such a rulewould not tie down the rate of inflation -- for this you need a nominal rather than a realobjective.Another possibility that can be rejected fairly quickly is the rule of thumbapparently sometimes offered in the face of medical uncertainty: “First do no harm”. This maybe sensible if medical malpractice suits threaten, but hardly seems a proper basis for economicpolicy, as it seems to be unduly biased towards inaction.Equally easy to dismiss are those who suggest that we should do something tocontrol inflation, but say that the lags between policy and activity are so long and uncertain thatwe should never try to do anything to influence activity. The problem with this suggestion is thatif the lags between policy and activity are long, uncertain and variable, then the lags betweenpolicy and inflation are longer and more uncertain still. In a world where demand shocks arecommon and policy operates on inflation largely via activity, it is hard to conceive of ananti-inflation policy which was somehow directed solely at inflation, in the belief that an attemptto direct it at activity will cause more problems than it solves.7Given the long lags in policy, there would seem to be a prima facie case for theauthorities moving not just pre-emptively, but by large amounts whenever they believe that thecycle is turning. Such a policy has been advocated by Goodhart (1992).8 Curiously, in the lightof these arguments, policy in Australia and just about everywhere seems to do precisely theopposite -- it has the characteristic of “interest rate smoothing”. Others in the Bank have writtenabout this recently (see Lowe and Ellis (1997)), so I can cover this quite briefly. In short, thereasons seem to be:• uncertainty. Thirty years ago, Brainard established that, if policy-makers areuncertain about the effect of their policies, they should do less than theythink would otherwise be optimal; • if policy-makers erred by applying too much of the instrument against thecycle, they would surely be severely blamed for it; on the other hand,                                                                                                                                                                   momentum.  In this phase, the econometrics are trying to separate two effects with different signs, and to theextent that these two effects are confounded (because, for example, the equation may not embody a perfectexplanation for the non-policy forces operating on activity), this negates or reduces the apparent power ofmonetary policy in this early phase of the cycle.  In this view of the world, the econometrically-estimated laglengths are as much a reflection of the periodicity of the cycle as they are of the lags of monetary policy.7 For those who prefer a more formal explanation of the same point, see de Brouwer and O’Regan (1997).8 “Central bankers need to brave their innate caution and be prepared to vary nominal interest ratessharply, both up and down.” (Goodhart 1992, p. 333).
- 6 -BIS Review   80/1997dampening the cycle without entirely eliminating it is seen as an acceptableoutcome. In this world, policy-makers are more likely to lean on the side ofcaution in exercising their instrument.In short, the arguments about the difficulties of influencing activity should makecentral bankers cautious and modest about their role as cyclical stabilisers, but do not excusethem from taking the cycle into account in setting policy, and doing what they can to lop peaksand fill troughs. With inflation down, a consensus among central banks seems to be emerging.Central banks still give very high priority to inflation control (they are, after all, the embodimentof Rogoff’s anti-inflationary central banker), but they do not, generally, focus exclusively onprice stability. The arguments are essentially empirical ones, with the focus on the question:“how fast can the economy grow while maintaining price stability?” You will note the ReserveBank’s rhetoric is precisely along these lines, with policy driven by common-sense and astrenuous effort to understand the cycle, rather than some doctrinal adherence to a simple rule.Has the cycle changed (and if so, how)?There is much talk, particularly in America, of a New Era in economics -- ofrapid growth, no cycles and price stability. While something important and beneficial does seemto be happening in the United States, we need to separate out what is possible from the wishfulthinking. We all hope that productivity is higher than before: this is possible and might addmodestly to US long-term growth potential, which has in the past been put at around 2-2½ percent. We hope that, with price stability well established and various other changes in theeconomy (on which, more later), the amplitude of cycles might be lessened and policy may bemore effective. We hope, also, that prices are well anchored by America’s good record of lowinflation. But the fundamental law of economics -- scarcity -- has not been repealed. The factorsthat are held to be responsible for the New Era -- “globalisation of production, changes infinance, the nature of employment, government policy, emerging markets, and informationtechnology” (Weber 1997, p. 71) -- will all be helpful, but they raise the long-term sustainablegrowth rate only to the extent to which they raise productivity growth on an on-going basis. Ifthe actual rate of growth exceeds the long-term potential, sooner or later pressure comes onresources and inflation will be the result.The same helpful factors may well apply in Australia:• if some kind of multiplier/accelerator process is the driving force of thecycle, we know that the type of investment has changed substantially overthe years, with large fixed long-term investment becoming less importantand short-term investments (such as computers) becoming more important.The old traditional driving force was the inventory cycle. Work done at theBank (Flood and Lowe 1993) shows a clear change in the cyclical pattern.The average quarterly contribution of inventory investment to GDP(E) hasfallen from close to 1 per cent in 1960/61-1971/72 to around a quarter ofthat in 1984/85-1995/96 (with smaller standard deviations as well). Thisconfirms our intuitive observation of the prevalence of “just in time”inventory systems.9 What is clear, too, is that service industries (with muchmore limited stock-holding) have become very much more important;                                                  9 Of course, the story has to be more complicated than this, because “just in time” simply pushes theproblem back to a different stage of production, and raises the question that if inventories are not acting as abuffer for production, then perhaps the processes of production become more cyclical.
- 7 -BIS Review   80/1997• as cyclical components of production become less dominant, the cycle maybe attenuated. Manufacturing, construction and wholesale trade have beenthe production sectors most correlated with the overall cycle and these,together, have fallen from nearly 40 per cent of production in 1974/75 tojust over 30 per cent in 1995/96. As the economy becomes more complexand varied, correlation between sectors diminishes: the tourism sector maybe doing well when house construction is slow; • perhaps the most important on-going change to the cycle is the continuingintegration of Australia with the international economy. Thirty years ago,10 per cent of (real) GDP was exported; now it is almost 25 per cent. Whendomestic demand rises, there is much greater capacity than before for this to“spill” overseas, into imports.All this is for others to examine in more detail. The focus here is on just oneaspect of the way the cycle might have changed over time -- that is, how the interaction betweenmonetary policy and the cycle may have altered.First, has financial deregulation changed the interaction between monetary policyand the cycle? This was certainly expected to be one of the impacts of financial deregulation.The Campbell Inquiry talked about it.10 In the housing sector, for example, the upswing of thecycle suddenly came up against the restraints of quantitative controls, and this was enough toturn the cycle down. In the old, regulated world, firms and households were not able to borrowenough to smooth their expenditure over time (they were “liquidity constrained” -- seeBlundell-Wignall and Bullock (1992)). It may well be that deregulation has removed these oldconstraints, but at the same time, it seems to have had some tendency to encourage or at leastfacilitate large or longer swings of the cycle. To put it crudely, financial deregulation providedmore rope for the cycle to swing with greater amplitude. It would be easy to exaggerate theimportance of this effect, because there were very large swings in the housing sector beforederegulation, and asset-price booms and busts occurred even in the regulated world. We mighthope, too, that some lessons have been learned from the asset boom of the late 1980s. Theconclusion that can be drawn is that those who expected financial deregulation to smooth thecycle by itself have been disappointed.One specific aspect of deregulation -- the floating of the exchange rate -- hasaltered the transmission of monetary policy in a way which should have smoothed the cycle.One of the characteristics of the floating exchange rate is that its movement more or less mirrorsthe course of the cycle, with an appreciation of the exchange rate at those moments when thecycle is running fastest. Partly this reflects the impact of commodity prices on the exchange rate,but it also reflects the policy response of interest rates over the course of the cycle. The result isthat demand is more readily “spilt” into imports during the expansionary phase of the cycle, soproduction is buffered. (This reinforces the effect of greater international integration, mentioned                                                  10 “The Committee concludes that, in the long run, housing financiers’ inflows would be more stable if theirinterest rates were allowed to move in line with market forces.  Coupled with greater overall monetary stability,interest rate decontrol may help appreciably to stabilise housing finance flows, especially as household sectorinvestors have become more interest-rate sensitive.  The reduced volatility in funds flows should contribute to amore stable housing sector over the long term.  This might result in a slower growth in housing costs.” (AustralianFinancial System Inquiry 1981, p. 639).
- 8 -BIS Review   80/1997above.)11 Even this, however, does not ensure that the new world of the floating exchange ratemakes the cycle smoother: it can be argued that in the old fixed-exchange-rate world, policyreacted earlier to stop the expansionary phase of the cycle, for fear of it spilling over into anunacceptable current account deficit. So, once again, financial deregulation has given the cycle,for better or worse, more room for manoeuvre. The old world of “stop/start” did not have muchto recommend it, but nor did the world of the late 1980s, where an asset boom developed a bighead of steam and inevitably was damaging when it came to an end. The floating exchange rateprobably allows expansions to last longer, but does not ensure that they end gently.Graph 1:Graph 2:This history makes us look for a degree of caution in policy-making, aiming forlonger, gentler phases in the cycle. There is nothing in the historical patterns of the cycle whichsuggests that they have a pendulum-like determinancy. On the contrary, the variation in lengthand amplitude (contrast, for example, 1986 with 1982 or 1990: see also Graph 2) would suggestthat the shape of the cycle is not at all regular and pre-determined. While it may be possible toexplain cycles in terms of “a stochastically disturbed difference equation of very low order”(Lucas 1977), the true causes seem less mechanical than this might imply, particularly if theimplication is that cycles are unaffected by and unresponsive to policy.                                                  11 Graph 1 shows the combined effect.  This effect was noted, in the early 1960s, by Burge Cameron.  Hasgreater integration and a flexible exchange rate made this effect stronger over time?  There was a fair bit ofexchange rate flexibility in the 1970s, so the proper comparison may need to go back earlier.
- 9 -BIS Review   80/1997The hope is that the upswing which has been underway since 1991 can go forquite some time yet. This may well require it to travel at a sedate pace at certain stages duringthe expansion, and we have certainly witnessed this over the past two years or so. But this seemsfar preferable to an economy which is running clearly too fast and has to be brought to a suddenhalt. While it is true that the economy might well have grown a bit faster over the past two yearswithout this igniting inflationary pressures, the one factor that most economists agree on is thatmonetary policy cannot fine-tune the cycle. Let me develop this idea by looking in detail at the1994 experience.The starting point here was an economy which began to grow too fast, withdemand growing at 7 per cent in the year to the September quarter, and excessive wagedemands. The Bank judged that this would produce inflationary pressures, and so raised interestrates three times in relatively quick succession in the second half of 1994. As far as we can tell,this was a necessary adjustment of policy, because the classic symptoms of excess demandemerged over the 1994/95 period with wages accelerating (to reach over 5 per cent by themiddle of 1995, despite high unemployment, at around 9 per cent) and then, lagged behind this,inflation rising to 3.3 per cent. Given the fragile nature of price expectations and the importanceof getting actual inflation back towards 2½ per cent relatively quickly to reinforce the stabilityof price expectations, the response of policy, even with the benefit of hindsight, seems aboutright. (Graph 3)Graph 3:To round off this section, ensuring that you are not left with a false impressionabout the Bank’s (limited) ability to tame the cycle, I present Graph 4. This might suggest thatthe Australian cycle (at least from the early 1980s until the mid 1990s) has followed theAmerican cycle so closely that any other explanation seems superfluous. To put this pointdifferently, the problem in explaining the cycle is not to find the causes of cyclical behaviour,but to decide -- in the face of a wide variety of “culprits” -- which one is, in fact, driving thecycle. In some ways this is like an Agatha Christie detective story, with all the characters equallyand obviously suspect. Unlike an Agatha Christie novel, however, it is possible that they all didit, if not simultaneously and in concert, at least more or less coincidentally. The Bank’s
- 10 -BIS Review   80/1997econometric research certainly gives a very important place to the United States in explainingthe Australian cycle (see Gruen and Shuetrim (1994)) and we have looked at the puzzle of whythe United States seems so much more important than its trade share would imply (see de Roosand Russell (1996), de Brouwer and Romalis (1996) and Debelle and Preston (1995)). But thereis still an important role for monetary policy (Gruen and Shuetrim 1994, and Gruen, Romalisand Chandra 1997). The moral is: don’t expect monetary policy to be able to eliminate the cycle,but don’t ignore its ability to “top and tail” the fluctuations.Graph 4:The cycle and pricesThe Reserve Bank does expect that its activities will have some beneficial effecton the course of the cycle, but the main focus is on inflation. We accept that there will be somemovement of inflation over the course of the cycle, but we want to make sure that inflation doesnot rise over time (now that price stability has been achieved). You can see this sense ofpriorities -- with medium-term price stability being the sine qua non, and our acceptance thatinflation may vary a little over the course of the cycle -- in the specification of the inflationtarget as being an average “over the course of the cycle”. This has caused quite a bit ofmisinterpretation about the specification. In talking to an audience such as this, I can take thetime to set out quite specifically what we have in mind by “over the course of the cycle”.We can go back a bit in history to illustrate the point here. In the 1950s and 1960s(see Graph 5), inflation moved about quite a bit -- from more or less zero to around 5 per centper annum -- but people look back on this period as “price stability”. Why is that so? The criticalissue here is that even though inflation rose and fell over the course of the cycle, priceexpectations did not move -- even when inflation was running at 5 per cent, the community atlarge expected it would soon be back to its normal lower pace. Stabilising and maintaining priceexpectations is the key issue in thinking about the question of “over the course of the cycle”. The 
- 11 -BIS Review   80/1997Graph 5:Bank should not be so trigger happy that it tightens policy at every threat of a price rise (nomatter how slight or temporary).There is a trade-off between output stabilisation and pricestabilisation (see Debelle and Stevens (1995)), and an attempt to smooth the path of pricesperfectly would make policy destabilising. We want to be on -- and stay on -- the short-termPhillips curve associated with 2-3 per cent price expectations. We would not be too fretted ifactual inflation moves about a bit over the short term, provided price expectations do not change(i.e. we stay on this short-run curve). To put this in operational terms, if we have limited pricestability credibility, we have to be more careful that inflation does not depart much from 2½ percent, or depart for too long. As credibility builds over time, monetary policy does not have torespond to every hint of inflation, knowing that the small fluctuations in inflation over thecourse of the cycle will not have any permanent effects. We would then, in effect, be back to theworld of the 1950s and 1960s, at least as far as price expectations are concerned.In raising this issue of price movements over the course of the cycle, I should alsorecord that the relationship between activity and prices probably has changed quite a bit overrecent years. I have written about this in more detail (Grenville 1997 ), so I will not go into it indetail today. But summarising the argument, there are a number of factors which should makeprices less sensitive to the course of the cycle:• the float of the exchange rate;• greater international integration;• greater competition, coming both from international integration and fromdomestic measures to enhance competition;• better linkages between markets, largely via better transport andcommunication.All this fits with the earlier discussion of “New Era economics”. These factorshelp to prevent inflation being triggered by the expansionary phase of the cycle, and limit thepropagation of inflation shocks. While we often think of price stability as being a medium-termand long-term problem, the obvious point is that the medium term is made up of a series of shortterms -- if short-term hikes in inflation can be avoided, then the problem of maintaining price
- 12 -BIS Review   80/1997stability in the medium and long term has been solved. But Chairman Greenspan’s warning, inFebruary 1997, about too-ready acceptance of a “New Era” is still relevant: “But, regrettably,history is strewn with visions of such ‘new eras’ that, in the end, have proven to be a mirage. Inshort, history counsels caution.” (Greenspan 1997). Price stability still requires good monetarypolicy supported by an anti-inflation consensus.ConclusionEconomics has long been known as the dismal science, but in recent yearsmortality has become a pre-occupation. Judging by recent book titles, not only is the businesscycle dead, but so too are inflation, economics, history and capitalism. Following Greenspan’slead, it would be wise to withhold judgment on the death of the cycle for the moment, or at leastborrow Mark Twain’s line and say that the reports are greatly exaggerated. Economies still seemvulnerable to alternating “over optimism … (and) a contrary error of pessimism” as noted byKeynes. Periodic supply-side shocks still seem likely. And policy-makers have not suddenlybecome omniscient masters of the previously-recalcitrant economy. But two factors should help.The first is the greater price resilience, noted in the previous section. Inflation is not dead, butenhanced competition in goods and factor markets inhibits the propagation of price shocksacross the economy. Second, low inflation has now become the international norm. The varianceover the course of the cycle has also fallen. In Australia, inflation has averaged 2½ per centannually for the past six years. The last two sharp downturns (1982 and 1990) followed sharprises in inflation (including asset inflation) in the previous upswing. If excessive optimism in theupswing can be resisted and inflation can be kept in check, there is a good chance that suchsharp downturns can be avoided.Good, forward-looking and far-sighted policy can reduce the amplitude of cyclesand lengthen them. The seven-year upswing which started in 1982 (with a “pause that refreshes”in 1986) should not be regarded as the norm: it can be exceeded. The current upswing has,already, lasted almost as long and seems to have a fair bit of life left in it yet. The price that mayhave to be paid for these long-lasting upswings is to avoid periods of excessive exuberance --this is what brought the 1980s upswing to a halt. This was the motivation for the 1994 policyresponse -- to avoid the stop/go policies of earlier years. We should, instead, be prepared toallow growth to build momentum over time, without becoming too impatient. This will producea world of longer expansions, which will not require the extremes of policy-setting which wereneeded in the late 1980s (or, for that matter, the early 1980s) to bring that expansion (with itsasset-price bubble) back under control.ReferencesAustralian Financial System Inquiry (1981), Australian Financial System: Final Report of theCommittee of Inquiry, September 1981, (J.K.

Mr. de Swaan discusses the background, advantages and implementation ofthe core principles for effective banking supervision   Speech by Mr. de Swaan, an ExecutiveDirector of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision, at the 14th Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean BankingThe banking system is sometimes compared to traffic. This comparison isjustified for at least two reasons: first, the causes of traffic accidents are essentially the samearound the world, just like the causes of banking crises. It is therefore not surprising that almostall countries adopt the same type of rules, like speed limits in the case of traffic, or some kind oflimitation of risk exposures in the case of banking. A second similarity between banking systemsand traffic is that with the increase of cross-border activity, such as air traffic, the need forharmonisation of national regulations has grown. The minimum requirements for bankingsupervision which the Basle Committee has recently developed in conjunction with supervisorsin emerging markets are an important step in this direction. Today, I would like to discuss withyou the background, advantages and implementation of these core principles.Backgroundl.Banking crises in countries are no new phenomena at all. In this part of the worlda number of countries experienced severe banking problems in the early 1980s. In some westerncountries, notably in the Scandinavian, the banking community also faced substantialdifficulties, albeit of a different nature. Since the Mexico crisis of 1995, awareness amongpolicy-makers of the potential damage that can result from banking problems has grownsignificantly. In emerging markets, banking problems often result in much deeper recessionsthan in industrialised countries. Generally, these economies are more vulnerable to bankingproblems because almost all financial intermediation is carried out by banks. Most industrialisedcountries are less dependent on banks, because the function of financial intermediation is alsoperformed by institutional investors and well-developed capital markets. Since the Mexico crisis,it has also been recognised that the frequency of banking problems is significantly higher inemerging markets. Recent research has shown that 85% of the severe banking crises which haveoccurred in the past fifteen years concerned developing and transition economies. Myexplanation for this striking fact is that the factors which cause banking crises are generally moreprevalent, but not essentially different in emerging markets than in industrialised countries. Thisbasic idea is the rationale behind the common set of core principles I would like to discuss withyou today.2.But before that a short word on the way the principles have been developedbecause it shows an important development in the cooperation between the members of theBasle Committee and other countries. The principles were first drafted by a joint working groupconsisting of a number of Basle Committee members and representatives from 15 othercountries. Subsequently a very lively exchange of views took place in a meeting in Basle inMarch of this year in which representatives of approximately 40 countries, including thechairmen of all regional groups, participated. To my satisfaction the consultation periodfollowing that meeting produced a large number of reactions, nearly all of them favourable.These reactions will be incorporated in the core principles. To endorse the final text of theprinciples, a similar meeting to the one in March will take place on September 10th in Basle.Two weeks later, in conjunction with the annual meeting in Hong Kong, the IMF and the BasleCommittee will co-sponsor a conference to introduce the principles to as wide as possible anaudience of Ministries of Finance and central banks.BIS Review   79/1997
- 2 -3.As I said, the main rational behind the core principles has been the increasedawareness among policy-makers that banking crises can aggravate recessions. Another reasonfor the formulation of core principles is the increased globalisation of economic activity. Withthe strong growth of trade and financial flows between national economies, banking problems inone country have much more potential to spread to other parts of the world. A specific form ofglobalisation concerns the increasing international activities of large banks. Policy makersgenerally welcome cross-border banking, because of the beneficial effects on the efficiency,liquidity and depth of financial markets. However, the internationalisation of banking alsoincreases the risk of contagion of banking problems. In order to reduce this risk, the coreprinciples pay special attention to the supervision of cross-border banking. On this subject, themost important message from the core principles is that home country supervisors shouldpractise consolidated supervision over their internationally-active banks. In order to enable homecountry supervisors to fulfil this task most effectively, host country supervisors must shareinformation with them about the local operations of foreign banks. Finally, the core principlesstate that banking supervisors must require the local operations of foreign banks to meet thesame high standards as are required of domestic institutions.Advantages4.You may wonder whether the core principles will really be able to reduce theseverity and frequency of banking problems around the world. Let me try to answer thisquestion by reviewing the main causes of banking crises and the way in which the coreprinciples deal with these causes. One important cause of banking crises is macro-economicinstability. High and variable inflation rates, booms and busts in economic activity and exchangerate volatility complicate credit assessments by banks. Moreover, during the expansion phase ofa business cycle, there is often a tendency towards over-optimism and excessive lending bybanks, which in turn can result in asset price bubbles. This factor can be regarded as the maincause of the current fragility of the Japanese financial sector. Thus, inadequate risk managementby banks is frequently a crucial link between macro-economic instability and banking problems.Macro-economic instability is on average greater in emerging markets, reflecting lessdiversification and greater structural rigidities. Unsound fiscal and monetary policies can addfurther to this problem. As a consequence, the risks faced by banks in emerging markets tend tobe higher.5.The core principles formulate prudential regulations and requirements in order topromote a framework to control the risks inherent in banking. The application of this frameworkcan limit the negative influence of macro-economic volatility on the soundness of the financialsystem. The requirements concerned cover capital adequacy, loan loss reserves, assetconcentrations, liquidity, risk management and internal controls. Of this group of principles, Ithink those regarding risk management and internal controls deserve special attention. Forexample, core principles 12 and 13 state that banking supervisors must be satisfied that bankshave in place risk management systems which accurately identify, measure, monitor and controlmarket risks and all other material risks. Furthermore, banks are required to hold an adequateamount of capital against these risks. These principles reflect the growing recognition that banksbear the principal responsibility for adequate risk management themselves. The main task ofsupervisors is to set minimum standards and to monitor the policies and procedures throughwhich banks control their risks.6.I would like to emphasise that adequate risk management by banks can reduce butnot eliminate the negative effects of macro-economic instability on the soundness of financialsystems. But it is evident that a sound financial sector is an important precondition forBIS Review   79/1997
- 3 -macroeconomic stability. For instance, when macro-economic stabilisation calls for monetarytightening, concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on the loan portfolios of weak banksmay delay policy action. In Mexico, this delay contributed to a sudden reversal of capital flowsand a deep recession in 1995. These so-called feedback effects from financial tomacro-economic instability underscore the need for the application of the core principles.7.The second main cause of financial fragility is premature financial liberalisation.It is widely recognised that financial liberalisation promotes competition among banks, therebyimproving the efficient allocation of financial resources in the long run. However, during thetransition, bank managers and supervisors often lack the expertise to deal with the higher risksassociated with the new activities in which their institutions get involved. This lack ofexperience increases the probability of banking crises. Moreover, increased competition fromforeign banks often encourages domestic banks to finance riskier investments in order to keep uptheir earnings. This chain of events has unfolded not only in emerging economies, but also inwell-developed Nordic countries and the United States. Policy makers have drawn an importantlesson from these banking crises, namely that financial liberalisation should be preceded by astrengthening of risk management systems by banks. The core principles regarding riskmanagement and internal controls which I have just discussed can serve as a guide for thesupervision of the risk management systems adopted by banks.8.The third culprit is government involvement in banking. One way in whichgovernment policy can undermine the soundness of banks is by means of the tax treatment offinancial institutions. For example, tax systems which do not allow the deduction of loan lossprovisions from taxable earnings reduce the incentive of banks to recognise these losses on atimely basis. A perhaps more damaging way of government involvement is the use of statebanks to finance government expenditures at below market rates. This channel has two apparentadvantages to the government; for one thing, it is cheap, at least in the short run. In addition,bank financing does not show up in the official measurements of the budget deficit, whichreduces the possibilities for public scrutiny. Although state-owned banks are most prone to thiskind of political exploitation, privately-owned banks can also function as quasi-fiscal agents, forexample when they are forced to lend to particular sectors or industries. Obviously, thesefinancing practices reduce the viability of banks in the medium and long term.9.I would point out that, while political involvement in banking tends to occur morefrequently in developing countries, it is not restricted to them. In South Korea and France, forexample, recent banking problems seem to be linked at least in part to government involvement.However, in less wealthy countries the pressure on government funds is usually larger, whichincreases the temptation to turn to state banks for funding. The risk of government influence onbanks in emerging markets is also larger, because state banks tend to control a much biggershare of banking assets.10.Core principle l contains a description of the preconditions for effective bankingsupervision. In the context of problems related to government involvement, the followingelements of this first principle seem particularly relevant. First, the explanation of coreprinciple 1 says that each supervisory agency should possess operational independence to pursuea sound banking system free from political pressure. A second important precondition is thateach supervisory agency should have adequate resources to meet the objectives set. Theseresources should be provided on terms that do not undermine the autonomy and independence ofthe supervisory agency. The emphasis of the first core principle on the independence ofsupervisory agencies is important, first of all because independent supervisors are in a betterposition to prevent political exploitation of banks. And secondly because it can limit forbearanceBIS Review   79/1997
- 4 -in dealing with problems in individual banks. A number of banking crises could have beenprevented or alleviated if the supervisory authorities would have had the independence and theinstruments to intervene in a timely and adequate way.In addition, the appendix of the core principles explicitly mentions the need forsupervisors to apply their supervisory methods in the same manner to government-ownedcommercial banks as to other commercial banks. The implementation of this advice should alsoreduce the opportunities for governments to use state banks as a source of cheap funding.ll.A related cause of banking problems is connected lending, which refers to loansextended to banks’ managers, shareholders or to parties connected to them. Just like loans togovernments, loans to connected parties are often granted on a non-arm’s length basis and atbelow market rates. Another similarity with government involvement is that there is reason tobelieve that connected lending is a more serious problem in emerging than in advancedeconomies. The risks of connected lending encompass a lack of objectivity in credit assessmentand undue concentration of credit risk. Core principle 10 explicitly addresses the problem ofconnected lending. This principle states that banking supervisors must have in placerequirements that banks lend to related companies and individuals on an arm’s length basis, thatsuch extensions of credit are effectively monitored, and that other appropriate steps are taken tocontrol or mitigate the risks. Moreover, core principle 9 calls for prudential limits to restrictbank exposures to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. If these principles areimplemented on a global scale, they will raise a significant barrier against connected lending.12.I now turn to a fourth set of causes of banking problems, that can be labelledinadequate corporate governance. This term refers to an absence of the right incentive structurefor bank owners, managers, depositors and supervisors to show prudent behaviour. Perhaps thebest way to throw light on these types of problems is by means of a well-known example,namely the downfall of the US savings and loans institutions. In the early 1980s, the supervisoryauthorities in the US sought ways to enable savings and loans institutions, which were generallyin bad shape, to continue in business. The range of activities in which these institutions werepermitted to engage was expanded, capital standards were relaxed and the level of depositinsurance was increased. As a consequence, many savings and loans institutions tried to growout of their problems by investing in high-risk assets, such as property and so-called ‘junkbonds’. The point is that depositors were content to finance these risky investments, because ofthe generosity of the US deposit insurance at that time. Moreover, with low capital standards,equity holders or owners had little to lose. Finally, banking regulation in the US did not penalisebank managers for excessive risk-taking and allowed supervisors to delay corrective measures.When the property market started to collapse in the mid-eighties, many savings and loansinstitutions became insolvent, which eventually resulted in a loss of at least $150 billion for theUS taxpayers. In order to prevent similar banking problems, bank regulation in advanced andemerging economies must incorporate the right incentives for all participants in the bankingsystem.13.If you look at the core principles you will find various sorts of incentives in thisfield. Firstly, principle 3 requires that the licensing process should consist of, among otherthings, an assessment of the bank’s ownership structure as well as of its directors and seniormanagement. The explanation of this principle makes clear that if the supervisory agency doubtsthe integrity and standing of a bank’s owner or manager, it should have the authority to preventa specific ownership structure or the appointment of a certain bank manager. In this way, pastimprudent behaviour of bank owners and managers is penalised by excluding them fromresponsible functions in the banking sector.BIS Review   79/1997
- 5 -14.Secondly, core principle 6 prescribes that capital requirements for banks shouldbe no less than those established in the so-called Basle Capital Accord. The Basle Accord setsminimum capital requirements of 8% of the risk-adjusted assets of banks. Bank capitalessentially serves three functions; it is a base for further growth, it provides a cushion againstexceptional losses and it promotes better governance. The governance function relates to the factthat if shareholders have more money at stake, they have stronger incentives to ensure that banksare managed in a safe and sound manner. Regarding the loss-absorption function of capital, itmust be stressed that the Basle capital requirements are considered a minimum standard. Inemerging economies, higher minimum capital requirements seem appropriate, because banksthere usually operate in a more volatile and therefore riskier environment. I therefore welcomethe initiatives of the supervisory authorities in Argentina and Colombia, who have already raisedtheir minimum capital requirements to 11.5 and 9% respectively.15.As the example of the US thrift crisis showed, the design of deposit insurancedeserves special attention. The second appendix of the core principles contains a balanced viewon this delicate issue, which can be summarised as follows: On the one hand, deposit insuranceis desirable because it limits the effect that problems at one bank might have on other banks.This obviously increases the stability of the financial system. However, deposit insurance canalso increase the risk of imprudent behaviour by banks, because depositors will be less inclinedto withdraw funds even if the bank pursues high-risk strategies. Therefore, governments shouldincorporate mechanisms in the system of depositor protection that prevent excessive risk-takingby banks. This can for example be achieved by a partial deposit insurance, so that depositors stillhave funds at risk. Another method is withholding deposit insurance from large, institutionalinvestors. The precise form of such a program should be tailored to the specific circumstances ofeach country.16.The last item on my list of crisis factors is a poor market infrastructure. It iswidely accepted that imperfect accounting systems, limited disclosure practices and inadequatelegal frameworks can hinder effective banking supervision and market discipline. Again, thesedeficiencies are more pronounced in developing countries, but deserve continuous efforts forimprovement in developed countries as well. The first problem concerns the accuracy ofaccounting systems. In many countries, the accounting standards for classifying bank loans asnon-performing are not tight enough to prevent banks from making bad loans look good. Ifnon-performing loans are systematically understated and are not properly provided against,figures about profitability and bank capital become meaningless. On the disclosure side, theability to distinguish healthy from unhealthy banks is often hampered by the absence of financialstatements on a consolidated basis. Differences in accounting standards across countries and theabsence of serious penalties for publishing inaccurate information can also obstruct a meaningfulassessment of banks. Finally, the legal system sometimes impedes prudent banking, for examplewhen it hinders banks to seize collateral behind delinquent loans.17.Core principle 21 relates to the information requirements of bank organisations,which is an important part of the market infrastructure. This principle states that bankingsupervisors must be satisfied that each bank maintains adequate records drawn up in accordancewith consistent accounting policies and practices. This information should enable supervisors toobtain a true and fair view of the financial condition and profitability of banks. Banks shouldalso publish financial statements that fairly reflect their condition on a regular basis. Moreover.the explanation of this principle prescribes that if a bank provides false or misleadinginformation, supervisory action or criminal prosecution should be taken against the individualsinvolved and the institution.BIS Review   79/1997
- 6 -18.Having elaborated on the contribution that the core principles can make towardsalleviating the main causes of banking problems, I think it is now time for an overall assessment.First of all, it would be an illusion to think that a global application of the core principles can byitself prevent financial crises occurring in the future. As I already mentioned with regard tocapital standards, the core principles contain minimum requirements. Individual countries,particularly those in emerging areas, should therefore consider to what extent they need tosupplement the core principles with requirements addressing particular risks of their financialsystems. Moreover, banking supervision is a dynamic function that needs to respond to changesin the marketplace. Therefore, the principles will need periodic, but not necessarily frequent,refinement and readjustment. Finally, the core principles provide guidelines for bank regulation.I hope my description of the causes of financial crises has made clear that financial stability notonly requires prudential behaviour by banks, but also macro-economic stability, a transparentgovernment budget and an adequate legal framework. In these areas, which all have to do withgovernment policy, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund can make an importantcontribution to financial stability.Implementation19.In the near future, the implementation of the core principles should be a toppriority. Of course the main burden of this lies with the governments of the individual countries.I don’t underestimate the wide-ranging legal, infrastructural and educational changes theimplementation of the principles call for in a large number of countries. Every country shouldput in place an ambitious program with clear time-frames for the implementation. It is obviousthat the IMF and the World Bank should have a leading role with regard to monitoring theimplementation of the core principles. The main argument for this structure is that theinternational financial institutions already send missions to almost all countries in the world.However, it is generally acknowledged that the Basle Committee possesses great expertise inbank regulation. I therefore plead for a model in which the Basle Committee, the IMF and theWorld Bank each and together assist countries in realising financial stability in their respectivefields of competence. In this model, the IMF and the World Bank are primarily responsible forcreating a sound environment for banking, which is highly dependent on viable governmentpolicies. As part of the assessment of government policies, these institutions will of course alsopay attention to the quality of bank supervision.20.The Basle Committee is primarily responsible for the amendment andinterpretation of the principles and will review compliance with the principles at theInternational Conference of Banking Supervisors in October 1998 and bi-annually thereafter.The Basle Committee can furthermore make a major contribution towards the implementation ofthe principles by offering technical assistance and courses to supervisors in emerging countries.In this respect, banking and traffic again look alike. It is all a matter of knowing yourresponsibility; if you do not make a timely agreement about who drives home, you both end updrinking too much.BIS Review   79/1997
BIS Review   78/1997Bank of Japan presents summaries of articles published in the Augustedition of its Quarterly Bulletin   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 29/8/97.Revision of Japan’s Flow of Funds AccountsIntroductionBank of Japan compiled the first flow of funds accounts in 1958, covering datafor the years from 1954 to 1957. Since then, the flow of funds accounts have been usedextensively, for example, as a source for producing the capital finance account of the nationalaccounts, and as the only statistical material that provides an overall picture of Japan’s financialstructure. However, the present flow of funds accounts require improvement in many respects.For example, although the framework of the flow of funds accounts basically conforms to thatof the System of National Accounts established in 1968 by the United Nations (hereafter, 1968SNA), various inconsistencies remain between the two due to inadequate availability of data.This results in various limitations when one tries to obtain a combined picture of real economicactivity and financial activity using the flow of funds accounts and the national accounts. Itshould also be noted that the 1968 SNA itself does not fully reflect the changes in economic andfinancial structures that have occurred in the years since it was established. In 1993, therefore,the Statistical Commission under the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations(hereafter, ECOSOC Statistical Commission) adopted a draft amendment to the SNA (1993SNA) with a view to creating a framework that better reflects the recent economic and financialenvironment. Further, in response to increasing demand for internationally standardizedfinancial statistics, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), at the behest of the ECOSOCStatistical Commission, is preparing a Manual on Monetary and Financial Statistics (hereafter,the IMF Manual) to supplement the 1993 SNA. A number of countries have initiated reviews oftheir flow of funds accounts in accordance with these developments.Statistics that provide a highly reliable overview of financial activities areindispensable for tracing changes in the financial structure, for examining the roles of eacheconomic sector, and for considering the implications of these factors for the real economy.Such statistics are also useful in considering various issues concerning financial systems. Ifthese statistics are compiled in accordance with international standards, internationalcomparability of these statistics will be improved.It is for these reasons that the Bank is revising Japan’s flow of funds accounts. Indoing so, the Bank has decided to make public its basic thinking underlying the revision,together with the outline of the revision, to thereby seek the users’ opinions, which the Bankbelieves is invaluable for the improvement of the statistics. This paper describes the revision insome detail, including changes in sectoral classification and expansion of transaction categories,and explains the new types of information obtainable from the revised flow of funds accounts.Improvement of statistics often involves a trade-off between users’ convenienceand reporting burden. Improvement of the flow of funds accounts is no exception. Although theintention is to make full use of existing statistics in producing the accounts, the reporting burdenmay be increased in some areas. This paper will also be useful in evaluating the costs andbenefits involved in the revision of the flow of funds accounts.
- 2 -BIS Review   78/1997The Framework for Restructuring the BOJ-NET Funds Transfer SystemIntroductionIn December 1996, the Bank of Japan published a consultation paper thatoutlined its plans to restructure the funds transfer system of the Bank of Japan FinancialNetwork System (BOJ-NET). The Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and makereal-time gross settlement (RTGS) the only settlement mode by the end of the year 2000. Thepaper also drafted the main features of RTGS after the restructuring, and the Bank requestedcomments and suggestions from current account holders with the Bank of Japan (BOJ accountholders), the operators of private clearing systems, and other interested parties. Overall, theBank’s proposal was strongly supported, and the Bank received a number of constructivecomments and suggestions on its proposal.On the basis of its December proposal and the comments and suggestionsreceived, the Bank released on April 1, 1997 a framework for abolishing designated-timesettlement and making RTGS the only settlement mode in the BOJ-NET funds transfer system.
Mr. Stals reports on major economic developments in South Africa over thepast twelve months   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. C. Stals,at the 77th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank on 26/8/97.IntroductionThe turbulences in the South African market for foreign exchange from February1996, and the subsequent destabilisation of the balance of payments, contributed to a weakeningof overall economic growth and to an upturn in inflation. The major task for monetary policyover the past year has accordingly been to restore both external equilibrium and domesticfinancial stability which are important preconditions for sustained investor confidence andeconomic growth.The process of restoring external economic equilibrium had to begin at home.Many adverse factors converged to contribute to the sudden exchange rate shock of February1996. Some were of a non-economic nature while others were rooted in macroeconomicdevelopments over the preceding two years. The problems caused by non-economic factorsdiminished as concern about the finalisation of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,the delay of local authority elections in certain provinces, and the political composition of theGovernment of National Unity were fortunately allayed during the course of the past year.Equally important has been the fact that the Minister of Finance, newly appointed in April 1996,has stood the test of the markets with acclaim and soon established himself as an effective leaderof the country’s overall financial policy.Many of the disturbing economic problems which emerged last year wereaddressed by appropriate policy responses, while the private sector has on the whole endured theinevitable painful adjustments with much understanding. During both 1994 and 1995, growth inreal domestic expenditure by far outpaced growth in real domestic production. This was clearlynot a sustainable situation, and growth in domestic demand had to be curtailed to ensure a betterbalance in the overall economy.The untenable developments in domestic economic activity created a wideningdeficit in the current account of the balance of payments which was being financed by an inflowof volatile short-term foreign capital. When these short-term capital inflows switched intooutflows after February 1996, however, a downward adjustment in the rate of growth in overalldomestic expenditure, and therefore in the growing demand for imports, became imperative.The divergent rates of expansion in domestic production and expenditure,respectively, were also being financed to an increasing extent with domestic bank credit, orsimply the creation of additional money. With insufficient domestic saving and a sudden declinein the inflow of foreign capital after February 1996, the pressure to accelerate the creation ofmore money increased even further.Assessed against this background, an untenable macroeconomic disequilibriumwas rapidly being perceived to be developing at the then level of the exchange rate of the rand.Large foreign capital inflows in 1995, as well as the early weeks of 1996, exerted upwardpressure on the value of the rand. Within a floating exchange rate regime, the rand appreciatedin real terms, despite heavy Reserve Bank intervention to absorb part of the excess supply offoreign exchange. The appreciation of the rand at the time was clearly irreconcilable with SouthAfrica’s otherwise weak position in a very competitive world economic environment. A strongerrand could not be sustained in the long term. Also instructive in this regard is that similarBIS Review   77/1997
- 2 -experiences by other emerging economies over the past year proved that alternative exchangerate systems, based on fixed or managed floating exchange rates, could also not cope with suchdivergent economic trends. In some of those countries, even more painful economic adjustmentswere required to restore financial stability than in the case of South Africa.The monetary policy approach adopted by the Reserve Bank under thecircumstances was to let market forces take their course, with some short-term intervention bythe Bank only to support an orderly process of adjustment. The exchange rate was thereforeallowed to take its market-determined run while liquidity was drained from the domestic moneymarket, interest rates were guided in a gradual upward path, and the resultant adverseconsequences of the adjustment in real economic activity were accepted as essential to avoideven greater disruption later on. Domestic financial stability had to be restored first and mustnow be maintained in order to raise the production capacity of the economy to higher levels on asustainable basis.These developments over the past year again exposed the urgent need forlonger-term structural economic reforms. In June 1996, the Government released aMacroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR). The fullimplementation of this programme over the next few years will undoubtedly raise the potentialof the economy and enable South Africa to meet the vast basic social and economic needs of thepeople of the country more adequately. It will also provide the economy with better armour towithstand with more vigour similar adverse macroeconomic developments that may recur infuture.In retrospect, the economic policies of the past year contributed significantlytowards improving equilibrium when emerging imbalances threatened to frustrate the primaryobjective of achieving sustainable optimum economic growth and development. Recentimprovements in the current account of the balance of payments, the firmer exchange rate of therand, the increased inflow of foreign capital, and the rise in official foreign exchange reserves,provide sufficient evidence to the effect that the serious danger of a collapse in South Africa’sexternal economic relations a year ago has been successfully averted. Moreover, there areencouraging, although as yet still only tentative, signs, emanating from both the production andthe expenditure sides, that the economy recovered slightly during the second quarter of 1997.This preliminary indication is also confirmed by some hopeful signs that theinflationary pressures which arose from the economic imbalances experienced last year are nowsubsiding. At the same time, however, the overall financial situation still provides reason forconcern, particularly in view of the continued high rates of increase in bank credit extension andin broad money supply. For reasons that will be explained in more detail below, the monetaryauthorities must persist with their vigil against the threat of overall financial instability that canonly lead to stagflation in due course. There are many examples in the world today, both amongindustrial and emerging economies, where this lesson is again being learnt the hard way afteryears of reluctance to apply appropriate but unpopular short-term disciplinary monetary policiesin a timely fashion.The Reserve Bank is not prepared to consider any short-term expediencies andimplement monetary policies that will in the long term lead to serious disruption of financialstability. The country just cannot afford unsound monetary policies for short-term gain. Suchpolicies would gradually undermine the value of the rand and lead to an eventual collapse of thefinancial system, with serious adverse implications also for the level of real economic activity.BIS Review   77/1997
- 3 -Recent economic developmentsThe Reserve Bank’s Annual Economic Report released this morning serves as abackground to the following brief summary of major economic developments over the pasttwelve months:A year of economic consolidationThe pattern of developments in real economic activity over the past twelvemonths can best be described as the outcome of a necessary process of consolidation after threeyears of positive growth. The rate of expansion in gross domestic product reached a seasonallyadjusted and annualised rate of 31½ per cent in the second half of 1996, but then slowed downto only 1 per cent in the first half of 1997, indicating a lower rate of growth for the full calendaryear of 1997 compared with that experienced during any one of the past two years.During the first quarter of 1997, total gross domestic product actually declined by1 per cent, setting off alarm bells of a pending recession. During the second quarter, however,there was a distinct recovery when overall economic activity again turned to positive growth,equal to an annualised rate of 21½ per cent. With a continued decline in agricultural productionduring the second quarter and only moderate growth in mining production, total value added bythe primary sectors declined by a further 1 per cent. Against this poor performance, however,production in the rest of the economy was back on track with an expansion equal to 31½ percent on an annualised basis. With growth of 7 per cent in manufacturing, 6 per cent inelectricity, gas and water, and 41½ per cent in transport and communication, together withpositive growth in all the other sub-sectors, the fears of a pending recession must at least for nowhave been allayed.Gross domestic expenditure, on the other hand, remained fairly depressed. Anestimated small decline in total expenditure in the first half of 1997 contributed to theconsolidation process of restoring a better balance between total domestic production andeffective demand. Further declines in the growth rates of private consumption expenditure andgross domestic fixed investment, coupled with a substantial reduction in total inventories, werepartly offset by a continued high level of expansion in general government consumptionexpenditure, particularly at the level of provincial and local government.During the second quarter of 1997 there was, however, a noticeable recovery indemand when total gross domestic expenditure expanded again by 2 per cent, after havingdeclined by 1 per cent in the first quarter. Small increases from the first to the second quarter inthe rates of growth in private consumption expenditure as well as domestic fixed investmentwere strongly supported by a further rise at an annualised rate of more than 51½ per cent ingeneral government consumption expenditure. Excluding the effect of a substantial reduction ininventories, total domestic expenditure actually increased by 21½ per cent in the second quarter.These disparate movements in real economic aggregates between the first andsecond quarters of 1997 underline the importance of correctly interpreting short-term indicatorsof current economic developments. The Reserve Bank will conscientiously analyse all economicinformation that becomes available over the next few months with the necessary sensitivity tothe pressing needs of the country.BIS Review   77/1997
- 4 -Better equilibrium in the balance of paymentsThe salutary effects on the balance of payments of slower growth in totaldomestic expenditure are clearly reflected in the rapid decline in the deficit of the currentaccount. On a seasonally adjusted and annualised basis, this deficit declined from R13 billion inthe second quarter of 1996 to only R3.5 billion in the second quarter of 1997. In unadjustedfigures, the negative balance declined from R5.5 billion in the first half of 1996 to R3.0 billionin the second half of last year, and R2.4 billion in the first half of 1997.Both imports and exports of merchandise responded to the depreciation of therand last year. In the second quarter of 1997, the level of merchandise exports at current priceswas 25 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1996, whereas the value of importsincreased by only 11 per cent. This was, however, not all due to the price effect of thedepreciation of the rand. Growth in the volume of imports also slowed down as a result of thedecline in gross domestic expenditure. In the case of the value of exports, an increase of 25 percent was already experienced in the year prior to the depreciation, partly as a result of theremoval of international sanctions, which no doubt continued to affect exports in 1996 and thefirst half of 1997.The improvement in the current account was supported by a larger net inflow offunds reflected in the capital account of the balance of payments. The pressure on the exchangerate of the rand, which continued from February to October 1996, subsided again after October,almost as suddenly as it had appeared. During the first three quarters of 1996, the net capitalinflow amounted to only R585 million, but this was followed by a net inflow of R3.3 billion inthe fourth quarter, and by no less than  R16.7 billion in the first half of 1997.After the rand had depreciated by as much as 23.5 per cent in nominal termsbetween 14 February 1996 and the end of October 1996, it appreciated by 10 per cent over thenext five months. From the end of March to the end of July 1997, however, the rand depreciatedagain by 3.6 per cent to give a net increase of 6.0 per cent in the external value of the currencyfrom November 1996 to the end of July 1997. It should be noted, however, that the average levelof the exchange rate of the rand over the first seven months of 1997, compared with its averagevalue over the same period in 1996, showed a depreciation in nominal terms of 8.4 per cent.Although the initial appreciation after October 1996 was accepted as a partialcorrection of an over-reaction, the Reserve Bank nevertheless, already in November 1996,started to intervene again in the market as a net buyer of foreign exchange. The country’s grossforeign reserves held by the consolidated banking sector indeed increased by R17.2 billion overthe past three quarters to reach a level of R31.1 billion at the end of June 1997. This wassufficient to cover about 91½ weeks of imports of goods and services.Currency depreciation as a means to achieve greater international competitivenessonly has a chance to succeed in countries where inflation is not sensitive to depreciation. Theevents of the past year proved once again that in South Africa inflation reacts with a time lag ofonly about  six months to major changes in the exchange rate. The quarter-to-quarter increase inthe seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of change in the production price index for importedgoods escalated from 6.0 per cent in the first quarter of 1996 to no less than 18.1 per cent in thefourth quarter, before it declined again to 12.4 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. In the secondquarter of 1997, that is approximately six months after the turnaround in the trend of theexchange rate in November 1996, the production price index for imported goods actuallydeclined by 10.7 per cent.BIS Review   77/1997
- 5 -Monetary aggregates slow to respondOver the past two years, the Reserve Bank has on various occasions advancedreasons why changes in the M3 money supply may have lost some of its usefulness as a reliableanchor for monetary policy. At this juncture, the Bank regards changes in M3 only as one amongseveral important financial indicators. It no longer bases its monetary policy decisionsautomatically on any rigid formula linking actual changes in M3 to the predetermined moneysupply guidelines issued by the Bank at the beginning of each year. In 1996, for example,monetary policy was aimed more directly towards the restoration of external financial stability.More recently, the Bank has become more concerned about the excessive increase in domesticbank credit extension, not only because of its influence on the money supply, but also for otherreasons. There has, for example, been growing anxiety about the over-extension of the privatesector’s indebtedness relative to disposable income, and the increasing vulnerability of thebanking sector to adverse developments in a possibly less favourable future macroeconomicenvironment.No central bank can, of course, disregard developments in the money supply or inbank credit extension, even if such developments can be explained as temporary distortionscaused by major structural economic reforms. Although changes in M3 and its shorter-termcomponents should be interpreted with circumspection in the present South Africanenvironment, they cannot be discarded or ignored. The relationship between the money supplyand nominal production, or the velocity of circulation of M3, may be changing, but newrelationships are being established in the process of transformation. Over the longer term, itremains true that inflation cannot be sustained indefinitely unless it is fuelled by continuousexcessive money creation.Throughout 1996, the annual rate of increase in the M3 money supply fluctuatedwithin a narrow range of between 13.6 and 16.1 per cent. By January 1997 it reached a peak of16.8 per cent, and then declined gradually to 12.7 per cent in June 1997. As a guideline theReserve Bank currently regards a rate of increase of not more than 10 per cent per year in theM3 money supply as consistent with the prime objective of reducing inflation gradually to alevel that will be more in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of SouthAfrica’s major trading partners.The increase in M3 has now consistently exceeded the rate of growth in thenominal value of gross domestic product for more than three years, with the result that the ratioof the total amount of money in circulation to gross domestic product has risen to 58 per cent,which is the highest level since 1980. A lack of availability of money can therefore hardly beadvanced as a reason for the slowdown in real economic activity over the past eighteen months.The relatively high level of the money supply or, inversely, its low level ofvelocity of circulation, holds a potential danger for future inflation. Although a substantial partof the excess amount of money in circulation may at this stage be confined to the financialsector, possibly contributing to financial asset inflation, the Reserve Bank will have little controlover the situation once holders of financial assets decide again to divert their spending to theacquisition of goods and services. Central bank policy must therefore always be forward-lookingand attempt to pre-empt the danger of overspending or rising inflation at some futureinopportune stage.Total bank credit extended to the private sector likewise continued to increase at ahigh rate throughout 1996, and fluctuated between a peak of 18.9 per cent in July and a low ofBIS Review   77/1997
- 6 -16.1 per cent in December. During the first six months of 1997, it peaked at 17.4 per cent inApril, and then declined only marginally to 16.3 per cent over the twelve months up to June. Asin the case of the money supply, the total amount of bank credit outstanding has risen as apercentage of gross domestic product over the past few years. At the end of June 1997, itamounted to 75 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 67 per cent at the end of1993.Bank credit is, of course, not only extended for the purpose of financingpurchases of goods and services. Indeed, particularly in recent months, a substantial amount ofthe additional bank credit created may have been linked to the explosive increases in the volumeof transactions in the financial markets, particularly in the equity and bond markets.Nevertheless, all forms of bank credit create money, and the initial reason for which money iscreated is only of limited significance for monetary policy purposes. Once the money has beencreated, it becomes part of the amorphous pool of the total money supply and, depending on thestrength of the multiplier effect, is available to be used a number of times over, and for manypurposes other than its first application.Many explanations can be offered for the persistently high rates of increase inbank credit extension and in the money supply, despite the slowdown in real economic activityover the past eighteen months. It could partly be linked to a switching of international tradefinancing from foreign to domestic sources, or partly to the financing of summer crops in theagricultural sector that are being harvested late this year. It is also known that bank creditextended to local authorities increased by no less than R2.7 billion from 31 December 1996 to30 June 1997. These explanations, however, do not detract from the need for a curtailment of theexcessive rates of increase in these important monetary aggregates at this juncture.In light of the unfavourable experiences of a number of other countries in recentyears, ranging from a well-developed country such as Japan to an emerging economy such asThailand, central bankers elsewhere are increasingly concentrating on restricting the provision ofbank credit for investment in financial assets and property. In a bull market, even at high interestrates, borrowers will continue to borrow funds to buy assets that are rapidly appreciating invalue; and banks will continue to lend because the value of their collateral is rising. This couldeasily cause a speculative bubble that, should it burst, can create major difficulties for bothlenders and borrowers. In such a situation, it is not unusual for the money supply to continue torise, in conflict with the objectives of the monetary authorities, and often also in contrast to theslowdown in real economic activity. South Africa is hopefully not yet in such a position. In theimplementation of monetary policy more than in anything else, prevention is almost withoutexception less costly in terms of a possible temporary loss of production and employment thatcan in any case not be sustained, than the sacrifices that will eventually be required to fight highinflation once it has become entrenched.In the present situation, the Reserve Bank feels that a cautious monetary policystance remains justified. This has been the approach throughout the past year and undoubtedlyhas had a major influence on developments in the money market. The shortage of funds in thismarket, as reflected by the amount of accommodation required by banking institutions from theReserve Bank, first increased from a daily average of R4.9 billion in January 1996 to R10.6billion in March 1997, before it declined to R7.3 billion in July 1997. As the recovery in thebalance of payments recently gained momentum, the Reserve Bank has been prepared to allow anatural downward adjustment in the money market shortage, paving the way for a gradualdecline in money market interest rates.BIS Review   77/1997
- 7 -The Reserve Bank raised its lending rate to banking institutions, the Bank rate,from 15 per cent at the end of 1995 to 16 per cent in April 1996, and then to 17 per cent inNovember 1996. The rate on three-month bankers’ acceptances first increased sharply from 14.6per cent at the end of December 1995 to 17.0 per cent a year later, but has since declinedgradually to 15.0 per cent in the middle of August 1997.As the South African financial markets are being integrated more in the globalfinancial system, the comparison between South African and international interest rates takes ongreater significance. Too low a level of interest rates locally will eventually be reflected in aweak currency, and lead to a further depreciation of the rand. Too high a level, on the otherhand, will attract speculative short-term capital from abroad, and lead to an undesirableappreciation of the currency, and/or an unhealthy expansion of domestic liquidity.The sharply inverted shape of the yield curve in South Africa makes thecomparison of the level of local interest rates with the international markets more difficult. Atthe long end of the spectrum, the yield on long-term government bonds in South Africa seems tobe on the low side in real terms. Short-term interest rates, and particularly bank lending rates atthe other end of the yield curve, seem to be high in South Africa, reflecting negativeexpectations on inflation, high risks involved in more short-term lending to an alreadyoverborrowed community, and a relatively high demand for funds.The conservative monetary policy measures applied by the Reserve Bank over thepast eighteen months have paid off by containing the increase in inflation to below 10 per cent,despite the pressures arising from the depreciation of the rand last year. Measured over a periodof twelve months, the rate of increase in the overall production price index rose from 5.3 percent in April 1996 to 9.6 per cent in March 1997, but then declined to 7.5 per cent in June 1997.Movements in the consumer price index followed a similar path and the increasein consumer prices, measured over twelve months, rose from 5.5 per cent in April 1996 to 9.9per cent in April 1997, before declining to 8.8 per cent in June 1997. At the time of thedepreciation of the rand in 1996, a much higher rate of inflation was predicted on the basis ofprevious experience.There is, however, no reason for complacency. As long as the South African rateof inflation remains significantly higher than that in the major countries of the world, theintegration of South Africa into the global financial markets will be slow and turbulent. In viewof the complex interaction between the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, and theexchange rate in the process of financial globalisation, disruptive adjustments will be demandedfrom time to time. This will continue to complicate decisions for investors and cross-bordertraders. Participation in the process of financial globalisation ultimately requires a high degree ofconvergence between countries in these basic financial aggregates. The domestic levels forinterest and exchange rates can no longer be determined by governments or central banks inisolation. These financial prices will indeed increasingly be driven by international marketconsensus.At this stage, the international market imperative requires of South Africa to bringits rate of inflation gradually in line with the rest of the world. Alternatively, the country’s drivetowards greater participation as an important borrower of funds in the world financial marketswill be constrained.BIS Review   77/1997
- 8 -Furthermore, what is even more important is that the existing imbalances ofincome and wealth in the domestic economy will further deteriorate in an inflationaryenvironment. It is relatively easy for those more fortunate members of society to protectthemselves against inflation as they have easy access to credit and can spend more in today’sterms, hoping to repay with depreciated money sometime in the future. Less fortunate membersof the society find that wage increases do not keep up with inflation, especially run-away risinginflation, and their savings and buying power deteriorate continuously.Financial market reforms pay dividendsThe major reforms in South Africa’s financial markets over the past few yearspaid good dividends in the form of substantial increases in the volume of business done throughthese various markets. Structural improvements introduced by the Johannesburg StockExchange, the Bond Exchange of South Africa, and the South African Futures Exchange(SAFEX), were also boosted by the further relaxation of exchange controls.The value of bonds traded in the Bond Exchange of South Africa increased by 51per cent in 1996 to exceed the R3,000 billion level. In the first half of 1997, the total turnover inthis market already exceeded R1,700 billion. These higher values included a substantial increasein transactions effected by non-residents in the market.The value of shares traded in the secondary share market increased from R63billion in 1995 to R117 billion in 1996, and to R92 billion for the first half of 1997. As in thecase of the Bond Exchange, non-residents also made an important contribution to the increase inbusiness transacted through the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The turnover in options andfutures contracts traded through SAFEX performed likewise, showing sharp increases over thepast eighteen months.The importance of the formal capital markets for the economic development ofSouth Africa can be clearly illustrated by two basic statistics. Firstly, over the eighteen monthsfrom the beginning of 1996 up to the middle of 1997, the amount of new capital raised throughissues on the Stock Exchange and net issues of fixed interest-bearing securities in the primarybond market amounted to approximately R50 billion. Secondly, over the same period, netpurchases by non-residents of South African securities listed on the exchanges amounted toabout R34 billion.Supportive fiscal policiesThe Minister of Finance applied further disciplines in his Budget proposals for1997/98 with a commitment to reduce both government dissaving and the deficit beforeborrowing during the current fiscal year. In the preceding year net dissaving by government wasequal to 3.1 per cent, and the budget deficit equal to 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. Thedeficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be reduced to 4.0 per cent of gross domesticproduct.The Government also made an important contribution to the official foreignreserves of the country by way of two bond issues in international capital markets during June1997. The total proceeds from these two loans amounted to R3.8 billion.A few smaller and one major privatisation transaction – the sale of an equity stakeof 30 per cent in Telkom – raised more than R6 billion over the past year. Part of these fundsBIS Review   77/1997
- 9 -was used to contain total government debt to a level of about 56 per cent of gross domesticproduct.The better harmonisation of monetary and fiscal policies over the past year madea major contribution to the success achieved with the objective of restoring overall financialstability after the foreign exchange market disruption of February last year.Financial co-operation in Southern AfricaThe Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the twelve members of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) met twice during the past twelve months todiscuss matters of financial co-operation. The Secretariat of the Committee within the ReserveBank has made good progress in the compilation of a computerised data base of financialstatistics of the region and information on the functions and responsibilities of the twelveparticipating central banks.Officials from all the central banks participated in a number of courses presentedby the Reserve Bank’s Training Institute, and a course was again presented for bank regulatorsand supervisors in the East and Southern Africa Banking Supervisors Group (ESAF). A specialstudy is being undertaken with the support of the World Bank on the development of nationalpayment and clearing systems with a view to the eventual establishment of a cross-borderpayment and settlement system for all SADC countries.Over the next year, the co-ordination of financial co-operation in the region willbe extended also to include the activities of commercial (private) banks and stock exchanges.A need for more flexible monetary policy operationsDevelopments over the past year revealed a need for greater flexibility in themarket for short-term funds. The transformation in the South African financial markets since1994, and in particular the further integration into the global financial system, will in futurerequire more prompt action and decisive direction for movements in financial asset prices,interest rates and exchange rates.Part of the explanation for the rigidities in the South African money market lieswith the present system used by the Reserve Bank to provide accommodation to bankinginstitutions at the discount window. Banking institutions have unlimited access at the Bank rateto overnight loans from the discount window, provided they have at their disposal acceptablecollateral. The Bank accepts Treasury bills, Land Bank bills, South African Reserve Bank paperand Government bonds, all with an outstanding maturity of less than 91 days, as security forsuch overnight loans. A second-tier facility is also available, but at a penalty rate of 75percentage points above the Bank rate against similar securities as collateral, but withoutstanding maturities of between 91 days and three years.The Bank rate is, of course, changed from time to time to adapt to changes inunderlying financial market conditions. To make the system work effectively, the market mustreact with sensitivity to changes in underlying demand and supply conditions, and must alsoemit clear and comprehensible signals to the authorities. For example, a rise in market interestrates for interbank funds, various maturities of negotiable certificates of deposit, or for bankers’acceptances to the Bank rate level or above, will provide a clear indication of a need for anincrease in the Bank rate. Alternatively, when a Bank rate increase is regarded as undesirable atBIS Review   77/1997
- 10 -that point in time, the Reserve Bank will have to use other means at its disposal to create moreliquidity (money) in order to reduce the pressure on interest rates.Over the past year, major changes took place in South Africa’s underlying moneymarket conditions, but money market interest rates were slow to react to these changes at a timewhen the Bank was looking for signals from the market, while the market sought guidance fromthe Bank on the direction of interest rates. It is clearly necessary to find a way out of thisuncertain situation and to ensure that greater flexibility will be introduced in the working of themoney market. Inflexible markets, be they for goods, services, labour or financing, invariablylead to incorrect pricing, inefficient allocation of resources and, ultimately, unnecessary andcostly losses in output and employment.In March 1998, the Reserve Bank will start introducing a new upgradedelectronically-driven National Payment System to provide for a daily automated settlement ofoutstanding interbank positions. The system is planned to be extended by September 1998 toeffect intraday settlements on a gross basis for large transactions. The introduction of the newversatile payment and settlement system will also provide a good opportunity for the ReserveBank to reconsider the existing accommodation arrangements between the Bank and privatebanking institutions.At this stage, the Bank would like to give notice of the proposed introduction of anew, more flexible accommodation facility, to be created in the form of regular repurchasetransactions between the Reserve Bank and its banking sector clients. The private banks will beoffered the opportunity to tender on a regular basis for central bank funds through the repurchasefacility, and accordingly be given more scope to manage their own liquidity positions better.Furthermore, the purpose of the minimum cash reserve accounts that banks mustmaintain with the Reserve Bank will be extended to serve also as operational accounts for theregular settlement of clearing account balances. An averaging principle will be introduced, interms of which each bank will have to ensure that the average daily balance in its account over amonthly period will comply with the prescribed minimum cash reserve requirements. Thisshould enable the banks, during the course of the month, to use their minimum reserve balancesfor settlement purposes.The present discount window facility will still be retained to provide banks with afurther source of funds for the management of their liquidity positions. It is envisaged, however,that the Bank rate for such loans will be at a substantial premium to the fluctuating effectiveinterest rate as established in the regular repurchase transactions.The Department of Finance is planning to implement new arrangements for theprimary issue of, and the secondary market-making in, Government bonds through appointedprivate market securities dealers. The transfer of these functions from the Reserve Bank tosecurities dealers will strengthen the Reserve Bank’s ability to pursue open-market operationsmore vigorously for monetary policy purposes.The Bank is now in the process of preparing a discussion document on theproposed new accommodation procedures. This document will be distributed to the bankingcommunity and to other interested parties before the end of October for comments andparticipation in the preparation of the new system.BIS Review   77/1997
- 11 -It must not be expected, however, that the introduction of the new system willlead to a permanently lower level of interest rates. The Reserve Bank may well in future useinterest rates more frequently and extensively to pursue its overriding objective of protecting thevalue of the currency. The Bank will nevertheless have to ensure that interest rates will bemaintained at a level that will be consistent with all the other objectives of monetary policy, andwith developments in other economic aggregates.Internal administration of the BankWith the appointment of Mr. James Cross as Deputy Governor from 1 January1997, all vacancies in the top management of the Bank have now been filled again for the firsttime since July 1995. The total staff complement of the Bank varied around 1,800 during theyear ended 31 March 1997. At the same time, further progress was made with the Bank’stransformation process when more than 70 per cent of the 136 new appointments to the Bankwas drawn from previously under-represented groups.The Bank’s international activities were affected to an important extent by thecurrency turmoils of last year. The International Banking Department, in particular, wasfrustrated by these developments, which temporarily disrupted the longer-term programme ofincreasing the country’s foreign reserves and reducing the role of the Bank in the forwardforeign exchange market. These programmes are, however, now back on course, and the recentsuccessful conclusion of a syndicated loan facility for a total amount of US$ 1.75 billion servedto strengthen the Bank’s foreign liquidity position further.Good progress was made by the Information Technology Department to preparethe way for the introduction of a new real-time gross settlement system within the bankingsector. The substructures for this ambitious new programme are now in place, and, as alreadyindicated, the first phase will go live in March next year. Precautions were also taken to ensurethat all the Bank’s electronic data processing systems will be able to cope with the technical“Year 2000” problem with the change-over to the next millennium.The Economics Department is likewise involved in guiding the Bank into thefast-expanding, worldwide electronic-communication system. South Africa was one of the firstcountries to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in August 1996, and is now one of only eight countries that provideelectronic links (hyperlinks) from the IMF’s SDDS to the more comprehensive sites ofimportant South African economic data and information. In March 1997, the Quarterly Bulletinof the Reserve Bank was released for the first time in its entirety with text, graphs and statisticaltables on the Internet.The Exchange Control Department is continuing with the task of graduallyphasing out all the remaining exchange controls. The concessions made to private individuals toinvest limited amounts abroad as from 1 July 1997, and all the other exchange controlrelaxations over the past year, were implemented smoothly and efficiently. Subject to theapproval of the Minister of Finance, the phasing out of the remaining exchange controls willcontinue in an orderly manner.During the year, the former Management Services and AdministrationDepartments were merged into a new Corporate Services Department as part of an internalrationalisation programme. A new Organisation Development Department was created to giveBIS Review   77/1997
- 12 -more specialised attention to the Bank’s transformation programme, human resourcedevelopment, and the co-ordination of strategic planning and development.With the rapid increase in the number of foreign banks operating in South Africa,and with the establishment in many other countries of branches, subsidiaries and representativeoffices of South African banks, the resources of the Bank Supervision Department came underpressure. The Office of the Registrar nevertheless also gave special attention to specific problemareas such as illegal deposit-taking operations, micro-lending activities, deposit insuranceschemes and regional co-operation in Southern Africa.Other administrative functions of the Bank, such as note and coin distribution,protective services and the branch network are being taxed by the ever-increasing need forgreater vigilance against fraud, burglaries and violent criminal attacks.The Bank relies heavily on its Internal Audit Department for the early detectionof any possible irregular activities, as well as for sound risk management. A major contributionis made in this area by the Audit Subcommittee of the Board, and also by the external auditors.In retrospect, the Bank can be grateful for the quality of its staff, and for theirloyalty to the task of the Bank as demonstrated again by the excellence of services renderedduring the past year.Concluding remarksIn its Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution, theGovernment defined the role of monetary policy as follows:“The main objective of monetary policy will continue to be the maintenance offinancial stability and the reduction of the inflation rate. Positive real interest rates are aminimum condition for overall financial stability. Low inflation is an important requirement forhigher economic growth, the creation of employment opportunities and a more equitabledistribution of income.”Looking back, the past year was particularly challenging for macroeconomicmanagement. The Reserve Bank can be satisfied that it has been relatively successful in makingits specialised contribution to the attainment of the Government’s overall economic objectives asset out in GEAR. After major disturbances in the market for foreign exchange early in 1996,stability has been restored. The rate of inflation, which accelerated to nearly 10 per cent by April1997, is now abating. To achieve these results required a consistent restrictive monetary policywith relatively high interest rates. As the monetary policy objectives are being consolidated andother programmes of GEAR, for example to increase total saving in the economy, are beingimplemented with greater effect, the way will be paved for lower interest rates on a moredurable basis.The contribution that monetary policy can make towards the attainment ofmaximum economic development and the creation of more employment opportunities is, afterall, limited to the intermediate goal of maintaining a stable financial environment. Attempts touse monetary policy for wider purposes or, more directly, to solve problems in the real economicsphere are bound to lead to an inflationary dead end. However sincere intentions might be, theinevitable result will eventually be lower growth and even less employment.BIS Review   77/1997
- 13 -The policy of persisting with essential monetary disciplines in South Africa at thisdifficult stage of general transformation is understandably being opposed in some circles, due toadjustment fatigue and frustrated expectations. It is imperative, however, for the sake ofattaining higher economic growth of a more durable nature, to ensure overall financial stabilitythat will also make access to the world financial markets easier for South African borrowers.This task demands the continuous implementation of monetary policies that will create afinancial environment with low inflation, a sound banking system, and well-functioningfinancial markets.I wish to place on record my appreciation to Minister Trevor Manuel, DeputyMinister Gill Marcus, Ms. Maria Ramos, Director-General of Finance, and also all the officialsin the Department of Finance, for their continued support and close co-operation over the pastyear. I thank my colleagues on the Board of the Bank for their undivided loyalty during difficulttimes. Finally, thanks are also due to the three Deputy Governors and staff of the Bank forkeeping the many activities of the South African Reserve Bank at a level where the Bank hascome to be respected as one of the most efficient institutions of its kind in the world today.BIS Review   77/1997
Mr. Reddy discusses gold banking in India   Address by the Deputy Governorof the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. Y.V. Reddy, at the World Gold Council Conference held inNew Delhi on 02/08/97.I am thankful to the World Gold Council for inviting me to participate in thisConference. It is unusual for the organisers to seek the same speaker and even more unusual forthe speaker to accept such an invitation within a span of nine months. That happens in academiccircles. It is of course, routine in the Toast Masters Club, of which I was a member decades ago.But, this is a gathering of hard-headed finance and business people. I presume that the organisersfelt that I should be called upon to squarely address the issues that I raised in the last meeting, ina somewhat less inconclusive manner this time. Well, it should be possible to address theseissues with a little more confidence now, since the last conference has generated prettywell-informed and wide-ranging debate on most of the issues posed.Today, I will briefly recall the issues that I had posed in November last. We couldtrace policy developments since then.  I would also share with you the response we received onthe subject, not only from intellectual circles and the media but also through letters addressed tothe Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - from people in many walks of life.Against this background, and keeping in view the recent developments in economic reform, it ispossible to examine the rationale for a New Gold Policy (NGP) at this juncture. The possibleobjectives and the immediate tasks of an NGP need our attention. If some changes in policytowards NGP are considered necessary, the role of the RBI, banks, government andindustry/trade would have to be redefined and re-oriented. I will elaborate on the re-orientation.In my normal style, I will conclude with a set of issues. Deliberately, I am avoiding going intodetails of gold banking since these aspects will be elaborated by Mrs. Usha Thorat, who is one ofour resident experts on gold in the RBI.Issues: A RecallThe issues raised in the last meeting related to demand, supply and use of gold.On the demand side, the need for and the effectiveness of restricting demand were the mainconcerns. On the supply side, limits to domestic production and the implications of importthrough various channels were touched upon. The fiscal dimensions, trade policy implications,balance of payments (BOP) impact and the desirability of restricting gold import to corporatesor banks were also flagged.  The role of the RBI in gold policy, sequencing of changes in such apolicy and finally the link with capital account convertibility were flagged for further debate.As you are aware, many of these issues have been debated since then, and there has been policyresponse also.Policy Response: A SummaryWe have made some progress in liberalising gold policy since we met last. Thepolicy on gold import has been further relaxed and non-resident Indians (NRIs) are allowed toimport 10 kgs of gold, against 5 kgs allowed previously.  The EXIM policy for 1997-2002 hasbeen modified and now, in addition to the existing canalising agencies, the RBI will beauthorising banks to act as nominated agencies for importing gold into the country under variousschemes viz., NRI, SIL and export replenishment/loans, etc. The Tarapore Committee on CapitalAccount Convertibility has submitted its report and has made wide-ranging recommendationsrelating to gold, including a more liberal import policy for domestic consumption.  The RBI hasissued guidelines to banks to apply to it for becoming nominated agencies, and the first set ofapplications will be considered shortly.  In the meantime, the customs have also modified theBIS Review   76/1997
- 2 -procedures for the import of gold - no longer requiring banks to be totally accountable for exportobligations of the exporters. The Standing Committee on Gold and Precious Metals in the RBI(Subrahmanyam Committee) has been expanded to include representatives of the Ministries ofFinance and Commerce. The Committee is more active now in rendering advice to the RBI andthe Government.General Response: A ReviewThe general response to the issues raised in the previous seminar can be describedas one dominated by aggressive liberalisers, some advocating caution,  only a few favouring nochange in the existing policy and virtually none seeking total roll-back of the policy. There hasbeen no mention of the mobilisation of idle gold for productive purposes or the establishment ofa Gold Bank to raise resources.(i) Let me summarise the arguments of aggressive liberalisers.- The gold industry, employing goldsmiths numbering about five lakhs, involvingan annual turnover of about Rs.25,000 crore, is kept out of any serious consideration in thecurrent reform process. This reflects continuation of a gold-control mindset and theidentification of all import, sale or use of gold with black money. Consequently, gold industryexporters of jewellery and genuine purchasers of gold jewellery continue to suffer.- On account of the present policy, the purchaser of gold jewellery pays a higherprice of about Rs.3,000 crore every year because of the “hawala” premium, etc. In percentageterms, at wholesale level, it is an extra 17 per cent. Also, because of lack of consumerprotection, and improper certification of quality, the purchaser loses about Rs.4,000 crore eachyear.- The present gold policy shows anti-rural bias. The real purchaser of gold istypically a peasant. Close to seventy per cent of gold jewellery is sold in rural areas and most ofgold sales are by way of jewellery. To quote Professor Jeffrey A. Franks, “holding gold has infact often in history served, from France to India, as the only way the peasant can protecthimself against inflation and the vicissitudes of politics”.- Similarly, there is a gender bias, since most of the jewellery is sought bywomen. While macho consumer durable components are imported and their production or evenconsumption financed, a non-depreciating asset like gold is discriminated against. It makes nosense to constrain the demand for “a multi-purpose indestructible asset” like gold or goldjewellery, which is a lifetime asset, a hedge against inflation, a source of liquidity and apreferred form of saving.- From a fiscal point of view, the NRI route generated about Rs.500 crore towardscustoms in a year. The “officialising” of gold import by liberal import of gold will give Rs.250crore per annum more towards customs, with duties at the same rate as for NRIs. Further, if goldis imported freely under OGL, gold trade down the line becomes traceable and will provide salestax to State Governments and octroi to local bodies.- From a trade policy point of view, the existing restrictions on goldjewellery-producing units like EOUs constrain the participants in the export market and hamperexport growth. Free import under OGL and free export are pre-conditions for capturing worldmarkets - as is evident from the Turkish experience.BIS Review   76/1997
- 3 -- Some advocate free import of gold or import under OGL on the ground thatthere may be a fall in reserves and a desirable impact on the exchange rate. However, most arguethat there will be only “officialising” of gold import and use of foreign exchange under hawala,resulting in no net loss of reserves. In fact, once gold jewellery exports pick up, consequent upongold-import liberalisation, there will be a positive impact on the trade balance.- There is no way of getting rid of or at least drastically reducing the hawalamarket in foreign exchange, so harmful to the social and moral fabric of India, unless goldimport is freed and the scope for gold smuggling reduced.- As pointed out by the Committee on Capital Account Convertibility, apre-condition for further reforms in the external sector is free import of gold.- Finally, while bank credit is available for import, domestic production orprocessing and easy acquisition or consumption of luxury goods, no such bank credit is availablefor gold and gold jewellery employing half a million and providing first-rate security for banks.In fact, the only way of penetrating the informal credit sector without generating non-performingassets is encouraging the flow of bank credit against gold and silver without reference to end-use.(ii)  The cautious liberalisers avoid the subject of liberal bank credit or regulatingthe gold market altogether, but concentrate on possible balance of payments impact. Hence, theyadvocate limited import through designated agencies to meet both exporters and domesticindustry.(iii) The no-changers feel that the existing import regime is foreign exchangeneutral; and existing policy is a reluctant admission of our incapacity to change the mindset ofIndians who are wasting their savings on gold. There is no need to assist or develop this“unproductive” sector or activity.(iv) There is little support for a total roll-back of policy. There was, however, asuggestion in the context of an analysis of the Report on Capital Account Convertibility in theEconomic and Political Weekly (EPW, June 1997). This article reiterated the possible impact ofliberalisation of gold import on domestic savings in an adverse way; on diversion of productiveresources into unproductive channels; on aiding the process of tax-evasion and hoarding ofincomes and assets. Having expressed this, the article states, and I quote, “a more viable policyfrom the point of healthy and egalitarian development was to recommend the banning of goldimports (other than for jewellery exports and for industrial use), and strict enforcement measuresagainst smuggling”.Rationale for New Gold Policy NowResponses to the issues raised by me last year thus show a distinct preference foran NGP. It is possible to highlight the important reasons for a re-look at the existing gold policy.Firstly, it is argued that import or use of gold should be discouraged since itaffects domestic savings adversely and implies diversion of resources for unproductive purposes.In reality, our household savings, unlike government savings, have been increasing sinceindependence, while gold was, in spite of the policy, being imported, traded and used. Thediversion of savings to unproductive purposes did not happen in the household sector. Further,the idea of mobilisation of resources for productive purposes as defined by planners has yieldedBIS Review   76/1997
- 4 -place to a slightly different form of policy management of disposition of resources under thepost-reform era. Now, even depreciating luxury goods are produced and traded in our economy.Why discriminate against gold?Secondly, it is also held that we should not waste scarce foreign exchange onunproductive purposes. With current account convertibility and a market-determined exchangerate, it is not appropriate to place a premium on foreign exchange. Further, the recentliberalisation of imports through the NRI and SIL route has shown that, in reality, there is noadverse impact of a liberalised gold import. In fact, this recent experience should provide reasonenough for a review now, with a view to liberalising further.Thirdly, it is felt that gold is an important instrument for black money deals andhence restrictions on gold amount to restrictions on black money. Since gold is not the onlyinstrument of black money deals, making gold availability difficult will not deter eithergeneration of black money, or its disposition in many ways, including illegal gold. In any case,with the reduction of income tax rates and the launch of the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme in thecurrent year, the fiscal stance is clear - remove incentives for generating black money. Hence,gold policy as an important instrument of anti-black money policy loses its significance, in viewof the recent Budget.Fourthly, international experience, especially with Turkey, where conditions aresimilar, has shown that liberal imports and organised trade in gold benefits the economy,including the external sector. Also, our neighbours in the SAARC region have liberalised andofficialised gold imports at nominal duties. These developments make it imperative that wereview our policies urgently.Finally, gold plays an important role in our external trade (next only to oil) and inthe domestic economy. The reform process would be incomplete without a review and update ofthe gold policy.Objectives and Tasks of a New Gold PolicyWhat should be the possible objectives of an NGP? The review of our policy sofar and the rationale for an NGP that we considered indicate clearly the desirable objectives ofan NGP. The major objectives should perhaps be to:- recognise the importance of gold in the Indian economic system and enable goldto play a transparent and positive role in the industrial development, employmentand export sectors of the economy,- ensure orderly development of a gold-related industry in India in terms ofphysical standards and consumer protection,- create and nurture appropriate official regulatory framework and self-regulatorytrade bodies,- exploit the scope for generating revenues to the central, state and localgovernments,- align the regulatory framework and institutional capabilities in the financialsector - especially banking sector - to enable the above, including gold banking,and- enable fuller integration of gold with other areas of the domestic economy andcloser integration with the world gold economy, consistent with our economicreform policies.BIS Review   76/1997
- 5 -If we accept the above objectives of an NGP, four broad sets of measures mayneed our attention now. These are (i) gold and trade policy (ii) regulation and development ofdomestic trading, including quality markup (iii) bank financing for import, export and domesticactivities and (iv) gold banking.First, on gold and trade policy, the broad thrust has to be liberalisation of importand export, but there are many options in this regard, and these need to be debated. First, placegold under OGL. This would be an ideal situation for free trade and freely tradeable good.However, as an immediate measure, some scepticism could be expressed. Gold has somecharacteristics of currency, a financial asset and has quasi-foreign exchange attributes. However,free import by members of the organised bullion market or designated agencies should serve thepurpose, with some scope for regulation. Import of gold through designated agencies includingbanks would help regulate the gold market, besides assuring the quality of gold and bringingmore transparency in prices. The advantage of restricting import of gold to designated agenciesis that the regulators can fix monetary limits on import during the transition. The domestictransactions of gold imported through the designated agencies could be more easily tracked andwould be channelled for making jewellery for domestic use or export. This would also boostexports substantially. On this logic, it will be necessary to discourage liberalised import throughNRIs. However, it is possible to charge less import duty when designated agencies import, todiscourage the NRI route. In any case, nominal import duty is a pre-condition for liberalisedimports. Incidentally, under the liberalised regime, the sale of gold by designated agencies has tobe freely permitted to domestic jewellery units. Also, the stipulation of payment of duty inforeign exchange may have to be dispensed with in view of the avoidable irritants, theundermining of domestic currency and market-determined exchange rate.Second, impetus to active domestic trading in gold is a logical consequence of anNGP. Currently, the industry is fragmented. It will be essential to tackle major operational issuesrequired to give a fillip to the gold market, such as the development of refining capacity,accredition of refineries and the introduction of the system of hallmarking as a consumerprotection and export promotion measure. Further, serial number, fineness and assay mark of themelter and assayer should be found stamped on bars. We may have to allow foreign companieswith expertise in this area to set up shop in India. The melters and refiners, both from within andoutside India may have to be permitted based on net worth, turnover, etc. Perhaps we have a lotof catching up to do.Third, it may be necessary to recognise financing as an important policycomponent of developing the gold market. As would be explained later, the legal andinstitutional framework is available.Finally, the development of gold banking will be derived from the policy stance.On this subject, I expect the deliberations in this conference to throw up some ideas.The Role of the Reserve Bank of IndiaCentral banks the world over have a special concern and role in gold economy.The RBI is no exception. Broadly speaking, the role of the RBI spans five areas.First, and very obvious, is the management of gold reserves. Since October 1990,the Bank’s gold holdings have been valued on the basis of international market prices. Werecognise the price risk on the gold holdings and have considered the use of gold options andfutures to hedge our risk. However, the RBI Act in its present form does not have enablingBIS Review   76/1997
- 6 -provisions. There is also a view that exemption notification by the Government would berequired under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts (Regulations) Act to enable the RBI to enterinto gold - currency swaps.Second, the RBI had played an active part in the local bullion market. The RBIhad, in the past, close links with Bullion Market Association, and the RBI’s nominee was amember. In the 1970s, gold sale was organised domestically by the RBI, even as it continued itsinterest in the study of gold and precious metals, monitoring prices, trade, etc., and constantlyadvised the Government on policies. The RBI in future under the NGP, could play a role similarto the Bank of England in the bullion market.Third, the licensing of import of gold and silver bullion was for a long time afunction of the RBI and not of the Import Trade Control. It was only through the amendment tothe Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 in 1992 that the import of gold/silver and the exportof gold, jewellery and precious stones ceased to be regulated by the RBI. Now, policy withregard to the import and export of gold is under the purview of EXIM policy. However, as perthe recent EXIM Policy, the RBI can designate an agency to import gold for selling it toexporters only.Fourth, in terms of Section 6 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in addition tothe business of banking, a banking company may engage in the buying, selling and dealing inbullion and specie. In fact, the Act allows banks to trade in bullion. Banks extend credit againstgold. The regulatory role of RBI arises out of its supervisory functions over banks.Fifth, the RBI has and continues to play its rightful role in influencing the goldpolicy in the country. We have in fact established a framework for ongoing review of policy ingold. We established a Standing Committee on Gold and other Precious Metals in 1992 whichhas since been enlarged and activated in 1997. The Committee is also addressing issues relatingto the development of the gold market and gold based instruments, with providing a significantboost to jewellery export being one of its objectives. We expect this committee to take an activeinterest in matters relating to gold banking also.The Role of GovernmentI have alluded, earlier today, to the need for an amendment to the RBI Act andalso to issuance of notification by the Government under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts(Regulation) Act, 1954. These measures are needed to enable the RBI and banks to enter intoderivative contracts in gold. Further, it is not clear whether gold-denominated certificates andother gold-related products would be deemed to be a security in terms of Securities Contracts(Regulation) Act. There are also wide-ranging issues related to taxation. In the EuropeanCommunity, transactions in gold are subject to VAT at rates which vary from country tocountry. In some countries, gold is subject to sales tax as well. In the UK, there is a formalagreement between the Commissioner of Customs and Excise and the London Bullion Market,on matters relating to tax treatment, and no doubt with the support of the Bank of England. TheGovernment’s role is critical in creating an enabling environment, especially through changes inthe legal framework.The Role of Trade and IndustryIn the early part of this century, there existed an active gold market in India - bothBIS Review   76/1997
- 7 -physical and financial - and gold options and futures were actively traded in the Bombay BullionExchange.It is possible to revive this market now. Futures trading is already active in othercommodities like pepper, etc. and perhaps there is no reason for disallowing gold to be tradedagain, though under an appropriate regulatory framework. The focus of the regulation could beto ensure that trading is undertaken within prudential limits and correlated to risk-takingcapacity, to prevent systemic weakness and to induce transparency in trading practices.We could draw lessons from the British experience. The London Bullion MarketAssociation has the formal responsibility for the supervision of its wholesale bullion market. TheBank of England, with assistance from the London Bullion Market Association, has drawn up aCode of Conduct for the market which covers such matters as confidentiality, market ethics,inducement and conflicts of interest. It is the responsibility of the Association to monitor itsmembers’ adherence both in letter and in spirit, and bring any breaches to the central bank’sattention. In addition, the Association has taken over the functions previously performed by theLondon Gold Market and the London Silver Market in connection with the technical aspects ofdeliverable material, the rules governing application for inclusion in the list of acceptableMelters and Assayers and the codification of market practices as far as clearing and settlementare concerned.The Role of BanksCurrently, the role of commercial banks is limited to investment in gold as anSLR asset and to lend against bullion and specie. As mentioned, banks could play a more activerole in financing gold-related activities. As an immediate measure, perhaps banks may be(a) permitted to be designated agencies for import, (b) encouraged to lend against gold or silverjewellery as security up to - say Rs.2 lakh without any stipulation on end-use to help peasantsand penetrate the informal credit sector, (c) advised to devise gold acquisition plans,(d) permitted to lend liberally to gold jewellery business, and (e) allowed to draw uponinternational experience to deal in the gold industry.IssuesAs you would notice, I have not gone into the details of gold banking. Similarly,on gold policy and capital account convertibility, my distinguished predecessor, friend,philosopher and guide Dr. Tarapore, will address you later. Deliberately, I have not gone intothe issue of the current price situation of gold or use of gold as reserves by central banks. I feelthat those issues, though of contemporary interest, are not directly relevant.I am thus, left with issues that flow from my presentation today.First: what should be the possible objectives of an NGP? And when should welaunch an NGP? Second: is mere liberalisation of import of gold enough of a reform? If not,what are the other measures? Third: who should be the promoter/regulator for gold trade?Fourth: what should be the objectives of regulating gold trade?  Fifth: what are the measures thatare possible under the existing legal framework? What changes in legal framework are needed toachieve a globally strategic position for India in world gold economy? Sixth: what should be thetax regime, since in many countries the tax regime for gold is somewhat special. Seventh: howsoon could the physical facilities, like quality assaying, marking, designs etc. of internationalstandards be established? What will be the role of foreign investment and technology in thisBIS Review   76/1997
- 8 -area? Eighth: how should the banks equip themselves to do gold banking - immediately, with thepresent legal and policy frame - and soon, to exploit the opportunities under a possible NGP?Ninth: and this is critical from the RBI’s point of view - what is expected of the RBI in thecontext of developing gold banking now, and under a possible NGP?Let me conclude by thanking the audience for patiently listening to me andassuring the organisers that we in the RBI are eagerly looking forward to the benefit ofdeliberations here.BIS Review   76/1997
Mr. Kelley describes the Federal Reserve System's efforts to address the Year 2000computer systems problem   Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr. before the Subcommittee onFinancial Services and Technology of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the USSenate in Washington DC on 30/7/97.I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee today to discuss the Federal Reserve’sefforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems problem. I will discuss what action is being taken bythe Federal Reserve System to address internal systems, our supervisory efforts, coordination with theindustry, and contingency planning.Year 2000 ReadinessIt is crucial that the Federal Reserve maintain reliable services to the nation’s bankingsystem and financial markets. I want to assure you that the Federal Reserve is giving the Year 2000 itshighest priority, commensurate with our goal of maintaining the stability of the nation’s financialmarkets and payments systems, preserving public confidence, and supporting reliable governmentoperations.The Federal Reserve System has developed and is executing a comprehensive plan toensure its own Year 2000 readiness and the bank supervision function is well along in a cooperative,interagency effort, to promote early remediation and testing by the industry. The supervision function iscompleting an assessment of the industry’s readiness, will examine every bank subject to our jurisdictionby mid-1998, and will review their progress as part of all examinations conducted throughout theremaining months before the millennium.We are taking a comprehensive approach to preparedness which includes assessments ofreadiness, remediation, testing, and updating proven plans and techniques used during other times ofoperational stress in order to be prepared to address potential century data change difficulties. All FederalReserve computer program changes, as well as system and user-acceptance testing, are scheduled to becompleted by year-end 1998. Further, critical financial services systems that interface with customerswill be Year 2000 ready by mid-1998, permitting approximately 18 months for customer testing.Many top personnel in the Federal Reserve System are working hard to manage thisinitiative. Our staff is putting in many extra hours to prepare for testing with customers, planning forbusiness continuity in the event of any unanticipated internal systems problem, and enhancing our abilityto respond to possible operating failures of depository institutions. While there are challenges before us, Ican report that we expect to be fully prepared for the century date change.Federal Reserve ReadinessThe Federal Reserve recognized the potential problem with two-digit date fields morethan five years ago when we began consolidating our mainframe data processing operations. Our newcentralized mission-critical applications, such as Fedwire funds transfer, book-entry securities, andAutomated Clearing House, were designed from inception with Year 2000 compliance in mind. Themainframe consolidation effort also necessitated extensive application standardization, which required usto complete a comprehensive inventory of our mainframe applications, a necessary first step to effectiveremediation. Like our counterparts in the private sector, the Federal Reserve System still faces substantialchallenges in achieving Year 2000 readiness. These challenges include managing a highly complexproject involving multiple interfaces with others, ensuring the readiness of vendor components, ensuringthe readiness of applications, testing, and establishing contingency plans. We are also faced with labormarket pressures that call for creative measures to retain staff who are critical to the success of our Year2000 activities.BIS Review74 /1997
- 2 -According to industry experts, one quarter of an organization’s Year 2000 complianceefforts are devoted to project management. Managing preparations for the century date change isparticularly resource-intensive given the number of automated systems to be addressed, systemsinterrelationships and interdependencies, interfaces with external data sources and customers, and testingrequirements. In addition, Year 2000 preparations must address computerized environmental systemssuch as power, heating and cooling, voice communications, elevators, and vaults. In the case of theFederal Reserve, management of this project is particularly challenging in that it requires coordinationamong Reserve Banks, the Board of Governors, government agencies, numerous vendors and serviceproviders, and approximately 13,000 customers.In late 1995, a Federal Reserve System-wide project was initiated, referred to as theCentury Date Change (CDC) project, to coordinate the efforts of the Reserve Banks, Federal ReserveAutomation Services (FRAS) -- the Reserve Banks’ centralized mainframe data processing and datacommunications services organization -- and the Board of Governors. Our project team is taking athree-part approach to achieve its objectives, focusing on planning, readiness, and communication. Ourplanning began with a careful inventory of all applications and establishment of schedules and supportmechanisms to ensure that readiness objectives are met. The readiness process involves performing riskassessments, modifying automated systems, and testing internally and with depository institutions,service providers, and government agencies. Finally, we are stressing effective, consistent, and timelycommunication, both internal and external, to promote awareness and commitment at all levels of ourown organization and the financial services industry, more generally. Some of our most senior executivesare leading the project and the Board is now receiving formal status reports at least every 60 days. Anysignificant compliance issues will be reported to the Board immediately.A significant challenge in meeting our Year 2000 readiness objectives is our reliance oncommercial hardware and software products and services. Much of our information processing andcommunications infrastructure is comprised of hardware and software products from third-party vendors.Additionally, the Federal Reserve utilizes commercial application software products and services forcertain administrative functions and other operations. As a result, we must coordinate with numerousvendors and manufacturers to ensure that all of our hardware, software, and services are Year 2000 ready.In many cases, compliance will require upgrading, or even replacing, equipment and software. We havecompleted an initial inventory of vendor components used in our mainframe and distributed computingenvironments, and vendor coordination and system change are progressing well.As we continue to assess our systems for Year 2000 readiness, we are preparing a centralenvironment for testing our payment system applications. We are establishing isolated mainframe dataprocessing environments to be used for internal testing of all system components as well as for testingwith depository institutions and other government agencies. These environments will enable testing forhigh-risk dates such as year-end 1999, beginning of year 2000, and February 29, 2000 (leap year).Testing will be conducted through a combination of future-dating our computer systems to verify thereadiness of our infrastructure, and testing critical future dates within interfaces to other institutions. Ourtest environments will be available to our customers for testing on a twenty-four hour basis, six days aweek. Network communications components will also be tested and certified in a special test labenvironment at FRAS.The testing effort for Year 2000 readiness within the Federal Reserve will be extensiveand complex. Industry experts estimate that testing for readiness will consume about half of total Year2000 project resources. To leverage existing resources and processes, we are modelling our Year 2000testing, both internally and with depository institutions, on proven testing methods and processes. Ourcustomers are already familiar with these processes and testing environment. We will finalize anddistribute our testing strategy to depository institutions by the end of September this year and begincoordinating test schedules January 1998. As I noted earlier, the Reserve Banks are targeting June 1998to commence testing with their customers, which allows an 18-month time period for depositoryinstitutions to test their systems with the Federal Reserve.
- 3 -The next challenge I would like to discuss regards retaining staff critical to the success ofthe project. As I mentioned earlier, we have placed a high priority on our CDC project, and as such haveallocated many of the best managers and technical staff in the Federal Reserve System to work on theproject. The information technology industry is already experiencing market pressures due to theincreased demand for technical talent. As the millennium draws closer, the global market requirementsfor qualified personnel will intensify even further. We are responding as necessary to thesemarket-induced pressures by offering incentives to retain staff members in critical, high-demandpositions.Our focus at the Board goes beyond the immediate need to prepare our systems andensure reliable operation of the payments infrastructure. We are also working hard to address thesupervisory issues raised by Year 2000 and are developing contingency plans which I will discuss later.Supervision ProgramBanks rely heavily on their automated information processing and telecommunicationssystems to participate in the global payments system, to exchange information with counterparties andregulatory agencies, and to manage their internal control systems and sophisticated computer equipment.As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has worked actively with the other banking agencies to advisethe industry of our concerns, and to develop a thorough understanding of the industry’s readiness. In thisregard, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring Year 2000 preparations and compliance of theinstitutions we supervise so that we can act aggressively to identify and resolve problems that arise.Early this year, the Federal Reserve and the other regulatory agencies developed auniform Year 2000 assessment questionnaire to collect and aggregate information on a national basis. Wehave received over 1000 responses from financial organizations and service providers supervised by theFederal Reserve. Based on these responses and other information, we believe the banking industry’sawareness level has improved substantially during 1997 and is reflected in the intensified projectmanagement, planning, budgeting, and renovation efforts that have been initiated.Generally speaking, the nation’s largest banking organizations have done much toaddress the issues and have devoted significant financial and human resources to preparing for thecentury date change. Many larger banks are already renovating their operating systems and havecommenced testing of their critical applications. Large organizations appear capable of renovating theircritical operating systems by year-end 1998, and will have their testing well underway by then. Some ofthese organizations have recently come to realize that their initial resource and cost estimates to addressthis project need to be raised, given the magnitude of the tasks to be performed and the growing scarcityof available programming staff with the skills necessary to renovate older systems.Smaller banks, including the US offices of foreign banks and those dependent on a thirdparty to provide their computer services, are generally aware of the issues and are working on theproblem; however, their progress is less visible and will be carefully monitored as part of our supervisionprogram. Many of these organizations appear to have underestimated the efforts necessary to ensure thattheir systems will be compliant. Accordingly, we will direct significant attention to ensure that thesebanks intensify their efforts to prepare for the Year 2000. We intend to update our assessmentperiodically in order to maintain a current awareness of the industry’s readiness.Our focus on the industry’s readiness began last year, when the Federal Reservecommenced examining banks’ plans and initiatives for the century date change. Through mid-year 1998we will continue this program and conduct a thorough Year 2000 preparedness examination of everybank, US branch and agency of a foreign bank, data processing center, and service provider that wesupervise. Our examination program includes an extensive review of each institution’s Year 2000 projectmanagement plans in order to evaluate their sufficiency, to ensure the direct involvement of seniormanagement and the board of directors, and to monitor their progress against the plan. Our examiners areactively engaged in ensuring that the board of directors and senior management are addressing the issues
- 4 -and assembling the necessary resources. Based on the examination results and the findings collectedduring the current assessment program, we are identifying those institutions that require intensifiedsupervisory attention and establish our priorities for subsequent examinations.Public AwarenessWe are mindful that extensive communication with the industry and the public is crucialto the success of our efforts. Our public awareness program includes communications related to ourtesting efforts and our overall concerns about the industry’s readiness. We continue to advise ourcustomers of the Federal Reserve’s plans and time frames for making our software Year 2000 ready. Wehave inaugurated a Year 2000 newsletter and have just published our first bulletin addressing specifictechnical issues. We have also established an Internet Web site to provide depository institutions withinformation regarding the Federal Reserve System’s CDC project. This site can be accessed at thefollowing Internet address: http://www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc.To heighten the industry’s awareness level, the Federal Financial InstitutionsExamination Council (FFIEC), issued a policy statement on May 5th entitled “Year 2000 ProjectManagement Awareness,” which updates the supervisory guidance first issued in 1996. The statementemphasizes the regulators’ concerns that inability to provide a compliant hardware and softwareenvironment to support the upcoming century date change would expose a bank to inordinate operational,financial, and legal risks. A set of uniform examination procedures accompanying the statement providesguidance for examiners as well as bank management, stressing the need for sponsorship at the highestlevels of the organization to effectively manage the remediation process and address any deficiencies thatmay surface.Bank management must not only be aware of the many Year 2000 problems, but mustalso be sensitive to the magnitude of the efforts needed to achieve compliance and the consequentbudgetary implications. Industry experts maintain that costs to perform Year 2000 renovation tasks willincrease as the demand for skilled information technology professionals grows. Accordingly, theinteragency policy statement emphasizes the need for bank management to be aggressive in securingsufficient human and computer resources. The statement also encourages banks to be largely completedwith their renovation and well into testing of their major applications by year-end 1998 so that anysubstantive problems can be addressed in 1999.The statement also calls upon banks to consider the Year 2000 risks posed by theirborrowers and customers, as banks could be adversely affected by borrowers who are not prepared forYear 2000 processing. Corporate customers who have not considered Year 2000 issues may experience adisruption in business, resulting in financial difficulties that could negatively influence theircreditworthiness. Examiners now verify that a bank incorporates a borrower’s Year 2000 preparednessinto its underwriting standards, and that loan officers assess the extent of Year 2000 computer problemsthat may influence a borrower’s ability to repay its loans on a timely basis.On behalf of the FFIEC, the Federal Reserve has developed a Year 2000 informationdistribution system, including an Internet web site and a toll free Fax Back service (888-882- 0982). Theweb site provides easy access to policy statements, guidance to examiners, and paths to other Year 2000web sites available from numerous other sources. The site has been used heavily since its introduction inearly May of this year. The FFIEC Year 2000 web site can be accessed at the following Internet address:http://www.ffiec.gov/y2k.The Federal Reserve has also produced a ten-minute video entitled “Year 2000 ExecutiveAwareness” intended for viewing by a bank’s board of directors and senior management. The videopresents a summary of the Year 2000 five-phase project management plan outlined in the interagencypolicy statement. In my introductory remarks on the video, I note that senior bank officials should bedirectly involved in managing the Year 2000 project to ensure that it is given the appropriate level of
- 5 -attention and sufficient resources to address the issue on a timely basis. The video has already beendistributed to banks and their service providers, and can be ordered through the Board’s Web site.We are also taking steps to provide this information to foreign bank supervisors. Withregard to the international aspects of the Year 2000 issue, US offices of foreign banks pose a unique setof challenges. Based on our assessments, we are concerned that some offices may not have an adequateappreciation of the magnitude and ramifications of the problem, and may not have committed theresources necessary to address the issues effectively. This is a particular concern for foreign bank officesthat are dependent on their foreign parent bank for information processing systems.Therefore, we are working through the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS)committee of bank supervisors composed of many of the international agencies responsible for theforeign banks that operate in the US Through several presentations and the distribution of the interagencystatement and the Year 2000 video to the BIS Supervisors Committee, we have sought to elevate foreignbank supervisors’ awareness of the risks posed by the century date change and to solicit their assistancein monitoring the state of overall preparedness of foreign bank parents to ensure that they consider theneeds of their US offices.We are also participating in the BIS Group of Computer Experts’ meeting of G-10 andnon-G-10 central banks in September which provides a forum to share views on and approaches todealing with Year 2000 issues and have been active in various private sector forums. The participantswill discuss their involvement with raising bank industry awareness, remediation of payment systems,and the readiness of the central banks’ internal systems. Information garnered from this meeting willassist the BIS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, as well as the Federal Reserve, inunderstanding the current state of preparedness of payment systems on a global level.Contingency PlanningBecause smooth and uninterrupted financial flows are obviously of utmost importance,our main focus is our preparedness and the avoidance of problems. But we know from experience thatupon occasion, things can go wrong. Given our unique role as the nation’s central bank, the FederalReserve has always stressed contingency planning -- for both systemic risks as well as operationalfailures.In this regard, we regularly conduct exhaustive business resumption tests of our majorpayment systems that include depository institutions. Moreover, as a result of our experience inresponding to problems arising from such diverse events as earthquakes, fires, storms, and poweroutages, as well as liquidity problems in institutions, we expect to be well positioned to deal withproblems in the financial sector that might arise as a result of CDC. We are, of course, developingspecific CDC contingency plans to address various operational scenarios. Our existing businessresumption plans will be updated to address date-related difficulties that may face the financial industry.We already have arrangements in place to assist financial institutions in the event theyare unable to access their own systems. For example, we are able to provide financial institutions withaccess to Federal Reserve computer terminals on a limited bases for the processing of critical fundstransfers. This contingency arrangement has proven highly effective when used from time to time bydepository institutions experiencing major hardware/software outages or that have had their operationsdisrupted due to natural disasters such as the Los Angeles earthquake, hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas,and hurricane Andrew in south Florida. In these cases we worked closely with financial institutions toensure that adequate supplies of cash were available to the community and also arranged for ouroperations to function virtually without interruptions for 24 hours a day during the crisis period. We feelthe experience gained from such crises will prove very helpful in the event of similar problems triggeredby century date change. We are also beginning to formulate responses for augmenting certain functions,such as computer help desk services and off-line funds transfers, to respond to short-term needs for theseservices.
- 6 -Although operational contingency is something that the Federal Reserve is confrontedwith on a daily basis, preparation for contingencies in the century date change environment does offersome new and significant challenges. For example, in the software application arena, the normalcontingency of falling back to a prior release of the software is not a viable option. This underscores theimportance of the rigorous assessment and testing to which all applications must be subjected.Beyond reliance on a sound plan and effective execution of the plan, the Federal Reserveis not totally dependent upon any single system for executing payment orders. While we have verysophisticated automated systems in place, such as Fedwire and our Automated Clearing House systems,we also operate paper-based payment systems that offer a set of alternatives in the event of a disruptionin a segment of the electronic payment system.Clearly, the Federal Reserve and other bank supervisors expect depository institutions towork diligently and effectively to ensure that automation issues associated with the Year 2000 areresolved fully and in a timely fashion. However, we anticipate that at least a few financial institutionswill experience difficulty in completing their Year 2000 preparations in a timely manner, and we aredeveloping plans to address such cases. The Federal Reserve will identify and monitor theseorganizations closely and work to ensure that senior management and boards of directors are aware oftheir Year 2000 issues, cost implications, and possible consequences. A bank’s need for adequatepreparation for the Year 2000 is regarded as a safety and soundness issue. Where progress is deemed tobe substantively less than satisfactory, resulting in excessive risk and a possibly unsafe or unsoundcondition, we will address the issue in a manner consistent with our long-standing supervisory approachto dealing with other safety and soundness issues. The full range of our supervisory tools and remediesare available, including intensified monitoring, progressively more detailed reporting requirements,presentations to the board of directors, insistence on bank commitments to initiate corrective action, and,ultimately, possible use of enforcement actions as appropriate.We recognize, nonetheless, that despite their best efforts, some depository institutionsmay experience operating difficulties, either as a result of their own computer problems or those of theircustomers, counterparties, or others. These problems could be manifested in a number of ways and wouldnot necessarily involve funding shortfalls. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve is always prepared toprovide information to depository institutions on the balances in their accounts with us throughout theday, so that they can identify shortfalls and seek funding in the market. The Federal Reserve will beprepared to lend in appropriate circumstances and with adequate collateral to depository institutions whenmarket sources of funding are not reasonably available. The terms and conditions of such lending maydepend upon the circumstances giving rise to the liquidity shortfall.Discussions are also underway with the other federal banking agencies to ensure that weare jointly prepared to address the challenge resulting from serious operating problems. If such operatingproblems were not correctable within a reasonable time frame, it could necessitate a federal resolutioncomparable to that used for a bank that has become capital insolvent.Our preparations for possible liquidity difficulties also extend to the foreign bankbranches and agencies in the US that may be adversely affected directly by their own computer systemsor through difficulties caused by the linkage and dependence on their parent bank. Such circumstanceswould necessitate coordination with the home country supervisor. Moreover, consistent with currentpolicy, foreign central banks will be expected to provide liquidity support to any foreign bankingorganizations that experience a funding shortfall.Closing RemarksAs I indicated at the outset, the Federal Reserve views its Year 2000 preparations withgreat seriousness. As such, we have placed a high priority on the remediation of date problems in oursystems and the development of action plans that will ensure business continuity for the critical financial
- 7 -systems we operate. While we have made significant progress in validating our internal systems andplanning for testing with depository institutions and others using Federal Reserve services, we must workto ensure that our efforts remain on schedule and that problems are addressed in a timely fashion. Inparticular, we will be paying special attention to the testing needs of depository institutions and thefinancial industry and are prepared to adjust our support for them as required by experience. We believethat we are well-positioned to meet our objectives and will remain vigilant throughout the process.As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve will continue to address the industry’spreparedness, monitor progress, and target for special supervisory attention those organizations that aremost in need of assistance. Lastly, we will continue to participate in international forums with theexpectation that these efforts will help foster an international awareness of Year 2000 issues and providefor the sharing of experiences, ideas, and best practices.
Ms. Rivlin discusses the Federal Reserve’s planning process and the effortsbeing made to improve performance   Testimony of the Vice Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, Ms. Alice M. Rivlin, before the Committee onBanking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 29/7/97.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today todiscuss the Federal Reserve’s planning process and the efforts we are making to measure andimprove our performance in the spirit of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).I am personally a long-term proponent of GPRA and worked hard on its implementation when Iwas at the Office of Management and Budget. While the Federal Reserve does not receiveappropriated funds and is not, strictly speaking, covered by the Act, we are eager to participatein the processes and activities set forth in the Act. GPRA fits well with the new efforts theFederal Reserve has undertaken to plan further ahead, use our resources more effectively and tocoordinate activities across the whole system more explicitly. The testimony is a brief progressreport on those efforts.Planning at the FedIn its briefest form, the Federal Reserve’s mission is to “foster the stability,integrity and efficiency of the nation’s financial and payment systems so as to promote optimalmacroeconomic performance.” This mission derives directly from the Federal Reserve Act of1913, which established the Federal Reserve as the nation’s central bank, and has three mainelements:To formulate and conduct monetary policy toward the achievement of maximumsustainable long-term growth; price stability fosters that goal.To promote a safe, sound, competitive, and accessible banking system and stablefinancial markets through supervision and regulation of the nation’s banking andfinancial systems; through its function as the lender of last resort; and througheffective implementation of statutes designed to inform and protect the consumer.To foster the integrity, efficiency, and accessibility of US dollar payments andsettlement systems, issue a uniform currency, and act as the fiscal agent anddepository of the US government.The activities involved in carrying out this broad mission are extremely diverse,ranging from setting short-term interest rates to processing checks and cash, to examiningdepository institutions. Allocation of the resources the Federal Reserve uses to do its jobdepends heavily on the state of the economy (both national and international), how well or badlythe financial services system is functioning, and what additional tasks (such as implementationof the Community Reinvestment Act and expansion of our oversight of foreign banks operatingin the US pursuant to the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991) the Congressassigns to us.To carry out this multi-faceted mission, the Congress established a highlydecentralized Federal Reserve System with a complex governance structure. Leadership anddirection are vested in the Board of Governors, but only about 1,700 staff (out of about 24,900)work for the Board in Washington. The regional Reserve Banks carry out the bulk of operationsand have substantial autonomy. As a result, planning and resource allocation at the FederalBIS Review   72/1997
- 2 -Reserve have historically been quite decentralized, and major changes have required painstakingconsensus building across the Board/Bank structure.The regional structure of the Federal Reserve is one of its great strengths. Thetwelve regional Federal Banks work closely with the banks in their region and are closely tiedinto their regional economies. The development of Federal Reserve policy is greatly enriched bythe in-depth knowledge that the regional banks have of the industrial, agricultural and financialforces shaping different parts of the economy. The challenge confronting strategic planning atthe Federal Reserve is to find a balance between decentralized regional planning, whichpreserves the strengths of the regional structure, and the need for a more comprehensive nationalplan aimed at increasing efficiency by rationalizing the allocation of resources across regionsand functions.In recent years, major changes have occurred in the allocation of Federal Reserveresources in response to unfolding events. When serious problems developed in the bankingindustry in the 1980s and in response to increased supervisory responsibility for foreign bankingentities, more Federal Reserve resources were channeled into supervision and regulation.Rapidly changing technology, especially telecommunications and automation, has revolutionizedFederal Reserve operations and required considerable investment in hardware, software andexpertise. Consolidation of the banking industry, evolution of payment systems patterns andtechnology, growth in derivatives, globalization of financial services, concerns about equalcredit opportunity and fair housing issues, efforts to reduce systemic risk in the payments area,and changes in monetary aggregates, have all caused planning and resource adjustments.Rapid technological change has also created opportunities for system-wideefficiencies resulting from consolidation of activities in one or more Reserve Banks. A numberof the twelve regional banks have developed specialized activities serving other regions. Forexample, Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS) is headquartered in Richmond, butprovides mainframe data processing and data communications services to all parts of the system.This consolidation and specialization has enabled the Reserve Banks to centralize operations ofmany of their mission critical applications, such as Fedwire, Automated Clearing House (ACH),and accounting. Continued technological advance, as well as further consolidation in thefinancial services industry, is likely to lead to further specialization among regional FederalReserve Banks.New Strategic Planning ActivitiesIn the face of accelerating change, the Federal Reserve recently recognized theneed for a more comprehensive planning framework. In 1995, a System Strategic PlanningCoordinating Group was appointed, consisting of Board members, Reserve Bank Presidents andsenior managers, representing the full range of the Federal Reserve’s activities. This groupproduced an “umbrella” framework, designed to enable the Board, the Reserve Banks andproduct and support offices to produce their own more detailed plans and decision documentsunder the “umbrella.”This framework, which is the basis for the document submitted to the House andSenate Banking Committees, sets forth the mission of the Federal Reserve referred to above. Italso discusses the “values” of the Federal Reserve, the goals and objectives of the Fed, keyassumptions, as well as the external and internal factors that could affect the achievement ofthose goals and objectives. With the overall framework as a reference point, strategic planningBIS Review  72/1997
- 3 -activities are proceeding with new energy at the Reserve Banks, at the Board, and with respect tocross-cutting major functions such as the payments system and bank supervision and regulation.Individual Reserve Banks have reviewed their operations from the ground up andreassessed their structure and effectiveness in carrying out their missions. Some of the Bankshave launched fundamental re-engineering efforts that are resulting in substantial changes inmanagement structure and operations. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago calls its effort“Fresh Look”; the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is engaged in “Transformation: 2000.”Board planning and budgetingAt the Board, we have restructured the annual planning and budget process to putmore emphasis on planning (and less on detailed line-item budgeting), to lengthen the planningand budgeting horizon, and to involve the Board itself more heavily in setting priorities. To thisend, we have established a Budget Committee of the Board (consisting of myself and GovernorsPhillips and Kelley) assisted by a staff planning group drawn from across the major functions ofthe Board. We are working with a four-year planning horizon and intend to produce the Board’sfirst biennial budget (1998/1999) to go into effect on January 1, 1998. Our hope is that the newprocess and structure will give the Board a better understanding of the options it faces withrespect to alternative ways of carrying out the Federal Reserve’s mission, and a clearer basis fordeciding on priorities.Payments System studyA major study of the Federal Reserve’s role in the Payments System, currentlyunderway, is another example of strategic planning with respect to a major portion of theFederal Reserve’s activities, under the general umbrella of the strategic planning framework.Since payments technology and the structure of the financial services industry arechanging rapidly, it seemed important to focus both on how the payment system was evolving(and should evolve) and what role the Federal Reserve should play in that evolution. The UnitedStates is amazingly dependent on paper checks -- Americans wrote 64 billion checks in 1996 --while most of the industrial world is shifting rapidly to more efficient electronic basedpayments.The study, directed by a committee of two Governors and two Federal ReserveBank Presidents, has drawn on analytic resources across the Federal Reserve System andoutside. We began by examining the consequences of substantially altering the role of theFederal Reserve in the retail payments system (checks and wire transfer system know as ACH).We analyzed the impact of scenarios ranging from withdrawal of the Federal Reserve from thecheck and ACH markets to more aggressive leadership by the Federal Reserve in making thepayment system more efficient and less dependent on paper.To get maximum input from the participants in the payment system -- banks,clearinghouses, vendors, consumers and others -- in helping us assess alternatives for the future,we held a series of “forums” around the country in May and June. We had enthusiastic andextremely helpful participation from a wide range of institutions. We learned a lot from theprocess and are now reassessing the alternatives, conducting additional analyses and preparing topresent preliminary options to the Board. I look forward to sharing the study with thisCommittee.BIS Review   72/1997
- 4 -The payments area is a good example of the dilemma posed for planners by rapidtechnological change. While rapidly evolving technology makes focussing on future optionsimperative, it also makes it extremely important to remain flexible. Laying out a blueprint forthe payments system of the next ten or even five years, and rigidly following it, would almostcertainly be a mistake. The technology is moving so rapidly that investments made now maywell be obsolete in a short time.Performance MeasuresA major theme of GPRA is the identification of specific measures of performanceof projects and programs which can be used to evaluate their effectiveness. As in mostorganizations, performance measurement at the Federal Reserve is more advanced -- and morefeasible -- in some types of activities than in others.In the payment services areas, the Reserve Banks have measured theirperformance through various financial measures for many years. For example, the MonetaryControl Act of 1980 imposes market discipline on the Federal Reserve by requiring it fully tocover its costs of providing services to depository institutions, and compliance with thisrequirement is monitored closely. Frequently private competitors provide or could provide theseservices, and our ability to recover our costs, adjusted to include a factor for imputed profits,taxes and cost of capital, help determine whether it is beneficial for the economy that we stay inthe business. In addition, the Federal Reserve has traditionally measured unit costs for itsfinancial services and has developed various indices that allow a Reserve Bank to measure itscost performance over time and in comparison to other Reserve Banks. Private sectorbenchmarks are also being developed. The Federal Reserve also tracks quality measures formany Reserve Bank services. Finally, the Federal Reserve monitors the progress of the ReserveBanks against various strategic objectives.Similarly, in bank supervision, the Federal Reserve has long used a variety ofmeasures of the effectiveness of its examination process, but the measurement challenge hastaken on new importance as supervision becomes more automated and more focused onanalyzing risk. To meet this challenge, the Federal Reserve is working closely with otherregulators to standardize and improve examination techniques, and has established a SteeringCommittee to oversee implementation of a risk-focused examination program and to design amanagement information system that will permit the Board to evaluate better the efficient use ofexamination resources among the Reserve Banks. For instance, supervisory data are used todetermine in advance of on-site examinations what factors (CAMELS rating, asset size, location,and loan types) are most predictive as to the resources needed for examinations, and whichinstitutions, particular lending areas or other service lines may require more intensive review.Such programs are low-cost because they use information that we already collect, and areeffective and cost-saving because they provide a systematic way to plan and prioritize our timeand resources.In other areas, such as the research and statistical analysis on which monetarypolicy is based, performance measurement is -- and will remain -- far more problematic. Theperformance of the economy itself is not so hard to measure and right now is highly positive.But it is not clear how much of the economic progress can be attributed to monetary policy, andeven less clear how particular monetary policy actions are related to the quality and quantity ofresearch and analysis produced by the Fed’s research staff.BIS Review  72/1997
- 5 -ConclusionGPRA provides the opportunity for a major improvement in the management andeffectiveness of Federal agencies. It provides the impetus for agencies to clarify their missionsand objectives, measure their performance better and improve their efficiency and effectiveness.It must, however, avoid the risk of becoming, like some previous efforts to improve governmentmanagement, largely a paper exercise which produces many numbers and reports but few realresults.The Federal Reserve welcomes the opportunity to participate in the GPRAprocess. We will work hard to fulfill the vision of the framers of the Act and avoid the pitfalls.We will have to respond in ways that are appropriate to the Federal Reserve’s diverse missionsand decentralized structure. I believe we have made significant progress toward the GPRA-typestrategic planning and are on the track to making more in the immediate future.BIS Review   72/1997
BIS Review   71/1997Mr. Thompson discusses the many faces of risk in banking in Australia   Talkby the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. G.J. Thompson, to the AustralianInstitute of Banking and Finance in Canberra on 12/6/97.IntroductionI would like to talk today about various aspects of risk in banking. One modernnotion is that banking essentially consists of processing information and managing risk. Whilethe average person in the street probably has a more prosaic - not to say jaundiced - view ofbanks, risk management is indeed very much a core activity for bankers.And it is of fundamental concern to bank supervisors, such as the RBA, thatbanks are doing this job reasonably well - that all the big risks are identified clearly, measuredaccurately, monitored continuously and kept within prudent bounds. Bank supervision in recentyears has focused much more intensively on the quality of the systems which banks use for thesetasks.It seems that banks and their supervisors are having to contend with a steadilygrowing array of risks.Derivatives risk, operational risk and environmental risk have all come toprominence in the past decade or so. And public relations risk is a major ongoing challenge forbanks!One even hears occasionally of “regulation risk” - which seems to relate to thecapricious demands of regulatory agencies. Needless to say, this one has not been high on ourlist of concerns for the Australian banking system!I propose to touch on only three areas of banking risk:-old-fashioned credit risk;-interbank settlement risk; and-the Year 2000 problem - a kind of operational risk visited upon the worldby the approach of the new millenium, and the short-sightedness of 1970scomputer programmers with a penchant for abbreviation!Credit riskAll of the major periods of stress in Australian banking have been caused bycredit losses. In the most recent episode - in the late 1980s and early 1990s - banks wrote offover $25 billion in loan losses.There have been recent comments from some bankers and others that lendingstandards are slackening once again, perhaps threatening another such round.One reaction would be that these comments are rather alarmist. After all, on mostindicators, banks’ asset quality position is very sound. Impaired loans are less than one per centof their total assets, the lowest point since we started collecting statistics seven years ago.Furthermore, the rate at which assets are becoming impaired has been stable for some time, andshows no signs of an upturn. “Past due” loans kicked up in 1995 and early 1996 but havestabilised recently, still at relatively low levels.
- 2 -BIS Review   71/1997The broader environment also has fewer worrying features than in the 1980s:-aggregate bank credit is expanding much less rapidly than then (althoughinflation rates are also down quite a bit);-the financial position of business borrowers is generally quite healthy withdebt to equity ratios lower, and interest coverage higher, than in the late1980s; and-while asset prices are rising, there is no sign of the bubbles we saw in the1980s; commercial property prices are up only modestly from their lowpoints of 1993.We also have the general impression that banks have a better handle on theircredit risks than they did ten years ago. With more centralised credit management, banks cannow aggregate exposures to clients and industries, a basic capability which was sadly lackingthen. Some of the bigger banks have specialised units to monitor their property exposures. I alsosuspect that the corporate structures which contributed to problems in the late 1980s are lesslikely to be tolerated by lenders today.This is all reassuring, but it is certainly no reason for complacency. There is littledoubt that current lending standards are less stringent than they were a couple of years ago. Ourobservations during visits to banks support the market anecdotes on this.There has been a clear narrowing in interest margins for big corporate borrowersand some relaxation in the loan covenants which apply. It’s only a slight exaggeration to say thathigh quality corporate borrowers can virtually write their own terms and conditions; and somelenders are prepared to lend for very long terms at low margins. For lesser quality clients thereappears to have been some drift back toward negative pledge and interest-only lending.The main reason for this is more intense competition among all banks as theystrive to keep or build market share in an environment where it is also becoming easier for majorcorporates to tap debt markets directly.At the smaller end of the market the signs of looser lending standards are lessclear. We have, however, seen more facilities where requirements for personal guarantees havebeen relaxed. It’s also possible that some of the regional banks might, in their eagerness todiversify loan portfolios, be lending to clients that major banks are turning away.It is, of course, not possible to interpret all these trends unequivocally asindicators of unsound banking. And it would be unrealistic to expect impaired assets to stay aslow as they are now. Credit quality necessarily ebbs and flows with the fortunes of the economyand particular sectors. What is important is that any deterioration is manageable against banks’capital, and that they recognise early the need for additional provisions.On balance, we believe that some current lending practices do risk sowing theseeds of future credit quality problems for banks. Chief executives and boards should beconsidering carefully whether the additional point of market share that might be won now bylending to marginal propositions is worth the pain of future losses, the resources needed for loanworkouts, and so on. They should also be alert to the possibility that the household sector mightfeature more strongly in the next upswing of losses. Household debt has increased a good dealmore quickly than incomes in recent years.
- 3 -BIS Review   71/1997The RBA recently organised a Credit Conference to review trends in credit riskmanagement, with participants including a number of leading bankers and accountants. Avolume of readings and a summary of discussion will be published soon.The main theme from the Conference was how credit risk assessment andmanagement are becoming more objective, more scientific. One speaker described this asmoving from an “experience-centric” approach to “data-centric” models.With standard products such as mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards and (tosome extent) small business loans, quite sophisticated statistical methods are beginning to beapplied to estimating default risk. The aim is to see, from an analysis of history, which data aremost helpful in predicting the probability of default. Such analysis produces “scorecards” for usein processing loan requests.Increasingly, consumer loans are being managed on a portfolio basis, with bankscalculating expected losses for various broad product categories. Some are tracking themigration of loans through various stages of delinquency to help determine the proportion whichwill ultimately incur a loss. By updating the amounts at each stage, and adjusting migration ratesin the light of current information, banks aim to measure more accurately the current risks intheir portfolios.At the “bigger” end of the loan market, a lot of attention is being given to theaccuracy and timeliness of risk-grading systems. To grade loans, the more sophisticated banksare now using complex statistical models based on financial information about borrowers or onequity prices. These feed into decisions about pricing, provisioning and portfolio balance.Securitisation, the development of secondary markets and the use of creditderivatives are other facets of the more scientific management of credit risk.These trends are, of course, to be encouraged. The new tools should not, however,be regarded as guarantees against unexpected credit problems.For one thing, their usefulness depends critically on the quality and relevance ofthe historical information which goes into them. Most banks have detailed asset quality data forno more than a few years, covering not even one full credit cycle. Even where good data areavailable, it is uncertain how closely past relationships will hold for the future.There would be dangers, therefore, if automated systems were used uncritically,without an understanding of their limitations. Even when these models have been extensivelyroad tested and their predictions assessed carefully, it is unlikely that they will do away with theneed for overriding judgments about economic prospects and the outlook for particularindustries and sectors.On the other hand, the new techniques do provide an objective framework fordecisions about pricing and capital allocation. While it would be foolish to rely blindly on them,it would be as dangerous if they were too easily overridden by competitive pressures. As anotherparticipant at our Conference asked: will banks be willing to forego business that is apparentlypriced in line with the prevailing market just because a risk-based model indicates that it woulddilute shareholder value? There is no doubt that such questions should be resolved at the highestlevels in banks. They should not be left to business-driven relationship managers.
- 4 -BIS Review   71/1997Needless to say, we will be keen observers of banks’ lending practices over thenext couple of years.Interbank settlement risk and RTGSNaturally we in the RBA, like almost everyone else, would prefer not tocontemplate the failure of a bank. But bank failures have happened from time to time in othercountries - despite the best endeavours of managers and regulators. And it would be foolish toturn a blind eye to this possibility in Australia, because a bank failure is not only very damagingfor the depositors immediately affected, but it can create a wave of problems flowing wellbeyond that particular institution. This flow-on damage can occur in various ways, includingthrough effects on depositor confidence, but perhaps the most important channel is the paymentssystem. If a bank in difficulty has large unsettled payment obligations to other banks, thosebanks will inevitably share some of the pain. There could then be further effects which cannot bepredicted with any precision.In the past Australian banks have not paid much attention to interbank settlementrisk; indeed, they have had no way of monitoring their exposures to each other during the day.They operated on the presumption that, as long as they exchanged payments only withsupervised banks, the central bank would “sort out” a settlement problem in the unlikely eventthat one arose. This is hardly a sound basis on which to proceed - from either a commercial or apublic policy viewpoint. It leaves individual banks potentially exposed to large losses which,because of the broader ramifications, tax payers might end up having to cover.To achieve a more satisfactory position, Australia is now travelling the path ofmany other countries in introducing a real-time gross settlement - that is, RTGS - system forinterbank payments.Under RTGS, high-value payments will be settled continuously across banks’accounts with the RBA - rather than being accumulated, left hanging overnight and settled up inone hit the following morning. On an average day payments exchanged among banks but notsettled until the next day come to over $90 billion. RTGS will, at the outset, eliminate abouttwo-thirds of that overnight exposure. It will also give Australia a fully-fledged delivery-versus-payment system for transactions in debt securities.With banks and other payments providers, the RBA began building the RTGSsystem in 1995. This has been a major undertaking - with a development cost across the industryof around $120 million. The project is technically complex, but its biggest challenges have beenreaching agreement on the architecture and rules for a system which all high-value paymentsproviders will use on an equal and open basis.Progress has not been rapid, or without occasional friction, but it has been steady.The key components of the system are now falling into place:-last month, the RBA’s central site - where interbank payments will beprocessed in real time - became available for testing by the industry;-by early next month, this central site will be fully operational;-by August, the industry’s system for delivering payments to the centralsite using SWIFT messages should be tested and ready to use;
- 5 -BIS Review   71/1997-over subsequent months, high-value interbank payments will be movedprogressively onto the new system, although ultimate settlement will, forthe time being, still be the following morning.Full implementation of RTGS is scheduled for April next year. Whether this isachieved now depends largely on the commitment of the industry, especially the major banks.As we get closer to RTGS “going live”, more thought is being given to itspractical implications for banks and their customers. Perhaps the most important of these is thedaily management of liquidity.With payments able to flow across banks’ settlement accounts at the RBA only ifthe paying bank has sufficient funds, liquidity will clearly become more of an issue than it isnow - when a bank needs only enough funds to extinguish any net obligation to others eachmorning. Under RTGS, banks will need to manage their liquidity more carefully or run the riskof being unable to send an important payment at the required time.Banks are starting to give attention to this task - studying the patterns in theirpayment flows and upgrading their systems so they can monitor and manage flows on anaggregate basis across their business.There will inevitably be implications for corporates in this. RTGS will causebanks to focus more sharply on the amount of credit extended to customers during the day.Because they will have to manage their own liquidity more closely on a real-time basis, bankswill (understandably) want to control their customer exposures, and the demands which theseplace on liquidity, more tightly than before. Payment requests will have priorities attached.Corporates may need to negotiate facilities to ensure that time-critical payments will flow whenthey are expected by suppliers and counterparties. As a result, some will no doubt choose to plantheir payments and receipts more actively than in the past.Our impression from recent discussions with corporate treasurers is that very few,if any, banks have yet done much talking to their customers about these issues.More careful management of liquidity by banks and their customers will reducethe likelihood of payments “gridlock” under RTGS. For its part, the RBA has taken variousdecisions aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity will be available, at a reasonable cost, across thesystem as a whole. We will enter into securities repurchase agreements with banks to providethem with intra-day funds at virtually no cost. We will allow banks to dip into their PAR assetsfor such transactions. The range of assets eligible for repos with the RBA has also just beenexpanded. Finally, as banker to the Commonwealth, we will use our control over governmentpayments to inject funds early in the day.It remains to be seen whether other devices will be needed to lubricate the system.In some places, such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, banks are required to send aminimum proportion of their payments early in the day to provide liquidity for the market. Wewill monitor flows to assess whether such “affirmative action” is necessary in Australia.It will, of course, be essential that most high-value payments are settled real-timewhen the new system is available. Anything less would defeat the purpose for which it is beingbuilt. There have been suggestions that some banks might by-pass RTGS by using lower cost(but higher risk) channels, such as the Direct Entry system which is designed for high volumes
- 6 -BIS Review   71/1997of small payments and settles on a net deferred basis. If this were to happen, we would have toconsider what incentives or sanctions were needed to ensure that high-value payments travelalong the RTGS path.RTGS will not, of itself, remove the risks that banks incur in internationalpayments - in particular, the risks arising from non-synchronisation of payments and receipts inforeign exchange transactions. Having RTGS for domestic transactions is, however, a necessarystep toward tackling this.We’re currently investigating the extent of Australian banks’ settlement risks intheir foreign exchange business. This is the next major frontier for risk reduction in banking.Operational risk and Year 2000As their business becomes more complex and diverse, banks are increasinglyreliant on computers for information-processing and control. As a result, they are exposed tovarious kinds of operational risk.For a bank active in derivatives trading, a breakdown in computer systems foreven a relatively short time could be disastrous - preventing it from monitoring its changingmarket positions and disrupting its capacity to trade and to settle outstanding transactions. Irecently heard a keen observer predict that the next big banking disaster would come from a(hypothetical) major international bank losing track of its derivatives positions for 24 hours.To protect against such events, banks invest heavily in the integrity of theircomputer systems, as well as in back-up and disaster recovery facilities. The RBA is, of course,providing such back-up for the core of the RTGS system.The Year 2000 problem poses a rather novel sort of operational risk because it isthe result of past programming decisions which have produced the classic “unintendedconsequence”. Basically, the risk is computer confusion and malfunction when the yearidentified in programming as “99” clicks over to “00”.The upshot for Australian banks is the need to spend big sums on replacing orreprogramming their date-dependent computer systems. For the four majors alone, the total costcould be well over $350 million.As the calendar moves forward, the need to get on with addressing this problembecomes more urgent. In the United States, Federal regulators have recommended that financialinstitutions complete all necessary reprogramming by the end of 1998 to allow time for thoroughtesting before January 2000. This will be needed because, in changing a lot of banking software,new bugs could be introduced along the way. More aggressive targets have been set for largebanks where computer problems could do broad damage to the working of the financial system.The RBA is currently seeking assurance that Australian banks are giving the Year2000 problem the high priority it warrants. We recently sent them a questionnaire asking eachabout progress in identifying the size of the problem for its operations, in drawing up amanagement program to fix it and in assigning the necessary resources. They should also befinding out what their major customers are doing about it.
- 7 -BIS Review   71/1997Fixing the Year 2000 problem is not a glamorous task - but it is no less importantfor that.In this respect, it is much like the challenge of managing banking risks generally.
Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve in its semi-annualHumphrey-Hawkins report on monetary policy   Testimony of the Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before Congress on 22/7/97.I am pleased to appear before this Subcommittee to present the Federal Reserve’sreport on the economic situation and monetary policy.The recent performance of the economy, characterized by strong growth and lowinflation, has been exceptional -- and better than most anticipated. During the first quarter of1997, real gross domestic product expanded at nearly a 6 percent annual rate, after posting a 3percent increase over 1996. Activity apparently continued to expand in the second quarter, albeitat a more moderate pace. The economy is now in the seventh consecutive year of expansion,making it the third longest post-World War II cyclical upswing to date.Moreover, our Federal Reserve Banks indicate that economic activity is on therise, and at a relatively high level, in virtually every geographic region and community of thenation. The expansion has been balanced, in that inventories, as well as stocks of business capitaland other durable assets, have been kept closely in line with spending, so overhangs have beensmall and readily corrected.This strong expansion has produced a remarkable increase in work opportunitiesfor Americans. A net of more than thirteen million jobs has been created since the current periodof growth began in the spring of 1991. As a consequence, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5percent -- its lowest level in almost a quarter century. The expansion has enabled many in theworking-age population, a large number of whom would have otherwise remained out of thelabor force or among the longer-term unemployed, to acquire work experience and improvedskills. Our whole economy will benefit from their greater productivity. To be sure, not allsegments of our population are fully sharing in the economic improvement. Some Americansstill have trouble finding jobs, and for part of our work force real wage stagnation persists.In contrast to the typical postwar business cycle, measured price inflation is lowernow than when the expansion began and has shown little tendency to rebound of late, despitehigh rates of resource utilization. In the business sector, producer prices have fallen in each ofthe past six months. Consumers also are enjoying low inflation. The consumer price index roseat less than a 2 percent annual rate over the first half of the year, down from a little over 3percent in 1996.With the economy performing so well for so long, financial markets have beenbuoyant, as memories of past business and financial cycles fade with time. Soaring prices in thestock market have been fuelled by moderate long-term interest rates and expectations ofinvestors that profit margins and earnings growth will hold steady, or even increase further, in arelatively stable, low-inflation environment. Credit spreads at depository institutions and in theopen market have remained extremely narrow by historical standards, suggesting a high degreeof confidence among lenders regarding the prospects for credit repayment.The key questions facing financial markets and policy makers are: "What isbehind the good performance of the economy?" and "Will it persist?" Without question, theexceptional economic situation reflects some temporary factors that have been restraininginflation rates. In addition, however, important pieces of information, while just suggestive atthis point, could be read as indicating basic improvements in the longer-term efficiency of ourBIS Review 70/1997
- 2 -economy. The Federal Reserve has been aware of this possibility in our monetary policydeliberations and, as always, has operated with a view to supplying adequate liquidity to allowthe economy to reach its highest potential on a sustainable basis.Nonetheless, we also recognize that the capacity of our economy to producegoods and services is not without limit. If demand were to outrun supply, inflationaryimbalances would eventually develop that would tend to undermine the current expansion andinhibit the long-run growth potential of the economy. Because monetary policy works with asignificant lag, policy actions are directed at a future that may not be clearly evident in currentexperience. This leads to policy judgements that are by their nature calibrated to the relativeprobabilities of differing outcomes. We moved the federal funds rate higher in March becausewe perceived the probability of demand outstripping supply to have increased to a point whereinaction would have put at risk the solid elements of support that have sustained this expansionand made it so beneficial.In making such judgements in March and in the future, we need to analyzecarefully the various forces that may be affecting the balance of supply and demand in theeconomy, including those that may be responsible for its exceptional recent behavior. Theremainder of my testimony will address the various possibilities.Inflation, Output, and Technological Change in the 1990sMany observers, including us, have been puzzled about how an economy,operating at high levels and drawing into employment increasingly less-experienced workers,can still produce subdued and, by some measures even falling, inflation rates. It will, doubtless,be several years before we know with any conviction the full story of the surprisingly benigncombination of output and prices that has marked the business expansion of the last six years.Certainly, public policy has played an important role. Administration andCongressional actions to curtail budget deficits have enabled long-term interest rates to movelower, encouraging private efficiency-enhancing capital investment. Deregulation in a number ofindustries has fostered competition and held down prices. Finally, the pre-emptive actions of theFederal Reserve in 1994 contained a potentially destabilizing surge in demand, short-circuiting aboom-bust business cycle in the making and keeping inflation low to encourage businessinnovation. But the fuller explanation of the recent extraordinary performance may well liedeeper.In February 1996, I raised before this Committee a hypothesis tying togethertechnological change and cost pressures that could explain what was even then a puzzlingquiescence of inflation. The new information received in the last eighteen months remainsconsistent with those earlier notions; indeed, some additional pieces of the puzzle appear to befalling into place.A surge in capital investment in high tech equipment that began in early 1993 hassince strengthened. Purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment have risen at amore than 14 percent annual rate since early 1993 in nominal terms, and at an astonishing rate ofnearly 25 percent in real terms, reflecting the fall in the prices of this equipment. Presumablycompanies have come to perceive a significant increase in profit opportunities from exploitingthe improved productivity of these new technologies.BIS Review 70/1997
- 3 -It is premature to judge definitively whether these business perceptions are theharbinger of a more general and persistent improvement in productivity. Supporting thispossibility, productivity growth, which often suffers as business expansions mature, has notfollowed that pattern. In addition, profit margins remain high in the face of pickups incompensation growth, suggesting that businesses continue to find new ways to enhance theirefficiency. Nonetheless, although the anecdotal evidence is ample and manufacturingproductivity has picked up, a change in the underlying trend is not yet reflected in ourconventional data for the whole economy.But even if the perceived quicker pace of application of our newer technologiesturns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather than true productivity advance, it has brought with ita heightened sense of job insecurity and, as a consequence, subdued wage gains. As I pointedout here last February, polls indicated that despite the significant fall in the unemployment rate,the proportion of workers in larger establishments fearful of being laid off rose from 25 percentin 1991 to 46 percent by 1996. It should not have been surprising then that strike activity in the1990s has been lower than it has been in decades and that new labor union contracts have beenlonger and have given greater emphasis to job security. Nor should it have been unexpected thatthe number of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs to seek other employment has not risen inthis period of tight labor markets.To be sure, since last year, surveys have indicated that the proportion of workersfearful of layoff has stabilized and the number of voluntary job leavers has edged up. And,indeed, perhaps as a consequence, wage gains have accelerated some. But increases in theEmployment Cost Index still trail behind what previous relationships to tight labor marketswould have suggested, and a lingering sense of fear or uncertainty seems still to pervade the jobmarket, though to a somewhat lesser extent.Consumer surveys do indicate greater optimism about the economy. However, itis one thing to believe that the economy, indeed the job market, will do well overall, but quiteanother to feel secure about one’s individual situation, given the accelerated pace of corporaterestructuring and the heightened fear of skill obsolescence that has apparently characterized thisexpansion. Persisting insecurity would help explain why measured personal saving rates havenot declined as would have been expected from the huge increase in stock market wealth. Wewill, however, have a better fix on savings rates after the coming benchmark revisions to thenational income and product accounts.The combination in recent years of subdued compensation per hour and solidproductivity advances has meant that unit labor costs of non financial corporations have barelymoved. Moreover, when you combine unit labor costs with non labor costs -- which account forone-quarter of total costs on a consolidated basis -- total unit costs for the year ended in the firstquarter of 1997 rose only about half a percent. Hence, a significant part of the measured priceincrease over that period was attributable to a rise in profit margins, unusual well into a businessexpansion. Rising margins are further evidence suggesting that productivity gains have beenunexpectedly strong; in these situations, real labor compensation usually catches up only with alag.While accelerated technological change may well be an important element inunravelling the current economic puzzle, there have been other influences at play as well inrestraining price increases at high levels of resource utilization. The strong dollar of the last twoyears has pared import prices and constrained the pricing behavior of domestic firms facingimport competition. Increasing globalization has enabled greater specialization over a widerBIS Review 70/1997
- 4 -array of goods and services, in effect allowing comparative advantage to hold down costs andenhance efficiencies. Increased deregulation of telecommunications, motor and rail transport,utilities, and finance doubtless has been a factor restraining prices, as perhaps has the reducedmarket power of labor unions. Certainly, changes in the health care industry and the pricing ofhealth services have greatly contributed to holding down growth in the cost of benefits, andhence overall labor compensation.Many of these forces are limited or temporary, and their effects can be expectedto diminish, at which time cost and price pressures would tend to re-emerge. The effects of anincreased rate of technological change might be more persistent, but they too could notpermanently hold down inflation if the Federal Reserve allows excess liquidity to flood financialmarkets. I have noted to you before the likelihood that at some point workers might no longer bewilling to restrain wage gains for added security, at which time accelerating unit labor costscould begin to press on profit margins and prices, should monetary policy be tooaccommodative.When I discuss greater technological change, I am not referring primarily to aparticular new invention. Instead, I have in mind the increasingly successful and pervasiveapplication of recent technological advances, especially in telecommunications and computers,to enhance efficiencies in production processes throughout the economy. Many of thesetechnologies have been around for some time. Why might they be having a more pronouncedeffect now?In an intriguing paper prepared for a conference last year sponsored by the Federal ReserveBank of Boston, Professor Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford documented how, in the past, it oftentook a considerable period of time for the necessary synergies to develop between differentforms of capital and technologies. One example is the invention of the dynamo in the mid 1800s.Rosenberg’s colleague Professor Paul David had noted a number of years ago that it wasn’t untilthe 1920s that critical complementary technologies of the dynamo -- for example, the electricmotor as the primary source of mechanical drive in factories, and central generating stations --were developed and in place and that production processes had fully adapted to these inventions.What we may be observing in the current environment is a number of keytechnologies, some even mature, finally interacting to create significant new opportunities forvalue creation. For example, the applications for the laser were modest until the laterdevelopment of fiber optics engendered a revolution in telecommunications. Broad advances insoftware have enabled us to capitalize on the prodigious gains in hardware capacity. Theinteraction of both of these has created the Internet.The accelerated synergies of the various technologies may be what have beencreating the apparent significant new profit opportunities that presumably lie at the root of therecent boom in high-tech investment. An expected result of the widespread and effectiveapplication of information and other technologies would be a significant increase in productivityand reduction in business costs.We do not now know, nor do I suspect can anyone know, whether currentdevelopments are part of a once or twice in a century phenomenon that will carry productivitytrends nationally and globally to a new higher track, or whether we are merely observing someunusual variations within the context of an otherwise generally conventional business cycleexpansion. The recent improvement in productivity could be just transitory, an artifact of atemporary surge in demand and output growth. In view of the slowing in growth in the secondBIS Review 70/1997
- 5 -quarter and the more moderate expansion widely expected going forward, data for profitmargins on domestic operations and productivity from the second quarter on will be especiallyrelevant in assessing whether recent improvements are structural or cyclical.Whatever the trend in productivity and, by extension, overall sustainableeconomic growth, from the Federal Reserve’s point of view, the faster the better. We see our jobas fostering the degree of liquidity that will best support the most effective platform for growthto flourish. We believe a non inflationary environment is such a platform because it promoteslong-term planning and capital investment and keeps the pressure on businesses to contain costsand enhance efficiency.The Federal Reserve’s policy problem is not with growth, but with maintaining aneffective platform. To do so, we endeavor to prevent strains from developing in our economicsystem, which long experience tells us produce bottlenecks, shortages, and inefficiencies. Theseeventually create more inflation, which undermines economic expansion and limits thelonger-term potential of the economy.In gauging the potential for oncoming strains, it is the effective capacity of theeconomy to produce that is important to us. An economy operating at a high level of utilizationand growing 5 percent a year is in little difficulty if capacity is growing at least that fast. But afully utilized economy growing at 1 percent will eventually get into trouble if capacity isgrowing less than that.Capacity itself, however, is a complex concept, which requires a separateevaluation of its two components, capital and labor. It appears that capital, that is, plant andequipment, can adapt and expand more expeditiously than in the past to meet demands. Hence,capital capacity is now a considerably less rigid constraint than it once was.In recent years, technology has engendered a significant compression of leadtimes between order and delivery for production facilities. This has enabled output to respondincreasingly faster to an upsurge in demand, thereby decreasing the incidence of strains oncapital capacity and shortages so evident in earlier business expansions.Reflecting progressively shorter lead times for capital equipment, unfilled ordersto shipment ratios for non-defense capital goods have declined by 30 percent in the last sixyears. Not only do producers have quicker access to equipment that embodies the most recentadvances, but they have been able to adjust their overall capital stock more rapidly to increasesin demand.The current lack of material shortages and bottlenecks, despite the high level andrecent robust expansion of demand, is striking. The effective capacity of production facilities hasincreased substantially in recent years in response to strong final demands and the influence ofcost reductions possible with the newer technologies. Increased flexibility is particularly evidentin the computer, telecommunications, and related industries, a segment of our economy thatseems far less subject to physical capacity constraints than many older-line establishments, andone that is assuming greater importance in our overall output. But the shortening of lags hasbeen pervasive even in more mature industries, owing in part to the application of advancedtechnologies to production methods.At the extreme, if all capital goods could be produced at constant cost and ondemand, the size of our nation’s capital stock would never pose a restraint on production. We areBIS Review 70/1997
- 6 -obviously very far from that nirvana, but it is important to note that we are also far from thesituation a half-century ago when our production processes were dominated by equipment suchas open hearth steel furnaces, which had very exacting limits on how much they could producein a fixed time frame and which required huge lead times to expand their capacity.Even so, today’s economy as a whole still can face capacity constraints from itsfacilities. Indeed, just three years ago, bottlenecks in industrial production -- though lessextensive than in years past at high levels of measured capacity utilization -- were nonethelessputting significant upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production. More recentlyvendor performance has deteriorated somewhat, indicating that flexibility to meet demands stillhas limits. Although further strides toward greater facilities flexibility have occurred since 1994,this is clearly an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.Labor MarketsMoreover, technology and management changes have had only a limited effect onthe ability of labor supply to respond to changes in demand. To be sure, individual firms haveacquired additional flexibility by increased use of outsourcing and temporary workers. Inaddition, smaller work teams can adapt more readily to variations in order flows. While thesetechniques put the right workers at the right spots to reduce bottlenecks, they do not increase theaggregate supply of labor. That supply is sensitive to changes in demand, but to a far morelimited extent than for facilities. New plants can almost always be built. But labor capacity foran individual country is constrained by the size of the working-age population, which, except forimmigration, is basically determined several decades in the past.Of course, capital facilities and labor are not fully separate markets. Within limits,labor and capital are substitutes, and slack in one market can offset tightness in another. Forexample, additional work shifts can expand output without significant addition to facilities, andsimilarly more labor-displacing equipment can permit production to be increased with the samelevel of employment.Yet despite significant increases in capital equipment in recent years, newadditions to labor supply have been inadequate to meet the demand for labor. As a consequence,the recent period has been one of significant reduction in labor market slack.Of the more than two million net new hires at an annual rate since early 1994,only about half have come from an expansion in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a job,and more than a third of those were net new immigrants. The remaining one million plus peryear increase in employment has been pulled from those who had been reported as unemployed(600 thousand annually) and those who wanted, but had not actively sought, a job (more than400 thousand annually). The latter, of course, are not in the official unemployment count.The key point is that continuously digging ever deeper into the available work agepopulation is not a sustainable trajectory for job creation. The unemployment rate has adownside limit if for no other reason than unemployment, in part, reflects voluntary periods ofjob search and other frictional unemployment. There is also a limit on how many of theadditional 5 million who wanted a job last quarter but were not actively seeking one could bereadily absorbed into jobs -- in particular, the large number enrolled in school, and those whomay lack the necessary skills or face other barriers to taking jobs. The rise in the averageworkweek since early 1996 suggests employers are having increasingly greater difficulty fittingBIS Review 70/1997
- 7 -the millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace of job creation continues, thepressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals couldescalate more rapidly.To be sure, there remain an additional 34 million in the working-age population(age 16 - 64) who say they do not want a job. Presumably, some of these early retirees, students,or homemakers might be attracted to the job market if it became sufficiently rewarding.However, making it attractive enough could also involve upward pressures in real wages thatwould trigger renewed price pressures, undermining the expansion.Thus, there would seem to be emerging constraints on potential labor input. Evenbefore we reach the ultimate limit of sustainable labor supply growth, the economy’s ability toexpand employment at the recent rate should rapidly diminish. The availability of unemployedlabor could no longer add to growth, irrespective of the degree of slack in physical facilities atthat time. Simply adding new facilities will not increase production unless output per workerimproves. Such improvements are possible if worker skills increase, but such gains come slowlythrough improved education and on-the-job training. They are also possible as capital substitutesfor labor, but are limited by the state of technology. More significant advances requiretechnological breakthroughs. At the cutting edge of technology, where America finds itself,major improvements cannot be produced on demand. New ideas that matter are hard won.The Economic OutlookAs I noted, the recent performance of the labor markets suggests that the economywas on an unsustainable track. Unless aggregate demand increases more slowly than it has inrecent years -- more in line with trends in the supply of labor and productivity -- imbalances willemerge. We do not know, however, at what point pressures would develop -- or indeed whetherthe economy is already close to that point.Fortunately, the very rapid growth of demand over the winter has eased recently.To an extent this easing seems to reflect some falloff in growth of demand for consumerdurables and for inventories to a pace more in line with moderate expansion in income. Butsome of the recent slower growth could simply be a product of abnormal weather patterns,which contributed to a first-quarter surge in output and weakened the second quarter, in whichcase the underlying trend could be somewhat higher than suggested by the second-quarter dataalone. Certainly, business and consumer confidence remains high and financial conditions aresupportive of growth. Particularly notable is the run-up in stock market wealth, the full effects ofwhich apparently have not been reflected in overall demand, but might yet be.Monetary policymakers, balancing these various forces, forecast a continuation ofless rapid growth in coming quarters. For 1997 as a whole, the central tendency of their forecastshas real GDP growing 3 to 3¼ percent. This would be much more brisk than was anticipated inFebruary, and the upward revision to this estimate largely reflects the unexpectedly strong firstquarter. The central tendency of monetary policymakers’ projections is that real GDP willexpand 2 to 2½ percent in 1998. This pace of expansion is expected to keep the unemploymentrate close to its current low level.We are reasonably confident that inflation will be quite modest for 1997 as awhole. The central tendency of the forecasts is that consumer prices will rise only 2¼ to 2½BIS Review 70/1997
- 8 -percent this year. This would be a significantly better outcome than the 2¾ to 3 percent CPIinflation foreseen in February.Federal Open Market Committee members do see higher rates of inflation nextyear. The central tendency of the projections is that CPI inflation will be 2½ to 3 percent in1998 -- a little above the expectation for this year. However, much of this increase is presumedto result from the absence of temporary factors that are holding down inflation this year. Inparticular, the favorable movements in food and energy prices of 1997 are unlikely to berepeated, and non-oil import prices may not continue to decline. While it is possible that betterproductivity trends and subdued wage growth will continue to help damp the increases inbusiness costs associated with tight labor markets, this is a situation that the Federal Reserveplans to monitor closely.I have no doubt that the current stance of policy -- characterized by a nominalfederal funds rate around 5½ percent -- will need to be changed at some point to fostersustainable growth and low inflation. Adjustments in the policy instrument in response to newinformation are a necessary and, I should like to emphasize, routine aspect of responsible policymaking. For the present, as I indicated, demand growth does appear to have moderated, butwhether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources isan open question. With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor marketutilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility thatadditional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation.The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing its policy to facilitate the maximumsustainable growth of the economy, but it is not, as some commentators have suggested,involved in an experiment that deliberately prods the economy to see how far and fast it cangrow. The costs of a failed experiment would be much too burdensome for too many of ourcitizens.Clearly, in considering issues of monetary policy we need to distinguish carefullybetween sustainable economic growth and unsustainable accelerations of activity. Sustainablegrowth reflects the increased capacity of the economic system to produce goods and servicesover the longer run. It is largely the sum of increases in productivity and in the labor force. Thatgrowth contrasts with a second type, a more transitory growth. An economy producing nearcapacity can expand faster for a short time, often through unsustainably low short-term interestrates and excess credit creation. But this is not growth that promotes lasting increases instandards of living and in jobs for our nation. Rather, it is a growth that creates instability andthereby inhibits the achievement of our nation’s economic goals.The key question is how monetary policy can best foster the highest rate ofsustainable growth and avoid amplifying swings in output, employment, and prices. Thehistorical evidence is unambiguous that excessive creation of credit and liquidity contributesnothing to the long-run growth of our productive potential and much to costly shorter-termfluctuations. Moreover, it promotes inflation, impairing the economy’s longer-term potentialoutput.Our objective has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself, but rather as aprecondition for the highest possible long-run growth of output and income -- the ultimate goalof macroeconomic policy.BIS Review 70/1997
- 9 -In considering possible adjustments of policy to achieve that goal, the issue oflags in the effects of monetary policy is crucial. The evidence clearly demonstrates thatmonetary policy affects the financial markets immediately but works with significant lags onoutput, employment, and prices. Thus, as I pointed out earlier, policy needs to be made today onthe basis of likely economic conditions in the future. As a consequence, and in the absence ofonce-reliable monetary guides to policy, there is no alternative to formulating policy usingrisk-reward trade-offs based on what are, unavoidably, uncertain forecasts.Operating on uncertain forecasts, of course, is not unusual. People do it everyday, consciously or subconsciously. A driver might tap the brakes to make sure not to be hit by atruck coming down the street, even if he thinks the chances of such an event are relatively low;the costs of being wrong are simply too high. Similarly, in conducting monetary policy theFederal Reserve needs constantly to look down the road to gauge the future risks to the economyand act accordingly.Growth of Money and CreditThe view that the Federal Reserve’s best contribution to growth is to foster pricestability has informed both our tactical decisions on the stance of monetary policy and ourlonger-run judgements on appropriate rates of liquidity provision. To be sure, growth rates ofmonetary and credit aggregates have become less reliable as guides for monetary policy as aresult of rapid change in our financial system. As I have reported to you previously, the currentuncertainties regarding the behavior of the monetary aggregates have implied that we have beenunable to employ them as guides to short-run policy decisions. Accordingly, in recent years wehave reported annual ranges for money growth that serve as benchmarks under conditions ofprice stability and a return to historically stable patterns of velocity.Over the past several years, the monetary aggregates -- M2 in particular -- haveshown some signs of re-establishing such stable patterns. The velocity of M2 has fluctuated in arelatively narrow range, and some of its variation within that range has been explained byinterest rate movements, in a relationship similar to that established over earlier decades. Wefind this an encouraging development, and it is possible that at some point the FOMC mightelect to put more weight on such monetary quantities in the conduct of policy. But in our view,sufficient evidence has not yet accumulated to support such a judgement.Consequently, we have decided to keep the existing ranges of growth for moneyand credit for 1997 and carry them over to next year, retaining the interpretation of the moneyranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability. With nominal income growth strongrelative to the rate that would likely prevail under conditions of price stability, the growth of M2is likely to run in the upper part of its range both this year and next, while M3 could run a littleabove its cone. Domestic non financial sector debt is likely to remain well within its range, withprivate debt growth brisk and federal debt growth subdued. Although any tendency for theaggregates to exceed their ranges would not, in the event, necessarily call for an examination ofwhether a policy adjustment was needed, the Federal Reserve will be closely examiningfinancial market prices and flows in the context of a broad range of economic and priceindicators for evidence that the sustainability of the economic expansion may be in jeopardy.BIS Review 70/1997
- 10 -Concluding CommentThe Federal Reserve recognizes, of course, that monetary policy does notdetermine the economy’s potential. All that it can do is help establish sound money and a stablefinancial environment in which the inherent vitality of a market economy can flourish andpromote the capital investment that in the long run is the basis for vigorous economic growth.Similarly, other government policies also have a major role to play in contributing to economicgrowth. A continued emphasis on market mechanisms through deregulation will help sharpenincentives to work, save, invest, and innovate. Similarly, a fiscal policy oriented toward limitedgrowth in government expenditures, producing smaller budget deficits and even budgetsurpluses, would tend to lower real interest rates even further, also promoting capital investment.The recent experience provides striking evidence of the potential for the continuation andextension of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies to enhance our economy’s performance inthe period ahead.BIS Review 70/1997
Mr. Stals considers the issues of the relaxation of exchange controls andraising finance on the foreign bond market   Speech given by the Governor of the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank, Dr. Chris Stals, at a luncheon of the Institute of Directors in SouthernAfrica in Pretoria on 16/7/97.The extension of the relaxation of exchange controls to private individuals asfrom 1 July 1997, marked a further step in the Government’s committed programme ofgradually phasing out all restrictions on the movement of funds between South Africa and therest of the world.The present system of exchange controls was introduced in South Africa overmany years, starting from 1961, and was mainly intended to provide some protection to thedomestic economy against the adverse effects of non-economic developments in South Africa,and international reactions that followed internal developments. Since these non-economicfactors were removed during 1993 and 1994, following the major social and political reforms inour country, justification for the retention of the exchange controls also disappeared. In the newsituation, the retention of exchange controls became counter-productive and, in a more open andfreer economic environment, created undesirable distortions in the allocation of resources.There was, therefore, general consensus that South Africa should removeexchange controls as quickly as possible, and some advisers even thought that it should be donein a one-off “big bang” approach. How desirable such an approach might have been, particularlyfor financial operators in the market, realism forced the Reserve Bank and the Government toopt for a gradual but determined phasing-out programme. The major constraint on the authoritieshad been the limited amount of foreign exchange reserves available to the country that wererequired for the conversion of South African rand assets into foreign currencies.Developments over the past few years enabled us to move rather fast with theremoval of the exchange controls. Large inflows of foreign funds, mostly in the form ofportfolio investments made by non-residents in South African equities and bonds, and inflows ofshort-, medium- and long-term loan capital made it possible not only to replenish the country’snet foreign reserves from a zero-level in April 1994 to more than R20 billion now, but also toremove more than 50 per cent of the exchange controls that existed three years ago. Theserelaxations required large amounts of funds, for example to enable South African residentcompanies to invest about R20 billion in foreign direct investment projects, and to enableinstitutional investors to diversify about R30 billion of their investments in foreign currencydenominated assets. Over the three year period from the beginning of 1994 up to the end of1996, the total net inflow of capital, that is taking account of non-resident capital inflows andresident capital outflows, showed a net gain for South Africa of almost R30 billion. Thesubstantial capital inflows into South Africa therefore enabled us to achieve our objectives withthe replenishment of the official foreign reserves, and the gradual relaxation of the exchangecontrols.The future programme with the removal of the remaining exchange controls will,as over the past three-and-a-half years, be very dependent on a continuation of net capitalinflows from the rest of the world. The capital inflows will, as a matter of fact, not onlydetermine the pace of the removal of the remaining exchange controls, but also the rate ofeconomic growth and development in the country. For South Africa it is of vital importanceBIS Review 69/1997
- 2 -therefore that we shall continue to make our markets and our economy attractive to foreigninvestors.We may ask ourselves what foreign investors are looking for before they decideto invest in a country. What prompted them, over the past few years, to make such hugeinvestments in South Africa? They are obviously looking for stable political and socialconditions in a country. The ANC Government has certainly established itself as a stablegovernment and has founded a credible track record with the management of the economy.Crime and violence remains a worrying aspect of the social system, and many foreign investorsstill prefer not to commit themselves for too long a period in making their investments here.On the economic side, the globalisation of the world financial markets is aprocess that countries such as South Africa cannot stay out of. Operators in these global marketsare defining their own economic criteria for the assessment and comparison of countries wherethey can invest huge amounts of funds administered by them. These criteria may sometimesseem to be rather superficial, but they are basic. For example, the Maastricht criteria requiremembers of the European Union to maintain a deficit on their budgets of not more than 3 percent of gross domestic product. Total government debt should not be more than 60 per cent ofgross domestic product. The rate of inflation in each participating member country should not betoo far out of line with the average rate of inflation in all the participating member countries.These criteria are now being applied very generally across the board by manyglobal fund investors when they assess the attractiveness of countries for investment purposes. Itis therefore not just a whim of the South African Minister of Finance to reduce the deficit on theBudget of the South African Government to 4 per cent this year. Likewise, it is not just anover-ambitious target of the Reserve Bank to bring inflation in South Africa more in line withthe average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners. These are directivesand requirements from the international investor community -- those investors that enabled us toachieve the results of the past three years with the exchange control relaxation and the improvedeconomic conditions in general. They will also determine the course of the further relaxation inexchange controls and in the economic development of our country over the next few years.Because of the importance of foreign investment for South Africa, it is essentialthat foreign investors shall also be well-informed of the South African economy, and itspotential to absorb new foreign investment. The recent decline in the gold price created a lot ofnervousness in the market for foreign exchange. This is an unfortunate development that canhave serious adverse implications for the gold mining industry. Its effect on the balance ofpayments, however, should be judged against a total level of exports of goods and services thatnow exceeds R150 billion per annum, with gold contributing less than 18 per cent of the total,and a total capital inflow through the Bond Market and Stock Exchange that was double thevalue of the gold production in the first six months of 1997.The average gold price last year was equal to US $388 per fine ounce, and SouthAfrica’s total gold exports amounted to 15.75 million ounces. Should the present price of $320be maintained for a full year, the loss in foreign exchange on the balance of payments willamount to R4.5 billion, or less than 3 per cent of total exports. Relative to the volatility of thenet capital movements, the amount should not create any undue pressure on the rand/foreigncurrency exchange rate. Part of this loss can also be made up with an increase in the volume ofproduction and with increases in other exports. We should also not be too negative for somerecovery of the gold price before the end of this year. If anything, the recent decline in the goldprice provides further evidence of how important it is for South Africa to continue to attractBIS Review 69/1997

Raising finance on the foreign bond marketThe South African Government recently made two further very successful issuesin international capital markets. An issue in the Samurai Yen market raised the equivalent of$357 million for seven years, and an issue in the American Yankee market provided an amountof $500 million for a twenty-year period. Both these loans were raised at relatively attractiveinterest rates.The international private financial markets have developed very rapidly in recentyears, and now provide for the needs of many types of borrowers. Only sovereign borrowers,however, and large multinational corporations will be able to raise funds through public issues inthese markets.Many other types of foreign loan facilities are, however, available to otherborrowers. It is known that the Reserve Bank is at present busy negotiating for a syndicated loanwith a group of foreign banking institutions for $1½ billion. Smaller borrowers can, of course,also negotiate loans on a bilateral basis with one of the many foreign banking institutions thatprovide their services in the South African markets.It is fairly easy for reputable and established South African organisations at thisstage to raise foreign funds. Non-residents are no longer affected by the remaining exchangecontrols, and accept the credibility of the South African authorities in their determinationgradually to remove the remaining controls. One major constraint, however, is provided by thevolatility of exchange rates, even amongst the major currencies of the world. It is not only theSouth African rand that showed great volatility over the past year, but also many othercurrencies. The exchange rate between the Deutsche Mark and the US dollar, for example,changed from $1=1.54DM at the beginning of January 1997, to $1=1.79DM today, i.e. a changeof 16.2 per cent. At this stage, the Malaysian ringgit, the Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, thePhilippine peso and the Czech koruna are all under pressure from international currencyspeculators.South African borrowers of foreign funds will therefore most probably prefer tocover foreign borrowings with forward exchange contracts, which will eliminate any costadvantages from lower interest rates in other countries. We nevertheless believe that it is in theinterest of the South African economy to make use of foreign finance where available, as thiswill enable the country to maintain a higher rate of economic development. We are indeedconfident that, if carefully managed, the relaxation of exchange controls for residents will notlead to an overall net outflow of capital from the country. New investments by non-residentsshould continue to exceed the outward investment by residents.BIS Review 69/1997
Ms. Phillips discusses the changing financial landscape and umbrellasupervision in the United States   Remarks by Governor Susan M. Phillips, a member of theBoard of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Exchequer Club in Washington on18/6/97.It is a pleasure to be here today at the Exchequer Club. I thank you for theopportunity to discuss the changing financial landscape and offer my own perspectives on whatthe future might bring. During the next few months, there will be significant debates on variousaspects of financial modernization, both within and without the halls of Congress. These debatesmay well set the stage for how financial service companies will operate as we enter the twenty-first century.As we can all plainly see, the world is changing across many dimensions, posingnew and ever-increasing challenges for both financial services firms and their supervisors. Tosucceed in this new world, I believe it is important for the industry and supervisors to findcommon ground for coping with these challenges. By working together to find solutions, we canboth accomplish our goals, while retaining the core principles and values that have contributedto the industry’s success.So today I would like to discuss briefly the changes underway affecting thefinancial services industry, as well as the individual and collective responses by the industry andsupervisors to those changes. Then lastly, I will offer some thoughts on what the role of anumbrella supervisor might look like in this changing environment for financial services. All ofthese changes must be considered in the context of possible legislative reform.The Changing WorldAs widely noted, dramatic advances in information and telecommunicationtechnologies have allowed banks to develop new and more customized products and services anddeliver them over a broader geographic area with greater efficiency. Such innovations by thebanking industry, and by financial markets in general, have increased the sophistication andcomplexity of bank lending, investing, trading, and funding. They have propelled growth in lesstraditional or newer banking activities such as investment banking, mutual fund management,insurance and securitization. In the process, the risk profiles of many banking organizations havebeen altered in fundamental ways, placing greater pressure on management to monitor andmanage underlying risks.To meet this challenge, a growing number of institutions are employing modernfinancial theory for measuring and analyzing the trade-off between risk and returns. Theavailability of dramatically more powerful computers at ever more affordable prices has allowedinstitutions to process vast data bases of rates, prices, defaults, and recoveries. As a result,techniques for portfolio management and risk measurement that not long ago were possible onlyin theory are now becoming integral parts of daily operating practice. By applying these theoriesand techniques, institutions today are more effectively pricing and hedging risk, allocatingcapital, evaluating risk-adjusted returns and identifying the optimum mix of financial productsor services. I believe these enhanced management practices have contributed importantly to theeconomic growth and market gains seen in recent years.As competition has intensified, we have seen a growing overlap in the activitiesand product lines provided by both banks and other financial service providers that hasdiminished the past distinction between banks and many nonbank firms. That trend has raisedBIS Review   68/1997
- 2 -public policy questions regarding bank powers and the appropriate organizational structurethrough which banking organizations should gain new powers. Proposals recently introduced inCongress to address those issues would fundamentally redefine the relationship of banks to otherfinancial services companies and in some instances their relationship to commercial firms aswell.Banks have not only expanded their products and activities, but have alsoexpanded their geographic reach, both domestically and globally. Within the United States,banks have expanded nationwide as barriers to interstate banking have been removed. Thisexpansion should continue as banks exercise their new power to branch across state lines. Arelated domestic trend is the rapid consolidation within and between banking organizations.Although some consolidation is undoubtedly related to the removal of barriers to interstatebranching, it is also spurred by improved technology, strong competition in banking markets,and the drive by banks to reduce costs.Internationally, the globalization of banking has accelerated, driven by improvedtechnology and the opening of economies in eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and otherregions. In particular, U.S. and other international financial institutions are forging a growingpresence in lending, trading, and underwriting in these emerging markets. These efforts havecreated closer links among the world’s financial markets and have improved the efficiency andavailability of capital. However, market integration has also increased the potential for systemicproblems to transcend national borders, as the volume of international financial transactions hasgrown. Last year, for example, an estimated $1.5 trillion of foreign exchange contracts weresettled daily in New York City alone. A default by a major U.S. or foreign participant in thatmarket could disrupt financial markets worldwide.Competitive pressures are intense to reduce the cost of financial services to thepublic. This is occurring against the need to improve the financial strength and competitivenessof the banking industry from the levels at the beginning of this decade. These factors have, inturn, also placed pressure on the banking agencies to remove unnecessary burdens on theindustry without threatening safety and soundness.Regulatory and Supervisory Responses to ChangeWhat have been the regulatory and supervisory responses to these changes? Letme first discuss how we addressed the issue of regulatory burden. Although the poor bankprofitability of the 1980s and early 1990s was mostly related to industry asset quality problems,regulators and Congress alike recognized that improvements could be made in bank regulationsand in supervisory processes to improve credit availability and bank competitiveness withoutsacrificing safety and soundness.Both legislative and regulatory efforts undertaken in the decade of the 1990’shave simplified regulatory reporting requirements, expedited the application process, eliminatedduplicate regulatory filings, and have led to more streamlined and uniform banking agencyguidelines and regulations. Taken individually, these and other refinements may not appearmaterial, but taken as a whole they have put a meaningful dent in regulatory costs. In fact, theindustry on several occasions has reminded us that it is not necessarily any particular individualregulatory requirement that is problematic, but rather, their cumulative effect, much like thestraw that broke the camel’s back. We have taken that point to heart when considering newguidelines and regulations.BIS Review  68/1997
- 3 -Efforts to reduce regulatory burden apply not only to banks, but to holdingcompanies as well. Earlier this year, for example, the Board streamlined Regulation Y andreduced application requirements. These changes recognize that regulatory burden arises notonly from the direct operational costs of compliance, but also from the indirect costs of delayedor lost opportunities to enter new activities.To reduce impediments, the Board has decided that the application process shouldfocus on the analysis of the effects of a specific proposal, and should not generally become avehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance issues.Rather, the latter can more effectively be addressed in the supervisory process. The Board alsorecently completed a lengthy review of its policies and procedures for assessing the competitiveimplications of bank mergers and acquisitions. Modifications have been made to that process tomake it more efficient and address the potential benefits of scale economies for small bankmergers.Another improvement in our regulations is the ability of well-capitalized, well-run companies to apply to acquire banks and nonbanks in a faster more streamlined fashion andto commence nonbanking activities approved by regulation without obtaining prior approval. Toallow bank holding companies greater opportunities to innovate, the Board has also indicatedthat it will be pro-active in approving new activities.Further efforts to provide flexibility and help modernize bank holding companyregulations have been directed toward securities firms known as section 20 affiliates. Last yearthe Board raised the Section 20 ineligible revenue limit on underwriting and dealing in securitiesfrom 10 to 25 percent. This appears to be allowing greater flexibility for these operations.The Board has also eliminated certain firewalls between banks and their securitiesaffiliates and for other firewalls has proposed to eliminate or scale back even more, recognizingthat other laws, regulations, and improved disclosures provide adequate protections againstconflicts of interest. These and other refinements should allow holding companies to movecloser toward their goal of operating as a one-stop financial service firm for customers, whileoperating safely and soundly.The Comptroller of the Currency has also taken steps to widen the breadth ofactivities undertaken by banking organizations. For example, the expansion of insurance salesactivities has opened new opportunities for national banks.Beyond efforts to reduce burden and modernize banking powers, regulators arealso redesigning their supervisory practices to address more effectively the changing nature ofthe industry. These efforts are leading to a more risk-focused approach to supervision. Thatapproach is more responsive to the industry’s rapidly evolving activities and risk profiles andplaces emphasis on the institution’s own ongoing system for managing risk, rather than point-in-time transaction testing. By focusing resources on the areas of highest risk, and eliminatingunnecessary procedures, this approach is not only more effective, but also less intrusive andcostly to all parties. I should note, however, that successfully implementing this approachrequires that supervisors attract, train, and retain qualified staff while also upgrading training,automation, and other resources. This is a continuing challenge indeed!Regulators are also trying to build on private sector initiatives that promotesafety, soundness and systemic stability. For example, at the height of Congressional concernBIS Review   68/1997
- 4 -about financial derivatives, the Group of Thirty sponsored a study to identify principles of soundpractice for managing risks in derivatives for both dealers and end-users.By providing guidance on this issue, that study served as a catalyst for industryparticipants to analyze and evaluate their own practices. Subsequent guidance from the FederalReserve and the Comptroller benefited from the insights provided by the study, while adding asupervisor’s perspective.The study’s emphasis on education and sound practices spurred greaterunderstanding and acceptance by the industry of supervisory recommendations for sound riskmanagement systems. I think it is safe to say that this cooperative approach between the privatesector and regulators resulted in stronger industry practices and better supervisory oversight, notonly for derivatives, but also for bank risk management more generally. Together, the industryand agency response helped stave off potentially restrictive legislation.Another example of how supervisors are trying to build on bank managementpractices is their use of internal value-at-risk models in the calculation of capital requirementsfor market risk. By relying on internal models already used by the institutions for their tradingand risk management activities, regulators can reduce burden while vastly improving theaccuracy of the capital calculation. In addition, by embracing internal models for regulatorypurposes, supervisors are encouraging organizations to incorporate sophisticated risk modelsmore fully and formally into their risk management systems and to continue to upgrade andimprove the models.As these two examples illustrate, supervisors recognize that they do not have allthe answers and that rigid regulatory solutions may often do more harm than good. Asupervisory approach that promotes continued improvements in private sector practices providesthe right incentives to industry and, in the case of banking, also reduces risks to the federalsafety net.In these ways, supervisors are placing greater reliance on a bank’s own riskmanagement system as the first line of defense for ensuring safety and soundness. We also wantto rely more on market discipline as another line of defense. This requires increased, improveddisclosure of a bank’s activities, risk exposures, and philosophy for managing and controllingrisk. We have made significant gains for derivatives and market risks. Hopefully we will seefurther gains in other areas in the years ahead.While it is important for supervisors to identify risk at individual banks, as thecentral bank the Federal Reserve must also be watchful for conditions and trends external to thebanking system that could place the financial system and the economy at risk. This broaderperspective has become especially important with the globalization of banking and integration ofmarkets. That is why the Federal Reserve has worked closely with financial regulators aroundthe world to reduce systemic risk and promote sound banking practices and improveddisclosures among both developed and emerging countries. These efforts have led to theadvancement by the BIS of core principles of bank supervision for authorities world-wide and,significantly, promotion of consolidated supervision of banking organizations by home countryauthorities. The issue of consolidated supervision is particularly relevant in revisiting thequestion of the modernization of the banking system. I will come to that in a moment.BIS Review  68/1997
- 5 -Financial Modernization and Umbrella SupervisionFirst I would like to point out that whether legislative agreement is reached or not,market forces will continue the modernization of the financial services industry and will furtherblur the lines between banks and nonbanks. For example, we can expect mutual funds to refinetheir offerings to compete with bank checking and savings accounts, albeit without depositinsurance. Banks will undoubtedly make further inroads in mutual fund management andinvestment banking through internal growth and through acquisitions of securities firms.Investment banks may also supplement their services by making commercial loans andparticipating in loan syndications.With such things happening, why do we need a legislative solution? The answer isthat a well thought out proposal addressing the appropriate structure for the industry wouldallow for a more rapid and efficient integration of financial services. Moreover, by clearlydefining the boundaries and structure of financial conglomerates, a well-considered supervisoryprogram could adequately protect banks without undue intrusion to other parts of theconglomerate.Because financial conglomerates generally operate as integrated entities andmanage risks on a global basis across business lines, their true operating structure superimposesa risk management and internal control process that extends across legal-entity-based corporatestructures. In this light, supervision by legal entity can create important supervisory gaps thatmay expose the insured depository institution to unnecessary risk. That is to say, someoneshould look at the risk management of the organization as an organic whole, rather than asseparate pieces that are simply added together. In fact, comprehensive, consolidated supervisionby the home country supervisor is a legal requirement for foreign banks operating in the U.S.Some foreign supervisors are now beginning to question the consolidated supervision of U.S.firms operating in their countries.Now, I suspect some nonbank firms may feel apprehension at having an umbrellasupervisor evaluate their operations. But let me emphasize that such oversight need not be overlyonerous or intrusive. In fact, regulators are probably better prepared than ever before toimplement an umbrella supervisory approach as a result of the supervisory techniques andapproaches I just discussed. By applying risk-focused supervision, and promoting soundpractices, and improved market disclosures, an umbrella supervisor should be able to implementan effective, unintrusive oversight process for conglomerates. Moreover, an umbrella supervisormay be able to provide assurances and information to other regulators and individual supervisorswhich may minimize their need to extend their reviews beyond the legal supervised entity andinto the conglomerate’s other operations, creating duplication and burden.I believe that the umbrella supervisor, whether it is the central bank or anotheragency, should not attempt to duplicate efforts of other regulators. Rather, the umbrellasupervisor should evaluate the financial conglomerate from a more comprehensive perspective,bridging the gap between an organization’s legal structure and its structure for taking andmanaging risk. Similarly, the umbrella supervisor need not attempt to extend bank-like safetyand soundness regulations to nonbank entities. Those standards were never intended to apply tothe nonbank entities of a conglomerate and would insert unnecessary competitive barrierswithout achieving the desired benefits.BIS Review   68/1997
- 6 -How exactly should an umbrella supervisor meet its responsibilities? First byfocusing its supervisory efforts on the adequacy of the risk management and internal controlprocess of the parent company and of the group as a whole, and determining how well thosesystems protect the safety and soundness of affiliated banks. That evaluation could be performedin a manner similar to that of a securities analyst, albeit from a different viewpoint. Thisassessment might involve analysis of public financial statements, rating agencies and Wall Streetanalyst reports, internal management reports, internal and external audit reports, meetings withmanagement, and only limited, if any, on-site inspections of nonbank affiliates. Any visits thatare made could be limited to testing the adequacy of management and operating systems, toprotect the insured depository institution.While various approaches could be taken to address capital adequacy and to avoidthe unnecessary or inappropriate use of double leverage, I believe such approaches should bemeasured against the goal of assuring the safety and soundness of the affiliated banks. Andfinally, the umbrella supervisor should have appropriate enforcement authority, including theauthority to require the sale of the bank in extreme situations.ConclusionIt is clear that the financial services industry is changing and that banking powersmust also change if banks are to remain competitive. The Board has long supported reforms andstrongly urges them today. However, changes such as these carry risks. It is important, therefore,that change be introduced properly through legislative debate and by adopting proper safeguardsto ensure that nonbank activities do not unduly expose banks and taxpayers.The Federal Reserve is mindful of regulatory burden and of the need toaccommodate change. Nevertheless, we also believe that some type of umbrella supervision willbe necessary to protect insured depository institutions and address systemic risk concerns.Whoever plays that role should take a broad perspective in evaluating risks not only to specificdepository institutions but also to the payment system and to the broad financial industry as well.Simply put, I believe that in an economy as complicated and integrated as we have in the UnitedStates, it is important for the nation’s central bank to have a significant role in comprehensivefinancial institution supervision.BIS Review  68/1997
Mr. Davies looks at the tasks of the UK's new Securities and InvestmentsBoard and how it will affect the business community   Speech by the Deputy Governor of theBank of England, Mr. Howard Davies, at the Futures and Options Association InternationalDerivatives Week Conference in London on 4/6/97.Thank you for your invitation. And, particularly, thank you for not withdrawing itwhen you discovered that, rather than having on your platform a benign, soft-centred DeputyGovernor of the Bank of England, you found yourself face to face with the all-seeing,all-regulating head of super-SIB. This may have come as a surprise to you - but nothing like asbig a surprise as it was to me, I can assure you.And I have to say that, in spite of the way I have been presented in some of thenewspapers, muscles rippling beneath a Superman T-shirt, I still feel rather more like Clark Kentin his thick specs, stumbling myopically around the office. I haven’t yet found a phonebox inwhich to get changed.I do not plan, this morning, to talk at length about my new responsibilities, partlyfor the very good reason that I have not had the time to prepare a coherent plan of campaign. ButI might just say a word or two about the new SIB, and the way it will affect your business.I have been quite encouraged, so far, by the market reaction to the proposed newstructure. Warning notes have been sounded, of course, about the need to avoid a lumbering,slow-moving bureaucracy, and the need to ensure that regulation is appropriate for the type ofmarket. I understand those points and, particularly as far as you are concerned, the need todistinguish between professional wholesale markets and the retail sector. There are someinteresting developments in that direction in the US at present, which we shall certainly lookcarefully at as we decide our own new structures.But, overall, I sense that we begin the task with some goodwill in themarketplace. I was particularly interested to see the summary of the views of members of yourAssociation on regulation in the Price Waterhouse report published late last year. That is ahelpful document which we will take into account. I was struck by the importance you attachedto a clear but flexible regulatory environment, which scored highly as a success factor as far asthe London market was concerned. And I took the strong point made about the need for costcontrol, on the one hand, and to provide a framework which facilitates innovation.When it came to structure, your views were divided. But I was encouraged thatthe option of an enlarged SIB incorporating the SROs was the one which received the strongestfavourable response. There was also quite a bit of support for taking banking supervision out ofthe Bank of England. Unfortunately, I cannot readily assess the level of support for the particularoption which the Government have now chosen, since the researchers did not ask you to assessit - which is certainly a tribute to the new Government’s ability to surprise the market.But in these surveys I am always fascinated by the outlying views - the smallminorities who express a contrary opinion. For example, when asked about the most appropriateregulatory structure 2 per cent of those asked said they thought the best option would be toabandon the SIB and the SROs, and the Bank of England, and that regulation should be carriedout directly by the Treasury. I would be very grateful if that 2 per cent of you could stay behindafterwards, assuming they have not been institutionalised since the study was conducted.BIS Review   67/1997
- 2 -The strongest message to emerge, though, was the need for regulators to consultthe market effectively on both structures and on rules. I am certainly prepared to undertake hereand now that we shall do so. We are charged by the Government to produce an over-archingframework pretty quickly, so our discussions with the market will need to start now. But,thereafter, we will consult intensively on the way in which the new structure will affect day today regulation. I give you my firm undertaking on that point.But, as I said, today I am not speaking to you as the Chairman of the SIB. Andyou have asked me, particularly, as Deputy Governor of the Bank to talk about Economic andMonetary Union, and the way it will impact on your business. Let us, therefore, move quicklyon to that point.Whenever I have accepted an invitation to speak about EMU over the last coupleof years, I have done so with the hope that when the day came to speak, the clouds ofuncertainty surrounding the project would have cleared - both in terms of developments amongthe countries committed to going ahead, and in terms of the UK’s position. But my hopes haveso far been confounded, and indeed the events of the last couple of weeks have complicatedmatters even further.This is not the time or place to talk in detail about the Bundesbank’s little localdifficulty with Herr Waigel. And it is too early to assess the consequences for the project of theresults of the French election. But it is clear that new elements of uncertainty have entered thescene, making it harder than ever to forecast the outcome next year.Looking at the markets’ own assessment, our interpretation of movements in theforward FX markets since the autumn is that the markets have become more persuaded that theeuro will begin, but that it will be a broader, and possibly weaker euro. Until last summer theassumption appeared to be that only seven or eight countries would make up the hard core. Inthe last few months the expected future correlation of the deutsche mark/dollar and lira/dollarrates has strengthened, suggesting a stronger market expectation of those currencies being part ofthe first wave. Very recently, a few doubts seem to have emerged about the project itself, thoughit would seem that, according to the market, the most likely outcome remains that a euro of somesort would start on time.I recognise that this is a difficult background against which businesses need toplan. Our own advice, which we have maintained for some time now, is that it is prudent to planon the basis that the euro will begin on 1 January 1999, as set out in the Treaty. As far as theposition of the UK is concerned, the option remains open, the policy remains what the Frenchcall ‘le wait and see’. But the new Chancellor, like the old, has acknowledged that there areconsiderable difficulties to overcome if the UK is to be a first wave member. This is not a tidyposition to be in, perhaps, but against the uncertain background, it nonetheless has a certainpractical appeal.But taking my prudent assumption - that EMU will go ahead - what can we sayabout the impact on the London market in general, and on the futures and options business inparticular? I note with interest that your own assessment is that the best option for the futuresand options business in London would be for EMU to go ahead and for the UK to participate inthe first wave. It is a moot point as to whether the impact on the profits and bonuses ofderivatives traders will be the number one criterion in the minds of Labour MPs when they cometo reach a view on EMU, but I will certainly draw it to their attention if you would like me to doso.BIS Review   67/1997
- 3 -By contrast, you are slightly, though not exaggeratedly pessimistic about businessopportunities in London if EMU goes ahead with the UK a ‘slow track’ country. I regard this asa pessimistic assessment, and will attempt this morning to persuade you that you are wrong.My first point, and perhaps the strongest, is that uncertainty about UKparticipation in EMU has persisted now for a considerable number of years - perhaps indeedsince the late 1970s when the UK government’s response to the original EMU plan wasdistinctly lukewarm. And certainly no British Prime Minister has given an enthusiasticendorsement of the most recent Delors Plan for EMU, at any stage. Yet at the same time,London has remained the dominant futures and options market in Europe, and indeed it hasstrengthened its position in many markets during that time so that, as far as on-exchangebusiness is concerned, London is by far the largest centre in Europe and second only to Chicago.And the central bank survey of OTC derivatives markets in 1995 demonstrated London’sposition as the premier centre for the trading and booking of OTC derivatives with 27 per centof average daily turnover, pushing New York into second place.I do not propose to follow the traditional gambit of Ministerial speakers at tradeconferences, reciting figures far better known to the audience than to the speaker, but the growthof LIFFE, the LME, the IPE and OMLX in recent years has been striking, and the most recentdevelopment is that LIFFE overtook the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to become the world’ssecond largest exchange in the first quarter of this year. So if, as I was taught at StanfordBusiness School, markets are efficient in the sense that they react in advance of events, in thelight of an assessment of probabilities, then they appear not to have been particularly distressedby the prospect that EMU may start without the UK in the first wave. Certainly we have not seenan anticipatory flow of business away from London and towards Continental European markets.We have recently asked ourselves why it is that LIFFE has retained its position inthe three-month euromark contract and the ten-year Bund contract - Europe’s most activelonger-term interest rate contract. And for those of you who like to go home with a reading list,there is an interesting article on the subject of what makes for successful futures contacts in ourlatest Quarterly Bulletin. (I am sure the restaurants and the bars of the West End will be emptytonight as you sit in your hotel rooms poring over it.) Frankfurt has recently started makinginroads into LIFFE’s share of Bund futures business - but the level of activity on LIFFEnonetheless continues to increase.Our assessment is that, in these markets, there is a considerable and long-termadvantage inherent in being the first mover. That helped LIFFE to achieve a very broad andinternational membership, with only 27 per cent of members being UK-based. It has meant thatLondon has an established skill base and good support functions in law and accountancy. Also agood telecommunications system - though fewer of those old telephone boxes, which may be aproblem for me at super-SIB. London also has a strong clearing function and we should notforget the advantage of the English language, which is increasingly the lingua franca of theEuropean Union, and I believe that even some Americans can now speak a kind of pidginversion which allows them to be understood.But EMU will create change. This raises three interesting questions. What will betraded in an EMU environment? How much will be traded? And where will the new instrumentsbe traded? Let me take these points in turn.What will be traded when the euro makes its debut?BIS Review   67/1997
- 4 -Looking first at on-exchange markets, it seems likely that, in EMU, there will beroom for only one three-month euro short-term interest rate futures contract, although the greaterdepth of the new euro market may allow other products at the short end of the yield curve, suchas a one-month euro contract, to co-exist with the three-month benchmark product.In the bond markets, one - and perhaps the most likely outcome - is that aparticular government’s bonds will become the benchmark for the new euro bond market. Wemay all speculate idly on which that country might be. These issues would then anchor the euroyield curve and futures contracts would follow naturally. The greater depth of the new euro bondmarket may well mean that it can support a greater range of futures contracts further along itsyield curve, as is the case now in the US. Five and two-year contracts, which do already exist inthe Bund market, may develop further. The exchanges themselves recognise this point and areseeking to fill in the yield curve in their various markets before the start of EMU.Other national bond markets will be keen to run alongside the main market andfutures contracts on those markets may also exist. But their number will depend on the basket ofdeliverables of the futures contracts and how those baskets are defined. The alternative would befor a group of different countries’ bonds to be traded interchangeably, but that seems an unlikelyoutcome.On the OTC markets, the last 18 months has seen the proliferation of trades basedon changing perceptions of the likelihood of convergence for the traditionally high-yieldingcountries and trades based on the differential yields of French and German government bonds.If I might embark on a regulatory diversion here, just for one moment, we at theBank expect those banks involved in convergence trading to undertake rigorous stress testing oftheir portfolios to assess the market risk they are running on open positions. That testing shouldalso shed light on the potential for changes in their credit risk - for example if an OTC contractis moving further in the money due to a market movement, the bank would become moreexposed to its counter-party. We believe that the credit exposure implications of stress testingshould be taken seriously too and are encouraging banks as best practice to do that. In our viewnot enough institutions do so yet.After EMU, one would expect to see the elimination of exchange rate risknarrowing yield differentials in the bond markets. With exchange rate risk removed and a singlemonetary policy in operation, national bond yields will differ principally because of differentialdefault risks and differences in market liquidity. That should leave default risk more readilymonitorable and more efficiently priced. We should therefore see an enhancement of banks’ andinvestment houses’ credit analysis functions and more trading of credit differentials.My second question was how much will be traded in a post-EMU world?This is not an easy question to answer. Volumes are difficult to predict. On theone hand, EMU may bring about a more stable interest rate environment, as well as eliminatingnational interest rates and exchange rates, reducing the need for hedging mediums and hence forderivative products. On the other hand, increased liquidity in the euro bond markets couldencourage business and we could well see new participants entering the capital and derivativemarkets. My hunch is that the latter possibility is more likely. And that the market for carefullyconstructed derivatives contracts, properly sold to customers with a genuine need for them, willcontinue to expand.BIS Review   67/1997
- 5 -That brings me to my third question, where will the trading be done?I do not think that there is a determinist answer to this question. Nor, certainly,should it be a matter of decision by politicians, central bankers or financial regulators. Certainly,our predisposition is to think that competition will and should determine where business is doneand the outcome will depend on the imagination and effort of the managers and controllers ofthe different markets. There will be lively competition between LIFFE, the DTB and Matif, I amquite sure. And LIFFE do not need me to argue their case for them. I see from the programmethat they are sponsoring the coffee and the tea at this conference. As a regulator it will of coursebe quite impossible for me to accept such lavish and unreasonable hospitality, but the rest of youare welcome to do so.For the moment, LIFFE has a dominant position in short-term interest rate futuresand is the leading contender to capitalise on that position, whether or not the UK elects to joinEMU in the first wave. It has already amended its contract specifications and from March 1999onwards these contracts will settle against the three-month interest rate for euros, a move whichhas been widely welcomed in the industry.The new euro bond market is likely to support a range of futures contracts, as Ihave said, and it is not impossible that more than one identical contract will continue to existpost-EMU, due to arbitrage opportunities, as happens now between the LIFFE’s and the DTB’sBund contract. That will be an interesting competitive arena to watch.As far as OTC derivatives are concerned, there is little reason why London shouldlose its pre-eminent position as a result of EMU. OTC markets by definition have no centralisedtrading platform and their location will depend on, for example, the regulatory environment, theavailability of staff of sufficient quality and in sufficient numbers and the other success factors Idescribed earlier.It is also worth noting that other changes are under way in the markets as well asEMU. The most notable is the advances in technology which have enabled electronic trading tostart to challenge traditional open outcry. In response, open outcry exchanges are looking toautomate and streamline their trading through technology to reduce costs. And it would seemthat the exchange-traded futures industry is coming under some pressure from the OTCderivatives market, which appears to be expanding at a more rapid pace. All of these changeswill run in parallel with the introduction of the euro, and as far as competition is concerned,success in those areas may well dominate the euro factor.But I said earlier that the outcome of these competitive skirmishes cannot besimply determined in advance by an analysis of existing competitive advantages. It will dependon the efforts of the different players and on the extent to which they are well prepared inadvance.Here I found your own survey rather depressing. The assessment was thatrelatively few market participants in London had made serious preparations for EMU, andseemed unsure of how to proceed. Only 6 per cent of brokers and own account traders had madecontingency plans for the introduction of EMU. But this survey was undertaken in April of lastyear, and I am confident that the responses would be different today.Certainly, a lot of work has been done in the London market, co-ordinated andsteered by a team in the Bank, to ensure that London is as well prepared as other EuropeanBIS Review   67/1997
- 6 -centres for EMU. And our assessment now, which I believe is shared by the EMI and theCommission, is that London is as well prepared as most if not all European centres.I can assure you that the Bank of England itself will be ready for EMU on 1January 1999, whether or not the UK is a member. We will be able to offer euro accounts andeuro settlement facilities. We have taken the lead in work on market conventions across Europe.EMU is likely to bring harmonisation of conventions such as day count and frequency of couponpayments among Europe’s bond markets, and the London market is ready to do that.We have been in regular discussion with ISDA which is taking a leading role inco-ordinating preparations of those involved with swaps and other OTC derivatives. And arecent working group chaired by the Bank has examined the adaptations that may be needed inthe gilt market, covering re-denomination of gilts into euro, whether to quote in decimals orfractions, the frequency of coupon payments, etc. There seems a reasonable chance that thedramatic move to abandon 30 seconds as the basis for gilt pricing may come about before toolong. This could be the only unambiguously, incontestably good thing to come out of Economicand Monetary Union.We have also conducted some really exciting discussions on the issue ofrounding - a subject which I find can cause great excitement among accountants and lawyers.And anything which brings excitement to their sad lives should clearly be welcomed by us all.My general conclusion - and I will end here, you will be pleased to know - is thatwhile EMU will significantly affect your markets, it does not negate the usual rules ofcompetition and success. EMU changes the raw material which you work with to generate yourexotic, and sometimes dangerous products. But it does not change the rules of economics, nordoes it alter the dynamics of competition. It closes down some aspects of current financialmarket business, but opens up a big set of new opportunities at the same time. Those who seizethose opportunities will be the most innovative, most cost effective, and most fast moving. Atthe moment, on this side of the Atlantic, most of those people are found in London. I see noreason why they should move.BIS Review   67/1997
Mr. Thiessen looks at the recent economic record in Canada and thechallenges ahead for monetary policy   Notes for remarks by Mr. Gordon Thiessen, Governorof the Bank of Canada, to the New England-Canadian Business Council in Boston, USA, on16/9/97.It has been a little over two years since my last public speech to an audience in theUnited States. During this time, a lot has happened in terms of economic developments in ourtwo countries.One thing that continues to impress me is the remarkable performance of the U.S.economy, which has achieved six years of steady economic expansion, with high rates of jobcreation and low inflation.As a neighbour and major trading partner, Canada has certainly benefited fromthe strong U.S. economy.But I think that what is happening in the United States is relevant to Canada inother ways. First, it offers a yardstick that we Canadians often use to judge the performance ofour own economy. Second, as the unused capacity in the Canadian economy is graduallyabsorbed, monetary policy in Canada will be facing challenges similar to those that the FederalReserve has had to confront in trying to steer the U.S. economy on a path of durable,non-inflationary expansion. The recent U.S. experience in this area is, therefore, particularlyinteresting for us.Today, I would like to discuss the recent economic record in Canada and thechallenges ahead for monetary policy. In doing so, I will emphasize the Bank of Canada’scontinued commitment to explicit targets for keeping inflation low. Along with their otherbenefits, these targets help anchor market expectations about future movements in the exchangerate. The role of the exchange rate in the operation of Canadian monetary policy is another topicI will discuss today.The recent economic record in CanadaLet us first take a quick look at how the Canadian economy has performed in therecent past, in comparative terms.In terms of economic growth and job creation, there is no doubt that Canada hasnot done as well as the United States in the 1990s. And even though, in my view, there are goodexplanations for this, the fact remains that Canada has some catching up to do in this regard.Why has the growth in output and employment been more modest in Canada thanin the United States in recent years?I believe that the reasons lie in the major transformation that the Canadianeconomy has been going through since the beginning of this decade. This transformation hasbeen in response both to the universal forces of globalization and technological change, and tothe need to unwind the domestic excesses and imbalances that had built up in the 1970s and the1980s. Let me remind you that, through that period, high actual and expected inflation had led toescalating production costs, speculative activity, and the accumulation of debt by households, bybusinesses, and by Canadian governments. Our foreign indebtedness was also rising rapidly, asBIS Review   84/1997
- 2 -were the risk premiums in our interest rates, leaving us in a very vulnerable position indeed. Bythe late 1980s, the situation had become untenable. Canada had to adjust.Of course, the United States also had to cope with many of these changes. Whyhas the restructuring been more intense and disruptive in Canada? In my view, the mostimportant reasons are that the distortions arising from high inflation were more severe in Canadaand that the adjustments to globalization and technological change were slow in coming. As aresult, Canada had to do more and do it faster.The short-run disruptions associated with the economic restructuring have beensignificant. Plant closings, cutbacks in major government programs, and layoffs in both theprivate and public sectors caused a great deal of uncertainty among Canadian households. And itdid not help that interest rates rose sharply in 1994 and early 1995 as investor nervousness aboutCanada’s fiscal and political situation increased in the wake of turbulence in global financialmarkets. All of this left Canadians anxious about the future and cautious about spending, whichacted as a drag on output and employment.But there have also been some particularly encouraging results from therestructuring. Canada has made rather dramatic economic adjustments in recent years, and as aresult has emerged with a much sounder economic foundation. Inflation has averaged just under2 per cent during the past five and a half years -- well below that in the United States. With thebenefit of low inflation and low interest rates, Canadian businesses have been investing in newtechnology and streamlining their operations to become more efficient, productive, andinternationally competitive. Canadian governments have taken steps to reduce their deficits andto move towards less vulnerable debt positions. And, with our success in exporting and theseimproved fiscal positions, the persistent large shortfall in the current account of our internationalbalance of payments has narrowed markedly.These improvements in Canada’s economic fundamentals have not been lost onfinancial markets. They are the reason why risk premiums demanded by investors on Canadiandollar assets have declined sharply over the past two years. They are also the reason why themarkets today see a potential for upward movement in the Canadian dollar over time, thusallowing interest rates on maturities up to 30 years to remain below comparable U.S. rates. Thisis a view of the Canadian dollar that we at the Bank of Canada share.These low Canadian interest rates represent a substantial stimulus to domesticspending. Because of the lags involved, it has taken households and businesses some time torespond. But now we have strong evidence, particularly from the interest-rate-sensitive sectorsof the economy, that the consumer is back. And businesses continue to increase their capitalspending. Moreover, the latest surveys of consumer and business confidence point to continuedexpansion in domestic spending in coming months. What is particularly heartening is that totalemployment growth has picked up recently, despite the cutbacks in the public sector, and thatthe number of full-time jobs has increased significantly.Altogether, it seems to me that the Canadian economy has the potential for a longperiod of sustained growth in output and employment, with rising productivity and improvingliving standards.The challenge aheadWhat does monetary policy need to do to help realize this potential?BIS Review   84/1997
- 3 -With the economy gathering momentum, the challenge for monetary policy in theperiod ahead will be to encourage monetary conditions that preserve Canada’s good inflationperformance, because low inflation is a prerequisite for a durable economic expansion.Experience has taught us that monetary stimulus which pushes too hard on theeconomy’s capacity limits for too long inevitably leads to rising inflation and painful boom andbust economic cycles of the kind we suffered in Canada from the 1970s to the early 1990s.Concern about inflation risks at this stage may seem misplaced. But monetarypolicy actions have their full effects on the economy with relatively long lags. So what we mustbe concerned with is not the current rate of inflation but rather what may happen in 1998 andbeyond.To maintain a low and stable rate of inflation in the period ahead, we mustconduct monetary policy in a forward-looking, pre-emptive manner. This means that we shouldbe ready to take action early to ensure that, as slack is absorbed, the pace of economic activityconverges smoothly with the path implied by potential output -- that is, the economy’s capacityto produce on a sustained basis.It is our view that the Canadian economy should indeed absorb the existingunused capacity over the course of the next couple of years. Thus, there will be a need to moveto less-stimulative monetary conditions in the period ahead. Taking timely, measured steps inthat direction is the recipe for avoiding the more substantial, and potentially more disruptive,tightening that would be required later if monetary policy actions were unduly delayed.As the Canadian economy approaches full capacity, we will have to contend withthe considerable uncertainty that surrounds the estimation of potential output. The recentexperience in the United States, where despite a high level of resource utilization there has beenno sign yet of generalized inflationary pressures, raises the possibility that past relationshipshave been altered by structural changes at both the national and international levels. It is possiblethat technological innovations have increased the flexibility and efficiency of productionprocesses. Heightened global competition and low inflation worldwide may have led to areduction of inflation expectations and to a change in price- and wage-setting behaviour.Monetary policy must somehow find a way to take all of these factors intoconsideration in order to avoid systematic misjudgements on potential output and the risk ofinflation. I believe that Canada’s inflation-control target provides a useful framework withinwhich to do that. Let me explain.Our target, set jointly with the Government of Canada, calls for inflation to beheld within a range of 1 to 3 per cent. One attraction of an explicit inflation-control target is thatit allows a ready assessment of macroeconomic performance by looking at the trend of theinflation rate relative to the target range. If it looks as though the trend of inflation will pushthrough the top of the target range, this implies that demand in the economy has beenunsustainably strong. Conversely, if it appears that the trend of inflation is about to fall throughthe bottom of the range, this suggests weak demand and a persistent margin of unused capacity.Moreover, if we somehow continually misjudge the economy’s capacity toproduce, we will in all likelihood witness an unexpected trend in the inflation rate. For example,if the rate is persistently lower than would have been expected in the past at the current levels ofaggregate demand, and it is tending to press the bottom of the target range, chances are that theBIS Review   84/1997
- 4 -economy has more room to absorb higher levels of demand than previously thought. Thus, thetargets provide a check on systematic errors in estimating potential output.However, if monetary policy is going to take account of such signals, the centralbank had better make sure that its inflation-control strategy is a credible one. Why? Becauseonly if it is widely accepted that the central bank will keep inflation under control, willbusinesses and individuals not respond immediately to signs of strong demand pressures byseeking to raise prices and wages. The recent U.S. experience attests to this. Indeed, strongcredibility has been a key factor that has enabled the Fed to take account of the possible changesin economic structure that I mentioned earlier and to steer the U.S. economy successfullytowards levels of aggregate demand and employment that in the past would have been thoughtincompatible with maintaining low inflation.It is by conducting monetary policy prudently during the economic upswing thatwe at the Bank of Canada will have the credibility needed when our economy begins to operateat levels that test its potential to produce.The role of the exchange rateI would now like to take a moment to underscore the important role that theexchange rate plays in the conduct of Canadian monetary policy and to explain what I meantearlier when I used the term “monetary conditions”.In a medium-sized, open economy, like Canada’s, a good deal of the impact ofmonetary policy actions is channelled through the exchange rate. But because financial marketsdo not always respond to events in completely predictable ways, we do not know exactly howinterest rates and the exchange rate will move and interact. That is why we at the Bank havefound it useful to construct an index of monetary conditions to help us keep track of thecombined effect of these two variables on aggregate demand in Canada.To understand how we use monetary conditions in practice, let us look at therecent situation where cyclical differences have meant that the Canadian economy has beenweaker than the U.S. economy. In these circumstances, the need for accommodative monetaryconditions in Canada required the Bank of Canada to take action to lower interest rates. But themagnitude and timing of those interest rate reductions depended, to an important degree, on theexchange rate response. With the Canadian dollar roughly stable between late 1995 and late1996, the easing in monetary conditions could take place through measured declines in interestrates. The strengthening Canadian dollar through the latter part of 1996 accelerated the declinein interest rates, as the Bank of Canada sought to maintain the degree of monetary ease achievedin the autumn of 1996. With the economy gathering momentum since then, persistent weaknessin the Canadian dollar through June 1997 prompted a small increase in interest rates in order tooffset an undesired further easing in monetary conditions.I might add that, since cyclical differences have required interest rates in Canadato be below those in the United States, there has been -- rightly -- a strong market perceptionthat the relative weakness of the Canadian dollar is temporary and that a future appreciation willcompensate investors for the lower yields on Canadian dollar assets. But experience has taughtus that this process of exchange rate/interest rate interaction works well only if there are noconcerns in the markets about Canadian economic policies. As we found out in 1994-95, whenthere were concerns about fiscal policy, a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar canBIS Review   84/1997
- 5 -generate a loss of confidence and expectations of further depreciation of the currency, not ofsubsequent appreciation.The upshot of all this is that, with a floating currency, market participants need aconsistent and credible policy framework to help anchor their expectations about futuremovements in the exchange rate. Such a framework rests, above all, on a firm undertaking bythe authorities to preserve the domestic purchasing value of the currency. I believe that ourinflation-control targets, by giving a clear, precise view of this commitment, provide a strongunderpinning for the external value of the Canadian dollar.What is my main message to you today?Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face theeconomic challenges of the future and to reap the benefits of changing technology and anincreasingly integrated world economy. But, for this scenario to unfold, there will have to becontinued commitment by the authorities to prudent, credible economic policies. As far asmonetary policy goes, this means a pledge to maintain Canada’s good inflation performance.That is a pledge I can give without reservation.BIS Review   84/1997
Mr. Greenspan comments on the importance of technological developmentand the value of education for economic growth in the United States   Remarks by theChairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Building DedicationI welcome the opportunity to join Dean Fulton, President Broad, PresidentEmeritus Spangler, Chancellor Hooker, Hugh McColl, and the many other distinguished guestson the podium today. It isn’t every day that we have the opportunity to dedicate a new buildingdevoted to the research and training that our young people need for conducting business in aglobal setting. This new facility -- the McColl Bulding -- has been equipped with state-of-the-artinformation technology that will enhance the ability of the faculty and students of Kenan-Flaglerto prepare for an exciting future in our global economy.The University has made this important commitment at a time when ourbusinesses and workers are confronting a dynamic set of forces that will influence our nation’sability to compete worldwide in the years ahead. One of the most central of these forces is therapid acceleration of computer and telecommunications technologies, which can be reasonablyexpected to appreciably raise our standard of living in the twenty-first century. In the short run,however, the fallout from rapidly changing technology is an environment in which the stock ofplant and equipment with which most managers and workers interact is turning over increasinglyrapidly, rendering a perception that human skills are becoming obsolete at a rate perhapsunprecedented in American history. I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon inthe context of the broader changes in our economy and, hopefully, explain why the value ofeducation, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.Wealth has always been created, virtually by definition, when individuals usetheir growing knowledge to interact with an expanding capital stock to produce goods andservices of value. Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identifythe types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placedon products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered inshorter time frames, or improved in quality.This striving to unbundle the particular characteristics of goods and services inorder to maximize their value to each individual inevitably results in the shift toward valuecreated through the exploitation of ideas and concepts, rather than simply the utilization ofphysical resources and manual labor. Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part ofthe growth in America’s real gross domestic product reflects increased physical productmeasured in bulk or weight. Most of our gains have been the result of new insights into how torearrange physical reality to achieve ever-higher standards of living. We have dramaticallyreduced the physical bulk of our radios, for example, by substituting transistors for vacuumtubes. New architectural, engineering, and materials technologies have enabled the constructionof buildings with the same space, but far less physical material, than was required 50 or 100years ago. Most recently, mobile phones have been significantly downsized as they have beenimproved.The increasing importance of new insights has, of course, raised the value ofinformation creation and transfer in boosting standards of living. Thus, it should be no surprisethat new computer and telecommunications products have been accorded particularly high valueby consumers and business and, hence, why companies that successfully innovate in this fieldexhibit particularly high stock market values.BIS Review   83/1997
- 2 -Breakthroughs in all areas of technology are continually adding to the growinglist of almost wholly conceptual elements in our economic output. These developments areaffecting how we produce output and are demanding greater specialized knowledge.The use, for example, of computer-assisted design instruments, machine tools,and inventory control systems has given our former, more rigid factory assembly lines greaterflexibility. Businesses now can more quickly customize their production to changes in marketconditions; design cycles are shorter, quality control has been improved, and costs are lower.Offices are now routinely outfitted with high-speed information-processing technology.The accelerated pace of technological advance has also interacted with the rapidrise in financial innovation, with the result that business services and financial transactions noware transmitted almost instantaneously across global networks. Financial instruments havebecome increasingly diverse, the products more customized, and the markets more intenselycompetitive. Our nation’s financial institutions, in turn, are endeavoring to find more effectiveand efficient ways to deliver their services.In this environment, America’s prospects for economic growth will greatlydepend on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology -- a quest that inevitably willentail some risk-taking. One lesson we have clearly learned is that we never can predict with anyprecision which particular technology or synergies of technologies will add significantly to ourknowledge and ability to gain from that knowledge. Moreover, America’s ability to remain inthe forefront of new ideas and products has become ever more difficult because of the rapidinternational diffusion of technology. Nonetheless, to date, we have not fallen behind inconverting scientific and technological breakthroughs into viable commercial products.But, to be fully effective in realizing the gains from technological advance willrequire a considerable amount of human investment on the part of managers and workers whohave to implement new processes and who must be prepared to adapt, over their lifetimes, to theongoing change that innovations bring.Clearly our educational institutions will continue to play an important role inpreparing workers. While we all are concerned about the performance of American elementaryand secondary schools compared with those in other developed countries, there is little questionabout the quality of our university system, which for decades has attracted growing numbers ofstudents from abroad. However, the notion that formal degree programs at any level can becrafted to fully support the requirements of one’s lifework is being challenged.A great deal of innovation and development has been occurring in the businesssector where firms are striving to stay on the cutting edge, in an environment where productsand knowledge rapidly become obsolete. Education, as a result, is increasingly becoming alifelong activity; businesses are now looking for employees who are prepared to continuelearning, and workers and managers in many kinds of pursuits had better look forward topersistent hard work acquiring and maintaining the skills needed to cope with a dynamicallyevolving economy.The recognition that more productive workers and learning go hand-in-hand isbecoming ever more visible in both schools and in the workplace. Linkages between businessand education should be encouraged at all levels of our education system. Your business schoolis an excellent example of how our educational institutions are building bridges to the privatesector that will have payoffs in how well graduates are prepared to meet the challenges of anBIS Review   83/1997
- 3 -increasingly knowledge-based global economy. The growth of high-tech industry here in theResearch Triangle, as well as in Silicon Valley and Boston -- all areas rich in educational andresearch institutions -- is no accident.In the private sector, a number of major corporations have invested in their owninternal training centers -- so-called corporate universities. Some labor unions have done thesame. More broadly, recent surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the provisionof formal education on the job has risen markedly in recent years. By 1995, 70 percent ofworkers in establishments with 50 or more employees had received some formal training duringthe twelve months preceding the survey. The incidence of training was relatively high across agegroups and educational attainment. Most often this training was conducted in-house by companypersonnel, but larger firms also relied importantly on educational institutions.At the same time, we must be alert to the need to improve the skills and earningpower of those who appear to be falling behind. In the long run, better child-rearing and betterbasic education at the elementary and secondary school level are essential to providing thefoundation for a lifetime of learning. But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies toovercome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skillsof workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.The advent of the twenty-first century will certainly not bring an end to thechallenges we are facing in a rapidly changing world. Americans will surely adjust to a freneticpace of change, as we have in the past, but we must recognize that adjustment is not automatic.All shifts in the structure of the economy naturally create frictions and human stress, at leasttemporarily. As those frictions dissipate, however, I have no doubt that the economy will emergehealthier. And, if we are able to boost our investment in people, ideas, and processes as well asmachines, the economy can operate more effectively as it adapts to change. This holds thepotential to create an even greater payoff of a broadly based rise in living standards over thelonger run. Your new Kenan-Flagler facility will enhance this University’s ability to meet thechallenge.BIS Review   83/1997
BIS Review   82/1997Mr. Matsushita reports on a new framework of monetary policy under thenew Bank of Japan Law   Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. YasuoMatsushita, to the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo on 27/6/97.I.  IntroductionAs you are all aware, the Diet passed the new Bank of Japan Law on June 11,which will come into effect on April 1, 1998.It has been the perennial wish of the Bank of Japan to revise the current Bank ofJapan Law, which was legislated during World War II, to accommodate the significant changesthat have occurred in the economic and financial environment and to make the Law able towithstand future changes in the environment.  Revision of the Law was also indispensable forrebuilding the entire Japanese financial system so as to meet global standards.  This revisionbuilt on the two principles of independence and transparency is thus a notable step in the 115years of the Bank’s history and also for reforming the financial system of Japan.The Bank of Japan Law holds great significance as one of the basic lawsgoverning Japan’s economic and financial activities.  Looking back, this important revision wasachieved in approximately one year from the start of discussions in spring 1996 owing to thesupport and efforts of many people, including Prime Minister Hashimoto, Finance MinisterMitsuzuka, and other government officials, members of parliament, and members of theAdvisory Group on the Central Bank (an advisory panel to the Prime Minister) and the FinancialSystem Research Council (an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance).  Many words ofencouragement as well as criticism were heard from the financial and business circles and thegeneral public, including perhaps some of you who are here today.  I would like to take thisopportunity to express, on behalf of the Bank, our heartfelt gratitude to all.Naturally, the reform of the Bank of Japan is not consummated merely by therevision of the Law.  We at the Bank of Japan believe it essential that we continue our efforts toconduct appropriate policy and operational management, cognizant of the responsibilitiesentrusted to us by the people.  We are determined to promote, in line with the aim of the revisionof the Law, wide-ranging reforms to further improve the transparency of policy managementand the efficiency of the Bank’s operational management.Today, I would first like to discuss recent monetary and economic conditions andthe Bank’s current monetary policy management.  I will then explain the new framework ofmonetary policy under the new Law and how the Bank intends to manage monetary policy.II.Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy ManagementA.        Recent economic and price developments and monetary policy managementI would like to start with the recent domestic economic condition.Japan’s economy is currently at a phase in which the downward pressures offiscal tightening appear strongest, with personal consumption and housing investment decliningin reaction to the stepped-up demand before the consumption tax rate was raised.  However, inview of the firm developments in production and improvements in corporate profits andhousehold income, the Bank judges that the economy continues to follow a moderate recovery
- 2 -BIS Review   82/1997trend.  The results of the June Tankan—Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,which were released two days ago, for the most part confirmed this view.The question is whether the virtuous circle of demand, production, and income,which has been developing steadily, will keep its momentum and whether, as a result, theeconomy will gain further momentum for a self-sustained recovery despite the downwardpressures of fiscal tightening.  The key to this will be developments in business fixed investmentand personal consumption, which, according to the Tankan results and other indicators, can beanalyzed as follows.Firms’ projections of revenues and profits and their plans for fixed investmentindicate that recovery in business conditions will remain moderate for smaller firms, especiallyfor those in the non-manufacturing sector.  However, for firms as a whole, revenues and profitscontinue to be on an upward trend, especially for major firms, supported by increasing exportsand buoyant demand for information technology-related goods and services.  Fixed investmentplans are also being revised upward.  If this trend continues, the recovery in business conditionscan be expected to spread to smaller firms.Employment and income are showing moderate but steady improvement, andbonus payments in summer 1997 are likely to enjoy a sizable rise.  While personal consumptionwill inevitably be affected by the rise in the consumption tax rate and by the discontinuation ofthe special tax reduction, it is unlikely that the trend of recovery will be hampered consideringthe improvements in the income environment.Thus, the virtuous circle, generated by a recovery in private demand, is still atwork.  The Bank is, therefore, of the view that the current slowdown in demand will only betemporary and that it is likely that the economic recovery will continue.  It is, however,necessary to continue to monitor closely consumer behavior and business activity.Prices remained virtually unchanged in April and May after the immediate effectsof the rise in the consumption tax rate are discounted.  The Bank will continue to monitor pricedevelopments closely, but expects prices to remain stable for some time, reflecting the recentappreciation of the yen and stabilized crude oil prices.In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank will continue to monitoreconomic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundations ofthe economic recovery.B.  The thinking behind the Bank’s easy stance of monetary policyI have heard various questions and criticisms with regard to the easy stance ofmonetary policy, which the Bank has continued with a view to strengthening the foundations ofthe economic recovery.  Therefore, I would next like to share with you the thinking behind thecurrent stance of monetary policy.First, there is the question of why the Bank has not changed its policy stancesince 1995, when it lowered the official discount rate to 0.5 percent, despite a gradual recoveryof the economy.Indeed, compared to 1995, concern about a deflationary spiral has subsided andeconomic activity has improved significantly.  The purpose of the drastic monetary easing
- 3 -BIS Review   82/1997measures was to prevent an occurrence of a deflationary spiral, to strengthen the confidence offirms and households in the economic outlook, and to thereby place the Japanese economy on apath of self-sustained recovery.As you are aware, the Japanese economy is faced with the medium to long-termchallenges of overcoming the after-effects of the bursting of the economic “bubble” andreforming its industrial structure.  The economy has therefore had to achieve a recovery whileaddressing these weighty challenges.  Further, since the latter half of 1996, measures for fiscalconsolidation have been implemented, including a reducing of public-sector investment and araising of the consumption tax rate.  In order for the economy to attain noninflationary,sustainable growth under such circumstances, the forces of the self-sustained recovery achievedin the private sector need to be further strengthened.  It is therefore the Bank’s judgment that, atthis point, it is necessary to monitor economic developments carefully bearing this in mind.Second, there has been criticism that, from the viewpoint of income distribution,the current low interest rates are putting the general public at a disadvantage.  The Bank is fullyaware of the difficult situation faced by those households which depend heavily on interestincome.  However, various types of income, whether it be wages, interest, or pensions, aredistributed from the total output produced by economic activity.  Therefore, without growth ofthe total output, sources of such income will not be generated.  If the policy interest rate is raisedbefore economic activity is sufficiently revitalized and, as a result, the economy is adverselyaffected, long-term interest rates may actually decline.  It will then be difficult to say how theaverage level of short and long-term deposit interest rates will be affected.  What I wish toemphasize is that in order for the overall level of interest rates to rise, there must have been therequisite improvement in the economic activity.Third, there have been concerns that low interest rates may encourage an outflowof domestic funds.  In discussing this point, it must be remembered that the relationship betweencross-border interest rate differentials and capital flows under the present floating exchange ratesystem differs from that under the fixed exchange rate system.Under the latter, there is no foreign exchange risk.  Therefore, funds tend to flowto economies with higher interest rates.  This is precisely why, under that system, strictregulation of capital flows was necessary.Under the floating exchange rate system, however, such capital flows do notnecessarily occur.  Even if one attempts to profit from a differential between domestic andoverseas interest rates, the profit can be wiped out instantly with even a slight shift in theexchange rate.  For example, if overseas interest rates rise, widening interest rate differentials,capital outflows may initially occur, causing the foreign currency to appreciate and the domesticcurrency to depreciate.  After some time, however, expectations will emerge that the value of theforeign currency will start to decline.  At that point, the benefits of investing in the foreigncurrency will have decreased significantly.  Thus, when foreign exchange risk is taken intoconsideration, a situation in which the expected rate of return on foreign currency investment issubstantially higher than that on domestic investment cannot be sustained.Under the floating exchange rate system, therefore, exchange rate fluctuationswill apply the brakes to any one-sided capital flow.  The long-term interest rate differentialbetween Japan and the United States has been around 2 to 4 percent in recent years, and haswidened in this time.  It is true that during this time investment in foreign bonds has increased.
- 4 -BIS Review   82/1997Yet this has not depleted funds in Japan or caused domestic interest rates to remain at a highlevel.With global capital flows as active as they are today, the mechanism of thefloating exchange rate system will function only more expeditiously.  In other words, the speedof market adjustments has accelerated.  What is critical in these circumstances is the occurrenceof a capital flight, which may be triggered by a loss of market confidence in a country’seconomic policy management resulting from an inflation or recession in that country.  In orderto prevent this from occurring in Japan today, it is essential to strengthen the foundations of theeconomic recovery and to achieve noninflationary, sustainable growth.In this connection, some argue that the revision of the Foreign Exchange andForeign Trade Control Law, together with the low interest rates, may accelerate capital outflow.The Bank intends to monitor carefully the effects of the revision on the markets.  However, as Ihave just explained, the Bank believes that there is little possibility of a disruptive capitaloutflow occurring simply as a result of the interest rate differentials between Japan and abroad.Rather, a more serious problem to consider would be the emergence of a “transaction flight.”Should market participants decide for certain reasons that overseas markets are more attractiveand beneficial to the conducting of transactions, even financial and capital transactions betweenresidents, which have conventionally been conducted in Japan—for example, securitiestransactions between domestic firms and households—may shift overseas.  Although this willnot induce an outflow of capital, transactions will be carried out abroad and the subsequentbusiness opportunities will be transferred overseas.  Should this trend continue, it might lead to ahollowing out of Japan’s financial markets.  This is why the “Big Bang” deregulation packagemust be implemented apace with the revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign TradeControl Law, to enhance the attractiveness of domestic financial markets and services.III.  The New Framework of Monetary Policy under the New Bank of Japan LawTo summarize what I have said so far, the Bank of Japan is managing monetarypolicy with a view to placing the Japanese economy on a path of noninflationary, sustainablegrowth.While this has always been the objective of monetary policy under the currentBank of Japan Law, it is stipulated more explicitly by the new Law, which will come into effecton April 1, 1998.  Various revisions have also been incorporated in the new Law to ensure theachievement of this objective.  I would, therefore, like to discuss the new framework ofmonetary policy under the new Bank of Japan Law and how we intend to make use of the newframework, firstly with regard to the objectives, secondly the instruments, and finally themanagement of monetary policy, including the decision-making procedures.A.  Monetary Policy Objectives1.  Price stabilityI would first like to discuss the objectives of monetary policy.The new Bank of Japan Law stipulates that the objective of monetary policy is “tocontribute to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of pricestability.”  The sound development of the national economy is a common objective of alleconomic policies.  As the objective of monetary policy is to contribute to the achievement of
- 5 -BIS Review   82/1997this ultimate objective through price stability, its direct objective will be to ensure price stability.Price stability, together with the stability of the financial system, is a precondition for money tosmoothly perform its intrinsic functions.  As the issuer and controller of money, maintenance ofprice stability is an inherent role of the central bank.It is, however, not easy to define price stability.  There are diverse types of priceindicators: for example, the Consumer Price Index, Wholesale Price Indexes, and the GDPdeflator.  Each of these has its limitation, such as the range of items covered or the timing ofrelease.  Further, many studies have been conducted more recently on the possibility that theseindicators offer a substantially biased measurement of prices.  Even with a perfectly reliableprice indicator, there will still be disparate views regarding what specific percentage of priceincreases would be acceptable.Thus, it is difficult to define specifically what is meant by price stability.  We atthe Bank will continue to study this issue, including the interpretation of price indices.  Itbecomes clearer, however, if the matter is considered from the viewpoint of the implications ofprice stability for economic activity.“Prices”, sometimes referred to as “prices in general”, are the average level of theprices of individual goods and services, and serve as a tool to measure the relative rise or fall inthe price of individual goods and services.  Therefore, if prices in general were to fluctuatesignificantly, firms and households would not be able to conduct efficient investment andconsumption activity.For example, in an inflationary economy, even if the price of a firm’s productrises, the firm will not be able to judge whether this will bring about increased earnings in thefuture, or whether it merely reflects a rise in prices in general with the price increase being offsetby an increase in wages and cost of raw materials.  In such an economy, firms will, in the longterm, inevitably become cautious with their investments.  Furthermore, when there are concernsabout inflation, people will tend to curtail their spending.  The same situation may arise in thecase of a deflationary economy.  One possible example was the Japanese economy in 1995,when there were concerns about a deflationary spiral.This line of thinking leads to the conclusion that ensuring price stability meansmaintaining a situation in which firms and households need not be concerned about a continuingrise or fall in prices in the future when planning their investment and consumption.2.  The relationship between price stability and the economyHaving defined price stability, there may still be questions about the relationshipbetween price stability and other important policy objectives or economic variables.  Forexample, should we not care about the economy and economic growth as long as prices remainstable?  What is the relationship between prices and foreign exchange rates or asset prices?First, with regard to the relationship between prices and the economy, it is truethat in the short term, it seems as if higher economic growth could be realized if a certain levelof price increase were allowed.  However, it has recently been proved both theoretically andempirically that this effect will only be temporary.If such a process is repeated, the economy may well fall into an intractablesituation of stagflation, in which the economy falls back into a recession but high inflation
- 6 -BIS Review   82/1997remains.  This was the economic disease that plagued the industrialized countries of Europe andthe United States from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.  In the light of that experience, there isa common understanding today that price stability is a precondition for sustainable economicgrowth.Second, how are foreign exchange rates and asset prices to be considered in thecontext of monetary policy management?  They are important factors that require due attention.However, if their stability is made a direct objective of monetary policy, the stability of thedomestic economy and of prices in general may be undermined.  This is because land prices andexchange rates reflect certain factors which prices in general do not.  Specifically, land pricesincorporate changes in the productivity of land and in the expected rate of return.  Exchangerates, in the long term, are adjusted by the market mechanism in accordance with thedifferentials between domestic and overseas inflation rates, or in other words, changes in thepurchasing power parities.  Any attempt to control such factors forcibly through macroeconomicpolicies will most likely cause distortions in other sectors of the economy.Needless to say, fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices will affect theeconomy in various ways.  It has been a valuable lesson of the bubble economy that significantfluctuations in asset prices may be a sign of some irregularities in economic activity or excessiveexpectations of economic entities.  Therefore, while it would not be appropriate to attempt anyrigid control of asset prices and exchange rates, the Bank will pay due attention to developmentsin them in managing monetary policy aimed at achieving the objective of price stability.B.  Monetary policy instrumentsLet me next discuss the instruments of monetary policy under the new Bank ofJapan Law.Economic textbooks often refer to (1) the official discount rate, (2) open marketoperations, and (3) reserve requirements as the three major monetary policy instruments.  Theseare in fact the means with which the Bank of Japan implements monetary policy, and this willremain unchanged under the new Law.  The revised Law, however, incorporates the followingchanges.First, the new Law explicitly stipulates that “guidelines for money market controlthrough various measures such as buying and selling of bills or bonds”—that is, the Bank’s basicpolicy for open market operations, or in other words, the Bank’s policy for the guiding of moneymarket rates—are to be decided by the Bank of Japan’s Policy Board, while in the current Law,there is no explicit stipulation concerning such policy.Second, while the current Law stipulates that determination and altering ofreserve requirements must be approved by the Minister of Finance, the new Law abolishes thisapproval system.With these changes, all three instruments of monetary policy—including officialdiscount rate policy, which is already stipulated by the current Law as a matter for decision bythe Policy Board——will be spelt out explicitly as matters to be decided by the Policy Board.Reserve requirements have been altered less frequently as the means of openmarket operations developed.  I would therefore like to discuss in detail the historicalbackground and the Bank’s view of official discount rate changes and of the guiding of money
- 7 -BIS Review   82/1997market rates, with emphasis on how the Bank will utilize these two means of implementingmonetary policy.1.  Relationship between official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market ratesFor many years, monetary policy was in most cases implemented in Japan bychanging the official discount rate.  This was because the financial markets were not sufficientlydeveloped and, under these circumstances, deposit interest rates and lending rates were linked tothe official discount rate.The situation changed gradually from the 1980s.  The financial markets began togrow both in quality and quantity, with massive issuance of government securities andintroduction of new financial instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercialpaper (CP).  As a result, interest rates started to fluctuate freely reflecting the supply anddemand conditions for funds, and accordingly, an environment was established in which theeffects of monetary policy would permeate via market interest rates.In response to such changes in the financial markets, the Bank has devisedvarious changes to its monetary policy management.  For example, in the buying and selling ofbills and bonds, the Bank abolished the system of conducting operations at the rate quoted by theBank, and adopted a more transparent bidding system.  The Bank also improved the efficiencyof its market operations by shortening the lag between the announcement of operations and thesettlement of funds.  In 1991, the Bank abolished window guidance, a method in which the Bankgave direct guidance to financial institutions regarding the amount by which they increased theirlendings, and provided for an environment in which the functions of interest rates could be usedto influence the behavior of financial institutions.In addition, in 1994, deregulation of deposit interest rates was completed.  Thismeant that the official discount rate no longer performed the role of directly bringing changes todeposit interest rates and lending rates, and instead, the significance of the guiding of moneymarket rates increased.Consequently, on March 31, 1995, the Bank introduced a new system to utilizethe guiding of money market rates as a means of monetary policy which is, by itself, assignificant as the official discount rate.  This is a system whereby the Bank publicly announcesits policy for market operations after it has been approved by the Policy Board.  The policy isstated with regard to the guiding level of overnight call money rates, the Bank’s target rate inmarket operations.  For example, the Bank might state that it “expects that the call money ratewill remain on average slightly below the official discount rate.”While this method of monetary policy implementation had already taken root inthe United States, it was the first attempt for Japan back in March 1995.  At the time of this firstattempt, it so happened that Germany had lowered its official discount rate a day earlier, and itcannot be denied that the market could not quite understand and assimilate the Bank’s policyintention.  The Bank’s use of the guiding of money market rates, however, has gradually gainedunderstanding and has taken root in Japan as well.  In fact, when the Bank encouraged a declinein the market rates on July 7, 1995, the policy intent permeated smoothly through the marketwithout causing any confusion.
- 8 -BIS Review   82/1997The provision of the new Law stating that the policy for the guiding of moneymarket rates be determined by the Policy Board reinforces the recent emphasis placed by theBank on the market mechanism.What significance, then, will the official discount rate have in this age ofmarketization?  Central banks overseas hold various views as to the relationship between officialdiscount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates, and it is difficult to arrive at asingle conclusion.However, examples overseas suggest that official discount rate changes continueto play an important role even in this age of economic and financial marketization and interestrate liberalization.  Their function is to communicate plainly to everybody the changes inmonetary policy.  In order to maintain the efficacy of monetary policy amid the progress ofmarketization, it becomes even more necessary to win public understanding of and confidence inthe central bank’s economic outlook and the thinking behind its monetary policy management.In this regard, the easy-to-understand announcement effects of the official discount rate arevaluable for monetary policy management based on the functioning of the market mechanism.I am sometimes asked which of the two would be employed first, the guiding ofmoney market rates or official discount rate change.  However, there is no fixed rule as to whichshould be implemented first.  In some cases, the Bank may change the level it has set for theguiding of money market rates several times before changing the official discount rate, and inother cases, the Bank may first strongly indicate its policy intention by changing the officialdiscount rate, and then guide the money market rates accordingly.For the reasons I have just explained, the Bank believes it necessary to makeeffective use of both official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates.C.  Monetary policy management1.  Strengthening of the functions of the Policy BoardI would now like to discuss monetary policy management, focusing on thedecision-making process of monetary policy.The new Bank of Japan Law incorporates major revisions aimed at strengtheningthe functions of the Policy Board, the Bank of Japan’s highest decision-making body.First, the composition of the Board is altered significantly.  The current PolicyBoard consists of seven members: the Governor of the Bank of Japan, four appointed members,and two government members without voting rights, representing the Ministry of Finance andthe Economic Planning Agency.  The new Policy Board, however, will consist of nine members:the Governor and the two Deputy Governors of the Bank of Japan and six deliberative members.The main features of the changes are that, first, there will be no governmentmembers on the Board.  Second, while the current appointed members must be selected fromeach of the four fields of city banking, regional banking, commerce and industry, andagriculture, the new deliberative members can be selected from among a much broaderpopulation, without any restriction on the fields they represent, so long as they are experts,including those on economy or finance.  Third, in order to ensure interactive linkage betweenmonetary policy decision-making and the Bank’s business operations, the number of members
- 9 -BIS Review   82/1997from the management of the Bank is increased from one to three.  A balance is to be struck,however, by appointing six deliberative members so that the three members from themanagement will not constitute the majority.Also, the powers of the Policy Board, which remained somewhat ambiguousunder the current Law, are clarified.  One example is the explicit stipulation of the threeinstruments of monetary policy as matters for decision by the Policy Board, which I discussedearlier.In addition to these revisions, we at the Bank will do our best to ensure that thePolicy Board can fully function.For example, meetings of the executive are currently organized at the Bank ofJapan pursuant to the Bank’s by-laws.  The meetings are attended by the Governor, the DeputyGovernor, and the Executive Directors, and, as the executive body of the Bank, meets to discussimportant matters related to the Bank’s daily business operations and to deliberate on matters onwhich it needs to consult with the Policy Board.  The meetings thus by no means representdecision-making opportunities.  However, the holding of the meetings has invited criticism thatthe Bank perhaps has two decision-making processes.  Under the new Law, therefore, themeetings will be abolished to prevent any misunderstanding regarding the procedures ofmonetary policy decision-making.As a result, meetings of the executive will not deliberate on monetary controlissues before they are discussed by the Policy Board.  The entire procedure related to monetarypolicy, from judging the economic and financial conditions to policy decision-making, will beconcentrated at the Policy Board.2.  Holding of regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control mattersWith the powers of the Policy Board strengthened in this manner, the new Lawprovides for regular meetings of the Policy Board on monetary control matters as well asdisclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts (detailed records of discussions) of themeetings.The main aim of holding regular Policy Board meetings on monetary controlmatters is to ensure the stability of the financial markets.Currently, the Policy Board meets every Tuesday and Friday.  However, theholding of ad hoc meetings means that there is the possibility that policy changes might be madeat any time.  That being the case, the markets inevitably become overly sensitive to variouskinds of information, such as daily movements in economic indicators and individual statementsby relevant people.  In fact, on quite a few occasions, one piece of information has triggeredspeculation over monetary policy changes, leading to market disruption.It is indeed an intrinsic function of the financial markets to assimilate variouskinds of information and to reflect them in the formation of interest rates.  In order for thisfunction to be played out in the most stable and efficient manner, however, it is important thatundue speculation and market disruption be avoided.  This will also be conducive to improvingthe efficacy of monetary policy.
- 10 -BIS Review   82/1997The new system of holding regular Board meetings on monetary control mattersand of announcing the schedule of such meetings in advance has been devised based on suchconsiderations.In determining the frequency of these regular meetings, due thought must begiven to ensuring the timeliness of policy implementation as well as market stabilization.Although there is no need to preclude the possibility of ad hoc meetings, monetary policydecisions should in principle be made at the regular meetings in keeping with the purpose of thenew system.  If we look at the practices of other countries, the U.S. Federal Open MarketCommittee meets the least often at eight times a year, the Monetary Policy Committee of theBank of England once a month, and the Central Bank Council of the German Bundesbank twicea month.  The Bank will continue to study how best to run the Board meetings by consideringsuch examples overseas and the aim of the new system.If I may add a word here, Policy Board meetings other than the regular meetingson monetary control matters will be held as necessary.  Apart from determination of monetarypolicy, the Policy Board will also discuss and decide on a number of matters, such as issuesrelated to the financial and payments systems as well as those related to the operational andorganizational management of the Bank.  The Policy Board currently meets twice weekly, and itis likely to meet frequently under the new Law as well.  What is of special note in the newsystem is that, while Policy Board meetings will be held frequently, the opportunities to holdintensive discussions and decide on monetary control matters are specified.3.  Disclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts of Policy Board meetingsI would now like to explain the new disclosure system of summaries ofdiscussions and transcripts of the regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters.One of the main principles underlying the revision of the Bank of Japan Law isimprovement of the transparency of monetary policy.  To this end, the new Law provides for thedisclosure of the summaries of discussions and the transcripts of the regular Policy Boardmeetings on monetary control matters.Disclosure of the summaries of discussions is aimed at gaining more fully theunderstanding and confidence of the market and the public regarding the Bank’s basic thinkingunderlying its monetary policy.  The Bank, therefore, intends to prepare accurate and clear-cutsummaries of the Board’s discussions on monetary and economic conditions and on monetarypolicy.The difficult issue is the timing of disclosure.  Considering the purpose of thedisclosure, it is desirable that the summaries of discussions be disclosed at the earliest possiblemoment.  Yet, it would only be counterproductive should the disclosure invite marketspeculation or disruption.  For example, let us assume that at a meeting held at the beginning ofa month, heated discussions are held on the projected movement of an indicator which is to bereleased at the end of the month.  If the summary of such discussions were disclosed before therelease of the indicator, it might heighten speculation over future policy management.  However,the summary should not be made ambiguous with the intention of avoiding such speculation.Therefore, the Bank will have to consider the earliest disclosure that will not undermine marketstability.  In the United States, the summary of discussions is disclosed approximately one to oneand a half months after the meeting, and in the United Kingdom, within six weeks.  These
- 11 -BIS Review   82/1997timings probably reflect the central banks’ desire to avoid undue speculation over discussionsand policy decisions at future meetings.The transcripts of discussions at the meetings will have a somewhat different rolefrom the summaries, although both are meant to enhance the transparency of monetary policy.While the summaries of discussions seek to promote better understanding of current policymanagement, the transcripts are a tool to enable a detailed review at a later date, as necessary, ofthe Policy Board’s policy management at a certain point in time.  On the one hand, due attentionmust be given to ensuring that the disclosure of the transcripts does not hamper free and frankdiscussions at Policy Board meetings.  On the other hand, however, if the disclosure is overlydelayed, the significance of the disclosure may be greatly reduced.  With these points in mind,the Bank intends to establish an effective disclosure system that makes the Bank sufficientlyaccountable to the public.The Bank has, to date, endeavored to explain as clearly as possible the basicthinking behind its monetary policy management at regular press conferences, before the Diet, inpublications, in speeches, and at various other opportunities.  Disclosure of the transcripts andthe summaries of discussions of the Policy Board are added to these measures under the newLaw, and this will equip the Bank of Japan with means that go beyond global standards to ensurethe transparency of monetary policy.  We at the Bank intend to make effective use of thesemeans to win even greater public understanding of and confidence in the Bank’s policymanagement.4.  Relationship between the central bank and the GovernmentLastly, I would like to discuss the relationship between the Bank of Japan and theGovernment.  The new Law allows Government representatives to attend Policy Board meetingson monetary control matters and to express their views when necessary.  It also grants theGovernment representatives the right to make policy proposals regarding monetary controlmatters, including requests to postpone the Board’s vote on policies.  Some suggest that theseprovisions will constrain the independence of the central bank.  We at the Bank, however, do nottake that view.First of all, the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan is designed to contribute tothe sound development of the national economy in conjunction with the economic policy of theGovernment.  The Bank therefore needs to ensure adequate communication with theGovernment in managing monetary policy, although the policy must be decided by the Bank onits own responsibility and judgment.What is important is that the relationship between the Bank and the Governmentin the determination of monetary policy be clear and transparent, and therefore under the newsystem, the Government’s views and the discussions and votes on Government proposals will bedisclosed in the summaries of discussions.  In addition, although the Government representativeshave the right to “request” a postponement of the Board’s vote, they do not have the right to“instruct.”  Whether to postpone the vote on policies as requested will be determined by a voteby the Policy Board.This new system is designed carefully from the viewpoint of ensuring theautonomy of the central bank in monetary policy management while also ensuring adequatecommunication between the Bank and the Government.  We at the Bank intend to establish aclear, transparent, and constructive relationship with the Government to serve the purpose of the
- 12 -BIS Review   82/1997new system, believing that such a relationship will not interfere with the central bank’sautonomy.IV.  ConclusionI hope that I have been able to make clear how specifically the two mainprinciples of the new Bank of Japan Law, independence and transparency, will be embedded inthe new central bank system.As I stated at the outset, the Bank intends to implement all possible measures aspart of the Bank’s self-reform even before the new Law is effected, to accommodate the aims ofthe new Law.  The Bank is currently studying a concrete mechanism for holding regular PolicyBoard meetings on monetary control matters and for disclosing the summaries of discussions atthose meetings, which will be implemented as soon as preparations are completed.I wish to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support.
Mr. Crockett reviews the changing role of central banks   Speech by the GeneralManager of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr. Andrew Crockett, at the Money Macro andFinance Annual Conference held in Durham on 11/9/97.The BIS Annual Report for 1996-97 observes, with characteristic understatement:“The last 25 years have been an eventful time for central banking”. The period since the breakdownof the Bretton Woods system has, indeed, seen enormous changes in the economic and financialenvironment, and a major evolution in the objectives, indicators and instruments of central bankpolicy. My objective this afternoon will be to review these changes, and to identify some of thecommon factors that lie behind them.The changes in the environment have been of both a macro-economic and a structuralcharacter. Macro-economically, the move to floating exchange rates in the early 1970s was followedby a period of substandard economic performance. In the industrial world high inflation ratesco-existed with disappointing growth. In the developing world, a borrowing spree was followed by adebt crisis. Not until the last few years have monetary authorities been successful in restoring a moresatisfactory degree of price stability, and still the task is not complete. There have also been dramaticchanges in financial structure. The process of liberalisation and innovation has led to a globalisationof finance and a quantum increase in intermediation. Coupled with an explosive growth in ever morecomplex financial instruments, this has presented new opportunities to financial intermediaries, butalso created new sources of systemic risk.The changing environment has both influenced and been influenced by an evolutionin the way central banks carry out their role of preserving monetary and financial stability. In the fieldof monetary stability, attempts to exploit the Phillips curve trade-off produced almost wholly negativeresults and led to a widespread consensus that the primary objective of monetary policy must be pricestability. The intermediate targets of monetary policy objectives have also evolved, with the earlieremphasis on monetary aggregates giving way to exchange rate anchors in some countries and explicitor implicit inflation targets in others. At the level of tactics, market management techniques, whichwere formerly quite diverse, have tended to coalesce around the use of repurchase operations as ameans of controlling very short-term interest rates.The other main function of central banks, that of preserving financial system stability,has acquired considerably more prominence as a result of financial liberalisation, which has led to thegreatest spate of banking sector difficulties since the interwar period. The focus of central banks’approach to maintaining systemic stability has evolved from field-of-activity regulation to a greaterstress on capital adequacy, and is still in the process of change. Meanwhile, a number of countries arerethinking the institutional structure of supervision, with some placing responsibility for day-to-dayregulation with specialised supervisory agencies and assigning to the central bank the broad, thoughless well-defined responsibility for systemic stability.Throughout these changes, a constant feature has been central banks’ search foreffective means of implementing policy in an environment where economic agents can use newinstruments and markets to arbitrage their way around restrictions and controls. The desire to avoiddistorting incentives and exacerbating moral hazard has been a guiding principle in this search. Theauthorities have sought anchors for policy that are compatible with profit-seeking behaviour byprivate agents in an increasingly competitive market. It is this search that will be the underlyingtheme of this lecture.I will begin by noting some of the driving forces behind the changes that have takenplace in the financial industry, and how they have manifested themselves. The key consequence forpolicy, I will argue, is that markets have become more complete, thus increasing the scope forBIS Review   81/1997
- 2 -arbitrage by private agents, and decreasing the scope for the monetary authorities to use directcontrols to achieve policy objectives. In the next part of my remarks, I will review how approaches tomonetary policy have evolved over the past 25 years, in respect of ultimate goals, intermediate targetsand policy instruments. After this, I will consider how financial stability has grown as a policyconcern, and how the way in which supervision is viewed has evolved. Finally, I will have a fewwords to say about the international monetary system.I.   The Changing Financial EnvironmentThe driving forces behind the transformation in the financial environment that hasoccurred in the past twenty to thirty years have been innovation and liberalisation. Technologicaladvances have dramatically lowered the cost of gathering and processing information, while newfinancial instruments have increased the range of transactions economic agents can undertake.Liberalisation has paved the way for the expansion and restructuring of the financial industry. It hasbeen driven both by the ascendancy of the free market philosophy and by the difficulty ofmaintaining controls in the face of innovation.The combined effects of innovation and liberalisation have been dramatic.Geographical barriers have largely disappeared, leading to the emergence of an increasinglyintegrated global capital market with a sizable group of multinational financial intermediariesoperating in all the major centres. Distinctions among different classes of financial intermediary havebecome blurred, with the relaxation of regulatory restraints, the growth of conglomerate structures,and the increasing ease with which institutions can transform the risk characteristics of theirportfolios through the use of derivatives. Another significant development has been the securitisationof assets and the institutionalisation of savings. Together, these trends have greatly increased thevolume of tradable financial assets, and the amount of transactions passing through financial marketsand settled in clearing systems.The significance for central banks of these developments in the financial environmentis that they have made markets more complete, that is, they have greatly increased the ability ofmarket participants to exchange assets and income flows over time, space, and market instrument.Portfolio management is far less constrained than before by lack of access to liabilities or claims withdesired pay-off characteristics. This has profound effects for central bank activity, both in theformulation and implementation of monetary policy, and in the preservation of financial stability.At the macro-economic level, markets can now discipline policies far more quicklyand effectively than in the past. Bad policies, or indeed any policies that are unsustainable in the faceof profit-maximising behaviour by private agents, will quickly have to be reversed. This means thatthe authorities always have to consider, in framing economic policies, whether they are credible andhow the market will react to them. It is very hard, for example, to spring an inflationary “surprise”that has a positive effect on output; or to set an exchange rate objective that is inconsistent with theunderlying stance of macro-economic policies.Concerning financial stability, more complete markets mean that competitionsqueezes out rents created by restricted franchises. Financial institutions have less of a cushion ofprotected profits and are therefore more vulnerable to losses caused by mismanagement ormisfortune. This has inevitably increased the emphasis given to the role of the authorities as theultimate guarantor of financial stability. At the same time, it has reduced the effectiveness ofregulation that is not based on market incentives. Financial institutions have a broad menu oftechniques that enable them to get around regulations that are intended to increase safety, but areburdensome to the institutions to which they apply.BIS Review   81/1997
- 3 -II.   Monetary Policy(a)ObjectivesIn the aftermath of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system (and for the UnitedStates for some time before that), monetary policy was designed to secure the best trade-off betweenoutput growth and inflation. The intellectual basis of policy was the Phillips curve. Eventually,however, the stagflation that marked the 1970s caused both the objective of policy and itsimplementation to be reassessed.Today, there is a widespread consensus among central bankers, and economists moregenerally, that price stability should be the overriding goal of monetary policy. The rationalexpectations literature, and the lessons of experience, suggest that there is no exploitable trade-offbetween output and inflation in anything other than the very short run. Moreover, inflation leads todistortions and uncertainties that impair economic performance. Worse, the short-run relationshipbetween inflation and output growth seems to be asymmetric: the output sacrifice needed to getinflation down may be greater than the output gain when inflation is allowed to rise. Taken together,these considerations mean that the best service monetary policy can render for the real economy is tokeep inflation credibly at low levels.In fact, policy has been remarkably successful in recent years in bringing inflationdown in virtually all industrial countries. So much so, that a number of issues are now coming to thefore that were previously considered as of second-order importance. These questions include: how toavoid bias in the measurement of inflation; whether inflation should be zero or some low positivenumber; whether the authorities’ objective should be expressed in terms of inflation or the price level;and how quickly one should return to the stated objective after a disturbance.It is hard to dispute that measurement bias in inflation should be corrected, if possible.That is easier said than done, however. Some biases can be relatively easily removed, such as thatarising from infrequent re-weighting of the consumption basket. Others are more difficult to dealwith, such as adjusting adequately for quality changes. And some are very difficult to correct, such asproperly incorporating new goods and services. Still, with some heroic assumptions it should bepossible to arrive at a serviceable estimate. The Boskin Commission in the United States has put thebias at just over 1%; in other countries, the bias is thought to be no more than half that.Concerning the desirable level of (properly measured) inflation, there seems to be aconsensus that a low positive number (1-3%) is better than zero.1 The reasons for this are both apriori and empirical. When inflation averages zero over time, the price level must, by definition, befalling for a significant part of the time (and a significant number of individual prices will be falling,even if the general price level is flat). This creates two problems. Firstly, if wages and prices aresticky downward, it may require a higher level of unemployment to stabilise the overall inflation rateat zero than at some higher number.2 Secondly, since nominal interest rates cannot go below zero, itwill become impossible to engineer negative (or even very low) real interest rates to help recoveryfrom a recession. Such considerations have led most observers to favour a low but positive rate ofinflation. Those who prefer zero tend to point to the distortionary effects of the tax system,3 or to therisk that any positive number can be revised up, as justifying the more ambitious target.                                                  1Fischer, Stanley: "Why are Central Banks Pursuing Long-Run Price Stability?" in "Achieving Price Stability", ASymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

- 4 -It is the fear of slippage that also motivates the suggestion to express the pricestability objective as a constant price level (rather than a zero or constant rate of inflation). The idea isthat the impact of an inflationary (or deflationary) surprise in one period should be offset in thesucceeding period by a policy aiming at reversing the initial shock. In this way, the price level wouldbe constant through time, enhancing the credibility of monetary policy and facilitating thedevelopment of very long-term contracts.One obvious objection to the pursuit of a policy of literal price level stability, namelythat it would require deliberate deflation following any inflationary disturbance, can be overcome byexpressing the price objective in terms of a rising trend through time. Nevertheless, perhapssurprisingly, there is still little support in central banking circles for expressing the inflation objectivein terms of the price level, rather than its first derivative. This may be because, if there is believed tobe an optimal inflation objective, whether zero or a low positive number, it seems odd to adjust it as aresult of past events.The last element of objective setting for central banks is how quickly they should seekto return to an inflation target once having been forced away from it. There seems to be an emergingconsensus, reflected, inter alia, in statements by the Bank of England, that a period of 1-2 years isappropriate, this being the time it takes for a change in monetary policy to have the bulk of its effectin prices. To attempt a quicker restoration of price stability would risk overshooting, while to gomore slowly would tend to undermine credibility. It should be noted, however, that thisrecommendation holds clearly only for minor departures from the objective. If the actual inflation rateis a long way away from the desired rate, there is no consensus on whether gradual or shock therapyis to be preferred. Much depends on the political circumstances, as well as on surrounding economicpolicies (e.g. fiscal policy) that affect credibility.(b)AnchorsJust as difficult as setting the objective of monetary policy has been settling on themeans for achieving it. A variety of approaches have been in vogue at various times in the pasttwenty or thirty years.Pure discretion has acquired a bad name because, at least in countries with non-independent central banks, it is seen as a cloak for politically-motivated decisions. Such decisionshave sometimes been a crude attempt to buy votes by easing of monetary policy before elections, thebenefits of monetary relaxation coming relatively quickly and the costs of higher inflation emergingonly later. More frequently, however, they have involved an attempt to use a presumedoutput/inflation trade-off to strengthen employment prospects; or an unwillingness to tightenmonetary policy until evidence of inflationary pressures was already apparent in the data. Whateverthe motivation, a fully discretionary policy has often lacked the strategic coherence to preventinflation accelerating.Monetary targeting became popular in a number of countries in the 1970s, on theback of Milton Friedman’s dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetaryphenomenon”.4 The powerful intuitive appeal of the money-inflation link was undoubtedly helpful inmobilising support for a rigorous anti-inflation policy in the United States, United Kingdom andelsewhere in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Nevertheless, one of the key requirements for such apolicy, namely a stable demand for some monetary aggregate, has not been adequately fulfilled inrecent years (at least in most countries). One by one, central banks that had adopted monetary targets                                                  4Friedman, Milton: "What Price Guideposts?", in George P. Schultz and R.Z.

- 5 -in the 1970s, dropped or downgraded them in the 1980s and 1990s. Nowadays only Germany andSwitzerland place strong reliance on monetary aggregate targeting, and even they apply such policieswith a significant measure of judgment.Exchange rate targeting has a long history. The gold standard involved stabilisingthe domestic price level in terms of gold, and the Bretton Woods system linked national currencies tothe dollar. More recently, exchange rate anchors have been used effectively by a wide range ofcountries. Their value in restoring discipline and credibility is hard to doubt. But they have two majordisadvantages that have become evident in recent years. Firstly, when capital markets are integrated,any country adopting a strict exchange rate peg subordinates its monetary policy to that of the anchorcountry. This works well when monetary policy requirements are in harmony; less well when thereare divergences, as the United Kingdom discovered in 1992. Secondly, if a country adopting acurrency peg fails to master domestic inflationary pressures, it may find that its balance of tradedeteriorates and eventually reaches a point of unsustainability. The decision to adjust or abandon anunrealistic peg has proved to be one of the most difficult of economic policy decisions – in partbecause so much has typically gone into seeking to achieve credibility through adherence to the peg.In response to the perceived shortcomings of monetary and exchange rate targets, andof unconstrained discretion, attention has been given in recent years to inflation targeting andcentral bank autonomy as a means of strengthening the likelihood that price stability objectives willbe met. At first sight it might seem tautological to use an inflation target to achieve an inflationobjective. In fact, there is rather more to it, as the practice in the United Kingdom shows. The idea isthat a public commitment to an inflation target, coupled with the maximum of transparency indescribing the authorities’ forecasts and decision-making process, enables a discretionary approach tobe applied with less risk that monetary policy decisions will be biased toward leniency. If, inaddition, the central bank is made fully independent to pursue a clearly-defined goal, politicalinterference will be avoided.A growing list of countries have adopted the inflation targeting approach in recentyears, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland. Thepractical implementation of the approach has varied in a number of respects, including who sets thetarget (government or central bank); whether it is expressed as a range or a fixed point; the priceindex employed; the use of adjustment or “override” mechanisms, and so on. These differences,however, are less significant than the common principle on which targets are based. So far, targetshave been rather successful, though the approach has yet to be tested under adverse conditions.(c)TacticsJust as there has been convergence in the goals and the strategy of monetary policyimplementation, so too there has been in matters of tactics. Twenty or thirty years ago, a variety ofoperating tactics were used, including control of some measure of the monetary base; variations inreserve requirements; discretionary discount window intervention; open market operations, at avariety of maturities; direct lending controls; and moral suasion.Nowadays, direct controls on lending have been abandoned in virtually all countries.Reserve requirements have been reduced to very low levels, to avoid distorting patterns ofintermediation, thus making control of the monetary base an imprecise instrument. Use of thediscount window and bond market intervention have similarly fallen out of favour. Central banksnow generally use very short-term reversible transactions (“repos” and “reverse repos”) to inject orwithdraw cash from the money market. The maturity of these transactions is typically eitherovernight or for a few days.BIS Review   81/1997
- 6 -Short-term money market operations enable central banks to maintain control overovernight interest rates. Longer-term interest rates are then influenced by expectations of how centralbanks are likely to adjust overnight rates in the face of economic developments. This, in turn, places apremium on credibility and effective signalling of policy intentions.The use of interest rates as the principal operating instrument does not mean, it shouldbe stressed, that the volume of money and credit is considered unimportant as a determinant ofinflationary trends. Rather, it reflects the view that “noise” in the demand for bank reserves is betteraccommodated by some short-term flexibility in the growth of liquidity than by fluctuations inovernight interest rates; and by the belief that judicious management of overnight interest rates willenable the authorities to achieve the desired degree of control over credit volumes in the mediumterm. At the same time, it is also part and parcel of the process that has led central banks to placerelatively more weight on prices (interest rates, exchange rates) than on quantities in the formulationand implementation of policy. There are several reasons for this, ranging from the socio-politicalclimate to structural economic factors such as the development of financial markets.II.   Financial System StabilityBesides the achievement of price stability through the appropriate use of monetarypolicy, the other major focus of central bank activity is the preservation of stability in the financialsystem. As first articulated by Bagehot, this involves a willingness to act as a lender-of-last-resort tothe banking system, to counteract the possibility of a “run” developing on a solvent but illiquidinstitution, and to avoid the risk of a contagious spread of financial distress. Central banks havealways had an important role in maintaining systemic stability, but it is only comparatively recentlythat economists generally have become aware of the analytic issues involved.Following the crisis of the 1930s, there was growing agreement, first in the UnitedStates and later elsewhere, that the stability of the financial system should be based on two pillars:firstly, explicit or implicit support to protect depositors at banking institutions; and secondly, astructure of regulation that would reduce the risk of banks getting into trouble in the first place.For the first twenty-five years or so of the post-war period, banking system stabilityattracted relatively little attention. Economic conditions were favourable, which limited the scope fortroublesome bad-lending decisions. Just as important, restrictions on market access and regulation ofpermitted activities enhanced franchise values and provided protection against losses.Essentially, entry into banking was restricted, both by natural economies of scale andby regulatory restraints. Competition within the banking industry was limited by tolerating cartel-typepractices and by rules, such as interest rate and credit expansion ceilings, that protected existingfirms. Such practices greatly reduced the probability of bank failure. The value of the bankingfranchise made stockholders and managements unwilling to take risks with the continued viability offirms under their control. And if serious losses did occur, rescue by other firms was likely, either inorder to acquire a valuable franchise, or as part of an implicit quid pro quo for the maintenance oftheir own favoured status.Two forces came to the fore in the 1970s and subsequently that made this regulatoryapproach unsustainable. One was the growing influence of the free market philosophy, and theaccompanying dismantling of controls and restrictive practices. This affected the willingness ofpublic authorities to limit competition in the name of stability. The other was the development of newfinancial instruments that enabled market participants to replicate virtually any kind of contract,regardless of regulatory restraints. This affected the ability of policy makers to influence financialactivity through regulatory controls. Interest ceilings on demand deposits were circumvented by thedevelopment of NOW accounts; exchange controls spawned the development of Euro-currencyBIS Review   81/1997
- 7 -accounts; and the growth of derivatives markets provided transactors with a multiplicity of ways ofcreating contracts with equivalent pay-off characteristics but different forms.The breakdown and eventual abandonment of direct controls required renewedattention to the issue of how to make the financial system resilient. The search was made more urgentby the fact that banks’ capital strength had (predictably enough) weakened during the period whentheir protected franchise generated guaranteed profits. This weaker capital position was highlightedby a number of episodes in the 1970s and early 1980s, notably the Third World debt crisis thaterupted in 1982.The vulnerability of banking systems in industrial countries that was revealed by the1980s debt crisis led to a renewed focus on risk-based capital adequacy as a means ofstrengthening systemic resilience. Bank regulators had, of course, always had rules for capitalholding by the institutions they supervised, but these were not harmonised across countries, and inmany jurisdictions, they were in the form of crude capital/asset ratios. What was different about theregulatory approach developed in the 1980s is that it was founded on international agreement, and itfocused on the concept of capital as a cushion against risk.The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision had been created in 1974, with theinitial task of identifying which country’s supervisors should be responsible for the activities andsoundness of internationally active banks. In the mid-1980s the Committee turned its attention to thedevelopment of capital standards for such banks. When finally promulgated in 1988, these standardsdivided banks’ assets into five risk categories, running from sovereign securities of industrialcountries (with a zero risk weight) to ordinary commercial credits (with a 100% risk weight).Supervisors from G-10 countries agreed to see that internationally-active banks under theirjurisdiction held capital at least equivalent to 8% of risk weighted assets.The Basle Capital Accord, which has subsequently been updated and amended, was asubstantial step forward for bank regulation. It meant that required levels of capital were more closelyrelated to the reasons for which banks hold capital, that is, to cover the risks in their portfolio. At apractical level, it led to a marked strengthening of major banks’ capital ratios, which had becomedangerously low.But although the Basle Capital Accord took regulatory practice a significant waytowards the market, it did not take it the whole way. The limited number of risk categories obviously(and deliberately) did not capture the full spectrum of creditworthiness. And the “building block”approach to the calculation of risk did not allow for the risk-reducing (risk-enhancing) properties ofdiversification (concentration).Much recent thinking has focused on incentive-compatible regulation – using themarket’s own internal forces – as the most promising next step strengthening the financial system. Itis banks’ shareholders and management that have the strongest interest to measure risk accurately (atleast if they expect to be around to bear the consequences of their actions). An internally generatedmeasure of risk should be better than one derived from formulaic risk-weights generated bysupervisors. There is, therefore, a strong case for supervisors to use the calculations developed byfirms themselves, at least if they can be satisfied that the risk assessment model is adequately robust.This is the approach that the Basle Committee in fact followed when the capitalaccord was amended to include market risk in addition to credit risk. The difficulties of extending theapproach to credit risk are considerable, since a loan portfolio does not have a market value whosevariability can be tracked over a series of observations. Nevertheless, the concept is similar, and thebest financial firms are now beginning to apply a similar methodology to the calculation of credit riskas they do to market risk.BIS Review   81/1997
- 8 -Does this mean that decisions relating to prudential capital requirements can be left toprivate institutions? Not quite. Although private institutions are, in principle, best placed to measurethe riskiness of their own portfolio, they are not necessarily the best judge of how much capital theyought to hold. This is because when a public authority acts as a lender-of-last-resort, or ultimateguarantor of systemic stability, that authority is providing part of the “capital” that the bankingsystem needs to safeguard stability. In the absence of regulatory rules, financial institutions would betempted to economise on capital holding, reasoning that the authorities would either come to theirassistance, or shoulder the consequences of systemic failure. So even if the task of measuring riskcan be largely privatised, the task of deciding the appropriate level of capital holding may stillrequire a public policy judgment.Important public policy decisions are also involved in dealing with financialinstitutions which, for whatever reason, find themselves with an inadequate capital. Low levels ofcapital can lead to the phenomenon of “gambling for resurrection” – banks pursuing risky strategiesin the knowledge that shareholders will get the benefit of good outcomes, while bad outcomes willimpose losses on third parties.Thus far, I have discussed financial stability in terms of the health of the institutionsthat go to make up the banking system. But there is another dimension that has received increasingattention from central bankers over the past 10-15 years. It concerns the market infrastructure thatunderpins financial transactions, and in particular the payment and settlement system. While thismight seem an unexciting subject to economists, it is in fact of great practical importance. At aconservative estimate, more that $5 trillion per day passes through the settlement system, most of itrepresenting large-value financial transactions cleared by a relative handful of major clearing banks.If one of these institutions became unable to meet its obligations in the clearing, the consequencescould be dramatic.Because this is the case, it is worth taking a moment to understand the issues thatarise. Broadly speaking, there are two sets of problems. Easiest to understand are the problems facingusers of payment and settlement systems – that is, those who trade in financial markets and then haveto use the systems to settle their deals. Almost every deal has two sides – one party pays, the otherparty delivers whatever is being bought. For these users, the difficulty arises where there is nomechanism to co-ordinate the two sides. The party paying is thus exposed to the risk that thecounterparty fails to deliver, and vice versa. In other words, there is often no mechanism to ensuredelivery-versus-payment. In securities markets this is by now a relatively familiar issue. Morerecently, the need to tackle the similar problem which arises when settling foreign exchange deals hascome to be appreciated. In both cases the value of the deals being settled is so substantial that theresulting settlement risks can be of a size to cause systemic concern.The second set of problems concerns one particular category of system users –namely banks, who also typically provide the payment and settlement systems. Until quite recently,the standard form of settlement was end-of-day net settlement. That is to say, all the payments andreceipts between banks were allowed to accumulate during the day, to be settled by a transfer of thesmaller, net amount at the end of the day. Banks liked this arrangement because it meant they couldhold smaller balances on their accounts at the central bank. But its systemic weakness was that itusually required participants in the clearing to grant unsecured, uncontrolled and unlimited credit toother participants during the period until final settlement occurs. It is quite common for the creditthereby extended to a single counterparty to exceed a bank’s entire capital. Implicitly, the participantsin the clearing are assuming that the central bank would be forced to come to the rescue if problemsarose.BIS Review   81/1997
- 9 -Over the past few years, considerable effort has been devoted to alleviating thesesources of systemic risk, and solutions are now being implemented. Solutions to protect users of thesystems include introducing improved delivery versus payment mechanisms for securities marketsand the possible introduction of some new form of multi-currency settlement arrangement for foreignexchange markets. Solutions to protect system providers include the introduction of tighter internalcontrols within traditional end-of-day settlement systems or, in an increasing number of cases, thereplacement of such traditional systems by so-called RTGS arrangements. In these real-time grosssettlement systems, individual transactions are settled one-by-one throughout the day rather thanbeing allowed to accumulate, thereby attempting to get to the heart of the problem by removing theexposures between banks. As a result of these major efforts, payment and settlement arrangements allover the world are – gradually – becoming safer.IV.   International Monetary ArrangementsThe nature of international monetary arrangements has also changed dramatically overthe past two and a half decades. Once again, the driving force has been the growing power of marketforces, and the recognition on the part of monetary authorities of the need to work with these forces,rather than to resist them.The Bretton Woods system, which lasted until the early 1970s, was based ondecisions reached by collective agreement among governments. Exchange rates were fixed withinnarrow margins, with changes being possible only by international agreement in conditions of“fundamental disequilibrium”. International liquidity was externally supplied through gold, reservecurrencies or, latterly, collective decisions to allocate Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Theadjustment mechanism worked through governments managing domestic demand so as to keeptheir current accounts close to balance (capital account restrictions were tolerated or evenencouraged).By the beginning of the 1970s, the difficulties of maintaining such a government-ledsystem were becoming increasingly apparent. International transactions were growing in importance,and countries were less willing to have their domestic macro-economic objectives subordinated toconsiderations of fixed exchange rates and balance-of-payments equilibrium. This issue came to ahead in the late 1960s, when the United States was not prepared to adopt restrictive domestic policiesto stem a dollar outflow when it was trying to finance domestic social reforms and the Vietnam warat the same time; and its partner countries were unwilling to accept the domestic inflationaryconsequences of a continued peg to the US dollar.Meanwhile, capital flows were increasing in volume as international financial marketsexpanded, and market participants found ways around pre-existing capital controls. The result wasthat private markets had growing means (and incentives) to challenge officially-maintained exchangerate pegs. Central bank reserves were increasingly inadequate to resist such pressures, despite theintroduction in 1970 of a Special Drawing Rights (SDR facility) at the IMF.As is well-known by now, the combined effects of these trends was to bring about thedemise of the fixed exchange rate (Bretton Woods) system in 1973. Thereafter it was quicklyrecognised that the most effective role for central banks and other public authorities was to make thenew market-driven system work as efficiently as possible, working with rather than against the grainof market forces.BIS Review   81/1997
- 10 -Each of the three main elements of the international monetary system is now “market-led”.5 Exchange rates are floating, except where governments have taken a conscious decision to usethe exchange rate as an anti-inflationary anchor, or where they are pursuing other goals (e.g.monetary union in Europe). Liquidity is demand-driven, with creditworthy governments able toborrow the reserves they need, and private markets being much more important to the availability ofliquidity than central banks. And the adjustment mechanism is largely the consequence of marketforces and private capital flows, which now provide the disciplining mechanism that previouslyoperated through intergovernmental discussion and pressures.The fact that market forces are now more important in the operation of theinternational monetary system has probably avoided some types of problem, but it has highlightedothers. For example, exchange rates have often fluctuated over wider ranges than can be justified byfundamentals. Inflation has sometimes reached dangerously high levels (e.g. following the oil priceincrease in the 1970s). And some countries have found themselves in a vicious circle of currencycrisis and domestic financial strains.The conclusion from this experience has been to underline the essentially unitarynature of financial stability. The growing links among markets mean that domestic economicstability, the stability of the international monetary system, and the robustness of financial institutionsand markets are closely tied together. The achievement of international stability therefore depends onactions on a number of fronts: the pursuit of effective stability-oriented macro-economic policies;adequate prudential supervision of financial institutions and markets, and a co-operative approach bymonetary authorities where their domestic policies “interface”, i.e. in exchange rate relationships andthe agreement of international regulatory policies.V.   Concluding CommentsWhat of the future? Where are the trends that have been described in this paper likelyto lead? And how can public policy best equip itself to provide the stable financial environment thatis most conducive to the development of the real economy?Predictions are always hazardous, but certain propositions can be made withreasonable confidence. Firstly, financial innovation will continue at a rapid pace, and global financialmarkets will become even more integrated, efficient and complete. The capacity of governments toresist market trends or pursue unsustainable policies will shrink further. Secondly, as aconsequences, there will be a premium in firm, transparent and credible anchors for policy.Achieving price stability will be easier (though not easy) if market participants know what theauthorities are trying to achieve and how they are going about it (and if there is an effective marketdiscipline on the authorities to prevent backsliding).A third proposition which it seems safe to advance is that there will be an intensifiedsearch for ways to ensure systemic stability while fostering a competitive and efficient bankingsystem. The plethora of financial system crises in recent years6 has amply illustrated the costs of laxpractices in the financial sector. At the same time, there is a recognition that any indiscriminateexpansion of safety net arrangements creates moral hazard problems, while excessive regulation leadsto inefficiencies. My expectation is that regulatory economics will become a fruitful area of researchfor central bankers and financial supervisors. The goal will be to develop a regulatory structure thathas as its anchor the replication of market disciplines, while at the same time providing protection                                                  5Padoa-Schioppa, Tommaso and Fabrizio Saccomanni: "Managing a Market-Led Global Financial System", Bancad'Italia, Mimeo.6Goldstein, Morris: "The Case for an International Banking Standard", Institute for International Economics,Washington, April 1997.BIS Review   81/1997
- 11 -against the systemic transmission of instability. Transparency and disclosure have an obvious role toplay here.Fourthly, and lastly, the international monetary system. Here, too, the power ofmarket forces seems likely to grow. This has the potential for beneficial consequences insofar as badpolicies are disciplined and good policies are rewarded. But it would be naive to suggest that marketforces always get it right. My expectation is that efforts will need to be devoted to promoting greaterstability in the market-led international monetary system. The bulk of these efforts will be in thedirection of improving policies (and their mutual consistency) and making markets more transparent(e.g. through better information). But it cannot be excluded that more direct measures will be requiredto limit damaging exchange rate fluctuations or contain the cost of currency crises.Taken together, this presents a full agenda for central bank policy-makers. I noted atthe outset of this lecture that “the last twenty-five years have been an eventful time for centralbanking”. The years ahead promise to be no less eventful.BIS Review   81/1997
Mr. Greenspan considers the recent history of the Federal Reserve System’spolicy process   Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the 15th Anniversary Conference of the Center for EconomicIt is a pleasure to be at this conference marking the fifteenth anniversary of theCenter for Economic Policy Research. The Center, by encouraging academic research intopublic policy and bringing that research to the attention of policymakers, is performing a mostvaluable role in our society.I am particularly pleased that Milton Friedman has taken time to join us. Hisviews have had as much, if not more, impact on the way we think about monetary policy andmany other important economic issues as those of any person in the last half of the twentiethcentury.Federal Reserve policy, over the years, has been subject to criticism, often withjustification, from Professor Friedman and others. It has been argued, for example, that policyfailed to anticipate the emerging inflation of the 1970s, and by fostering excessive monetarycreation, contributed to the inflationary upsurge. Surely, it was maintained, some monetarypolicy rule, however imperfect, would have delivered far superior performance. Even if true inthis case, though, policy rules might not always be preferable.Policy rules, at least in a general way, presume some understanding of howeconomic forces work. Moreover, in effect, they anticipate that key causal connections observedin the past will remain fixed over time, or evolve only very slowly. Use of a rule presupposesAnother premise behind many rule-based policy prescriptions, however, is thatour knowledge of the full workings of the system is quite limited, so that attempts to improve onthe results of policy rules will, on average, only make matters worse. In this view, ad hoc ordiscretionary policy can cause uncertainty for private decision makers and be wrong forextended periods if there is no anchor to bring it back into line. In addition, discretionary policyis obviously vulnerable to political pressures; if ad hoc judgments are to be made, why shouldn’tthose of elected representatives supersede those of unelected officials?The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has involved varying degrees ofrule- and discretionary-based modes of operation over time. Recognizing the potentialdrawbacks of purely discretionary policy, the Federal Reserve frequently has sought to exploitpast patterns and regularities to operate in a systematic way. But we have found that very oftenhistorical regularities have been disrupted by unanticipated change, especially in technologies.The evolving patterns mean that the performance of the economy under any rule, were it to berigorously followed, would deviate from expectations. Accordingly we are constantly evaluatinghow much we can infer from the past and how relationships might have changed. In an everchanging world, some element of discretion appears to be an unavoidable aspect ofpolicymaking.Such changes mean that we can never construct a completely general model of theeconomy, invariant through time, on which to base our policy. Still, sensible policy doespresuppose a conceptual framework, or implicit model, however incompletely specified, of howthe economic system operates. Of necessity, we make judgments based importantly on historicalBIS Review   79/1997
- 2 -regularities in behavior inferred from data relationships. These perceived regularities can beembodied in formal empirical models, often covering only a portion of the economic system.Generally, the regularities inform our interpretation of “experience” and tell us what to look forto determine whether history is in the process of repeating itself, and if not, why not. From suchan examination, along with an assessment of past policy actions, we attempt to judge to whatextent our current policies should deviate from our past patterns of behavior.When this Center was founded 15 years ago, the rules versus discretion debatefocused on the appropriate policy role of the monetary aggregates, and this discussion wasechoed in the Federal Reserve’s policy process.In the late 1970s, the Federal Reserve’s actions to deal with developinginflationary instabilities were shaped in part by the reality portrayed by Milton Friedman’sanalysis that ever-rising inflation rate peaks, as well as ever-rising inflation rate troughs,followed on the heels of similar patterns of average money growth. The Federal Reserve, inresponse to such evaluations, acted aggressively under newly installed Chairman Paul Volcker.A considerable tightening of the average stance of policy -- based on intermediate M1 targetstied to reserve operating objectives -- eventually reversed the surge in inflation.The last fifteen years have been a period of consolidating the gains of the early1980s and extending them to their logical end -- the achievement of price stability. We are notquite there yet, but we trust it is on the horizon.Although the ultimate goals of policy have remained the same over these pastfifteen years, the techniques used in formulating and implementing policy have changedconsiderably as a consequence of vast changes in technology and regulation. Focusing on M1,and following operating procedures that imparted a considerable degree of automaticity toshort-term interest rate movements, was extraordinarily useful in the early Volcker years. Butafter nationwide NOW accounts were introduced, the demand for M1 in the judgment of theFederal Open Market Committee became too interest-sensitive for that aggregate to be useful inimplementing policy. Because the velocity of such an aggregate varies substantially in responseto small changes in interest rates, target ranges for M1 growth in its judgment no longer werereliable guides for outcomes in nominal spending and inflation. In response to an unanticipatedmovement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded, a small variation in interestrates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation inspending.As a consequence, by late 1982, M1 was de-emphasized and policy decisions perforce became more discretionary. However, in recognition of the longer-run relationship ofprices and M2, especially its stable long-term velocity, this broader aggregate was accordedmore weight, along with a variety of other indicators, in setting our policy stance.As an indicator, M2 served us well for a number of years. But by the early 1990s,its usefulness was undercut by the increased attractiveness and availability of alternative outletsfor saving, such as bond and stock mutual funds, and by mounting financial difficulties fordepositories and depositors that led to a restructuring of business and household balance sheets.The apparent result was a significant rise in the velocity of M2, which was especially unusualgiven continuing declines in short-term market interest rates. By 1993, this extraordinaryvelocity behavior had become so pronounced that the Federal Reserve was forced to begindisregarding the signals M2 was sending, at least for the time being.BIS Review   79/1997
- 3 -Data since mid-1994 do seem to show the re-emergence of a relationship of M2with nominal income and short-term interest rates similar to that experienced during the threedecades of the 1960s through the 1980s. As I indicated to the Congress recently, however, theperiod of predictable velocity is too brief to justify restoring M2 to its role of earlier years,though clearly persistent outsized changes would get our attention.Increasingly since 1982 we have been setting the funds rate directly in response toa wide variety of factors and forecasts. We recognize that, in fixing the short-term rate, we losemuch of the information on the balance of money supply and demand that changing market ratesafford, but for the moment we see no alternative. In the current state of our knowledge, moneydemand has become too difficult to predict.Although our operating target is a nominal short-term rate, we view its linkages tospending and prices as indirect and complex. For one, arguably, it is real, not nominal, rates thatare more relevant to spending. For another, spending, prices and other economic variablesrespond to a whole host of financial variables. Hence, in judging the stance of policy weroutinely look at the financial impulses coming from foreign exchange, bond, and equitymarkets, along with supply conditions in credit markets generally, including at financialintermediaries.Nonetheless, we recognize that inflation is fundamentally a monetaryphenomenon, and ultimately determined by the growth of the stock of money, not by nominal orreal interest rates. In current circumstances, however, determining which financial data shouldbe aggregated to provide an appropriate empirical proxy for the money stock that tracks incomeand spending represents a severe challenge for monetary analysts.The absence of a monetary aggregate anchor, however, has not left policycompletely adrift. From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitmentto contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raisinginflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.Within that framework we have attempted not only to lean against the potential for anoverheating economy, but also to cushion shortfalls in economic growth. And, recognizing thelags in the effects of policy, we have tried to move in anticipation of such disequilibriadeveloping.But this is a very general framework and does not present clear guidance forday-to-day policy decisions. Thus, as the historic relationship between measured money supplyand spending deteriorated, policymaking, seeing no alternative, turned more eclectic anddiscretionary.Nonetheless, we try to develop as best we can a stable conceptual framework, sopolicy actions are as regular and predictable as possible -- that is, governed by systematicbehavior but open to evidence of structural macroeconomic changes that require policy to adapt.The application of such an approach is illustrated by a number of disparate eventswe have confronted since 1982 that were in some important respects outside our previousexperience. In the early and mid-1980s, the FOMC faced most notably the sharp swings in fiscalpolicy, the unprecedented rise and fall of the dollar, and the associated shifts in internationaltrade and capital flows. But I will concentrate on several events of the last decade where Ipersonally participated in forming the judgments used in policy implementation.BIS Review   79/1997
- 4 -One such event was the stock market crash of October 1987 shortly after Iarrived. Unlike many uncertain situations that have confronted monetary policy, there was littlequestion that the appropriate central bank action was to ease policy significantly. We knew wewould soon have to sop up the excess liquidity that we added to the system, but the timing and, Ibelieve, the magnitude of our actions were among our easier decisions. Our concerns at that timereflected questions about how the financial markets and the economy would respond to theshock of a decline of more than one-fifth in stock prices in one day, and whether monetarypolicy alone could stabilize the system. By the early spring of 1988 it was evident that theeconomy had stabilized and we needed to begin reversing the easy stance of policy.Another development that confronted policy was the commercial property pricebust of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since a large volume of bank and thrift loans was tied tothe real estate market and backed by real estate collateral, the fall in property prices impaired thecapital of a large number of depositories. These institutions reacted by curtailing new lending --the unprecedented “credit crunch” of 1990 and 1991.Not unexpectedly, our policy response was to move toward significant ease. Ourprimary concern was the state of the credit markets and the economy, but we could also see thatthese broader issues were linked inextricably to the state of depository institutions’ balancesheets and profitability. A satisfactory recovery from the recession of that period, in ourjudgment, required the active participation of a viable banking system. The extraordinarycircumstances dictated a highly unusual path for monetary policy. The stance of policy easedsubstantially even after the economy began to recover from the 1990-91 recession, and astimulative policy was deliberately maintained well into the early expansion period.By mid-1993, however, property prices stabilized and the credit crunch graduallybegan to dissipate. It was clear as the year moved toward a close that monetary policy,characterized by a real federal funds rate of virtually zero, was now far too easy in light of thestrengthening economy on the horizon. Financial and economic conditions were returning tomore traditional relationships, and policy had to shift from a situation-specific formulation toone based more closely on previous historical patterns. Although it was difficult at that time todiscern any overt inflationary signals, the balance of risks, in our judgment, clearly dictatedpre-emptive action.The 1994 to 1995 period was most instructive. It appears we were successful inmoving pre-emptively to throttle down an impending unstable boom, which almost surely wouldhave resulted in the current expansion coming to an earlier halt. Because this was the firstchange in the stance of policy after a prolonged period of unusual ease, we took special care tospell out our analysis and expectations for policy in an unusually explicit way to inform themarkets well before we began to tighten. In addition, we began for the first time to issueexplanatory statements as changes in the stance of policy were implemented. Even so, the ideaof tightening to head off inflation before it was visible in the data was not universally applaudedor perhaps understood.Financial markets reacted unusually strongly to our 1994 policy actions, oftenratcheting up their expectations for further rate increases when we actually tightened, resultingin very large increases in longer-term interest rates. At the time, these reactions seemed to reflectthe extent to which investment strategies had been counting on a persistence of low interestrates. This was a classic case in which we had to be careful not to allow market expectations ofFederal Reserve actions to be major elements of policy determination. We are always concernedabout assuming that short-term movements in market prices are reflections of changes inBIS Review   79/1997
- 5 -underlying supply and demand conditions when we may be observing nothing more thanfluctuating expectations about our own policy actions.Most recently, the economy has demonstrated a remarkable confluence of robustgrowth, high resource utilization, and damped inflation. Once again we have been faced withanalyzing and reacting to a situation in which incoming data have not readily conformed tohistorical experience.Specifically, the persistence of rising profit margins in the face of stable or fallinginflation raises the question of what is happening to productivity. If data on profits and prices areeven approximately accurate, total consolidated corporate unit costs have, of necessity, beenmaterially contained. With labor costs constituting three-fourths of costs, unless growth incompensation per hour is falling, which seems most unlikely from other information, it isdifficult to avoid the conclusion that output per hour has to be rising at a pace significantly inexcess of the officially published annual growth rate of nonfarm productivity of one percentover recent quarters. The degree to which these data may be understated is underlined bybacking out from the total what appears to be a reasonably accurate, or at least consistent,measure of productivity of corporate businesses. The level of nonfarm noncorporate productivityimplied by this exercise has been falling continuously since 1973 despite reasonable earningsmargins for proprietorships and partnerships. Presumably this reflects the significant upwardbias in our measurement of service prices, which dominate our noncorporate sector.Nonetheless, the still open question is whether productivity growth is in theprocess of picking up. For it is the answer to this question that is material to the current debatebetween those who argue that the economy is entering a “new era” of greatly enhancedsustainable growth and unusually high levels of resource utilization, and those who do not.A central bank, while needing to be open to evidence of structural economicchange, also needs to be cautious. Supplying excess liquidity to support growth that turns out tohave been ephemeral would undermine the very good economic performance we have enjoyed.We raised the federal funds rate in March to help protect against this latter possibility, and withlabor resources currently stretched tight, we need to remain on alert.Whatever its successes, the current monetary policy regime is far from ideal. Eachepisode has had to be treated as unique or nearly so. It may have been the best we could do at themoment. But we continuously examine alternatives that might better anchor policy, so that itbecomes less subject to the abilities of the Federal Open Market Committee to analyzedevelopments and make predictions.Gold was such an anchor or rule, prior to World War I, but it was firstcompromised and eventually abandoned because it restrained the type of discretionary monetaryand fiscal policies that modern democracies appear to value.A fixed, or even adaptive, rule on the expansion of the monetary base wouldanchor the system, but it is hard to envision acceptance for that approach because it also limitseconomic policy discretion. Moreover, flows of U.S. currency abroad, which are variable anddifficult to estimate, and bank reserves avoidance are subverting any relationship that mighthave existed between growth in the monetary base and U.S. economic performance.BIS Review   79/1997
- 6 -Another type of rule using readings on output and prices to help guide monetarypolicy, such as John Taylor’s, has attracted widening interest in recent years in the financialmarkets, the academic community, and at central banks.Taylor-type rules or reaction functions have a number of attractive features. Theyassume that central banks can appropriately pay attention simultaneously to developments inboth output and inflation, provided their reactions occur in the context of a longer-run goal ofprice stability and that they recognize that activity is limited by the economy’s sustainablepotential.As Taylor himself has pointed out, these types of formulations are at best“guideposts” to help central banks, not inflexible rules that eliminate discretion. One reason isthat their formulation depends on the values of certain key variables -- most crucially theequilibrium real federal funds rate and the production potential of the economy. In practice thesehave been obtained by observation of past macroeconomic behavior -- either through informalinspection of the data, or more formally as embedded in models. In that sense, like all rules, as Inoted earlier, they embody a forecast that the future will be like the past. Unfortunately,however, history is not an infallible guide to the future, and the levels of these two variables arecurrently under active debate.The mechanics of monetary policy that I have been addressing are merely meansto an end. What are we endeavoring to achieve, and why? The goal of macroeconomic policyshould be maximum sustainable growth over the long term, and evidence has continued toaccumulate around the world that price stability is a necessary condition for the achievement ofthat goal.Beyond this very general statement, however, lie difficult issues of concept andmeasurement for policymakers and academicians to keep us occupied for the next fifteen yearsand more.Inflation impairs economic efficiency in part because people have difficultyseparating movements in relative prices from movements in the general price level. But whatprices matter? Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced -- our basic measureof inflation -- matter. But what about prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities,real estate or other earning assets? Is stability in the average level of these prices essential to thestability of the economy? Recent Japanese economic history only underlines the difficulty andimportance of this question. The prices of final goods and services were stable in Japan in themid-to-late 1980s, but soaring asset prices distorted resource allocation and ultimatelyundermined the performance of the macroeconomy.In the United States, evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balancesheets and variations in asset prices has been an integral part of the development of monetarypolicy. In recent years, for example, we have expended considerable effort to understand theimplications of changes in household balance sheets in the form of high and rising consumerdebt burdens and increases in market wealth from the run-up in the stock market. And the equitymarket itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications forfinancial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices -- a rise basedapparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations’ already robustlong-term earning prospects. But, unless they are moving together, prices of assets and of goodsand services cannot both be an objective of a particular monetary policy, which, after all, hasone effective instrument -- the short-term interest rate. We have chosen product prices as ourBIS Review   79/1997
- 7 -primary focus on the grounds that stability in the average level of these prices is likely to beconsistent with financial stability as well as maximum sustainable growth. History, however, issomewhat ambiguous on the issue of whether central banks can safely ignore asset markets,except as they affect product prices.Over the coming decades, moreover, what constitutes product price and, hence,price stability will itself become harder to measure.When industrial product was the centerpiece of the economy during the firsttwo-thirds of this century, our overall price indexes served us well. Pricing a pound ofelectrolytic copper presented few definitional problems. The price of a ton of cold rolled steelsheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over aperiod of years.I have already noted the problems in defining price and output and, hence, inmeasuring productivity over the past twenty years. The simple notion of price has turneddecidedly complex. What is the price of a unit of software or of a medical procedure? How doesone evaluate the price change of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature ofthe procedure and its impact on the patient has been altered so radically? The pace of change andthe shifting to harder-to-measure types of output are more likely to quicken than to slow down.Indeed, how will we measure inflation in the future when our data -- using current techniques --could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?However, so long as individuals make contractual arrangements for futurepayments valued in dollars and other currencies, there must be a presumption on the part ofthose involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter howcomplex individual products become, there will always be some general sense of the purchasingpower of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence, we must assume thatembodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable toproducers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions.The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds does not solve the problem of pinningdown an economically meaningful measure of the general price level. While there is, of course,an inflation expectation premium embodied in all nominal interest rates, it is fundamentallyunobservable. Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes,which may or may not reflect the market’s judgment of the future purchasing power of money.To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the oppositedirection.Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of measurement to unearth those trueprices as the years go on. It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even iffaulty price indexes fail to reveal it.It should be evident from my remarks that ample challenges will continue to face monetarypolicy. I have concentrated on how we have tried to identify and analyze new developments, andendeavored to use that analysis to fashion and balance policy responses. I have also tried tohighlight the questions about how to specify and measure the ultimate goals of policy.Nonetheless, all of us could easily add to the list. In dealing with these issues, policy can onlybenefit from focused and relevant academic research. I look forward to learning about andutilizing the contributions made under the sponsorship of the Center for Economic PolicyResearch over the years to come.BIS Review   79/1997
BIS Review   78/1997Mr. Brash discusses fluctuations and long-term trends in exchange rates andtheir effects on export commodities and comments on the Reserve Bank’s MonetaryConditions Index   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. DonaldBrash, to the Counties Kiwifruit Growers Association in Pukekohe on 22/8/97.Mr Chairman, I am delighted to be back in Pukekohe, though I must admit I’drather be next door in my orchard instead of in here, explaining the impact of monetary policyon the fruit-growing industry!Two months ago, when you asked me to speak this afternoon, you asked me tofocus on exchange rates. In particular, you suggested I speak about ‘fluctuations and long termtrends in exchange rates and their effects on export commodity pricing’. I am happy to do that,but I also want to make a few comments on the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Conditions Index,both because it is relevant to the subject you have asked me to address and because the MCI hasbecome the subject of a good deal of public discussion and debate over the last month or two.Indeed, some claim it is only the Reserve Bank’s obsession with the MCI that has seenexchange rate and interest rates pushed around in a rather volatile manner over the last couple ofmonths.The exchange rateFirst let me talk a little about the exchange rate. Here the concerns seem to bepartly about fluctuations in the exchange rate and partly about the long-term trends, as yoursuggested subject for my speech indicates.I have to say that I do not have a great deal of sympathy for those who complainabout the fluctuations in the exchange rate, and that for two quite different reasons. First, andmost obviously, there is now a very well-developed market in forward foreign exchangecontracts, so that it is readily possible for exporters to fix the exchange rate at which they selltheir products long before they actually want to repatriate the proceeds to New Zealand.Exporters may, of course, choose not to use that market and instead gamble that they might geta more favourable exchange rate at some stage in the future. They should be free to make thatchoice. But it is important to recognise that they are deliberately taking on foreign exchangerisk in the hope of getting something better in the future. They are not obliged to gamble in thisway.This point is perhaps particularly relevant at the moment, when a number offarmers are lamenting the fact that, while the exchange rate is now much more attractive, thatdoesn’t help farmers because few have stock to sell at the moment. But there is nothing at allstopping farmers who have no stock to sell, or meat companies on their behalf, from buyingforeign exchange forward at the currently prevailing rates, and locking in current exchangerates. By doing that, they eliminate the risk that the exchange rate may rise before their stock isready for sale, but of course they also pass up the additional benefit they might get if theexchange rate were to fall further.Secondly, although the New Zealand dollar has been subject to quite markedfluctuations over the last few months, by and large the New Zealand dollar is not a volatilecurrency by the standards of other floating rate currencies. Certainly measured on a trade-weighted basis, the New Zealand dollar has in recent years been less volatile on a week-to-weekbasis than, say, the Australian dollar, the US dollar, the pound sterling, or the Japanese yen.
- 2 -BIS Review   78/1997What about the longer-term trends? Since at least the beginning of the seventies,the trade-weighted measure of the New Zealand dollar has tended to move to reflect differencesbetween inflation in New Zealand and inflation in our trading partners (graph 1).4060801001201401607072747678808284868890929496406080100120140160Nominal TWIForeign/Domestic price levelIndexIndexGraph 1: Relative Consumer Prices and Nominal TWI(1970 - June 1997 average equals 100)In other words, when inflation was higher than in our trading partners, the NewZealand dollar had a tendency to depreciate. When inflation was lower than in our tradingpartners, the New Zealand dollar had a tendency to appreciate. Occasionally, the exchange rate4060801001201401607072747678808284868890929496406080100120140160Nominal TWIForeign/Domestic price level'Real' exchange rate IndexIndexGraph 2: Nominal and 'Real' Trade Weighted Exchange Rate(1970 - June 1997 average equals 100)
- 3 -BIS Review   78/1997would depreciate a little faster than seemed warranted by a relatively poor inflation performancein New Zealand, and exporters enjoyed the experience. Occasionally, as in the period from early1993 to early 1997, the exchange rate appreciated faster than seemed warranted by a relativelygood inflation performance, and exporters found the experience anything but enjoyable (graph2).If historical relationships hold, one would expect the New Zealand dollar tomove broadly in line with inflation differentials over the longer term, and a few months ago thisled a number of commentators to suggest that, at that time, the New Zealand dollar was clearlyover-valued. Last December I also expressed the view that, at that time, the New Zealand dollardid indeed seem somewhat over-valued on that basis, though it should be noted that, to theextent that productivity growth is higher in New Zealand than in our trading partners, onewould expect to see the exchange rate rise somewhat faster than inflation differentials alonewould suggest.I have no difficulty at all in acknowledging the fact that the appreciation in theNew Zealand dollar from its floor of around 53 (on a trade-weighted basis) in January 1993 to69.3 in March 1997, an increase of some 30 percent over just four years, put significant pressureon a great many exporters. But four points need to be made in qualification.First, it is very likely that an exchange rate of 53 on a trade-weighted basis wasas unsustainable as an exchange rate of 69.3. Neither represents an ‘equilibrium’ level of theexchange rate, so to measure exchange rate appreciation from that artificially low level riskscreating quite a false impression.Secondly, while acknowledging the pressure which the rising exchange rate from1993 to early 1997 placed on exporters, I am bound to express a degree of cynicism about theway in which some producer boards have described this impact. To hear some tell it, the impactof the rising exchange rate on the gross incomes of farmers and orchardists is the same as theimpact of the exchange rate on their net incomes, and of course that it not correct. Granted, ourland-based export industries are not heavy users of imports, but they do use diesel, they do usetractors, they do use fertilisers, and they are heavily affected by the costs of transport to andfrom the farm-gate. And from their net incomes they still spend money on petrol for the familycar, they still buy clothes, they still buy other goods which are imported. The New Zealanddollar price of all these items would have been significantly higher over the last few years had itnot been for the appreciation of the currency. Indeed, it is very likely that wage increases wouldalso have been significantly higher if there had been no currency appreciation. So while theincrease in the New Zealand dollar in recent years has undoubtedly had a severe impact ongross farm incomes, the impact on farmers’ living standards was rather less severe.Thirdly, while the exchange rate appreciation has clearly made matters worse, thebasic problem facing our land-based exporters is that the inflation-adjusted, or real, price ofmany of the items which they produce has been declining, and that for a long period. The NewZealand Meat and Wool Boards’ Economic Service tells me that between 1948 (prior to theKorean War boom) and 1996, the inflation-adjusted price of lamb fell by 45 percent in the USmarket; the price of dairy products fell by 55 percent; the price of beef fell by 69 percent; andthe price of wool fell by 79 percent. I don’t know that anybody was noticing the price ofkiwifruit in the US market in 1948, but I can still recall that in 1982, just 15 years ago, theorchard-gate price of New Zealand kiwifruit was $11 per tray. Nobody yet knows what we willrealise in 1997, but if the orchard-gate price for this year’s crop is, say, $4.30 per tray, that willbe an inflation-adjusted fall in the orchard-gate price of some 85 percent in just 15 years - and
- 4 -BIS Review   78/1997that over a period during which the New Zealand dollar has fallen quite substantially against thecurrencies of virtually all our trading partners, and especially against the Japanese yen and theGerman mark, the two currencies of most direct relevance to kiwifruit exports. The basic realityis that the market price of kiwifruit has fallen substantially over that time.And in case New Zealand exporters feel hard done by by this reality, rememberthat very substantial falls in inflation-adjusted prices are common for most commodities, andindeed for a great many other goods and services as well. Productivity improves, andinternational competition often ensures that the benefit of that improvement is passed on toconsumers, rather than retained by producers. Reflect on the huge fall in the real price ofcomputers - a fall which dwarfs the falls suffered by New Zealand land-based exporters - or theprice of television sets, or of motor vehicles, or of international air travel, or of long-distancetelephone calls. Large price falls are by no means unique to the products which New Zealandexports. To remain viable, all producers must be constantly seeking new ways to improveproductivity or add value, and if they do that successfully, they can maintain profitabilitydespite a trend decline in prices.Finally, apart altogether from the tendency for the prices of many commodities todecline in the long term, commodity prices tend to be volatile and in recent years this volatilityhas tended to swamp the impact of exchange rate trends. The best illustration is the experienceof beef farmers in the three years to the middle of 1996: of the fall in the farm-gate price of bullbeef over that period, more than three-quarters was caused by a fall in overseas market prices,and less than one-quarter by the rise in the exchange rate. In other words, the fall in the marketprice of bull beef was substantially greater in its impact on farmers than the effect of theincrease in the exchange rate. Our land-based exporters operate in inherently volatile markets,and would face major swings in prices even if, in some way, the New Zealand dollar could beheld absolutely stable. This should influence what can sensibly be paid for farming andorcharding assets.So yes, monetary policy does have an impact on the exchange rate, but that inturn has much less impact on exporters’ net incomes than on gross incomes, and has been ofvery much less significance to land-based exporters than the fluctuations in internationalcommodity prices and the long-term decline in the real prices of many of the commoditieswhich New Zealand exports.The Monetary Conditions IndexBut what of the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Conditions Index? Is the MCI, as somehave suggested, really to blame for much of the current economic slowdown, or at very least forthe sharp increase in interest rates recently?Before answering those questions, it is worth recalling briefly that, once everythree months, the Reserve Bank does a comprehensive projection of the New Zealand economyand of inflation for a period of two or three years. That projection takes into account all theinformation available to the Bank at that time - the official statistics covering GDP, prices,wages, employment, imports, exports, and all the rest; the data collected by the Bank itself onthe money and credit aggregates, and the path of interest and exchange rates; the survey datacovering business and consumer confidence; the views expressed to us, formally andinformally, about individual businesses and the economy; and much more. At the end of thatprocess, we reach a view on how firm monetary conditions need to be to keep inflation movingtowards the middle part of the 0 to 3 percent inflation target we have agreed with Government.
- 5 -BIS Review   78/1997But of course neither we nor any other central bank can control the mix ofmonetary conditions. In other words, we can tighten monetary conditions, but we can notdetermine whether that tightening takes the form of an increase in interest rates with little or noincrease in the exchange rate; or an increase in the exchange rate with little or no increase ininterest rates; or an increase in the exchange rate with a decrease in interest rates; or an increasein interest rates and a fall in the exchange rate. The mix depends on the perceptions andreactions of a great many people, here and abroad, and indeed on what other central banks aredoing or are expected to do.What to do? In a small open economy like New Zealand, it is impossible toignore the fact that monetary policy affects inflation through both interest rates and theexchange rate, and for a number of years we have factored that into our policy setting. What theMonetary Conditions Index seeks to do is to give the public and financial markets a broadindication of how we see the relative impact of interest rates and the exchange rate onmedium-term inflation with a ‘rule of thumb’ combining both. Nobody can be dogmatic aboutthe precise nature of this relative impact - it clearly differs between economies depending on theimportance of international trade, and almost certainly varies depending on the stage of theeconomic cycle. On the basis of research to date we believe it is reasonable to suggest that a1 percent increase in 90 day interest rates has roughly the same effect on inflation, in themedium-term, as a 2 percent increase in the (trade-weighted) exchange rate. This ratio isparticularly helpful in helping us to assess how the overall degree of monetary restraint isevolving when interest rates and the exchange rate are moving in opposite directions, as hasoften been the case over the last year.In June this year, we expressed this relationship in numerical form, called it theMonetary Conditions Index, and indicated that our projected inflation track was based onmonetary conditions being at 825 on that Index through the September quarter.Has this increased openness been constructive or destructive? On balance, I haveno doubt that it has been constructive. Financial markets now know explicitly what in the pastthey could only guess at, namely how we ‘translated’ movements in exchange rates intomovements in interest rates in assessing their effect on inflation. In the last few months, wehave experienced the sharpest decline in the New Zealand dollar since late 1991 without anykind of drama or crisis. Interest rates have adjusted upwards to offset the effect of thatdepreciation on the medium-term inflation rate, and that with only a couple of brief commentsfrom the Reserve Bank. Of course, a sharp fall in the exchange rate is almost inevitably going tobe associated with rising interest rates, since the fall is likely to prompt many investors to wantto withdraw funds from New Zealand investments, and this inevitably leads to higher interestrates. But the fact that interest rates moved to keep the MCI broadly unchanged - certainly overthe sharpest movements in the exchange rate - suggests that the system has worked well. For therecord, I think the MCI is working at least as well as other approaches - better in some respects- and I am in no hurry to change it.Let me put this another way. I’m sure that if the Reserve Bank had not publishedan MCI actual monetary conditions would have evolved in a broadly similar way, but probablywith more anguish. Without the early interest rate reaction, the exchange rate fall would haveleft monetary conditions very much looser than we wanted. We would then have had to move torecover the lost ground by tightening policy, probably requiring specific policy actions. In otherwords, the MCI is only an indicator. It isn’t driving events in a substantive way, so people
- 6 -BIS Review   78/1997blaming the MCI are misdirecting their complaints. Give me stick, if you want, for misreadinginflationary pressures out there, but ‘don’t shoot the messenger’, for that’s all the MCI is.What of criticism that the Bank has been operating the MCI mechanistically, orrobotically, and thus causing excessive volatility in financial markets? Should the Bank havebeen more willing than it has been to allow actual monetary conditions to diverge from itsannounced ‘desired’ conditions of 825, or, alternatively, should we have adjusted policyinstruments to ensure that actual conditions kept within the plus or minus 50 points of 825announced as ‘desired’ on 27 June?It is perhaps worth recalling what I said on 27 June, in releasing our latestMonetary Policy Statement:‘It is clear that deviations from desired monetary conditions can be very largeindeed without threatening either edge of our inflation target if those deviationsare of relatively short duration. This suggests that the Bank should be relativelytolerant of quite large deviations from desired. On the other hand, largedeviations, even for relatively short periods, may raise doubts - either about theBank’s determination to achieve the inflation goals we have been set or about thepossibility that the Bank, in accepting those large deviations, may have changedits view of desired conditions. These doubts can create uncertainty, and thatuncertainty has real costs, both short-term and long-term. We already allowmonetary conditions to move within a range, without reaction from the Bank,which is at least as wide as that allowed in other developed countries.I am reluctant to be too precise about how much deviation we are willing toaccept and for how long. Much will depend on the circumstances in which thedeviation occurs. We may, for example, be more tolerant of deviations whichappear to arise out of sharp movements in overseas exchange rates, where localinterest rates or exchange rates may take a brief period to adjust. We may bemore tolerant of deviations during the weeks immediately preceding our nextquarterly inflation projection, since it is at that time when our last comprehensivereview of desired conditions is, by definition, getting most dated. We are likelyto be less tolerant if monetary conditions change very rapidly, and appear to bebuilding some momentum, without any obvious explanation in terms of overseasexchange rates or changed prospects for inflation.As a very approximate guideline, we would expect actual monetary conditions tobe within a range of plus or minus 50 MCI points from desired in the weeksimmediately following a comprehensive inflation projection. As more datacomes to hand over the ensuing three months, and as our last comprehensiveinflation projection recedes into history, we may be rather more tolerant. But thisis not, repeat not, a binding rule which the market can expect us to follow underall circumstances, and those expecting us to do so are likely to be disappointed.’That is what I said on 27 June, and looking back with the wisdom of hindsight Ithink the comments have stood the test of time rather well. Did we signal a tight band of plus orminus 50 points around ‘desired’? Hardly. On the contrary, we made it clear that we wouldjudge monetary conditions in the light of emerging data, and the factors we believed weredriving conditions. Should we therefore leap to change the target for settlement cash as soon as
- 7 -BIS Review   78/1997conditions stray by more than 50 points from the designated level? Absolutely not, and nobodyshould expect us to do so.My only regret is that I did not mention, as one reason for being tolerant ofdeviation of actual monetary conditions from desired monetary conditions, the complicationcreated by a sharp change in the mix of conditions. Clearly, the Index is based on theassumption that a 1 percent movement in interest rates is equivalent, in medium-term effect, to a2 percent change in the exchange rate, and that is our best estimate at this stage. But it is only anestimate, and we recognise that the relationship may well change over time and in response tovery sharp movements in either interest or exchange rates. In the jargon, the relationship maynot be linear. It is partly for this reason that we have been willing to accept quite a markeddivergence between actual and desired conditions in recent weeks.It is important also to recall that, as indicated a moment ago, we can not controlthe mix of monetary conditions. This was very clearly indicated between September 1996 andMarch 1997. Over that period, 90 day interest rates fell from around 10 percent to around 7.5percent, while the exchange rate rose from around 66 on the Trade-Weighted Index to over 69.On the face of it, this period of rising exchange rate and falling interest rates was the veryreverse of what might have been desirable - given that there was already little or no inflation inthe export and import-competing sectors of the economy, and plenty of inflation in the domesticsectors - and I expressed my unhappiness about this mix on several occasions, all to no avail.For a whole host of reasons - perceptions of the likely trend of monetary policy in New Zealandand overseas, perhaps concerns about the balance of payments deficit, perhaps general concernabout currencies in this part of the world - the mix has changed quite sharply in the last fewmonths, with an increase in interest rates, which has taken them about half way back to wherethey were last September, and a sharp fall in the exchange rate. Overall, conditions have easedconsiderably, and I am sure that there won’t be an exporter in the country who is not a gooddeal happier with the present mix than with the one we had three or four months ago.But aren’t monetary conditions still too tight, given the low level of business andconsumer confidence, the general flatness of the economy, and the fact that, on the ReserveBank’s own figures, we will have inflation at or slightly below 1 percent by the end of this yearand into 1998?In less than a month, the Bank will be publishing its next comprehensive inflationprojection, so I don’t want to give a substantive answer to that at this stage. But let me justremind you of a couple of relevant points.It is hardly surprising, or a matter for regret, that our June Monetary PolicyStatement projected that inflation would fall to 1 percent by the end  of this year: through all oflast year, until 10 December, we were targeting inflation at between 0 and 2 percent, with amid-point of 1 percent, because that’s what our Policy Targets Agreement with the Governmentrequired at that time. We were battling to reduce inflation, which had been somewhat above thetop of that range throughout 1996. Given that it takes a minimum of 12 months for monetarypolicy to have its impact on inflation, it would be surprising if inflation were not projected to bemoving towards 1 percent at the end of this year.The inflation projection which the Bank published at the end of June was notonly based on monetary conditions being around 825 on the MCI during the September 1997quarter, it was also based on a particular combination of interest rates and exchange rate. Weassumed that, during the September quarter, the trade-weighted exchange rate would average
- 8 -BIS Review   78/1997around 67.3, and 90 day interest rates would average around 7 percent. We also explicitlyrecognised that if the mix of conditions changed, the short-term track of inflation could bedifferent. With the exchange rate in fact significantly lower than assumed in the June MonetaryPolicy Statement, and interest rates significantly higher than assumed, it is possible that theimmediate inflation track may be a little higher than projected in June because of the impactwhich the lower New Zealand dollar may have on the prices of goods like television sets, cars,and other imports. In other words, a lower dollar may increase inflation more quickly thanhigher interest rates will reduce it.Although there are many people who feel that monetary conditions areinappropriately tight, and some who just feel that the combined wisdom of financial markets ismore likely to be right than is the Reserve Bank, it is worth recalling that for the first fourmonths of 1997, until the very end of April, financial markets kept monetary conditionsappreciably tighter than the Bank had indicated was necessary or appropriate, despite our sayingthat we would be happier if conditions were somewhat easier. In other words, financial marketsare not infallible. It is interesting that in the latest Consensus survey of New Zealandforecasters, representing views in mid-July 1997, 39 percent felt that conditions were undulyfirm, but 54 percent felt that they were about right - and conditions have eased somewhat sincethat survey was conducted.Monetary conditions have eased substantially over the last six or eight months -from an average of 1000 on the MCI in the December 1996 quarter to an average during thefirst half of August of 730. Put in more familiar terms, conditions have eased by the equivalentof a 2.7 percent fall in interest rates with unchanged exchange rate; or by the equivalent of a 5.4percent fall in the exchange rate, with unchanged interest rates. This is a considerable easing inmonetary conditions, which will not have its main effect on activity and inflation until well into1998 - at about the time the economy is also experiencing a strong stimulus from reduced taxrates and increased government expenditure. In other words, the suggestion that the ReserveBank has been braking the economy in recent months is factually wrong. In fact, over recentmonths the opposite is true.We will, of course, be weighing all these factors and more in reaching ourjudgement for the appropriate level of monetary conditions in the December quarter. We willpublish our considered judgement on 18 September. Unfortunately, given the long lags betweenactions taken by the Reserve Bank today and the impact of those actions on inflation, nobodywill know until at least the second half of next year whether we should have eased rather morein June 1997, or indeed whether we should have kept things a little firmer.Of one thing you can be certain. We will do everything in our power to keepinflation within the target which has been agreed with the Government. That will not guaranteeyou a profit in fruit-growing, or in exporting more generally. It will, however, be the bestcontribution which the Reserve Bank can make to the creation of an environment where youand others can make rational investment decisions, to the ultimate benefit of all NewZealanders.
BIS Review   78/1997Bank of Japan’s summary of the annual review of monetary and economicdevelopments in fiscal 1996   BANK OF JAPAN, ANNUAL REVIEW 1997.OverviewJapan’s economy followed a moderate recovery trend in fiscal 1996. The pace ofrecovery began to accelerate at the end of 1995, aided by substantially stimulative monetary andfiscal policy measures, and the recovery continued in fiscal 1996. In the second half of the fiscalyear, the economic recovery firmed, particularly in private demand, driven in part by thedepreciation of the yen since the previous year.With respect to final demand in the first half of fiscal 1996, net exports declinedsharply, reflecting such factors as the appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995 and theincrease in imports of manufactured goods from Japanese affiliates overseas. However, theeconomic recovery was underpinned by policy-related demand factors, such as the increase inpublic-sector investment reflecting the economic stimulus package of autumn 1995, and thehigh level of housing investment induced by low interest rates.  In the middle of fiscal 1996,public-sector investment began to decline gradually from its peak, while net exports, which hadbeen restraining the economic recovery, started to rise, partly reflecting the depreciation of theyen. Regarding private demand, business fixed investment increased steadily throughout thefiscal year, reflecting recovery in corporate profits, progress in stock adjustments, and a rise inautonomous investment, such as in information technology, and the increase spread acrossindustries from large manufacturing firms to small nonmanufacturing firms. Personalconsumption followed a moderate recovery trend in line with a recovery in compensation ofemployees despite fluctuations caused by factors such as the weather. From autumn 1996,automobile sales, which have a large influence on production, accelerated. Housing investmentremained high, owing both to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption taxrate, implemented in April 1997, and to low interest rates.Industrial production remained virtually unchanged until the middle of 1996,reflecting the decrease in net exports, and adjustments in the excessive inventories of someproducer goods. However, growth in production has gradually gathered pace since the middle ofthe year, as private demand has increased steadily, net exports have begun to increase, and theincrease in final demand has led more directly to a rise in production because of progress ininventory adjustments. At the end of the fiscal year, both industrial production and shipmentsrecovered to the levels recorded at the previous peak in the economic cycle reflecting theincrease in demand before the rise in the consumption tax rate. In these circumstances,corporate profits continued to recover primarily among large manufacturing firms, driven inpart by a rise in profits of processing industries reflecting the depreciation of the yen and thesuccess of corporate restructuring efforts. Business confidence also improved gradually,according to the Bank of Japan’s “Tankan—Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises inJapan.” The improvement in profits of large manufacturing firms was reflected in an increase intheir expenditures, which in turn contributed to a recovery in the business conditions ofcorporate service industries and small manufacturing firms. As for labor market conditions, theunemployment rate remained high and growth in the number of the regularly employedstagnated owing to persistent adjustment pressures on personnel expenses in the corporatesector. However, overtime working hours and the number of new job offers increased steadily,reflecting production growth and improvements in corporate profits, and compensation ofemployees rose gradually, particularly in special cash earnings. In sum, the overall labor marketconditions followed a recovery trend.
- 2 -BIS Review   78/1997While substantially stimulative monetary and fiscal policy measures in fiscal1995 continued to underpin economic recovery in early fiscal 1996, a positive cycle of demand,production, and income began to operate, underpinning the economic recovery throughout fiscal1996. That is, an increase in final demand pushed up production and led to an improvement incorporate profits, particularly among large manufacturing firms. This in turn led to animprovement in profits and a rise in compensation of employees among nonmanufacturingfirms and small firms, thereby expanding expenditures. During the second half of fiscal 1996,the recovery in private demand firmed, reflecting the positive effects of the depreciation of theyen on corporate profits, despite a decrease in public-sector investment. In other words,although the pace of the economic recovery remained moderate, a recovery led by policydemand is gradually shifting toward one led by private demand.Although Japan’s economy bottomed out at the end of 1993, the pace of recoveryremains relatively moderate, owing to various structural adjustment pressures on industries.These include (1) pressures for the industrial structure to change in response to globalcompetition resulting from the expansion of supply capacity in Asian countries, and to theconstant appreciation of the yen until the middle of 1995; and (2) balance-sheet adjustmentpressures owing to the sharp and significant decline in asset prices since the bursting of theeconomic “bubble” in the late 1980s. Steady progress has been made in dealing with thepressures for the industrial structure to change, as reflected in (1) a significant improvement incorporate profits, particularly among large manufacturing firms, resulting from the successfulrestructuring efforts and the depreciation of the yen from the middle of 1995; (2) progress in thereorganization of the international production system as seen in the shift in Japan’s exports andproduction toward more capital- and technology-intensive goods; and (3) increased businessfixed investment in new sectors owing to technological innovations and deregulation ininformation and communications industries. With regard to balance-sheet adjustments, strongadjustment pressures remained throughout fiscal 1996, as seen in the persistently high level ofthe ratio of debts to assets, especially among small nonmanufacturing firms.In fiscal 1996, weakening of prices came to a halt. Domestic wholesale pricesfollowed a downward trend until the middle of 1996, but in the second half of fiscal 1996 theyvirtually stopped declining, owing to a moderate improvement in domestic supply and demandconditions, as well as a rise in import prices reflecting the depreciation of the yen and the rise incrude oil prices. In March 1997, the year-to-year change shifted from decline to increase.Although corporate service prices continued to decline compared to the level of the previousyear, reflecting the decrease in leasing prices and real estate rents, the year-to-year declineswere smaller in the second half of fiscal 1996, due to a recovery in demand for servicesfollowing the improvement in corporate profits. Consumer prices (nationwide, excludingperishables) also increased by a slightly wider margin from the previous year owing to a smallerdecline in commodity prices as a result of the depreciation of the yen, and the halt in the declinein domestic wholesale prices, as well as a gradual increase in service prices. While pricesseemed to have stopped declining, the increase in import prices from the depreciation of the yenand higher crude oil prices had little impact on domestic prices, as there remained persistentdownward pressures on prices from imports of manufactured goods, particularly final goods,and technological innovations. As for commercial land, prices for large and well-located plotsof land suitable for development virtually stopped declining owing mainly to the gradualprogress in stock adjustment for office space. However, the prices of smaller plots of land withlimited commercial value continued to decline. The recent development in commercial landprices thus indicates a distinct splitting into two groups. Meanwhile, residential land prices arebottoming out, reflecting the high level of residential housing construction.
- 3 -BIS Review   78/1997The cyclical momentum for economic recovery gathered strength in fiscal 1996.However, the pace of the recovery remained moderate owing to continued structural adjustmentpressures, including the balance-sheet problems. Although weakening of prices had come to ahalt by the second half of fiscal 1996, prices were unlikely to follow an upward trend. Againstthe background of these economic and price conditions, the Bank of Japan maintained an easymonetary policy, keeping the official discount rate at its September 1995 level of 0.5 percent toestablish a solid foundation for the economic recovery.As for financial developments, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) remainedon average slightly below the official discount rate following monetary adjustments by the Bankof Japan. Long-term interest rates continued to rise with some fluctuations in the first half of1996, but fell sharply in the second half. Interest rates on short-term instruments, namely3-month certificate of deposit (CD) rates, followed a similar trend, although with smallerfluctuations than those in long-term interest rates. Stock prices continued to rise during the firsthalf of 1996, but began to weaken in the summer, and fell sharply from the end of the year. Theyear-to-year growth rate of M2+CDs, a representative indicator of monetary aggregates,generally remained around 3.0-4.0 percent, but declined slightly in the second half of the fiscalyear, partly due to the slow growth in funding in the private sector.Despite the firm recovery of the real economy, particularly in the private sectorduring the second half of fiscal 1996, the financial markets during this period adopted a morecautious stance. This was because (1) the financial markets reacted in anticipation of the fiscaltightening measures—such as the rise in the consumption tax rate and the termination of specialtax reductions in fiscal 1997—and this had restraining effects on economic conditions; and(2) there was renewed awareness that various adjustment pressures, especially balance-sheetadjustment pressures, remained strong among small nonmanufacturing firms and financialinstitutions. Under these circumstances, the cyclical developments of the economic recoverywere not immediately reflected in financial indicators through the confidence of marketparticipants. Meanwhile, significant progress was made in fiscal 1996 in the solution of thejusen (housing loan companies) problem, and steady progress was also made in solving theproblem of nonperforming assets of financial institutions, including improvements in theframework for the resolution of failed financial institutions.With respect to the outlook, the probability that Japan’s economy will continue torecover is rising, although the pace of recovery may decelerate temporarily. This expectation isbased on the fact that the positive cycle of production and consumption has not been deterred bythe reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate rise. Despite thecontinued economic recovery, the private sector has not gained sufficient confidence in itsfuture growth, reflecting persistent uncertainty about structural adjustments. Under thestructural adjustment pressures, expected growth rates are unlikely to rise at the same pace indifferent industries and firms. However, from a long-term perspective, the establishment of anew industrial structure based on the principle of comparative advantage can be expected toenhance growth by promoting the efficiency of resource allocation.In order for Japan’s economy to achieve sustainable growth, it is vital to createinvestment opportunities and raise expected growth rates of economic entities through effectivereforms of the economic structure. Such efforts are essential in adapting to the medium- tolong-term changes in economic environment, including increasing global competitive pressures,and the further aging of the population, and in maintaining Japan’s economic strength.Considering the important role that the financial sector must play in the reforms of theeconomic structure, it will be necessary to continue implementing measures to stabilize the
- 4 -BIS Review   78/1997Japanese financial system, and increase domestic and overseas confidence in the system. At thesame time, the financial system must be reorganized to enhance its functions andcompetitiveness, by improving the infrastructure in order to promote competition in accordancewith the Japanese “Big Bang” deregulation package.
Mr. Reddy reports on the dilemmas of exchange rate management in IndiaInaugural Address by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. Y.V. Reddy, at theXIth National Assembly Forex Association of India held in Goa on 15/8/97.I am thankful to the organisers of the XIth National Assembly of the ForexAssociation of India for giving me an opportunity to share with you the dilemmas that we face inforeign exchange management. The fifty years since independence have seen significant changesin our exchange rate regime. The exchange rate policy has evolved from the rupee being peggedto the pound sterling until 1975, pegged to an undisclosed currency basket until 1992 and after ayear's experience with dual exchange rate system to a market-related system by March 1993.This has helped to bring about flexibility in exchange rate management. A couple of years ago,my predecessor, distinguished Dr. S. S. Tarapore, addressed this Assembly on some of theburning issues of foreign exchange markets. Last year, my colleague, Mrs. Usha Thorat gave anauthentic and analytical account of the recent developments in forex markets and on the role ofauthorised dealers (ADs) in forex markets. Today, I will address the dilemmas that we, as policymakers, face in the conduct of exchange rate policy.International Parity2. I will briefly, as a backdrop, revisit the four parity conditions, that you arefamiliar with. First, the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) which links the spot exchange rate andinflation. Secondly, the International Fisher Relation which links interest rates and inflation.Thirdly, the Foreign Exchange Expectations which link forward exchange rates and expectedfuture spot exchange rates. Fourthly, the Interest Rate Parity, which links spot exchange rates,forward exchange rates and interest rates. The four parity relations could be combined in severalways to throw light on the four critical variables that are often used in exchange ratemanagement policies, viz., the interest rate differential, the inflation differential, the forwarddiscount/premium, and the exchange rate movement. The theories built around the parityrelations help us to understand the foreign exchange markets better, but, they rarely give usready-made solutions to the problems that arise in day-to-day, say, minute-to-minute operationsin the exchange markets.3. What could be the explanation for such a phenomenon? In the real world,expectations cannot be easily subjected to definitive formulae; goods cannot be transferredacross countries simultaneously; shipping and other transactions costs can turn out to be muchdifferent from the initial conditions; trade and other restrictions often exist, distorting prices.Even in the most efficient markets, ‘ideal’ conditions do not exist, and forward premia as aresult have not been able to predict future spot rates accurately. The actual exchange rates areusually overvalued or undervalued in terms of the purchasing power parity. Under Indianconditions, however, there are some additional questions. For instance, which is the correctrisk-free interest rate to be compared while calculating interest rate differentials? Should weconsider the 91-day T-bill rate or some other short-term rate? The theoretical forward premiacould vary depending on the interest rate chosen. In the quest for answers to some questions,dilemmas do arise.Objectives and Purposes of Exchange Rate Management4. The main objective of India's exchange rate policy is to ensure that economicfundamentals are reflected in the external value of the rupee. Subject to this predominantobjective, the conduct of exchange rate policy is guided by three major purposes.BIS Review   76/1997
- 2 -First, to reduce excess volatility in exchange rates, while ensuring that the marketcorrection of overvalued or undervalued exchange rate is orderly and calibrated.Second, to help maintain an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves.Third, to help eliminate market constraints with a view to the development of ahealthy foreign exchange market.Let us relate the above approach to the current context.Current Context5. The elements of continuity, contextual response and change would be presentin the conduct of any policy, including the exchange rate policy. In this address, I will befocusing on the contextual response. After all, exchange rate policy will form part of the overallmacroeconomic policy and will, therefore, have to be subservient to overall macroeconomictargets. The conduct of exchange rate policy during 1996-97 was primarily guided by marketconditions resulting from the contraction in the current account deficit and resurgence of capitalinflows. Foreign exchange reserves (including gold) scaled a peak of US$ 26.4 billion byend-March 1997, without sacrificing exchange rate stability. In regard to 1997-98, the exchangerate policy needs to be seen in the context of the Monetary Policy Statement of April 15, 1997.The Statement indicates, given the real GDP growth for 1997-98 of 6.0 - 7.0 per cent, theexpansion in M3 would be sought to be maintained in the range of 15.0 - 15.5 per cent to keepthe inflation rate at around 6.0 per cent. Monetary policy would, in other words, continue to bedirected towards maintaining a stable financial environment in relation to price, interest rate andexchange rate.6. Against these broad parameters, we have to look at the variables that have abearing on contemporary exchange rate management. Some of the crucial variables at thisjuncture, apart from price stability and money supply, which are always dominant, are, in myview, the revenue and expenditure position of the Government, the oil pool deficit, the buoyancyin industrial activity, the progress in infrastructure sector, and the developments in trade andcapital flows. Besides, leads and lags operate, affecting the market. Moreover, major players inthe market influence exchange rate movements and thereby the perceptions about policy. Let meillustrate this point with reference to the oil pool deficit. The IOC has, in the recent past,increasingly resorted to foreign currency borrowing rather than domestic borrowing to financethe deficit, presumably in view of the lower cost and the perceived stability of the rupee. To theextent the IOC resorts to additional overseas borrowing for oil purchases, the demand in theforex market is depressed, leading to pressure on the rupee to appreciate even further. Therewould be an exactly opposite effect when the IOC starts reducing the exposure to short termborrowing, simultaneously making the cash payment for current purchases, with implications forexchange rate management.External Value of the Rupee7. The deceleration in export growth during 1996-97 has emerged as an area ofpolicy concern and exchange rate is often blamed for that. The slow down in export growthduring 1996-97 could as well be attributed to the decline in world trade coupled withsluggishness in manufacturing goods prices in the global market, variations in cross-currencyexchange rates and deceleration in domestic industrial activities. However, we should acceptthat, beyond a point, real appreciation of a currency can hurt exports. Given the disparateBIS Review   76/1997
- 3 -movements over time of the exchange rates of the domestic currency and the domestic inflationrate relative to important trading partners, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is reckonedas one of the most important determinants of the country's external competitiveness. Using thetrade based REER (1985=100), the REER was 61.02 per cent in August 1993 and 65.78 per centin August 1995, i.e. an appreciation of 7.8 per cent. In August 1995, the volatility in theexchange rate of the rupee started and in the following months, the rupee depreciated andcorrected for real appreciation by January 1996 when the REER was 59.32. For most of 1996,the REER remained stable. However, with the sharp appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis othermajor currencies since the last quarter of 1996, the rupee also appreciated in real terms. InAugust 1996, the trade based REER (1985=100) was 62.26 which rose to 65.41 in April 1997,i.e. an appreciation of around five per cent. Over January 1996, the appreciation in April 1997was 10.3 per cent. There is considerable discussion as to whether the rupee is overvalued or not.As per the REER, it would certainly appear so, irrespective of the base chosen. Theovervaluation has got exacerbated with the sharp appreciation of the US dollar against othermajor currencies, viz., the DM and the Yen. The relative “cheapening” of  imports may not haveresulted in increasing imports and larger current account deficits. This is because imports arerelatively less responsive to exchange rate changes and are more sensitive to the level ofeconomic activity. There could be a potential larger current account deficit as industrial activityrebounds - even at the present exchange rates and if oil demand picks up, a correction cannot beruled out.The optimal size of the external current account deficit, of course, depends uponthe degree of openness of the economy. In the Indian context, the ratio of current receipts toGDP of 15 per cent, as at present, could sustain a current account deficit of the order of two percent of GDP and would still enable a decline in the debt service ratio from the present level of25 per cent. A current account deficit of two per cent of GDP in conjunction with the domesticsavings rate of 25-26 per cent could ensure an investment rate of around 28 per cent which, evenwith ICOR of around 4.0 should be able to sustain a real GDP growth of seven per cent perannum. Since 1991-92, however, the current account deficit has averaged around only one percent of GDP. Thus, enlargement of the current account deficit beyond the present level issustainable.Volatility8. The Reserve Bank has been intervening in both the spot and forward markets toprevent undue fluctuations. In the context of large capital flows (inflows as well as outflows)within a short period, it may not be possible to prevent movements in the exchange rate awayfrom the fundamentals. Hence, the management of rate fluctuations becomes passive, i.e., one ofpreventing undue appreciation in the context of large inflows and providing a supply of dollarsin the market to prevent sharp depreciation. But, the correction, if any, has to be gradual and notsudden.Level of Reserves9. Adequacy of reserves is, as I mentioned, an important consideration. The levelof  foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 29.8 billion by August 1, 1997 - equivalent to sevenmonths of imports. In the context of the changing interface with the external sector and theimportance of the capital account, we have to evaluate reserve adequacy in terms of bothconventional indicators and non-conventional norms. The present level of foreign exchangereserves is equivalent to about 30 months of debt service payments and 5.7 months of paymentsfor import and debt service taken together. In the context of mobile capital flows, it may beBIS Review   76/1997
- 4 -useful to assess the level of reserves in terms of the volume of short-term debt which can becovered by reserves. At the end of March 1997, the ratio of short-term debt to the level ofreserves amounted to a little over 25 per cent,  compared to about 100 per cent for Indonesia, 50per cent for Argentina, and 25 per cent for Malaysia. In fact, the level of reserves exceeds thetotal stock of short-term debt and portfolio flows which, taken together, constitute little less than75 per cent of the level of reserves. The present level of external reserves is a source of comfortas it provides a measure of insulation against unforeseen external shocks or shocks created bydomestic supply shortages. Besides, it helps to meet the precautionary motive and satisfy theneed for liquidity, which in itself instils confidence in the Indian economy among internationalinvestors and financial markets. Such confidence has also a bearing on the extent and of coursecost of external borrowings.As the economy becomes more open, external shocks need a cushion whichreserves alone can provide. The volatility of some of the capital flows needs to be kept in mind.It is true that reserves are not required to meet the transaction motive which is to be taken care ofby changes that will naturally occur in the market determined exchange rates. But, in a period oftransition, when structural shifts can release strong excess demand or throw up temporarybottlenecks, reserves smoothen the process of change and mitigate pains of adjustment. So, someaddition to reserves, in my view, would give additional comfort.Forex Markets10. Developing exchange markets is another important consideration in exchangerate management. Recently, several measures were initiated to further integrate the Indian forexmarket with the global financial system. Banks were permitted to fix their own position limitsand Aggregate Gap Limits (AGLs) in January 1996. Banks were permitted in October 1996 toprovide foreign currency denominated loans to their customers out of the pool of FCNR - Bdeposits.In order to achieve greater integration between domestic and overseas moneymarkets, authorised dealers (ADs) were permitted in April 1997 to borrow from their overseasoffices/correspondents as well as to invest funds in overseas money market instruments up to US$10 million. With a view to imparting flexibility to corporates and improving liquidity in theforward markets for periods beyond six months, ADs were also permitted to book forward coverfor exporters and importers on the basis of a declaration of exposure supported by pastperformance and business projection, provided the total forward contracts outstanding at anypoint of time did not exceed the average export/import turnover of the last two years. ADs werealso allowed to arrange forex-rupee swaps between corporates and run a swap-book within theiropen positions/gap limits without prior approval of the Reserve Bank.Now, as per the decision taken last week, FIIs are allowed to cover as a first steptheir debt exposures in the forward market.In order to further facilitate integration between domestic and overseas markets,banks with adequate capital strength may be encouraged to have higher limits for investments inoverseas markets. This will help in developing further the forward markets.East Asian Experience: Relevance to India11. Speaking of correction in external value and of volatility in forex markets, thequestion that is often asked is “would India go the East Asian way?” In the early stages ofBIS Review   76/1997
- 5 -development, East Asian countries adopted a conscious policy of export-led growth stimulatedby real depreciation of their currencies. It was only much later, when capital inflows becamestrong, after 1992, that their currencies appreciated in real terms.The currency overvaluation, declining exports, overheated property markets andthe fragile banking system had fuelled intense foreign currency speculation, as the marketparticipants felt that the natural course of the currency was to depreciate. Given the hugeshort-term borrowings, the fund managers started exiting the economy with the first sign oftrouble, leading to a de facto devaluation of the Thai baht. An important point to be noted here isthat the currency crises in these countries was managed quite efficiently with the help of reserveswhich most of these countries had to defend their currencies. Thailand, as also other East Asianeconomies, despite a large current account deficit, are high-saving economies with goodunderlying growth rate and strong competitiveness.What are the lessons for India?12. The recent experience of the emerging economies shows that any currencycould come under speculative attack if its exchange rate is out of alignment with fundamentalsfor a prolonged period of time.Second, once the speculative attack is launched on any currency, the neighbouringcurrencies are also vulnerable, no matter how sound their policies may be.Third, the overvaluation of a currency acts as a catalyst when there is a run on thecurrency as all the market players base their action on the information that the currency is duefor correction.Presently, compared to March 1993, the appreciation of the Indian rupee in realeffective terms is around 14 per cent. The Indian economy does have certain favourable factorsin terms of a moderate CAD/GDP ratio, high foreign exchange reserves and a ratio of short-termdebt to reserves much lower than that of the East Asian countries. Our inflation rate is alsoedging downwards. We have a fairly solid banking system despite the NPAs; the number ofNBFCs are not that large; and the financial sector is subject to reasonably effective regulation bythe RBI. Our financial sector is, therefore, less vulnerable than many of the East Asianeconomies, notwithstanding the fact that there are corporates operating with unhedged positions.It is unlikely that any turmoil in South East Asian economies would have a directimpact upon the Indian rupee as India’s trade with the five countries of the South East Asianregion (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore) constituted only 7.8 per centin 1996-97. Also, the currencies of this region are more internationally traded, larger number ofhedging products are available, and the central banks of several South East Asian economiespool their resources to counter any attack on their currencies. It is possible that the sentimentsthat govern the interest of investors in these countries are different from the sentiments ofinvestors coming to India.In brief, the experience of these countries should provide some lessons for us interms of potential risks. Of immediate relevance to us is the impact of their devaluation onexport competitiveness if the rupee continues to appreciate.BIS Review   76/1997
- 6 -Capital Inflow13. Capital inflows constitute a major factor affecting the value of the rupee now.With the resurgence in capital inflows, the net surplus on the capital account more than doubledto about US$ 11,600 million during 1996-97, thereby exceeding the previous peak of US$ 9,695million touched in 1993-94. Reflecting these developments, surplus conditions prevailed in theforeign exchange market throughout the year. In general, the policy response has taken the formof partial sterilised intervention through open market operations, liberalisation of capitaloutflows, raising of reserve requirements and deepening of the foreign exchange market byrouting increased volumes of transactions through the market. To prevent appreciation of therupee, and to protect international competitiveness, the Reserve Bank made substantial purchasesof US dollars in the market. During 1997, the RBI intervened in the spot and forward markets,both in the outright and swap segments. Outright spot and forward purchases of US dollarsduring 1996-97 amounted to $7.9 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Swap purchasesamounted to $2.4 billion. While spot sale of US dollars was marginal, forward and swap salesamounted to $0.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Thus, net purchases of US dollars during1996-97 amounted to $7.8 billion.The influx of capital continues during 1997-98. The Reserve Bank hasaccumulated US$ 3.9 billion of foreign currency assets until August 8, during the currentfinancial year. Total spot and forward purchases and swap sales of US dollars up to end-July1997, totalled $4.3 billion, $1.1 billion and 0.9 billion, respectively. Thus, net purchases of USdollars by the Reserve Bank of India up to end July, during the financial year 1997-98 amountedto about $4.6 billion.The optimal policy response to capital inflows is very much a function of theanticipated persistence of capital inflows. The design of policy depends upon the expectation ofwhether the inflow of capital is temporary or is expected to continue. A temporary increase ininflow, perceived as such by the public, which may lead to a temporary real appreciation of theexchange rate, is unlikely to have major effects. Problems, however, arise if the inflow istemporary, but the public expects the inflow to continue. But, in real life, nobody knows withconfidence, what is temporary, how temporary it is, and what the public perception is, andindeed how temporary the public perception is! So, let me straightaway go into the instruments.Internationally, a number of instruments have been used to sterilise capitalinflows, the chief among them being the sale of government bonds through open marketoperations. This policy is useful temporarily and if used for long, leads to renewed inflows. Wein the Reserve Bank are, however, well equipped with physical stock of government securities.We have been active in the repo market in recent months to manage temporary liquidityconditions. The idea is to realise a fine balance in order to achieve the objectives of sterilisationwithout putting pressure on yields.Discount policy, which implies restricting the access of banks to central bankcredit or raising the cost of refinance, has also been used by countries to sterilise capital inflows.This instrument cannot, however, be used in the current context when there is plenty of liquidityin the money market and there is no borrowing from the central bank. However, this instrumentmay go against the long-term objectives of monetary and credit policy.Varying the reserve requirements is yet another policy tool. MobilisingGovernment deposits has served as a variation to absorption of reserves in some countries.Variable deposit requirements in the nature of interest-free deposits with the central bank isBIS Review   76/1997
- 7 -another form of discouraging capital inflows. This measure, while it reduces the need for costlysterilisation through the sale of bonds, may result in misallocation of resources and reduce thefacility to borrowers to take advantage of lower international interest rates. We have used theCRR successfully in the past to stem inflows. After the imposition of CRR on incremental NRIdeposits there has been some deceleration in the growth of foreign currency deposits during thecurrent financial year.Entering into foreign currency swaps (spot sell - forward buy) is another way ofsterilising capital inflows. The foreign currency purchased by banks may be used to financedomestic activities or for investment abroad. Our experience shows that the market is fairly thinand, in such a market, the use of foreign currency swaps for sterilisation only adds volatility tothe forward market unless there is a constant swap window.Central banks can employ outright forward exchange transaction, i.e., buyoutright forward instead of spot. This will have the desired effect on the spot rate only if it is notcountered by very large spot inflows from participants like FIIs and forward supplies byexporters who wish to take advantage of the increase in premium.Taxing on capital inflows is yet another form of dissuading flows. For foreigninvestors, it effectively lowers the rate of return on local assets. This instrument also carries thedisadvantage of raising the cost of capital. This option was considered at one time, but deferred,considering its disadvantages.Conclusion14. I have explained the dilemmas, mainly to show that we are committed to thestated objectives, and assert that we are equipped to handle the problems - equipped with therequisite will and skill. However, some believe that we are cautious - whether in allowing therupee to appreciate or inducing adequate depreciation. Perhaps some explanation would be inorder.First, we are going through a process of economic reform. In a democratic federalset-up, going through such economic reform, we require a general mandate on essentialcomplementary policies.Second, we are vulnerable to supply shocks, especially food stock and oil prices.Third, the East Asian countries support each other. The G-10 countries coordinatewith each other. The Latin American countries are generally supported by North America. Weare not members of any blocks. We have gone through the trauma of a balance-of-paymentscrisis in the early 1990s and we cannot ignore the threat to economic sovereignty if we takeundue risks.Fourth, and most important, price stability is critical to the economy as a whole,to both the poor and exporters. In fact, as our Governor at the Reserve Bank of India,Dr. C. Rangarajan, mentioned in his address at the Annual Presentation Ceremony of theEngineering Export Promotion Council earlier this month, “containment of domestic priceincrease has the same beneficial effect as the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. If thenominal exchange rate is stabilised at a certain level by letting the foreign exchange assets of thecentral bank increase, it may have an adverse effect on the exporters through price increasesarising from more than the desired increase in money supply. There can therefore, be no rigidBIS Review   76/1997
- 8 -formula governing exchange rate determination. Monetary authorities need continually toperform a balancing act between ensuring an exchange rate which will be supportive of exportsand the need to contain monetary expansion within reasonable limits.”During the current financial year up to August 1, deposits have grown rapidly by4.1 per cent (3.7 per cent in the corresponding period last year). M3 has grown by 4.4 per centup to July 18 (3.7 per cent last year). The year-on-year growth in M3 is 16.7 per cent. Thepositive features during the current year are that interest rates have come down, both in the shortand long term, and so has the inflation rate. The area of concern relates to money supply. Anyfurther measures in terms of exchange rate should consider the money supply effect so that thegains already made on the interest rate and inflation fronts are not eroded. This is the criticalaspect of the current exchange rate management stance.Finally, the extent, the pace and the manner of correction of the exchange ratewill have to be taken in conjunction with money supply, since price stability continues to be thedominant objective of monetary policy. We in the Reserve Bank seek your assistance, advice,cooperation and understanding. For my part, I am happy to announce that henceforth theReserve Bank will make available weekly data relating to its intervention in the forex market.BIS Review   76/1997
BIS Review   75/1997Mr. Macfarlane discusses monetary policy and economic growth in AustraliaTalk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to the AustralianInstitute of Company Directors (Western Australia Division) Winter Dinner held in Perth on12/8/97.1. IntroductionIt is a pleasure to be in Perth to address the Western Australian Division of theInstitute of Company Directors. It is also fitting that I should be talking about economic growth,since Western Australia has set an example to the rest of Australia by its high growth rate in the1990s. Some would say this is inevitable, given its resource base, but we have seeninternationally that the fastest growth does not coincide with the biggest resource endowments.Enterprise and a willingness to embrace change are also vital ingredients, and here WesternAustralia has also distinguished itself.In the Reserve Bank we are often drawn into a discussion of economic growthbecause of claims that we have a “growth ceiling” of 3½ per cent per annum. I do not knowwhere this perceived ceiling came from, and I have on several occasions denied its existence. Iwill do so again tonight.It has been suggested to me that one of the reasons for this belief is that I have often highlightedthe data contained in Table 1 below, particularly when I have been doing my patriotic duty inTable  1: OECD  GDP  Growth  Over  the  Past  Six  Years(Average annualised growth)Real  GDPIreland6.4Australia3.5Norway3.5New Zealand3.4United States2.7United Kingdom2.4Canada2.2Denmark2.1Netherlands2.0Austria1.7Japan1.6Spain1.5Finland1.5Germany1.4Belgium1.3France1.3Italy0.9Sweden0.9Switzerland-0.1Source: OECD
- 2 -BIS Review   75/1997front of audiences of overseas investors. It shows that over the past six years, thatis the period of the current expansion, we have grown at an annual average growth rate of3.5 per cent. This is very good by the standards of the “high income OECD countries”. OnlyIreland has done better, and Norway and New Zealand have grown at about the same rate as wehave. These are all much smaller countries than we are (their combined GDP is less thanAustralia’s). The other thing that stands out from this table is how well the English-speakingcountries have done in the nineties; the six English-speaking countries are in the top seven spots.The 3½ per cent per annum contained in this table is there for international comparisons, not as ayardstick for what we can do this year, next year or the year after. For a start, that six-yearaverage of 3½ per cent contains years like the past 12 months where we have achieved only 2.4per cent, but there are other periods like the year to September 1994 when we managed 5½ percent.2.  Economic growth over the cycleWhile we do not have a growth target or growth ceiling, we do have an inflationtarget. This says that inflation should average somewhere between 2 and 3 per cent over themedium term. That is, when we look back, we should see that it has averaged 2 point somethingper cent, even if we have been over 3 per cent on some occasions and below 2 per cent onothers.This approach is not, as some might think, anti-growth. It is, in fact, pro growthby favouring forward looking management of the business cycle, which will help in achieving astable platform for long-run growth. The other way of expressing an inflation target is to say thatthe economy should grow as fast as possible consistent with maintaining low inflation, but nofaster. We say no faster because post-war experience in a number of countries has shown us thatallowing inflation to rise too much actually harms growth prospects in the longer term.Sustained periods of strong growth have always gone hand in hand with low inflation. Weakergrowth occurred in the high inflation era, particularly between the mid-seventies and mid-eighties.We have also emphasised that it is the length of the expansion that is important.Our last two expansions were cut short by inflationary pressures after about six-and-a-half years.It would probably be possible on this occasion to engineer a short-lived boom, characterised byrising output and falling unemployment, but also by increasing inflation, unrealistically highasset values, inflated paper wealth and financial instability - which is, of course, a recipe for aslump thereafter. Recessions may come for some other reasons, but there is no reason to run ahigh risk of a self-inflicted one. It is important that we take a longer view in order to achieve alonger expansion. The value of the inflation targeting regime is that it forces us to do preciselythat. That is why I am confident that, under our present arrangements, we will be able to do allthat can be done to foster a long expansion.What does this mean for the next couple of years? That is really a matter offorecasting rather than speed limits. With inflation tamed, and with some slack available, weshould be quite capable of growing by 3½ per cent, 4 per cent, 4½ per cent (or possibly evenfaster) over the next couple of years without any significant detrimental effect on inflation. Noneof these figures is a target; they are simply illustrative of the sorts of numbers we mightreasonably expect to see after a period of sub-par growth such as 1996.Ideally, as we grow fast enough to take up existing slack, businesses would liftinvestment rates further, pushing the capacity constraints further back. If, at the same time, wefound that labour market arrangements were able to bring new employees onto payrolls without
- 3 -BIS Review   75/1997generalised pressure on wages, we would be able to sustain faster growth for longer. In otherwords, by having a longer expansion, we would be able to drive unemployment down further.How likely is that outcome? It is hard to say. We do not have a doctrinaire viewon what can be achieved. We will evaluate the evidence as it comes in. Critical in that evidenceis the course of prices. The main test of what is sustainable on the growth front is the inflationtest: is the rate of growth compatible with achieving the 2-3 per cent average for inflation,looking forward as best we can over a year or two? If the answer is yes, then that growth issustainable, at least at that point in time. To repeat: we do not have a growth ceiling, beyondwhich the brakes automatically go on. We have an inflation target, appropriately and flexiblydefined, which tells us to tighten when our forecast of inflation has it exceeding the target forany sustained period of time, and to ease when the forecast has inflation sustainably belowtarget. Growth per se does not necessarily trigger this response: it is the inflation outlook whichis important. In thinking about the inflation outlook, of course, we need to ask ourselves whetherthe growth which is occurring now and that which is in prospect are likely to put pressure oncapacity to such an extent that inflation might rise noticeably. But that is a judgement based on arange of factors, not a mechanical response to the breaching of some arbitrary growth threshold.Another point I would like to make is that at the moment I do not see thatmonetary policy is placing any constraint on growth. This is as it should be - one of theadvantages of an inflation target is that it makes sure monetary policy is eased when the inflationforecast is below the target average. Hence the five easings over the past year. This might helpto reassure those people who think that in order to maintain a low average inflation rate,monetary policy has to be kept continuously tight. It does not - monetary policy will be eased asoften as it is tightened.  Monetary policy has to be no tighter to maintain an average inflationrate of 2½ per cent, than to maintain an average of 5 or 10 per cent. In fact it probably wouldhave to be tighter at the higher figures as it would be fighting against rising inflationaryexpectations.Another sign that present monetary policy is not restrictive is to look at the effectit is having on the cost and availability of credit. If this was too expensive, we would not seemuch being used, but that is not the case at present. All forms of credit - business, housing andpersonal lending - have been growing at somewhere between 8 and 11 per cent over the pastyear. This does not suggest that the economy as a whole is finance-constrained, although therewill always be some individuals or firms that are.Another manifestation of this that may have escaped many people is that we nowhave lower interest rates out to five years than the United States, which is the usual benchmarkfor international comparisons. Now this is entirely fit and proper, given the different cyclicalpositions of the two economies and given our lower inflation. But even so, it would have beenunthinkable even a few years ago. Financial markets took it for granted that Australia wouldalways be a high interest country relative to the United States. (International investors putAustralia in with a group of countries called the “high yielders”.) I am strongly of the view thatthese lower interest rates are a substantial benefit for Australian businesses.3. Economic growth in the long runSo far, we have been talking about growth over short time horizons such as acouple of years or so. Over this horizon, growth can vary quite a lot, and monetary policy willhave some influence on the outcome. While monetary policy’s major long-term influence will beon the rate of inflation, over shorter periods it can have a significant influence on economic
- 4 -BIS Review   75/1997activity and employment. If it is too tight, it will unnecessarily constrain them, and if it is tooloose, it could set up the conditions for an inflationary boom. The relationship betweenmonetary policy and economic growth is thus essentially a short-term or cyclical one.But this is not what a lot of people are interested in. They want to know what isAustralia’s long-term growth potential. Is our potential growth rate relatively low like all thestandard OECD countries in Table 1? Is it a bit higher? Or, alternatively could it be as high, ornearly as high, as the newly-industrialising countries of Asia? How could it be raised to a higherfigure?These are all difficult questions to answer, and I shall only attempt a very cursoryone. But before I do that, I want to make an important point - whatever our potential growth rateis, monetary policy will have little to do with it compared with other factors. Monetary policymainly works by affecting aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in demand are thenormal (though not exclusive) source of business cycles. In thinking about long run trends,however, it is the supply structure - the economy’s capacity to produce and how that can beincreased - that is crucial.Perhaps I can take the liberty of illustrating this distinction between short andlong run with a stylised diagram. An economy could have an average long-term growth rate asshown in the straight line Trend A. Its actual growth will never be a straight line because of thebusiness cycle, so it is likely to look like the wavy line Actual A. If monetary policy wasconducted badly, we could end up with a boom and bust given by the dotted line Actual A1.Alternatively, if monetary policy was conducted well, we should expect to have relatively stableconditions, including low inflation; with a bit of luck, we should also get longer lastingexpansions and milder recessions. Because a reasonably stable aggregate price level does notprompt the distortions in economic decisions seen with high inflation, trend growth should be alittle higher. But while that difference will be worth having, it only adds a little to trend A, andmany people would have trouble noticing the difference.GGDDPP: : TTrreennd d aannd d AAccttuuaall02040608010012014016018020055110011552200YYeaearrssTTrreennd d BBAAccttuuaallAAccttuuaal l AATTrreennd d AAAAccttuuaal l AA''LLeevveel l oof f RReaeal l GGDDPP
- 5 -BIS Review   75/1997Now, people may be unsatisfied with this outcome and say that they would preferto be on the faster trend growth line given by Trend B, which is perhaps two or three per centhigher than Trend A. This is a reasonable aspiration, but it cannot be achieved by an adjustmentto monetary policy.What factors then explain long-run growth? In simple terms, it is explained by thegrowth of the productive factors in the economy - the growth of the labour force, expansion ofthe capital stock and growth in productivity of both labour and capital. This is why there is suchfocus on micro-economic policies to raise efficiency, rather than manipulation of the macro-economic instruments, when people talk about long run growth potential. Again, all thatmonetary policy can do is to minimise the booms and busts around the higher trend. The onlyway that the economy can move from Trend A to Trend B is by enacting policies that eitherincrease the growth of the productive factors or increase their productivity.I do not intend to say much about the growth of the labour force, which in thelong run is determined by population growth and participation in the workforce. Note, however,that in the short run the economy can grow faster than the labour force constraint would suggestbecause, if there is enough flexibility, we can move people out of unemployment intoemployment. The other point that I should register is that I do not think in the long run we willbe able to maintain our current low male participation rate. With life expectancy still increasing,we will not be able to continue the luxury of having so many people entering the workforce intheir early twenties and leaving in their mid fifties. This is a transitory phase, not a permanentincrease in leisure.In thinking about how to ensure that the capital side of the production potential isexpanded sufficiently, it is hard to go past the simple idea that investment has to be funded bysaving, and we would probably have more if we increased our domestic saving. Of course itcould be funded by more foreign saving, but that path tends to be a more unstable one. I have nonew ideas on how to increase our savings other than through the familiar methods of makingsure that the government does not reduce national savings through chronic budget deficits andby enacting measures to make sure that a higher proportion of retirement incomes are funded outof private savings.The really big issue for long-run growth is how we raise productivity. In simpledebate, this is often portrayed as producing the same with less people, either by job shedding orby substituting capital for labour. But any business knows that it is not just manning levelswhich are important. The flexibility of the workforce in using the capital equipment, the skillswhich they can bring to bear in response to new demands and opportunities, the capacity of thefirm to innovate and improve processes in industrial and service applications, the ability todevelop and exploit new technology - these are actually more important ingredients in the longrun.Of course, all good firms are trying to do this all the time. In a competitivemarketplace, they have to keep up with their competitors or fall by the wayside. In a globalmarketplace, they increasingly have to move towards international best practice, which itself isalways advancing as a result of innovation and adoption of new technology. In the process ofmatching their competitors, the best firms drive the development of productivity and the rise inliving standards.Not all firms nor all industries will succeed in doing this. Some will thrive andothers will fail. Some industries will grow, and some industries that we do not even know about
- 6 -BIS Review   75/1997as yet will emerge. The only thing we know is that there will be continuous change, not just herebut in all countries, under the constant pressure of competition, new technologies andglobalisation. There is no simple secret to success, but part of the answer must be for both firmsand for countries to facilitate change, and to adapt to it, not to resist it. The central issue is thatall productivity gains involve change. By their nature they involve producing goods and servicesin different (and better) ways, or in producing different goods and services. Change is anecessary condition for productivity growth.These major changes are going to occur in the private sector among both largeand small firms. The adjustment task will be difficult, but they must try to seek out the profitableand growing areas. While the role of government will be important, the Government will not beable to do the adjustment for the private sector. I find it hard to believe that the Governmentwould be better than the private sector at picking the growth areas, so I believe that theGovernment’s main contribution should be to remove unnecessary obstacles to change, toprovide a high quality infrastructure, to encourage saving and to work at lifting and maintainingquality of education.I know this is a difficult message to give to a public which is growing tired ofchange (not all of it economic). But the alternative of stopping change is really not viable. It hasalways been the case that the firms and societies that have managed to embrace the challenge ofchange and seize new opportunities, rather than turning their backs, have been the ones thatprospered.It may, of course, be harder for the high income societies like Australia than forthe newcomers who feel less attachment to established ideas and who therefore have less to“lose” in embracing change. But we surely have the capacity to adopt change when we see theneed.  We have to be convinced it is worth it.The advantages of flexibility have been well demonstrated in the nineties by thesuperior performance, both in terms of growth and in lower levels of unemployment, of the lessregulated English-speaking countries compared to the corporatist European ones.I am not suggesting we should remove all regulation and rely totally on laissezfaire. There is clearly a large role for government, but we should always ask whether particulargovernment initiatives are forward looking, or whether they are protecting an existing industryor an existing privilege.The first requirement of government is to provide as stable a macro-economicenvironment as it can. The second requirement of government is to provide first class, low costinfrastructure. This stretches from such items as the legal system and accountancy standardsthrough to more tangible items like the education system and the utilities, including electricity,gas, water and telecommunications. The Government, of course, need not be the provider ofeach of these, but it will always ultimately set the standards. Inevitably, governments will alsobe called upon to enact policies which affect one industry at the expense of others. My only pleahere is that they do it in a way that encourages adjustment, perhaps even compensates losers, butnot to do it in a way which resists change.4. ConclusionAustralia has recorded quite a respectable growth performance by developedcountry standards during the current upswing. Even our low point in the mid-cycle growth
- 7 -BIS Review   75/1997pause  - a bit over 2 per cent - is pretty good compared with many countries’ averageperformances. People are disappointed that more progress has not yet been made on reducingunemployment, but we have made some, and further real progress will be made if we can sustaina long running expansion. As I have noted tonight, I think our current monetary policyframework is serving us well in this regard, by requiring us to take a medium-term view in ourpolicy deliberations and maximising the chances for a long recovery. I hope I have helped toexplain our thinking.When we shift our focus to the economy’s long run growth prospects, however,monetary policy should inevitably attract less attention. Price stability is a necessary conditionfor faster long-term growth, but there are many other policies which have to be got right. That’swhy it is so hard. If there is a simple message, I think it is that the heart of the long-term growthprocess is productivity enhancement through innovation, technological change and so on, andthat to reap the benefits of those processes, we have to embrace the forces of competition andglobalisation, with all the changes and discomforts they bring.

- 2 -explain such favorable performance, and specifically what accounts for the favorablecombination of low inflation and low unemployment? Second, what can monetary policy do tohelp extend the good performance; specifically, how should monetary policy be positioned inlight of the uncertainties in the current environment so as to balance what I call regularities andpossibilities -- regularities that suggest there are limits to the economy’s productive capacity, atany point in time, and to the growth of capacity over time and possibilities that suggest theselimits may have become more flexible in recent years.The art and science of forecasting and policymakingWhen I won awards for economic forecasting while in the private sector, I wasalways asked about my recipe for forecasting. My response was: take one part science and mix itwith one part art and one part luck. The science refers to the model that guided the forecast, tothe historical regularities that the model uses to help predict future performance. The art refers tothe forecaster’s judgment. I never made a forecast by standing back and letting the model do allthe work. Judgment was equally important to the end product. We constantly had to considerwhat parts of the model could be trusted better than others and what to do when some parts ofthe model got off track. That is where a forecaster earns his living and makes his reputation.Finally, I never ignored the contribution of good fortune to my forecasting success.It is not very different for policymakers. Models and historical regularities areimportant underpinnings of any preemptive policy. Such a policy depends on forecasts becauseyou are attempting to avoid problems that would occur if you failed to act. But judgment isessential too, and more so when historical regularities are called into question, as is the casetoday. A policymaker, like a forecaster, has to adjust on the fly, before there is time to evendetermine, with certainty, why the models are off track and certainly before they can becorrected. Historians may put this all in perspective in due time. Perhaps. But policy is made inreal time.In recent years monetary policy has not simply been guided by historicalregularities about the relationship between inflation and unemployment inherited from the 1980sand early 1990s. Rather, monetary policy has been adaptive, pragmatic and flexible in responseto evolving economic circumstances. Such an adaptive approach does not throw out theframework that has successfully guided forecasting and policymaking in the past, but attempts,in real time, to adjust that approach based on the current data.Key Issues in the Economic OutlookThe economy appears to have slowed to near a trend rate in the second quarter,after surprisingly robust growth in the previous quarter. The underlying fundamentals of theexpansion continue to look quite positive. There is solid momentum in employment and income,financial conditions are highly supporting, and consumer confidence has soared to record levels.I do not see any obstacles to the continuation of the expansion, with growth near trend, through1998.There are in my judgment two key issues in the outlook related to monetarypolicy and these focus on the interaction among growth, utilization rates and inflation. First, willgrowth rebound to an above-trend rate, raising utilization rates still further? Second, areprevailing utilization rates already so high that inflation will begin to rise, even if growthremains at trend? These are the same questions I raised in my first speech after coming to the
- 3 -Board, in September 1996. They are the key questions that affected my judgment about theappropriate posture of monetary policy over the last year, and they remain relevant today.Answers to your questionsLet me briefly now turn to some specific questions that you raised in your letterof invitation or that were the subject of Congressman Frank’s comments on my April 24 speech.What do I think of the NAIRU concept and its usefulness today?NAIRU stands for Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. Therelationship between inflation and unemployment, based on NAIRU, is called the Phillips Curve.According to this concept, there is some threshold level of the unemployment rate(NAIRU) at which supply and demand are balanced in the labor market (and perhaps in theproduct market as well). This balance yields a constant inflation rate. You asked what therelationship was between full employment and inflation. In this model, there is no relationshipbetween full employment and inflation. At full employment, defined as the rate ofunemployment equal to NAIRU, inflation is constant, but any constant level of inflation ispossible at full employment. The rate of inflation in the long run is therefore not determined bythe unemployment rate at all. It is determined by the rate of growth of the money supply. This ofcourse gives monetary policy unique responsibility for inflation in the long run.If the unemployment rate falls below this threshold, inflation rises over time,indefinitely, progressively, and without limit. It is a process that feeds upon itself, because onceinflation begins to rise, further price increases feed into wage increases. The basic framework isbased on supply and demand. At NAIRU, supply and demand are balanced, so inflation is stable,matched by expected inflation. The trigger for increases in inflation is excess demand for laborand goods. The unemployment rate is a proxy for the balance between supply and demand in thelabor market, for the degree of excess demand. Historically the balance between supply anddemand in the product market -- that is, for final goods and services -- has closely paralleled thebalance in the labor market, so that the unemployment rate has effectively summarized therelationship between supply and demand in both the product market and the labor market.It has always been the case that the application of the NAIRU concept has beenmore difficult in practice than in theory. Sometimes, the Phillips Curve has made large errors;occasionally the equation has over or underpredicted for a considerable period of time. Thevalue of NAIRU has also varied over time, for example, in response to changes in thecomposition of the labor force. Of course, if NAIRU moves frequently without explanation, theconcept would not be very useful, either for forecasting or for policymaking. But the fact is that,relative to other equations used to forecast macroeconomic performance, the Phillips Curve wasone of the most reliable, if not the most reliable equation, during the 15 years prior to 1994.During this period NAIRU either appeared to be relatively constant or moved predictably withchanging labor force composition. More recently, there has been a run of over-predictions,beginning in late 1994 for wages and the last year or so for prices. These errors are the veryheart of the challenge of explaining the recent surprisingly favorable performance and of thechallenge of setting monetary policy today. I will turn to the possible sources of these errorsbelow.The accompanying table provides some outside estimates of NAIRU. The sourcesinclude the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the President’s Council of Economic Advisers
- 4 -(CEA), which develops, along with OMB and Treasury, the economic assumptions underlyingthe Administration’s budget projections; two leading model-based forecasting firms -- DRI andMacroeconomic Advisors; and estimates from Professor Robert Gordon of NorthwesternUniversity, who I consider the leading academic authority on NAIRU. All those represented inthe table view NAIRU as a central and important concept for forecasting inflation andidentifying long-run values to which the actual unemployment rate will gravitate. The range ofestimates is from 5.4% to 5.9%. Professor Gordon’s work suggests that, after falling for a coupleof years, NAIRU has stabilized, remaining unchanged over the past year.Obviously, I am not alone in using this concept in important policy work. Forexample, in its budget projections, CBO is very disciplined in assuming that the unemploymentrate gradually gravitates to NAIRU. If we begin with an unemployment rate below their estimateof NAIRU, CBO assumes a period of below-trend growth to allow the unemployment rate toreturn to their estimate of NAIRU and to prevent on ongoing increase in the rate of inflation.This is the model and forecast upon which your budget deal is based.Outside Estimates of the current NAIRU and Trend GDP Growth(percent)Organization                   NAIRU                               Trend GDP GrowthMacro Advisers                5.9                                              2.2DRI                                  5 ¾                                             2.3CEA                                 5.5                                              2.1CBO                                 5.8                                              2.1Gordon1                         5.4-5.5                                           2.2In the conduct of monetary policy, the process of analysis is more decentralized.There is no single model or forecast, no single measure of NAIRU (not everyone on the FOMCeven believes that the concept is useful), no single measure of trend growth. But each of us isdedicated to making disciplined judgments about the economy.I have said on several occasions that (1) I continue to believe NAIRU is animportant and useful concept; and (2) I believe that NAIRU is lower recently than it had been inthe 1980s. I believe NAIRU has declined from about 6% at the end of the 1980s to about 5 ½%currently. However, as has always been the case and is certainly true today, there is uncertaintyabout the precise estimate of NAIRU. Clearly, many believe it is higher, as reflected in thistable. Some also believe it is lower. I constantly re-evaluate my own estimate of NAIRU in lightof the recent data.How fast can the economy grow?The next question you asked is how fast the economy can grow. Over the shortrun, that depends on the amount of slack in the economy. Once the economy has moved tocapacity, the maximum sustainable growth rate is limited by the rate at which productivecapacity expands over time. This limit is generally referred to as trend growth. Productivecapacity expands both because of increases in physical inputs (labor and capital) and because ofimprovements in technology -- more people working with more and better equipment. Once fullemployment is reached, the labor force expands with increases in the working age population,augmented by any trend in the labor force participation rate.

- 5 -capital stock and of technological improvements is summarized in the growth in laborproductivity.The accompanying table also provides outside estimates of trend growth. Notethey all fall within a very narrow range, just above 2% per year. There has been very littlechange in these estimates in recent years. About half of the increase in trend GDP is attributableto the long-term trend in labor force growth and about half to the long-erm trend in productivitygrowth. The narrowness of the range of estimates in this table should not suggest the absence ofan important degree of uncertainty about trend growth and I will consider in the next sectionsome reasons why trend growth could turn out to be higher.If output grows at the trend rate, resource utilization rates will generally beconstant. If output grows faster than the trend rate, demand increases relative to supply andresource utilization rates will rise. At some point, above-trend growth will raise utilization ratesto a point where excess demand puts upward pressure on inflation.Note that trend growth does not cause inflation. The higher the trend rate ofgrowth, the better, as Chairman Greenspan noted yesterday in his testimony. And whileabove-trend growth itself does not raise inflation, it does raise utilization rates which, after somepoint, will result in higher inflation. I will come back to this thought when I answer yourquestion about the rationale for the March 25 policy action.How do you explain the recent favorable performance of inflation and unemployment?The answer here, unfortunately, is not as well as I would like. It is important, as aforecaster and policymaker, to understand how much you know and how little you know. In thisspirit, I believe that the recent performance of the economy is to some degree a puzzle. I cannotsolve that puzzle completely, but I am quite sure of some of the factors that have been importantand I can speculate about some other factors that might be important. In the final analysis, wehave to make monetary policy before we have all the answers, though we can and do constantlyreview our models in light of new data to refine our thinking.The clearest and perhaps the most important factor is the temporary confluence offavorable supply shocks over the last couple of years; by favorable supply shocks, I refer todevelopments that have recently lowered the prices or slowed the rate of increase in the prices ofspecific goods, unrelated to the overall balance between supply and demand in US labor andproduct markets. The list of favorable shocks is well known and generally widely appreciated.First, non-oil import prices have declined, due in large measure to the appreciation of the dollarfrom mid 1995 through early 1997. This has both lowered the price of imported goods andconstrained the pricing power of domestic firms that compete with imports. Second, the cost ofemployee benefits has risen more slowly, especially the cost of employer-provided health care,tempering the rise in compensation per hour. Third, most recently, energy prices have declinedsharply this year and food prices are increasing less rapidly. Fourth, the price of computers isfalling even faster, reflecting, in part, the rapid pace of technical change.Some believe the collection of these temporary factors fully accounts for therecent favorable performance of inflation and such a view is not entirely implausible. But I donot hold this view. I believe that other longer lasting factors may also be contributing. Onepossibility is an intriguing anomaly of the current expansion. I noted above that the change inutilization rates in the labor and goods markets (the unemployment rate and the capacityutilization rate) usually mirror one another over the cycle. In the current episode, these two
- 6 -measures have diverged to a greater degree than has been typical in the past. This divergence islikely related to another defining feature of this expansion, the investment boom which hasraised the level of net investment to the point where the capital stock is expanding rapidly,raising capacity and preventing the increase in demand from overtaking supply. Theunemployment rate is signaling that the labor market is tight; but the capacity utilization rateindicates that supply and demand are well balanced, at least in the industrial sector of theeconomy. As a result, there has been some upward pressure on wages, but no pass-through tohigher price inflation. Firms report an absence of pricing leverage because nothing gives a firmpricing power like excess demand and there is no apparent excess demand for U.S. firms,especially in the global market place where there is plenty of slack abroad.The most intriguing explanations of the recent favorable performance arestructural changes which may have expanded the limits to productive capacity and trend growth.These possibilities come in two forms: structural change in the labor market which lowersNAIRU and structural change in the product market, specifically higher productivity growth,which, at least temporarily also lowers the NAIRU, and which pushes out the limit of trendgrowth.One explanation for why we can sustain stable inflation with lowerunemployment is the worker insecurity hypothesis. According to this theory, corporaterestructuring, globalization, and technological change have increased workers’ insecurity abouttheir jobs. As a result, workers have been willing to accept some restraint on their real wages inorder to increase their prospects of remaining employed, leading to a more moderate rate ofincrease in wages than would otherwise have occurred at any given rate of unemployment.While this is consistent with a decline in the NAIRU, we cannot very precisely test the workerinsecurity hypothesis itself. But it does fit some of the facts of the current labor marketexperience. My conclusion is that NAIRU has declined, even taking into account the role oftemporary factors, though I cannot pin down definitely the source of the decline. I am simplyadjusting my estimate to the data. The worker insecurity hypothesis is a possible explanation.An example of a product market structural change would be an increase in trendproductivity growth. This is clearly the most intriguing of all the potential explanations, becauseit ties together so many puzzles. It can explain why we are in a midst of an investment boom,why the profit share of income has been rising, why inflation is so well contained, and whystock prices have soared. The only problem is the data. It is true that productivity has increasedmore rapidly recently. This is not clear-cut evidence of a shift in the productivity trend,however, because productivity normally accelerates when output growth rises, as it has over thelast year. There is, however, some support for the view that we are experiencing a speed-up inthe trend rate of productivity growth. For example, if we measure productivity from the incomeside rather than the product side of the national accounts, we do observe a sharper acceleration inproductivity. This income-side measure of productivity provides at least a tantalizing hint of anincrease in trend productivity growth. This would also be consistent with a considerable numberof reports by businesses that they are realizing new efficiencies in production, both throughcorporate reorganization and through the application of new technology.What was the rationale for the March 25 tightening?The discussion of the rationale for the March 25 policy move to follow is mypersonal view. During the period from June 1996, when I joined the Board, through February1997, utilization rates had remained in a very narrow range, in the case of the unemploymentrate only a shade below my estimate of NAIRU. Recall that the unemployment rate averaged
- 7 -5.4% in 1996. There was some risk that utilization rates were already so high that inflationmight increase over time, but this risk was not clear enough, in my judgment, to justify action. Iviewed growth as either close to trend already or about to slow to trend, implying that there wasnegligible risk that utilization rates would rise further. So, before March 25, the FederalReserve’s posture was one of “watchful waiting,” but with an asymmetric directive, based on thejudgment that the risks were weighted toward higher inflation.In March, my view was that there was sufficient momentum in growth to justify aforecast that utilization rates would rise materially further, in the absence of a change in policy.The policy action was clearly a preemptive one, not based on inflation pressures evident at thetime, but on inflation pressures likely to emerge in the absence of policy action. As theChairman has repeatedly emphasized, lags in the response to monetary policy make it imperativethat monetary policy be forward looking and anticipatory, not backward looking and reactive.One of the principles of prudent monetary policy management, in my judgment,is to lean gently against the cyclical winds. This means that when growth is above trend andutilization rates are increasing, it is often prudent to allow short-term rates to rise. Monetarypolicy should not sit on interest rates and wait until the economy blows by capacity and inflationtakes off. To do so would risk a serious boom-bust cycle, and would require abrupt and decisiveincreases in interest rates later to regain control of inflation. A small, cautious step early is therecipe for avoiding the necessity of a sharper destabilizing move later on.What does the record show? Growth was much stronger in the first quarter than Ihad anticipated and appears to have slowed to trend in the second quarter. The legacy of therobust first-quarter growth was a decline in the unemployment rate to below 5% in the secondquarter. I call the March 25 move, as a result, “just-in-time” monetary policy. I believe it wasprudent. I voted in favor of it because I thought it would help to prolong the expansion andcontribute to the goal of maximum sustainable employment and maximum sustainable growth.
Ms. Rivlin reports on the positive perfomance of the US economy and thepolicies needed to sustain growth in the future   Testimony of the Vice Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, Ms. Alice M. Rivlin, before the Committee onBanking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 23/7/97.I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the Committee for holding thishearing to solicit a wide range of views on appropriate monetary policy at this extremely favorablemoment in our economic history. All too often congressional hearings are called when something badis happening. In a deteriorating situation, Congress finds it necessary to survey the damage, assessresponsibility and call for better policies in the future.At the moment, however, the economy as a whole is functioning amazingly well.Employment is high and rising, unemployment is low, incomes are increasing, profits are high, theFederal budget deficit is plummeting, state and local finances are increasingly strong, and inflation isbenign. The overriding economic objective -- shared by all participants in the economy -- is to keepthe good news flowing. We all want the economy to grow at its highest sustainable rate, to keepunemployment and inflation low, and above all, to avoid recession as long as possible.Thoughtful people, at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, have somewhat differentviews about why the economy is doing so well and how best to keep it going. Your invitation toshare those views is timely, constructive and welcome.I would like briefly to discuss three questions:1.Why is the economy performing so well -- and, in particular, why do we haveso little   inflation with such low unemployment?2.Why is it so important, especially right now, to keep the economy growing atits highest sustainable rate and to avoid recession?3.What policies -- monetary and other economic policies -- are most likely tokeep economic performance high and sustained?Why is the economy doing so well?Most economists are frankly surprised that the economy has been able to grow fastenough to push unemployment rates below 5 percent without generating accelerating inflation. Untilrecently, most students of the economy thought that unemployment rates below 5.5 - 6.0 percent(estimates differed) for an appreciable period would lead to rising labor costs that would be passed onin higher prices and start a self-perpetuating wage-price spiral that would be hard to reverse. True,unemployment had been lower in the 1960s while inflation remained low, but the structure of theeconomy and the characteristics of the labor force subsequently changed in ways that seemed to makethe economy more inflation-prone for given levels of unemployment. The experience of the periodsince about 1970 appeared to confirm that inflationary pressure emerged at unemployment ratesappreciably higher than those of the 1960s.Five years ago, most economists would have thought the Federal Reserveirresponsible and derelict in its duty if it had not used monetary policy to slow an economy operatingat such a high level that unemployment remained under 5.5 percent for more than a short time. Theinflation might not appear immediately, but it was thought to be inevitable, and allowing it to get up ahead of steam before acting was taking a high risk of having to react more strongly, perhaps stronglyenough to bring on a recession.Nevertheless, the unemployment rate has been below 5.5 percent for over a year andbelow 5.0 percent in 1997 while inflation has shown no signs of picking up -- indeed, producer pricesBIS Review   72/1997
- 2 -have actually been falling. The Federal Reserve, except for a quarter point tightening of the federalfunds rate in March (after months of inaction), has left the monetary levers alone. Is the FederalReserve ignoring risks of future inflation?The answer depends on whether the coexistence of higher growth and lowerunemployment with benign inflation is explained by a fundamental improvement in the structure ofthe economy making it less inflation-prone, or by temporary factors that might return to “normal” andkick-off an inflationary wage-price spiral, or by some combination of the two. The honest answer is:We don't know yet.One surprise has been that such tight labor markets have not resulted in more rapidincreases in wages and other labor compensation. Part of the explanation, as Chairman Greenspannoted in his testimony on July 22, may lie in less aggressive behavior on the part of workers.Workers may be more reluctant than previously to bargain for higher compensation or to take drasticaction, such as striking or quitting to look for a better job. They may be reluctant because they areinsecure in the face of rapidly changing technology, for which they fear they may not have the rightskills, because they have recent memories of company “downsizing,” or because they are less likelythan in previous tight labor markets to be members of a union. These explanations of less aggressiveworker behavior are plausible, but likely to be temporary. Workers are not likely to get more insecureas low unemployment continues, and union strength is unlikely to ebb further.Part of the explanation of moderate compensation increases may also lie in moreaggressive employer resistance to labor cost increases than in previous cycles. Business owners andmanagers appear to believe strongly that they are operating in such a competitive environment --whether domestic or international -- that they cannot pass cost increases on to their customers inhigher prices because they would lose those customers to competitors overseas or down the street.Low import prices resulting from growing international competition and the strong dollar reinforcethis perception. Domestic markets have also become more fiercely competitive as the result ofderegulation, lower transportation and communication costs, and more competitive business attitudes.These competitive forces, well known to workers, may give employers a plausible reason -- or atleast an excuse -- for strong resistance to wage and benefit demands.The subdued inflation rate itself, moreover, has dampened inflationary expectations.These lower expectations contribute both to diminished compensation demands of workers and stifferemployer resistance to those demands. An important contribution to lower total compensation costshas also come from the slowdown in the rise of health benefit costs associated with the shift tomanaged care and the general reduction in the rate of health care inflation. It is not yet clear howmuch of this slowdown is temporary.The other surprise is that prices have shown no reaction to the moderate compensationincreases that have occurred. Increased foreign and domestic competitiveness is certainly part of theanswer, but the remarkable fact is that this competition has not generally eroded profit margins.Persistent high profits suggest that, on the average, employers have been able to increase productivityenough to absorb larger compensation increases without comparable price increases. Whether theywill be able to continue to do so is the crucial unanswered question facing monetary policy makers atthe moment. Measured productivity has grown slowly for more than two decades and did notaccelerate in this expansion as economists hoped it would. Nevertheless, output per hour seems tohave picked up a little recently, which is surprising late in an expansion when productivity increasenormally slows. If productivity growth were on the verge of sustained acceleration, a possibilitydiscussed in Chairman Greenspan's testimony, it would greatly increase the chances of highersustained growth without accelerating inflation. There are reasons to be optimistic, but only time willtell if the optimists are right.BIS Review  72/1997
- 3 -Why is sustained growth so important now?It is always desirable to live in an economy that is growing at a healthy rate. Thegeneral standard of living rises and average people are normally better off. Not only do privateresources grow, giving consumers more and better choices, but public resources also grow, making iteasier to solve public problems and improve national and community infrastructure. Healthy growthhas to be sustainable, not bought at the price of environmental degradation or inflationary overheatingthat turns a boom into a bust.Nevertheless, there are at least three reasons why it seems especially important for theUnited States in the next few years to do everything possible to keep the economy growing at ahealthy sustainable rate and avoid recession.Welfare reformRecent legislation requires extremely ambitious state and Federal efforts to reducedependency and channel large portions of the present and future welfare population into self-supporting jobs. For these efforts to be even moderately successful will require effective skill trainingand job placement, adequate child care and, above all, low unemployment rates and plentiful entrylevel jobs. If economic expansion continues and labor markets remain tight, there is a good chancethat many families who would otherwise have depended on welfare can acquire the job skills andexperience that can enable them to live more independent and satisfying lives. If the economy slidesinto recession before welfare recipients have time to establish new skills, work patterns and eligibilityfor unemployment benefits, welfare reform is almost certain to be a failure, if not an outright disaster.Community developmentPartnerships for community development are beginning to create new hope for somedevastated areas of big cities, smaller towns and rural areas. Partners include business andcommunity groups, financial institutions and governments. With continued economic growth and lowunemployment, these efforts could transform many blighted areas into viable communities withdecent housing and an economic base. Recession, especially a deep one, would dry up public andprivate resources and greatly reduce the chances of successful community development.Preparing for more older peoplePerhaps the biggest challenge to the U.S. economy (indeed to all industrialeconomies) over the next couple of decades is the prospective rise in the ratio of elderly to workingage people. Barring a huge increase in working age immigrants or dramatic increases in the length ofworking life, the number of retirees will rise much faster than the working population beginning earlyin the next century. No matter what combination of public and private pensions are used to sort outthe claims of retirees to a share of the nation's output, the only way to guarantee a rising standard ofliving for both retirees and workers is to greatly increase the future productivity of that workforce. Ahigh growth economy over the next decade could generate enough saving and investment to makethat increased future workforce productivity feasible. Slower growth and repeated recessions couldmake the burden of an aging population far heavier and policy choices more contentious.What policies are needed?These three challenges to the American economy simply reinforce the need to keepthe economy on the highest sustainable growth track attainable and to keep recessions as shallow andinfrequent as possible. The biggest problem for monetary policy at the moment is that no one knowswhat growth rate is sustainable. It may be true that the structure of the economy has changed in waysBIS Review   72/1997
- 4 -that make a higher growth rate sustainable without inflation than we thought possible a few years ago-- or it may not be true. The question turns on whether productivity growth has shifted up out of thedoldrums of the last couple of decades. It's possible that it has, but by no means certain.This leaves monetary policymakers with the difficult job of watching all the signs,weighing the risks and making a new judgment call every few weeks. At the moment, there seems tobe little risk of the economy slowing down too much in the near term and sliding into recession.Growth has already slowed from its clearly unsustainable pace in the first quarter, but all the currentsigns point to continued economic expansion for the rest of this year and into the next. The risksseem higher on the other side -- that many of the factors holding down inflationary pressures willprove temporary, that the rebound of productivity necessary for higher sustainable growth will notoccur or not prove robust and durable. The Federal Open Market Committee has to weigh the risk ofslowing the economy unnecessarily against the risk of waiting too long and having to put the brakeson harder later. Waiting longer may increase the possibility of overheating followed by recession. It'sa tough call. I can't promise we will make the right decisions, but I can promise we will try.It is important not to overestimate the role of monetary policy and the FederalReserve. Monetary policy can help keep the economy from falling off the sustainable growth track ineither direction -- either by overheating and generating enough inflation to unbalance the economyand threaten growth or by chugging along too slowly with excessive unemployment. But monetarypolicy cannot do much to determine how high the sustainable growth rate is. How fast the economycan grow is determined by how rapidly the employed labor force is increasing and how fast theproductivity of that workforce is growing. There are only two ways to get more output: either morepeople work or working people produce more (or both).In the 1960s and 1970s, the American workforce was growing rapidly as the largebaby boom generation reached working age and women, especially mothers, moved into theworkforce in much larger proportions than previously. But those two trends have run their course.The labor force is likely to grow slowly over the next few years, about 1 percent per year. The mainhope for increasing labor force growth, besides encouraging more immigration, is that continued tightlabor markets plus increased flexibility in employment hours will gradually begin to reverse thetrends to early retirement that has reduced labor force participation among older people. Continuedemployment opportunities combined with well-designed training programs, especially in computerrelated skills, could also attract into the labor force people who are not actively looking for workbecause they don't think they have the skills to get a “good” job -- principally older workers andyoung people who have dropped out of school.Indeed, the shortage of workers with modern technical skills may be the biggestproblem facing the American economy at the moment, as well as its biggest opportunity. As long aslabor markets stay tight, investment in skill training is likely to pay off handsomely both forindividuals and for companies that can retain the trained workers long enough to benefit from theirincreased productivity. Public investment in training for workers with low skills -- often unsuccessfulwhen jobs are scarce -- also stands a far better chance in tight labor markets of moving workers intojobs in which they can gain increasing skills, experience and higher wages. Continued lowunemployment rates, plus public and private investment in skill training are essential, not only forsuccessful welfare reform, but also for modernizing the skills of the portion of the workforce whosereal incomes and opportunities have declined both relatively and absolutely in the last couple ofdecades.The other key to productivity increase, of course, is continued investment, both publicand private, in research and development and the technology and infrastructure needed for continuousmodernization of the economy. Stable low inflation tends to foster long-term planning and investmentby businesses and households. A high growth economy should generate more of the saving needed toBIS Review  72/1997
- 5 -finance the investment. Reducing the public dissaving inherent in running a deficit in the Federalbudget also adds to national saving. Near term reform of social security and Medicare in ways thatadd to national saving, public and private, could make a significant contribution to future productivityincrease and hence to raising the future rate of sustainable economic growth.In summary, the objective of economic policy -- monetary policy included -- is tokeep the economy on the highest sustainable growth path. No one knows exactly what that rate isright now, or what it can be in the future, but a combination of policies, intelligently pursued, canraise it as far as possible. These policies include:wise monetary policy that helps the economy expand, and keeps labor markets tight,without incurring excessive risk of accelerating inflation;investment in skills by individuals, firms and the public and non-profit sectors;increased saving (public and private) invested in research, technology andinfrastructure.The Federal Reserve will do its part, in the face of huge uncertainties, to steer anappropriate monetary policy. Fiscal and other policies, both public and private, are needed to take fulladvantage of the opportunity we have today to keep the American economy operating at a high levelin the future.BIS Review   72/1997
Bank of Japan presents its quarterly economic outlook for summer 1997BANK OF JAPAN, QUARTERLY BULLETIN, August 1997 (advance summary).1.Japan’s economy continues on a moderate recovery trend.  Production andincome are showing underlying firmness despite the continued reaction to the temporary surge indemand ahead of the consumption tax hike.  Among final demand items, public-sectorinvestment has been on a decreasing trend, and housing investment has been somewhatlackluster, particularly as a result of the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumptiontax hike.  On the other hand, net exports have recently increased significantly and business fixedinvestment has been rising steadily.  Despite the continued decline in demand which followedthe rise ahead of the consumption tax hike, particularly in consumer durables, the recovery trendin personal consumption does not seem to have been hindered.  In these circumstances, industrialproduction has been firm and the growth in employees’ income has been rising steadily, albeitmoderately.Price indices were pushed up in April 1997 by the consumption tax hike, butexcluding this factor, prices have been stable.  Both quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year changesin domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have been near zero, and theyear-to-year declines in corporate service prices have narrowed.  The year-to-year rises inconsumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables) are widening somewhat, albeit by a smallmargin.  Changes in commercial land prices have varied by type, and residential land prices havevirtually stopped declining.2.In the financial markets, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) stayedslightly below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent.  The long-term government bond yieldrebounded to near 2.7 per cent in late May, as market uncertainties about the economic outlookand the Japanese financial system gradually subsided after the second half of April.  However, itdeclined to around 2.2 - 2.3 per cent.  Stock prices rose to ¥20,000 - 21,000 in May and June1997, and have recently been fluctuating without showing clear direction.  In the foreignexchange market, the yen reached ¥127 to the U.S. dollar in early May, but later appreciated andhas recently moved at around ¥113 - 116 to the U.S. dollar.With respect to the fund-raising activities by firms, growth in bank lendingcontinues to be lackluster but fund-raising through the capital market has been high, particularlyin straight bonds.  Growth in monetary aggregates in terms of M2 + CDs year-to-year averageoutstanding has continued at around 3.0 per cent.3.Looking at individual components of final demand, public-sectorinvestment will be supported by implementation of public works included in the government’ssupplementary budget for fiscal 1996 for the time being, but it is expected to follow a decliningtrend.  Net exports, on the other hand, are likely to continue to be steady even after the recentlarge increase.  This reflects the robust increase in overseas demand, and the recovery in theprice competitiveness of Japan’s manufacturing industry supported by the yen’s depreciationuntil early spring.In these circumstances, corporate profits on the whole are expected to continueimproving in fiscal 1997 although with varied strength across sectors.  Business fixed investmentis also expected to continue increasing, mainly reflecting 1) increases in corporate profits,2) further progress in capital stock adjustments, and 3) the rise in information-relatedinvestment.  However, because of the remaining balance-sheet adjustment pressures and theBIS Review   /1997
- 2 -absence of leading industries, the increase in business fixed investment is unlikely to gathersignificant momentum for the time being.The growth in the employees’ income has been rising gradually owing to theincrease in bonus payments and the moderate recovery in employment growth, reflecting theimprovement in the labor market conditions.  This shows that the recovery in the business sectorhas spread to the household sector.  Thus, recovery in personal consumption is expected tocontinue after the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike subsides inthe near future.  However, the pace of recovery is likely to be moderate considering the increasesin the tax burden, such as the rise in the consumption tax.  Meanwhile, housing investment,which is in a generally favorable environment including low interest rates, is expected to recoversomewhat in the second half of fiscal 1997, although it has recently been weak reflecting thereaction to the surge in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike.4.With respect to price developments, the downward pressure on domesticprices from the increase in manufactured imports has weakened, as the rise in import penetrationrate has paused.  On the other hand, the upward pressure on import costs from materials priceshas also subsided owing to the decline in crude oil prices since spring 1997 and the appreciationof the yen.  Thus, import prices are not exerting significant upward nor downward pressure ondomestic prices.  Meanwhile, final demand will continue to recover on the whole, but the outputgap is unlikely to narrow significantly as the pace of recovery in final demand is expected to bemoderate.  In these circumstances, prices are expected to be stable for some time.5.In sum, the positive cycle among production, income and expenditurecontinues steadily and is reflected in the improvement in corporate profits and the rise inemployees’ income.  Thus, despite the restraining pressures from fiscal policies, including theconsumption tax hike and the decline in public-sector investment, Japan’s economy is expectedto continue its recovery, supported by the yen’s depreciation until early spring and the expansionof information-related demand.  However, the economic recovery is unlikely to gathersignificant momentum, as a result of fragility in some sectors, as well as the continued balance-sheet adjustment pressure.  In these circumstances, building an economic environment whichincreases the confidence of the private sector is vital to strengthening the economic recovery.  Inthis process, effective structural reforms to draw out the dynamism inherent in the economycontinue to be essential in addition to appropriate macroeconomic policies.
Bank of France reports industrial output continued to make progress inJune 1997   BANK OF FRANCE, MONTHLY BUSINESS REVIEW, June 1997.According to the business leaders surveyed by the Banque de France,industrial output continued to make progress in June. Output of consumer and intermediategoods advanced significantly, with a more moderate increase for capital goods, whereas itlevelled out in the food-processing industry and slightly dipped in the automobile industry.Capacity utilization rates recovered.Overall demand strengthened both in France and abroad. Export sales grewconsiderably, in particular to Great Britain, Italy and the United States. Domestic demand rose,stimulated to some extent by inventory replenishment.Order books seem generally satisfactory. While they have emptied outsomewhat in the food processing industry, they remain on the full side in the capital goodssector. Inventories are only just above desired levels, despite an increase in the consumer goodssector, and above all in the automobile and food processing industries.In the coming months, activity is likely to intensify across the board, exceptfor the automobile sector which is expected to stabilize.Overall, raw material and finished goods prices changed little. The cost ofsupplies climbed in certain branches of the intermediate goods sector, mainly due to the rise inthe dollar, although these increases were not passed on to sales prices.Business managers continued to take a cautious stance on investment. Thelittle capital expenditure there was primarily concerned the modernisation of equipment andbringing it into line with standards.Retail activity, which was buoyant in May, fell back in June partly due topoor weather conditions. In aggregate, activity was up over the last two months.The construction and civil engineering sector1 recovered in the secondquarter of 1997 primarily as a result of seasonal factors.Employment levels held steady in industry, except for the automobile sector,where there was a further contraction, and the building, retail and market services sectors.Wherever possible, companies sought to enhance workforce flexibility via temporary staff andovertime, in order to cope with fluctuating demand and organize themselves for the summervacation period.__________________1Unadjusted data.BIS Review 70/1997
Mr. Stals looks at the future of financial co-operation in Southern AfricaSpeech by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. Chris Stals, at a conference onSouthern Africa: Resources, Investment and Trade, arranged by Forum Southern Africa Limitedin London on 10/7/97.1. The reintegration of South Africa in the world economyGood progress has been made over the past four years with the reintegration ofSouth Africa in the world economy. The political and social changes introduced in South Africapaved the way for the removal of international economic punitive actions that partly isolated thecountry’s economy from the rest of the world during the ten years preceding the fullydemocratic election of a Government of National Unity in April 1994.Even before the election took place, the rest of the world gave its support to themoves towards democracy by lifting sanctions, boycotts, disinvestment campaigns and traderestrictions. Since 1994, the following major changes took place in South Africa’s internationaleconomic relations:(i) South Africa became a full participating member again in variousmultinational institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the UnitedNations and the African Development Bank.(ii) Agreements were entered into with the World Trade Organisation for asubstantial revision over a five year period in the protective import tariff structure, and certaindiscriminatory export subsidies were removed.(iii) Exchange controls were substantially relaxed to introduce full convertibilityfor current account transactions, to remove all exchange controls applicable to non-residents andgradually to lift the remaining exchange controls applicable to the outward investment of capitalby South African residents.(iv) An extensive liberalisation programme of the South African financial marketsincluded major changes in the capital market, e.g. to allow for foreign and corporate ownershipof stock broking members of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and the opening up of the SouthAfrican banking sector for foreign competition. There are now 17 foreign banks with branchesand subsidiaries in South Africa, and about 60 foreign banks with representative offices.(v) A number of new bilateral, regional and international economic co-operationagreements were entered into, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC)and the arrangements with the European Union for closer economic co-operation.These changes have had a material effect on South Africa’s internationaleconomic relations and are reflected in a very visible way in the South African balance ofpayments. Over the three years 1991 to 1993, the current account of the balance of paymentsshowed a surplus of US $5.8 billion, and the capital account a net outflow of $7.1 billion. Theofficial foreign reserves therefore declined by $1.3 billion. When the new Government cameinto power in April 1994, the country had virtually no official foreign reserves left.Over the past three years, that is from 1994 to 1996, the current account of thebalance of payments showed an accumulated deficit of $5.1 billion.

At the end of June 1997, the Bank held an amount of $4.9 billion in reserves,which was still relatively low (sufficient cover for 7 weeks’ imports), but nevertheless muchbetter than four years ago.The balance of payments developments merely reflected the changes in total grossdomestic economic activity. The average rate of change in gross domestic product over the threeyears 1991 to 1993 showed a decline of 0.6 per cent, compared to an average rate of increase of3.1 per cent over the next three years. The average rate of change in gross domestic expenditurechanged from a decline of 0.3 per cent per annum from 1991 to 1993, to 4.9 per cent growthover the next three years.2. South Africa’s role in Southern AfricaThe developments over the past few years enabled South Africa to take on a moreactive part in the economic development of the Southern African region. Economic co-operationin Southern Africa has been formalised through the Southern African Development CommunityTreaty of August 1992, which incorporated the following goals:* To achieve development and economic growth, enhance the standard andquality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa, and support the sociallydisadvantaged through regional integration;* To promote and maximise productive employment and the utilisation ofresources of the region; and* To achieve sustainable utilisation of natural resources and effective protectionof the environment.To achieve its objectives, SADC shall:* Harmonise political and socio-economic policies and plans of member states;* Mobilise the peoples of the region and their institutions to take initiatives todevelop economic, social and cultural ties across the region, and to participatefully in the implementation of the programmes and operations of SADC and itsinstitutions;* Develop policies aimed at the progressive elimination of obstacles to freemovement of capital and labour, goods and services, and of the peoples of theregion generally among member states;* Promote the development of human resources;* Promote the development, transfer and mastery of technology, and* Improve economic management and performance through regionalco-operation.The Treaty provides for other political, social and cultural objectives which arenot of direct relevance for the enhancing of financial co-operation in the region.South Africa has been given the task to manage the Finance and InvestmentSector of SADC, and the South African Reserve Bank was given the important role toco-ordinate the functions of the central banks of the twelve member states in the promotion ofthe SADC objectives. For this purpose, a Committee of Governors of Central Banks of SADCBIS Review 69/1997
- 3 -was created, with a small secretariat in the South African Reserve Bank, and a research unit toprovide assistance to the Governors’ Committee.In drafting its mission statement, the Committee of Governors designed a modelfor financial co-operation that was described as a “bottom-up” approach. This approach is basedon building financial co-operation by first laying an appropriate foundation in the form of aneffective institutional framework for the financial system in each country. More ambitiousschemes for the harmonisation or integration of macroeconomic monetary policies can beconsidered at a later stage, i.e., once central banks, competitive private banking sectors andfinancial markets have been established on a firmer basis, and are functioning effectively in mostof the participating countries.In its work programme, the Committee of Governors has made good progresswith the following projects:* The development of a monetary and financial statistical data base, captured inthe computer of the Reserve Bank in Pretoria, with the intention of providingreal-time on-line access to the information to all participating central banks; * The development of an information bank on the policies, structures andfunctions of the 12 SADC central banks;* The harmonisation of the development of national payment, clearing andsettlement systems within each one of the twelve SADC countries, and theeventual provision for a network of cross-border settlements in the region;* The co-ordination of exchange controls, and the gradual removal of exchangecontrols, in the region. South Africa is now relaxing its exchange controls stillapplicable to foreign capital investment by South African residents in respect ofinvestments in other SADC countries faster than for the rest of the world;* The co-ordination of training of officials of all SADC central banks. The SouthAfrican Reserve Bank has introduced a specialised Training Institute for CentralBanking, and is now providing specialised courses in central banking andfinancial management for its own staff and officials of other central banks in theSADC region.* There is also a more ambitious training programme provided through theMacroeconomic and Financial Management Institute (MEFMI), with itsheadquarters in Harare. The objective of MEFMI is to assist Governments(Treasuries) and central banks to develop internal capacity for macroeconomicmanagement;* The development of the quality of, and capacity for, proper bank regulation andsupervision. Some harmonisation is encouraged on policies such as banklicensing, minimum prudential financial requirements, and regular auditing ofbanking institutions. A joint effort is also being made to take the necessary stepsagainst illegal banking activities in the region, such as money laundering andpyramid schemes.* The forum for closer co-operation amongst the central banks of the region hasnow been firmly established. The work of the Committee, apart fromconsolidating the projects so far undertaken, will now be extended to the level ofthe private banking sector, and of the development of financial and capitalmarkets in the common interest of the region as a whole.BIS Review 69/1997
- 4 -3. Economic challenges for South AfricaSouth Africa now finds itself in the challenging situation that, in one direction, itsfinancial markets are rapidly being integrated in the global financial system, and in the otherdirection it is becoming more and more part of the difficult process of supporting andstimulating economic development in the Southern African region. At the same time, dauntingproblems still remain unsolved in the internal economy of the country. The new Government hashad remarkable success over the past few years in the implementation of disciplined fiscal andmonetary policies, and has gained confidence from investors and business people in itsdetermination to apply sound economic policies in general.Little progress, however, has been made in solving one of the most urgentproblems of the South African economy, and that is to create sufficient jobs for the growingpopulation. Total employment in the country is now hardly more than what it was at thebeginning of the nineties.South Africa’s economic policies must, at this stage, maintain good balancebetween the process of globalisation, the satisfaction of the dire basic needs of the domesticpopulation, and the desire to assist in the economic development of the region. In a holisticapproach, these various objectives are not in conflict with each other, but are in many respectssupplementary. Successful participation in the global financial markets will lead to a largerinflow of foreign investment capital into South Africa, that will enable the country to do morefor the upliftment of its own people, and for the development of the region. But this will subjectall the macroeconomic initiatives of the country to the disciplines of the global investmentcommunity. These disciplines, tested by world-wide experience, amply reward successes, butseverely punish failures.With its economic policies of the past few years, South Africa has already provedthat it is determined to stand up to this challenge. The process of economic liberalisation andintegration into the global markets must continue; economic co-operation in Southern Africa,and with countries further North in Africa, will be extended; the implementation of theGovernment’s Reconstruction and Development Programme, and the Strategy for Growth,Employment and Redistribution, will be pursued with vigour and determination.The task ahead is not an easy one. South Africa, and Africa, will need all theassistance it can get from the rest of the world. There is growing optimism that, in the earlyyears of the 21st century, Africa will succeed in its concerted efforts to improve the livingconditions of all the people of our Continent.BIS Review 69/1997
Mr. Heikensten looks at the prospects for the Swedish economy against thebackground of the central bank’s monetary policy  Speech by the Deputy Governor of theBank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, given at the Centre Party’s Economic Seminar inHaparanda on 15/6/97.I should like to begin with a word of thanks for the invitation to talk to you here.In these introductory remarks I shall be discussing the economic situation.Sweden’s economy presents many positive aspects: the outlook for growth is good, the generalgovernment deficit is estimated to be eliminated next year and the low inflation policy isbecoming more and more established. But there are also persistent economic problems to solve,not least in the labour market.Before considering the economic situation, however, I thought I would saysomething about monetary policy, the role of the Riksbank and the changes in the status of theRiksbank that recently gained the support of five of the political parties in Sweden’s parliament,including the Centre Party.1. Monetary policy and the role of the RiksbankWhy low inflation?In the past decade there has been a growing awareness of low inflation’simportance as a central condition for the proper workings of an economy. This has been the casenot just in Sweden but virtually throughout the western world. The significance of price stabilityis clearly demonstrated by Sweden’s experience in earlier decades. The economic climate in the1950s and 1960s, with low inflation, high and stable growth and low unemployment makes asharp contrast with the 1970s and 1980s, when attempts to keep the price rise on a par with therest of the world failed and a series of devaluations had negative effects on wage formation,productivity and economic growth.There is reason to believe that the high and fluctuating inflation in the 1970s and1980s contributed to the weak state of investment and productivity. The recurrent crises overwage costs generated uncertainty about business profits and thereby about the conditions forinvestment. And although the devaluations did lead to a temporary improvement of profitabilityin the sector exposed to foreign competition, they also eased the pressure for structuraladjustments.By concealing important economic signals, high and fluctuating inflation impairsthe workings of the economy. Households and firms are less able to make rational consumptionand investment decisions and planning for the longer term is more difficult. The risks are greaterand the required return, including compensation for the risks, rises. Decision-making thereforebecomes more short term and speculative.A good example is Sweden’s real estate boom in the 1980s. The combination ofhigh inflation and the tax system at that time meant that speculative capital was attracted to theproperty market. Financing more productive investment became comparatively difficult. Wheninflation fell back in the early 1990s it became apparent that the investments in real estate hadbeen founded on unrealistic expectations that prices would continue to rise. The property marketcollapsed and credit institutions were hit by massive loan losses. The bank crisis accordinglyaccentuated the economic downturn in Sweden.BIS Review   68/1997
- 2 -Inflation is also associated with an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth,often contrary to the ambitions of distribution policy. Referring again to the 1980s, the chieflosers from the inflationary economy at that time, with the resultant price fall, were probably notthe property speculators but households whose bank savings were eroded by two-digit inflationand whose wages were only subsequently adjusted for inflation.Price stability is the Riksbank’s objectiveThe reason why monetary policy is assigned the task of safeguarding the value ofmoney is basically simple: by adopting an appropriate monetary stance the central bank canchoose, or at least strongly influence, the rate of inflation. In the short run price increases are ofcourse affected by many other factors such as the state of economic activity, the direction offiscal policy, wage formation, etc. But in the long run inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Bycontrolling the supply of money in a wide sense, in the long term the Riksbank can also governmovements in the value of money and in inflation.Interest rate management by the Riksbank cannot, on the other hand, generateeconomic growth and employment in the longer run. The crucial factors for this are quitedifferent, such as capital formation, demographic trends, advances in technology and education,how the economy functions, etc. Some scope for stimulating the economy may exist in the shortrun but this presupposes an established confidence in economic policy’s commitment to pricestability. If economic agents have doubts about economic policy, attempts to stimulate demandwill be liable to elicit an upward shift in the rate of inflation that is expected by firms,households, trade unions and others. Wages and prices may then start to chase each other as theydid in the 1970s and 1980s. The longer market rates of interest, which the Riksbank caninfluence only marginally, will begin to move up and the ultimate effect on demand may be theopposite of what was intended. The outcome may be a combination of low growth and highinflation.Much accordingly depends on the confidence that the price stability policy enjoys.In an economy where a low inflation policy is firmly established, it is easier to lower the interestrate without eliciting uncertainty about monetary policy’s long-term commitment. There is, quitesimply, more room to manoeuvre. But this does of course presuppose that the outlook for futureinflation condones such a policy.Independence and accountabilityThe institutional framework for monetary policy is important for underpinningconfidence in long-term economic policy. The agreement announced recently between fivepolitical parties concerning measures to strengthen the formal status of the Riksbank is thereforea good thing, even though it amounts in many respects to a codification of current practice. It isa clear demonstration that the political system supports a monetary policy that focuses on pricestability consistently and over the long term. Increased confidence in the low inflation policyamong economic agents implies greater opportunities of supporting economic activity in practicewhen the conditions for inflation so permit.Some voices in the public debate have chosen to see this as a move towards amonetary policy that is less democratic. Such an interpretation is comprehensible but no lessmisleading for that. It is the Riksdag, Sweden’s parliament, that lays down monetary policy’sobjective and elects the governing board, which then appoints the members of the directorate fora term of six years. The proposed changes mean that the practical execution of the monetaryBIS Review  68/1997
- 3 -policy objective as established by the Riksdag is entrusted to the Riksbank. We can concentrateon this task and build up the competence that is needed to do the job properly.At the same time there is less risk of monetary policy being influenced by variousshort-term considerations. One way of describing the consequences of the reform is to say thatthe delegation improves the conditions for attaining the objective of low inflation that theRiksdag has ordained. At the same time, an independent status for the Riksbank calls for more inthe way of accountability. It will be even more important that monetary policy decisions areanchored - at the political level as well as among a broader public - by means of clear motivationand an open dialogue. Decisions to adjust the interest rate tend to affect both households andfirms very directly and specifically. It is therefore vital to gain an understanding for ourexecution of monetary policy.In recent years the Riksbank has done a great deal to promote an increasedunderstanding of what we do. This work must continue. One instance of transparency is the clearfocus on the 2 per cent inflation target. In that this target and our tolerance interval of 1percentage point are clearly specified, the Riksbank’s operations are open to assessment.Our policy involves adjusting the instrumental interest rate - the repo rate - to alevel that we judge to be in accordance with the inflation target. Experience tells us that a changein the short interest rate has its full impact on inflation after a time lag of one to two years.Consequently, the Riksbank has to operate in a relatively long time perspective - the interest ratehas to be set in the light of forecasts of what the rate of inflation will be one to two years ahead.Our assessments of future inflation are presented continuously in speeches and variouspublications, above all the quarterly inflation reports. What I now have to say about theeconomic situation in Sweden is largely taken from the latest inflation report, which waspublished about a fortnight ago.2. The economic situationActivity is strengtheningIn the period since 1993, when economic activity in Sweden turned upwards afterthe profound crisis, growth in annual terms has averaged 2.7 per cent, which is higher than wewere accustomed to in the inflationary period in the 1970s and 1980s. The growth has also had afavourable composition, coming primarily from exports and investment. This has contributed toa period of expansion without any appreciable capacity shortages. The good export performancehas also led to sizable current account surpluses, making it possible to repay foreign debt.Private consumption has been restrained by the measures taken to consolidategovernment finance. This consolidation will continue on a substantial scale in the years aheadbut its effects have probably peaked. Together with a pent-up consumer demand, this leads us tocount on rising private consumption, though the labour market situation is a factor that webelieve will tend to make the increase relatively cautious.GDP growth in 1996 was held back by destocking and a continued fall in publicconsumption and investment. We envisage that the stock adjustments are now coming to an end.Together with some increase in consumption and a continuation of strong exports, this meansthat the outlook for growth in the coming years is relatively bright. Our assessment is thatgrowth in 1997 will amount to approximately 2 per cent, followed by 3 per cent in 1998.BIS Review   68/1997
- 4 -Inflation in line with the targetThe path of inflation largely depends on growth in relation to the economy’slong-term potential output - in other words on how the gap between actual and potential outputchanges - as well as on the inflation expectations of different economic agents.The Riksbank considers that 5 per cent growth in the coming years is compatiblewith low inflation, mainly because in general the economy has plenty of unutilised capacity. Inother words the output gap, which is affected by, for example, the labour market situation, is notexpected to close in the coming years.Structural changes and increased competition in several fields suggest that theSwedish economy’s inflation propensity has fallen. Deregulation has been carried out intransport and communications, for instance, and to some extent in the food sector. EUmembership has had positive effects for competition in Sweden, partly via increased competitionfrom imports. The new competition laws have also helped to strengthen competition.Changes of this type, as everyone knows, are positive in that they pave the wayfor lower consumer prices. Another consequence that is less evident and therefore worthunderscoring is that, in so far as the changes affect the outlook for inflation, they can provideroom for a somewhat less tight monetary stance.The continued fall in inflation expectations, to a level that for Sweden ishistorically low, likewise suggests that inflationary pressure is subdued. Agents in markets forlabour, goods and money now count on inflation being in line with the Riksbank’s inflationtarget in both the short and the medium term. Increased confidence in the inflation target can ofitself lower the inflation propensity. The rate of wage increases to date this year indicates thatthe parties in the labour market are beginning to act in line with the lower expectations; the newwage settlements that have been concluded in 1997 show a downward shift in the rate of wageincreases compared with 1996, towards levels that are more in line than before with theRiksbank’s inflation target.The Riksbank’s overall assessment is that in the coming two years the underlyingrate of inflation will be between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Registered inflation, however, will rise bydegrees with the disappearance of transitory effects that have pushed the CPI down in recentmonths. The registered rate will probably remain below the inflation target during 1997 and thenmove up towards two per cent in 1998. Against this background, in the inflation report theRiksbank considered that the monetary stance is well balanced.Forecasting inflation a couple of years ahead is, as everyone appreciates, a verydifficult matter. So there is good cause to be humble. In the inflation report we have highlighteda number of factors that may cause inflation to follow a different path. A weaker exchange ratethan we assume or a stronger increase in consumption could result in higher inflation. Theopposite effect could come from, for example, better productivity growth or a different pictureof resource utilisation. For the Riksbank it is therefore important continuously to assess newinformation that may provide guidance about the path of inflation.3. Two questionsThe picture of Sweden’s economy I have painted thus far is relatively bright. Thisis warranted. The economy has gone through a deep recession after the policy realignment in theBIS Review  68/1997
- 5 -early 1990s. Difficult adjustments have been made and we are now beginning to see the results.There are many resemblances with Denmark and other countries that have experienced similarprocesses of adjustment earlier. In every case it has taken time for the situation to become morestable and for households and firms to recover confidence.However, the bright picture must not blind us to the continued presence of seriouschallenges for economic policy. For one thing there is the importance of securing soundgovernment finance in the long run. For another there is the situation in the labour market. Ichoose to raise these two questions because what happens with fiscal policy and in the labourmarket is of great consequence for the Riksbank’s ability to safeguard the value of money. Itwould therefore be almost a dereliction of duty not to place these matters on the agenda asclearly and distinctly as we are able.Fiscal policy and monetary policy’s manoeuvrabilityLet me begin with fiscal policy. Since the dramatic deterioration of governmentfinance in the early 1990s there has been a remarkable recovery. From a deficit equivalent toover 12 per cent of GDP in 1993 the Government now counts on a deficit of 2 per cent for 1997.This consolidation, besides attracting praise from the European Union and internationalorganisations, has earned the confidence of our creditors; since 1995 the interest rate differentialbetween Swedish and German treasury bonds has narrowed from 3.5 to little more than 1percentage point.Even with the SEK 16 billion for expansionary measures in fiscal 1998 that theGovernment proposed in the Spring Economic Bill, the Swedish budget trend looks favourablein a European context.Notwithstanding these successes, there is reason to comment briefly on how fiscalpolicy influences the conditions for monetary policy and thereby the future development ofinterest rates. This influence acts in two ways.Firstly, fiscal policy is an important consideration for monetary policy in that itaffects the demand situation in the economy. An illustration of this is provided, for example, bythe recent years’ changes in household disposable income. Although household wage incomerose strongly from 1994 to 1997, the sector’s disposable income hardly changed. Householdincome has been held back by increased taxes and decreased transfers; but for the negativeeffects of changes in public systems, the annual level of household income would have been 3 to4 per cent higher. The burden on household income was probably greatest in 1996 but even inthe coming two years the fiscal stance measured in this way will be tight. It is accordinglyhelping to lower inflationary pressure.If, in the current situation with good prospects for growth, unexpected budgetimprovements were to be used to give fiscal policy a more expansionary turn, the result might bean earlier need to tighten monetary policy in order to secure the objective of price stability. It isthen by no means certain that the overall effect on demand would be what was intended.Secondly, the fiscal trend in a longer context of “sustainability” is also importantfor monetary policy. If the government deficit appears to be growing uncontrollably, as was thecase for some years in the early 1990s, uncertainty may arise as to whether the problems can betackled at all. This can have negative consequences for monetary policy; the exchange rate mayweaken sharply, for instance, with an increased risk of inflation. The budget consolidation hasBIS Review   68/1997
- 6 -naturally been important in this respect, too. It is the main single explanation for the krona’sappreciation since the crisis years, as well as for the Riksbank being in a position to lowerinterest rates so markedly.As a result of the years with massive general government deficits, however, from1990 to 1996 public sector debt has grown from 44 per cent of GDP to 78 per cent. This restrictsthe future freedom of action in economic policy and means that there is a risk of fiscal policy inpractice having a destabilising effect. This is particularly the case in that, with high revenue andspending ratios, the Swedish budget is sensitive to cyclical factors. Seen from this angle theGovernment’s target of a 2 per cent budget surplus over the economic cycle appears reasonable,though there is no academic foundation for a quantified level of ambition. There may be groundsfor strategic tax cuts to improve the long-term growth potential. But in the light of theexperience with government finance in recent decades a warning should be issued against taxcuts without parallel cuts in spending.Weak employmentThe labour market trends in recent years have been bleak. Although annualeconomic growth since 1993 has averaged 2.7 per cent, employment has not risen. This indicatesthat a considerable proportion of unemployment is structural in the sense that the level is liableto remain high even if activity continues to improve.The difficulty in generating new jobs is not confined to Sweden; it is a problemwe have in common with much of Europe. But there are countries in Europe that have succeededin turning the employment curve upwards since the mid 1980s. I am thinking in particular of theNetherlands, where employment, after a long period of stagnation, has been increased by 20 to25 per cent since the mid 1980s. In the course of a decade unemployment has been virtuallyhalved, from 12 to just over 6 per cent.Of course one cannot be certain that other countries’ solutions apply to Swedishconditions in every respect. But it is important to note that GDP growth in the Netherlands hasbeen fairly close to the EU average even though employment has developed very differently.So it is not higher demand in the past decade that lies behind the creation of somany new jobs in the Netherlands. Most of the evidence suggests that traditional demandmanagement is not capable of lowering unemployment appreciably. Instead it is the workings ofthe labour market and wage formation that are key factors for the possibility of turning the pathof unemployment. That is where the efforts must be made.Such efforts might make it possible to combine low inflation with a betterdevelopment of employment. They could then contribute to increased confidence in economicpolicy as a whole. At times there seems to be a tendency for the problem of unemployment togenerate some uncertainty about economic policy’s long-term commitment. Reforms in thefields of wage formation and the labour market can mitigate the potential conflicts betweeneconomic policy’s goals. That would improve the conditions for a continued fall in the level ofinterest rates relative to the rest of the world, even in a situation where Sweden stays outside theeuro area for the time being.BIS Review  68/1997
- 7 -4. SummaryToday, future prospects for the Swedish economy are bright in many respects.The consolidation of the government budget, accompanied by growing confidence in andsupport for the low inflation policy, has paved the way for a marked reduction of interest rates.This favours domestic demand. Together with a continuation of strong exports and favourableproductivity, this points to good conditions for growth in the coming years, with persistently lowinflation.At the same time it is a major problem that growth does not seem to be generatingnew jobs to a sufficient extent. This suggests that to a high degree the unemployment isstructural. Measures must therefore be taken to improve the functioning of the labour market.For further favourable economic development it is also essential that the efforts to reducegovernment debt are continued. The conditions for monetary policy in the years ahead will thenbe improved and greater freedom of action will be created for economic policy in the longerterm.BIS Review   68/1997
Mr. Lamfalussy reflects on the possibilities and constraints of monetarypolicy against the background of price stability in Europe   Address by the President of theEuropean Monetary Institute, Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, on the occasion of the change of thepresidency of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt am Main on 30/6/97.The moment has come for me to say a heartfelt “thank you” to you all!I should like to express my gratitude, first of all, to the governors of the centralbanks of the European Union, who, in the autumn of 1993, chose me as their candidate for thepresidency of the European Monetary Institute, thereby setting in train a process which hasallowed me to play a part in a ground-breaking enterprise of exceptional scope andresponsibility. I should like to thank them, secondly, in their capacity as members of the EMICouncil, for their cooperation in this undertaking and for their wisdom, prudence, willingness tocompromise but also their will to achieve results. They have invariably acted with the utmostprofessionalism. I should like to add that we should not have been able to achieve what has beendone without the conviction - which each of us shares - that the first duty of a central bank is tomaintain price stability. This fundamental principle has never been a matter of dispute.My thanks go next to the political authorities. First, to the Heads of State or ofGovernment, who did me the honour of putting their faith in me in appointing me President ofthe EMI. Second, to the Finance Ministers, who resigned themselves gracefully to the existenceof an institution which would be independent of the executive and who played their part, withconsummate political skill, in establishing the good working atmosphere between the ECOFINand the EMI, in the mutual respect of our respective competencies. I hope that this will be anenduring legacy.Thanks go, too, to the European Commission, with which we have been able -after a little trial and error, and with both sides demonstrating good will and a certain ability tolisten - to draw up the rules of the game for the indispensable cooperation which is needed toenable the project of Economic and Monetary Union to go ahead.The European Parliament - and several national parliaments - have given me theopportunity to report on the work of the EMI, in an atmosphere of constructive dialogue. Theirquestions and concerns, as well as those of the media and of the large number of associationsfrom both the banking and financial sphere as well as society at large, have given me valuableinsights into the expectations and concerns of our fellow citizens.These thanks would not be complete without expressing publicly what I havealready had the opportunity to say in private to the members of the management and staff of theEuropean Monetary Institute: without their personal commitment, their spirit of innovation, theirboundless ability to find the happy medium - and not just a practical compromise between theconcerns of our central banks - nothing would have been accomplished.What can I say to you know by way of farewell? There is little point in givingyou the “final score” at this stage - the match is not over yet ... Recommendations on how tocope with the challenges which are looming on the horizon? You will deal with them effectively,I am convinced, without my advice. But perhaps you will accept some reflections on the ability -and the limits - of monetary policy to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens who, whileappreciating the confirmation (or renewal) of price stability, are looking for stronger growthand, above all, more jobs. I share their concern unreservedly. The current level ofunemployment in the majority of our countries is ethically unacceptable; it is leading to theBIS Review   67/1997
- 2 -erosion of the social fabric and, because of the waste it represents, it is a clear signal that theeconomy is not functioning properly. Reducing unemployment must be the prime objective ofaction by the authorities. But what should be the role of monetary policy? In view of the shorttime available to me - plus the fact that you cannot contradict me - I shall be brief. You mayperhaps feel that I am being dogmatic: if so, please bear with me. I should like to make fourobservations.1.  There is not doubt whatsoever that monetary policy can bring inflation undercontrol. When monetary policy is not flanked by the appropriate budgetary policy, and whenlabour markets - but also goods and services markets - are not flexible, bringing inflation undercontrol will take time. It will take time, and it can also entail costs - which could otherwise havebeen avoided. But even so, these costs would still be less than the (very high long-term) cost ofnot dealing with inflation. Let us not forget that while the rich and the powerful can protectthemselves from any loss of purchasing power of their money - and in many cases can evenbenefit from such a loss - the weak and the not-so-rich will always be the losers. Inflation hasalways been a major source of social iniquity. In addition, it prevents the economy fromfunctioning properly, by falsifying the signals which are given by prices. The speculative boomin the real estate markets in some of our countries at the end of the 1980s caused serious damage- and we are still paying the price.2.  Once inflation has been brought under control, and once this control has beenconfirmed, monetary policy can guide short-term interest rates to a level which contributes tobalanced growth. Quite a number of EU countries are in such a situation already, with short-terminterest rates at around 3%. In others, where inflation has been brought under control morerecently, rates have not yet reached this level but are approaching it gradually. The confirmationthat inflation has been brought under control does, unfortunately, take time. Finally, in onemajor country which has seen rapid growth for several years now and in which unemploymenthas fallen remarkably, short-term interest rates have been raised - applying the principle ofpreventive medicine.3.  Now, what can we say about long-term interest rates, which also have animportant role to play in stimulating growth - perhaps an even more important one thanshort-term rates?Monetary policy does have an influence on the level of these rates, but itsinfluence is not exclusive and we cannot even predict the direction of its influence withcertainty. At this particular point in time, in the first group of countries to which I referred amoment ago, nominal long-term interest rates are at a historically low level - they are well below6% - but real long-term interest rates can be regarded, perhaps, as still being too high to putcontinental Europe on the road to more vigorous growth.I am doubtful whether a further easing of monetary policy in this group ofcountries would be able to help move the yield curve in the desired direction. It could actuallyhave the opposite effect - if investors perceived it as heralding a weak euro. In any event, giventhe current level of short-term interest rates, monetary policy’s margin for manoeuvre isextremely limited.It is possible that the level of real long-term interest rates in Europe reflects,partially at least, that of real interest rates worldwide. Europe has no influence over that effect.BIS Review   67/1997
- 3 -Europe can, however, have an influence on the effect which comes from theconstant increase in public sector indebtedness in our countries. As a reminder, between the endof 1991 and the end of 1996 the general government debt rose from around 56 to above 73% ofGDP for the European Union as a whole. This development, together with the worry that itmight not yet have run its course, are not likely - to say the least - to lead to a fall in real interestrates. Nor do they create the climate of confidence necessary for consumers and investors tomodify their current prudent behaviour. On the other hand, the certainty that governments aretackling the underlying causes of the public deficits which are responsible for the constantincrease in the debt burden could well bring about such a change in behaviour. “Faceless”markets are not the only ones looking beyond the immediate present to the future - our fellowcitizens are, too. The prospect of self-perpetuating, ever-increasing deficits will not encouragethem to spend more.4.  Stronger growth would certainly have a beneficial effect on employment. Butit would not eliminate the largest component of unemployment - the structural component. Thiscan be done by means of measures which remedy labour market rigidities and reduce the burdenof non-wage labour costs. It is this latter channel that links efforts to create jobs with the task ofbringing public expenditure under control. I observe, too, that in those countries whereunemployment has fallen substantially, jobs have been created not by existing enterprises - andespecially not by large enterprises - but by the setting-up of a large number of new enterprises,which have necessarily been small to begin with.To conclude - allow me, if you will, to be quite blunt. Yes, once inflation hasbeen brought properly under control, monetary policy can and must contribute to supportingbalanced growth, but balanced growth will not depend on monetary policy alone. Both theacceleration and the viability of growth will rely on the contribution to be made by otherpolicies. First, on that of a fiscal policy which does not crowd out private investment but, rather,fosters a climate of confidence by implementing a credible process of reforms. Second, on thatof a policy which creates a favourable fiscal, financial and regulatory environment for theproliferation of new enterprises. And, so that the growth fostered in this way can create manyjobs, structural policies will have to assume the principal role, while the role of monetary policywill then dwindle and fade away - alas - to nothing.BIS Review   67/1997
Mr. Thiessen’s remarks to the Canadian Club of Toronto   Notes for remarksby the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Gordon Thiessen, to the Canadian Club of Torontoin Toronto, on 1/12/97.What can monetary policy do to help the economy reach its full potential?Today, we meet against a backdrop of some uncertainty in the internationaleconomy. I would like to begin my remarks with an assessment of what the recent financial andeconomic events in Asia could mean for Canada.The nervousness and uncertainty that spread around the world in the wake of theproblems in Southeast Asia highlight the growing interactions among national economies andfinancial markets. The events in Asia also underscore how crucial prudent macroeconomicpolicies and sound financial sector management are to good economic performance.The measures that have been taken, mainly through the International MonetaryFund, are important first steps for the affected Asian economies in dealing with their problems. Ibelieve that these measures have helped to contain at least some of the potential spillover effectsto other countries and, thus, they are helping to settle global financial markets.Canada’s direct trade links with Southeast Asia are not large. However, thosewith Japan and Korea are more important to us, and there are also potential effects on our othertrading partners that need to be taken into account. The problems in Asia and their possibleimplications for the world economy are probably the source of some of the recent softening inworld commodity prices. Because of the importance of commodities to Canada, this softeninghas been a factor behind the recent weakness in our currency.Our judgment at this stage is that the overall impact of these recent developmentson Canada does not look likely to be large. However, we are sensitive to the fact that someindustries and regions will be affected more than others. I can assure you that we will continueto monitor the situation very closely, in view of the uncertainty that remains about the likelyoutcome of events in Asia.Even with this uncertainty, however, recent suggestions that there is a risk ofworldwide deflation strike me as being very pessimistic. Developments in Asia will slowsomewhat the pace of global economic expansion. But as long as the world’s largest economy,the United States, is pressing against its capacity limits, with the possibility of upward pressureon its inflation rate, the risk of worldwide deflation looks rather remote. Certainly, fromCanada’s perspective, the U.S. economy is by far the most important influence.I would now like to turn from these recent events and talk about the Bank ofCanada’s longer-term strategy for monetary policy.In any discussion of strategy, the place to start is with the objective. In conductingmonetary policy, the Bank of Canada’s ultimate objective is to help the Canadian economyachieve its full potential. And that means more jobs and rising standards of living. I am sure thatall Canadians would agree that this is an appropriate objective.BIS Review   113/1997
- 2 -The Bank pursues this objective through a policy aimed at keeping inflation lowand stable. Today, I would like to explain why such a policy is the best way to achieve Canada’sfull economic potential and to extend the current expansion. In this connection, I will review therecent U.S. experience in this area -- an experience that I find both relevant and instructive.On the road to full economic potentialThe performance of the Canadian economy over the past 25 years has been ratherdisappointing. The economy has suffered from recurring bouts of boom and bust, andunemployment has been very high. The growth of productivity and, thus, the improvement inour standard of living have been very gradual.Canada is not unique in this respect. Most industrial countries have shared thisexperience to varying degrees. And that includes the United States. Since the early 1990s,however, the U.S. economy has performed remarkably well and substantially better than otherindustrial economies. That country has enjoyed a solid, six-and-a-half-year-long economicexpansion. Over that period, employment growth has averaged 2 per cent per year. Theunemployment rate has declined from a peak of 8 per cent to under 5 per cent. Householdincomes have risen by 2½ per cent a year (after correction for inflation). U.S. businesses havebecome highly competitive, even in areas where prospects did not look all that good at the endof the 1980s. What’s more, inflation has been on a declining path, albeit with some help fromtemporary factors (such as an appreciating U.S. dollar, declines in energy prices, and the slack inoverseas economies).Why has the U.S. economy done so well? Are there any lessons here for Canada?Lessons from the U.S. experienceThere are, undoubtedly, a number of factors behind this striking U.S.performance. But, to me, there are at least two that seem to have been particularly important: theearly adjustment of that economy to changing technology and globalization; and the credible,low-inflation policy pursued by the U.S. central bank.The Americans started adjusting in earnest in the 1980s to the new realities ofheightened global competition and rapidly changing technology. As a result, they are ahead ofmost other industrial countries on that score. And, with improving productivity and highlycompetitive enterprises in a wide range of sectors, the U.S. economy has been able to expandrapidly and to support rising employment on a sustained basis.But taking full advantage of that improved potential for economic growth hasrequired a climate of confidence in monetary policy. Bringing inflation down in a crediblemanner has helped to create that climate. And because of this, the U.S. monetary authoritieshave been in a position to encourage the economy to test its full capacity to produce, to createjobs, and to support rising incomes. This would not have been possible in an environment ofhigh inflation and high inflation expectations. In such an environment, businesses, workers, andinvestors respond swiftly to any signs of demand pressures by pushing up prices, wages, andinterest rates. And this has the effect of undermining the sustainability of the economicexpansion.BIS Review   113/1997
- 3 -What precisely did the U.S. Federal Reserve do? In the early 1990s, problems inthe banking sector were restraining the economic recovery in that country by limiting access tofinancing and undermining confidence. To counter these “headwinds”, as Alan Greenspan calledthem, the Fed responded by providing a high degree of monetary stimulus. Then, in early 1994,when it became evident that the economy had started to pick up steam and move ahead on itsown, the Fed began withdrawing the excess monetary stimulus.This timely, pre-emptive action to moderate monetary stimulus accomplished twothings. First, it sent a strong reassuring signal to investors, businesses, and consumers that theFed would not let inflation break out as the economy surged ahead. Indeed, after short-term rateswent up in 1994-95, long-term rates declined, as investors became more confident that theeconomic expansion would remain non-inflationary and, thus, sustainable. Second, thepre-emptive action helped avoid the need for stronger, more disruptive, tightening later on.The less-accommodative monetary conditions that have prevailed since thencertainly have not stopped the U.S. economic expansion dead in its tracks, as some had feared atthe time. On the contrary, the expansion has continued at a healthy pace. And with widespreadbelief in the Fed’s commitment to low inflation, there has been some room to explore thepossibility that capacity has improved. As a result, the Fed has been able to set monetaryconditions that have encouraged output and employment to expand at rates that in the past couldnot have been sustained. And both unemployment and inflation have come down at the sametime.To be sure, with tightening labour markets, there is some risk of an increase ininflation pressures in the United States. Thus, one cannot rule out the possibility that the Fedmay have to raise interest rates somewhat further at some point. But any future increases ininterest rates should not have to be large and may be conditioned by the implications of therecent international developments I mentioned earlier.What parallels can we find in all this for Canada?The recent Canadian experienceThe adjustment in Canada to the forces of technological change and globalizationhas run behind that in the United States. Because the restructuring was delayed, Canada had torespond in a more dramatic fashion. We had to do more and do it faster. More importantly, ourfiscal situation was more precarious and required stronger medicine. As a result, we ended upwith more pronounced short-run disruptions and more catching up to do in terms of output andemployment.These difficult but necessary adjustments in the private and public sectors of oureconomy were Canada’s parallel to the U.S. headwinds.To compensate for the direct impact of these adjustments, as well as for theirindirect effects on consumer confidence, the economy needed a substantial amount of monetarysupport. The Bank of Canada was able to provide such support once investor concerns aboutCanada’s fiscal and political problems began to subside in late 1995. We did that bysystematically reducing interest rates over the next year or so. As in the United States in1991-92, short-term rates in Canada were brought down during 1995-96 from over 6 per cent toabout 3 per cent -- their lowest level in over 30 years. At the same time, the Canadian dollar hasBIS Review   113/1997
- 4 -been relatively low, providing support to the export sector. When we put interest rates and theexchange rate together -- as we must in order to correctly gauge the amount of monetarystimulus -- it is clear that monetary conditions in Canada have been exceptionally stimulative forwell over a year.This was entirely appropriate while our economy was still struggling against theheadwinds of private and public sector restructuring. To return to my automobile analogy ofrecent speeches, we needed to put the “pedal to the metal” to buck those headwinds and get theeconomy going.The monetary stimulus has done its job. The economy has been gathering speedand absorbing unused capacity. We now expect it to have expanded by about 4 per cent from theend of 1996 to the end of 1997. The diminishing effects of fiscal restraint, along with evidenceof continued strong demand, output, and money growth, suggest another year of healthyexpansion in 1998.Thus, in terms of the economic cycle, we are about where the Americans were in1994.What should the role of monetary policy be in the period ahead?As we move towards full capacity over the next year or so, the task for monetarypolicy will be to try to ensure that this process goes smoothly and that inflationary pressures donot re-emerge.I want to make it clear that the Bank does not see an overheated economy at thispoint, nor a threat of inflation lurking around the corner. There is still unused capacity and, thus,room for strong expansion for some time yet. But, with monetary policy actions taking betweenone to two years to have their full effects on the economy, we always have to look ahead. Andwe have to ask, What sort of monetary support will the economy need at that point? Themeasures -- especially the fiscal measures -- needed to restructure our economy will be largely inplace by then. Thus, monetary policy will no longer need to compensate for these sources ofrestraint on demand. By gradually easing off on the monetary gas pedal, we can steady oureconomy at a safe cruising speed down the road.As we look still further down the road, we will face other important issues. Howwell will our economy perform once it reaches full capacity? How rapid can growth be and stillbe sustainable? And how far can we reduce our unemployment rate?Given the complexity of the factors affecting economic performance, it is notpossible to make precise predictions on these matters. Much will depend on the flexibility,efficiency, and productivity of Canadian enterprises; on how effectively new technology is used;on the skills, training, and adaptability of our labour force; on our ability to control costs; and onthe initiative and ability of Canadian businesses to develop new products and new and expandedforeign markets for those products.Still, I believe that the restructuring that has taken place in the Canadian economyprovides good reason to think that our potential to grow and create jobs is the best we have hadin years. I also believe that continued credible fiscal and monetary policies have an importantrole to play.BIS Review   113/1997
- 5 -The best contribution monetary policy can make towards achieving that potentialis to ensure that the economic expansion remains sustainable over the medium term.As we have learned over the past 25 years, a sustained expansion is not possibleunless we can avoid a resurgence of inflation and the painful cycles of boom and bust that gowith it. Thus, the challenge for monetary policy will be to set monetary conditions at levels thatallow the economy to expand at a pace that makes full use of its production capacity and at thesame time preserves low inflation.It is by conducting monetary policy prudently during the upswing that the Bankcan assure Canadians that inflation will not break out when the economy begins to operate atlevels that push against capacity limits. If we succeed in providing that confidence, we will thenhave the flexibility that will allow us to carefully explore the limits of growth and employmentwithout immediately putting the economic expansion at risk.Concluding remarksLet me summarize my main messages to you today.The extraordinary monetary stimulus of the recent past has accomplished its task.It has supported the economy through a period of difficult but necessary restructuring. As theimpact of this restructuring subsides and our economy enters a phase of self-sustainingexpansion, we will no longer need the same amount of monetary stimulus.Because the economy takes time to respond to monetary policy actions, the Bankhas to focus on the future. This means taking steps early to ensure that we will reach fullcapacity at a sustainable cruising speed.Of course, projections of future economic trends need constant reassessment. Andthat is particularly true at a time of nervous financial markets and uncertainty about theimplications that events in Asia may have for the world economy. As I said earlier, the Bankcontinues to monitor the current global situation carefully.Aside from any complications that could arise from a prolonged period ofinternational instability, the Canadian economy in the next year or so should absorb the unusedcapacity that we now see. At that point, we will begin to see concrete evidence of the kind ofpayoffs we are going to get from the economic restructuring process we have been through.With low inflation and a sound fiscal position, the Canadian economy is now in abetter position than it has been for years to weather the impact of unexpected internationaldevelopments and to make progress in generating higher incomes and employment.BIS Review   113/1997
Bank of Japan presents summaries of articles published in the Novemberedition of its Quarterly Bulletin   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 28/11/97.Flow of Funds in Japan, 1996SummaryIn 1996, the gross amounts of fund-raising and financial investment by thedomestic nonfinancial sector (comprising the corporate business, personal, and public sectors)during the year both decreased from the previous year, remaining at low levels compared withthe past. The sector’s fund-raising through borrowing declined, while funds raised throughgovernment bond issues reached a record high. As for financial investment, there was a largernet redemption of securities (excluding investment trusts) than in 1995, and the net investmentin insurance products narrowed significantly.In the corporate business sector, the financial surplus marked a record high. Thiswas because (1) cash flow improved in excess of the continued growth in fixed investment, duemainly to a recovery in sales; and (2) interest payments decreased, reflecting low interest rates.The sector’s fund-raising was at its lowest level since 1956 -- the third year of compilation of theflow of funds accounts -- primarily on account of a net decline in loans, which was moresignificant than the previous year, particularly in those from private financial institutions. At thesame time, financial investment also declined from the previous year. Such overall sluggishnessof fund-raising and financial investment activities can be attributed to the persistingbalance-sheet adjustment pressure.In the personal sector, the financial surplus narrowed, the ratio of financialsurplus to nominal GDP marking a record low. This was because (1) consumption expendituresincreased by a larger margin than the improvement in employees’ income; and (2) housinginvestment increased due to the effects of low interest rates and a surge in demand ahead of therise in the consumption tax rate in fiscal 1997. Both fund-raising and financial investment fellbelow the previous year’s levels, with conspicuous declines in investments in long-term assetssuch as insurance, securities, and trusts. The outstanding amount of financial assets in thepersonal sector reached ¥1,200 trillion for the first time at the end of 1996.In the public sector, a large financial deficit remained, due to expandedpublic-sector investment during the first half of the year. Fund-raising through government bondissues, almost all of which were purchased by the financial sector, marked a record high.Profits and Balance-Sheet Developments of Japanese Banks in Fiscal 1996OverviewOperating profits1 of Japanese banks2 in fiscal 1996 amounted to ¥6.4 trillion,5 percent lower than in the previous year. This decline reflects a decrease in the net bond-related                                                  1  “Operating profits” signifies earnings from core banking operations, arrived at by subtracting “general loan-loss provisions,” “ general andadministrative expenses” and “expenses for debenture issuance” from the total of “net interest income” (e.g., interest received/paid) for loans andBIS Review   113/1997
- 2 -profits and in the net interest income of city banks. Excluding a temporary factor3 whichcontributed to an increase in profits on trust accounts, the decline in operating profits from theprevious year was about 10 percent.Loan write-offs and loan-loss provisions4 marked approximately ¥7.6 trillion(including trust accounts), which is the second highest level following fiscal 1995 when thejusen (housing loan companies) were liquidated. This suggests that most banks continued to givehigh priority to solving the problem of nonperforming loans.Net stock-related profits5 were no more than about ¥1.0 trillion, approximately¥2.9 trillion lower than the fiscal 1995 level, due to substantial stock write-downs resulting fromthe fall in stock prices. This reflects the fact that banks’ balance sheets have become moreexposed to volatility in stock prices because of a rise in the book values of stocks which resultedfrom recent cross transactions -- sets of purchases and sales transactions on the same stocks inorder to acquire unrealized capital gain. As the loan write-offs and loan-loss provisions virtuallymatched the total of operating profits and stock-related profits, recurring profits and net incomereached close to zero levels, although this represented an improvement from the previous year.On the Relationship between Monetary Aggregates and Economic Activities in Japan: A StudyFocusing on Long-Term Equilibrium RelationshipsIntroductionThis paper empirically analyzes the relationship between monetary aggregates andeconomic activities in Japan using actual data and focusing on long-term equilibriumrelationships. Long-term time-series data from the 1960s to 1996 are used in the analysis inorder to observe long-term relationships between the most commonly used monetary aggregate,M2+CDs, and macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, rather than limiting the analysis toshort-term relationships during the past year or two.1  In addition to long-term relationships, the                                                                                                                                                                   discounts, deposits and securities), “net fee and commission income” (e.g., fees and commissions received/paid) and “net other operatingincome” (e.g., net profits related to bonds and foreign exchange).2  “Japanese banks” or “banks” in this article refers to “All Banks,” comprising the member banks of the Federation of Bankers Associations ofJapan, which consists of city banks, long-term credit banks, seven trust banks (excluding foreign-owned trust banks and trust banks that startedbusiness after October 1993), the 64 member banks of the Regional Banks Association of Japan (hereafter referred to as regional banks), and the65 member banks of the Second Association of Regional Banks (hereafter referred to as regional banks II). However, calculated figures excludedata for Hyogo Bank (the present Midori Bank), Taiheiyo Bank (the present Wakashio Bank), and Hanwa Bank.3  Specifically, the temporary factor here refers to profits resulting from withdrawals from special reserve funds held by trust banks. Thewithdrawal profit resulted from a revision of a government ordinance that reduced the ratio of funds to set aside for the special reserve funds(from 3 percent of principal to 0.5 percent of principal). These are accumulated to provide for situations in which the value of a loan trust fallsbelow the value of the principal. The trust banks applied part of the profit to write off nonperforming loans in trusts, and the remainder to beaccounted as trust fees and be registered in the banking accounts as net fee and commission income.4  This includes not only loan write-offs, but also transfers to special loan-loss accounts (provisions), losses from the sales of nonperformingloans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), and renunciations of claims.5  Stock-related profits/losses are calculated by subtracting from “gains on stock-selling operations” the sum of “losses from stock-sellingoperations” and “stock write-downs”.1  Note that the sample period includes the period when M2+CDs underwent large fluctuations, i.e. from the latter half of the 1980s to the early1990s.BIS Review   113/1997
- 3 -stability of the money demand function and also the lead/lag relationships between monetaryaggregates and other macroeconomic indicators are tested.The conclusions of the paper can be summarized as follows.(1) When developments in M2+CDs and other macroeconomic indicators areviewed in the long term, fluctuations in nominal M2+CDs have a relatively stable relationshipwith movements in nominal GDP. This can also be confirmed by applying an econometrictechnique called “cointegration analysis”, which suggests that there is a long-term equilibriumrelationship between the two. On the other hand, the relationship between M2+CDs andprices -- which along with real GDP make up nominal GDP -- has changed since the latter halfof the 1980s, in the sense that fluctuations in prices have clearly diminished relative to those ofM2+CDs.(2) A relatively stable money demand function can be estimated, based on theabove long-term equilibrium relationship and incorporating factors for short-term fluctuations.At least in the sample period, the mechanism of short-term fluctuations has been relatively stablein M2+CDs, GDP, interest rates, and asset factors, as represented by the money demandfunction.(3) An analysis in terms of lagged cross correlation on the lead/lag relationshipsbetween M2+CDs and other macroeconomic variables reveals that M2+CDs basically leadsnominal and real GDP, domestic private demand, and prices. However, there are differences inresults across sample periods that cannot be ignored.(4) Similar analyses are conducted, from the standpoints of conclusions (1)-(3)above, on selected monetary and credit aggregates other than M2+CDs, and on monetaryaggregates obtained by partially changing the components of M1 and M2+CDs. The resultsshow that these aggregates did not have more stable relationships with macroeconomicindicators than did M2+CDs.(5) The above results suggest that, in analyzing monetary aggregates, it would beeffective to use the long-term equilibrium relationship between M2+CDs and GDP as well as themoney demand function incorporating the relationship. In interpreting the empirical results usingthe statistical techniques, however, it is necessary to bear in mind the following limitations:(a) Long-term equilibrium relationships indicate only the average relationship inthe long run, and hence considerable deviations from equilibrium values may arise in the shortterm; and(b) There still remains a possibility that the long-term equilibrium relationships ormoney demand functions derived from the previously observed data may change, as a result of alarge shift of funds caused by deregulation and other structural changes in the financial marketsin the future.Checklist for the Year 2000 ProblemIntroductionBIS Review   113/1997
- 4 -The Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Japan compiled the followingchecklist (the original is in Japanese) to assist bank examiners in assessing the adequacy offinancial institutions’ risk management framework for addressing the Year 2000 problem(hereinafter simply “the Problem”).1 On August 19, 1997, the checklist was also distributed tofinancial institutions to help them in their own evaluation of their action plans.The checklist emphasizes the significance of each financial institution’sunderstanding and awareness of the Problem, and calls for the commitment of each institution,including the top management, to its action plans. In proceeding with the action plans, eachinstitution is advised to fully assess the effects of the Problem, carefully arrange the schedulingof the plans, and complete renovation and testing prior to the implementation of the action plans.The checklist also stresses the importance of other matters including (1) the monitoring of theprogress as to the implementation of the action plans, (2) the scrutiny of legal responsibilities ofoutside vendors, and (3) the establishment of contingency plans.                                                  1  Many computer operating systems and applications use six-digit codes for dates -- date fields -- comprising two digits for the year, two digitsfor the month, and two digits for the day (for example, December 31, 1999 reads 991231). With such a coding system, the code for the year 2000will be “00,” which may be interpreted as the year 1900, not 2000. This will cause errors in date-sensitive calculations and other issues. Suchproblems are referred to as the Year 2000 problem. If measures are not taken to address the problem, normal operations of financial institutionswill be disrupted, which would lead to disturbances in payment and settlement systems nationwide, the effects of which may spread to otherindustries.*     *     *NB   This Review is available on the BIS Worldwide Web site (http://www.bis.org)__________________________BIS Review   113/1997
Mr. Hannoun discusses the operational framework for EMU and thechallenge of managing price stability   Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Banque deFrance, Mr. Hervé Hannoun, at the Financial Times European Economic and Monetary UnionConference in London on 20/11/97.I am delighted to take part in this discussion on the framework for the singlemonetary policy in Stage Three. I will address what I consider to be the two main categories ofissues in this context: those related to monetary policy strategy on the one hand, and thoserelated to the execution of monetary policy operations on the other hand; in other words,strategic and operational issues.1. STRATEGIC ISSUESWhat are the main strategic issues relating to the formulation of the singlemonetary policy? I will consider in turn:•the final objective,•the intermediate target,•the role of the exchange rate as an indicator, and•the starting level of interest rates in the euro area at the end of next year.1.1. Final objective: a quantified definition of price stabilityThe final objective of the single monetary policy is clearly stated in theMaastricht Treaty: according to article 105, “the primary objective of the ESCB shall be tomaintain price stability”. Only a monetary policy geared towards the objective of price stabilitycan create the conditions for durable and sustainable growth. To reach this objective, threeconditions need, in my view, to be fulfilled:•firstly, the monetary strategy should be set in a medium-term framework. More generally,the European policy mix should consist both of a medium-term stability-oriented monetarypolicy and of a medium-term fiscal policy aiming at a balanced budget (or “close to balance”as stated in the Stability Pact).1 This medium-term stability-oriented policy mix is the bestwe can do to create the conditions for durable growth in the euro area. And it is now widelyagreed in the European Union that the policy mix should not give the illusion that it can finetune the economy;                                                  1 By urging governments to aim for a fiscal position close to balance or in surplus in the medium term, theStability Pact enables them to let automatic fiscal stabilizers come into play during recessions without exceedingthe 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that canbe drawn on if an asymmetric shock occurs.BIS Review   112/1997
- 2 -•secondly, the strategy pursued should provide a clear anchor to inflation expectations.This implies the public announcement of a quantified definition of the final objective ofprice stability; for instance, the Banque de France aims at an inflation rate not exceeding 2%;•thirdly, the strategy should be based on a forward-looking approach. This is because thetransmission of monetary policy decisions to the economy takes place with relatively longlags. Estimates of these lags between interest rate changes and their effects on inflation varybetween one and two years. As a consequence, central banks have to look ahead before theytake monetary policy decisions. A case in point was the recent decision by severalcontinental central banks, including the Banque de France, to raise their main refinancingrates on 9th October. This move was justified by the need to pre-empt inflationary pressuresearly enough, although current inflation remained low. In my view it is very important tomake the public aware of the concept of the “pre-emptive strike”, which is at the heart ofcentral banking.1.2. Intermediate target: more arguments in favour of monetary targeting, with a caveatIn order to provide an anchor to inflation expectations and to look ahead, centralbanks make public an intermediate target which they commit themselves to respecting.Announcing an intermediate target also enhances the accountability of the central bank. This iswhy Article 12 of the Statute of the ECB explicitly refers to decisions relating to intermediatemonetary objectives as one of the main responsibilities of the Governing Council of the ECB.Two possible strategies have been selected by the EMI Council as potential candidates to berecommended to the ECB, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.2 In the caseof direct inflation targeting, the inflation forecast made by the central bank can be viewed asfulfilling the role of the intermediate target.3Let me dwell a moment on the choice the ECB will have to make between directinflation targeting and monetary targeting, unless it chooses to combine elements of bothstrategies. Inflation targeting stresses the responsibility of the ESCB for achieving andmaintaining price stability. However, there are some difficulties in the process of forecastinginflation over the medium and longer term. As Mervyn King recently stated, “such a forecastcannot be a single number. It must be presented for what it is, namely a probabilitydistribution”.4 Furthermore, inflation targeting could imply more formal cooperation with theGovernment since the latter is in a position to influence price developments. Finally, inflationtargeting has admittedly proven useful in progressing towards price stability, as the experienceof the United Kingdom has shown. Nevertheless, the track record of inflation targeting is fairlyshort and has mostly taken place in a context of world-wide disinflation.Monetary targeting (in concrete terms, targeting a broad money aggregate suchas M3) clearly indicates the responsibility of the central bank for developments that are moredirectly under its control and would therefore correspond better to the independence of the ECB.Moreover, it is based on observed information, which makes it more transparent. Finally,                                                  2 See the EMI report: “The single monetary policy in Stage Three - Elements of the monetary policy of theESCB”, February 1997.3 See, for instance, Lars E.O. Svensson, “Inflation forecast targeting : Implementing and monitoring inflationtargets”, European Economic Review 41 (1997), 1111-1146.4  Lecture given by Mervyn King at the London School of Economics on Wednesday 29 October 1997 to mark thetenth anniversary of the LSE Financial Markets Group.BIS Review   112/1997
- 3 -monetary targeting by the ESCB would be in continuity with the strategy implemented by theBundesbank since 1975 and by the Banque de France since 1976. However, this strategy hingeson the stability of money demand. Preliminary research has shown that EU-wide moneyequations often perform better than comparable national equations.5 Nonetheless, this mayprovide no safe guidance for the starting period of EMU in so far as the move to Stage Threeconstitutes a change of regime which might lead to breakdowns in empirical relationships.1.3. Indicators: an important role for the exchange rate and long term interest rate of the euroIt is likely that, while avoiding a “looking-at-everything” approach, the ESCBwill closely monitor, in addition to the intermediate objective, a broad set of other economic andfinancial indicators to help assess the risks to future price stability. In this set of indicators,emphasis will probably have to be laid on the exchange rate and the long-term interest rate ofthe euro, for at least three reasons.Firstly, the euro exchange rate and long-term interest rate will play an importantrole in shaping monetary conditions within the euro area, together with the level of short-terminterest rates that will be steered by the ESCB. Secondly, although the degree of openness of theeuro area will be much lower than is currently the case for any EU Member State, with “foreign”trade representing roughly 9% of GDP for the EU as a whole, the area will remain totally opento foreign capital flows. In that regard, I would like to stress that current holdings of French andGerman securities by non-residents, including cross-holdings, amount to 1,200 billion dollars.This highlights the importance of keeping a high level of confidence in the euro. Thirdly, inspite of the fact that the ESCB will inherit credibility from the participating national centralbanks, the ECB will have no track record of its own in targeting money or inflation. It will thushave to build up its reputation and pay due attention to those indicators that reflect most directlythe level of confidence placed by investors in the euro.Of course, as underlined above, the external value of the euro will not have thestatus of an intermediate objective and the ECB’s strategy will not be based on exchange ratetargeting.6 However, any depreciating trend of the euro would feed domestic inflation through arise in import prices and, by undermining investors’ confidence, would contribute to the buildingof risk premia into the euro yield curve. This would have negative consequences for investment,competitiveness, growth and employment in the euro area. So there cannot be any “benignneglect” with respect to the exchange rate. A stable and strong currency contributes to loweringlong-term interest rates, which play a crucial role in the financing of the economies incontinental Europe.All these reasons point to the need for a strong and stable euro, a currency thatwill be as credible as the franc, the guilder or the Deutsche Mark. The euro must be, and will be,rock solid. Therefore the exchange rate of the euro, even if not targeted as such, willundoubtedly play an important role as an indicator in the conduct of the single monetary policy.                                                  5See, for instance, “Money Demand in EU Countries: A Survey”, by F.X. Browne, G. Fagan and J. Henry, EMIStaff Paper n° 7, March 1997.6This is different from the current stance in France, where the stability of the exchange rate vis-à-vis the mostcredible currencies within the ERM is one of the two intermediate targets of monetary policy.BIS Review   112/1997
- 4 -1.4. The starting level of key interest rates in the euro areaLet me say a few words on another strategic question: what will be the startinglevel of key interest rates in the euro area thirteen months from now?Futures contracts on short-term interest rates reflect the market’s expectations onthis issue. But of course don’t expect a central banker to answer this question, one year inadvance. I will just mention the Banque de France view on the rationale that should be behindthe determination of the starting level of the euro area short-term rates.As you know, we currently observe interest rate differentials between the “core”and more “peripheral” currencies participating in the exchange rate mechanism. Although thesespreads have been dramatically reduced in the past two years, due to the remarkableconvergence of inflation rates throughout the European Union, some interest rate differentialsstill exist. They can be attributed partly to differing positions in the business cycle, and partly todifferences in credibility.Cyclical differences within the potential euro area should not be overestimated.There is, all in all, a relatively high degree of synchronisation in the business cycle in continentalEurope. The convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty certainly played animportant role in fostering this synchronisation. Moreover, in the future, differences in cyclicaldevelopments will gradually be reduced as policies, structures and behaviour will become moreand more similar. Lastly, some persisting differences may well be tolerated as is currently thecase between the various regions of the same country or, for instance, between the variousmember states of the USA.Credibility differences between “core” and “peripheral” currencies result fromthe different lengths of the track records in terms of stability-oriented policies. It is not the sameto have reached an inflation goal of less than 2% for one year as for ten years. One of thebenefits that the “peripheral countries” could reap from participating in the first wave ofmonetary union is to achieve the level of interest rate of the most credible currencies withouthaving yet built up a very long track record.I would like to underline that in Europe, we are not converging towards a kind ofaverage of the market interest rates of the potential euro area. One has to understand that thephilosophy of EMU is to organize the convergence of the European countries towards the bestpossible level of monetary credibility and therefore towards the benchmarks in terms of interestrates. As Mr. Trichet recently stated, “convergence is a benchmarking concept”, not anaveraging process. Convergence does not mean that the “core” currencies’ interest rates shouldgo up towards irrelevant “average levels”, but that the interest rates of more “peripheral”countries should progressively converge towards the benchmark level.This benchmark level is currently given by the intervention rates of theBundesbank and of the Banque de France, both at 3.3%. But of course the benchmark level oneyear from now could be different from 3.3%.2. OPERATIONAL ISSUESHow will the ESCB operate? As you know, central banks implement their policiesthrough the creation and destruction of central bank reserves, of which they are monopolyBIS Review   112/1997
- 5 -suppliers. This is done in the framework of domestic credit operations as well as foreignexchange interventions. Credit operations are conducted at maturities that extend overnight orbeyond, to implement monetary policy, or on an intraday basis, to provide liquidity to paymentsystems. Therefore, I will consider in turn monetary policy operations, intraday credit operationsand foreign exchange operations. I will focus on the following issues:As regards monetary policy operations, how will a single money market rate beattained and what will be the degree of interest rate volatility that the ESCB will be willing toaccept? As regards intraday operations, how to cope with the risk of spillover from intradaycredit into overnight credit? As regards domestic credit operations as well as foreign exchangeoperations, how will the principle of operational decentralisation be applied within the ESCB?2.1. Monetary policy operations: a short-term money market rate as operational targetTo implement the single monetary policy, the ESCB will pursue an operationaltarget that will normally be a short-term money-market interest rate. Two issues deserve closeattention in that regard: the singleness of the money market on the one hand, and the volatility ofthe interest rate that will be targeted on the other hand.2.1.1. Single money market rateThe single monetary policy will be characterised by the singleness of interest ratelevels in the interbank market: from the 1st January 1999 on, a single money-market interest ratewill apply throughout the euro area for a given maturity. The issue is, thus, how to attain thissingle interest rate level. Two requirements will have to be met for that purpose. The firstrequirement is that, in the context of a single monetary policy that will be implemented in adecentralised manner, there should be a very high degree of harmonisation of instruments andprocedures. The EMI and central banks are working relentlessly to this aim. The secondrequirement lies in the integration of interbank markets and payment systems.As far as interbank markets are concerned, two factors should play a key role:•the first factor relates to the various rules market operators have to abide by. These rulesapply to counterparts, market makers, brokers, rating agencies and market enterprises such asclearing houses. They take the form of codes of conduct, regulations, master agreements andmarket standards. An appropriate degree of harmonisation of these market rules should bereached under the aegis of central banks and prudential authorities;•the second factor, the use of a single range of reference interest rates would guarantee thetransparency of the euro money market. In this respect, short-term maturities are of specialinterest to central banks. This justifies that they intervene to some extent in the process ofelaborating these indicators. As a matter of fact, the EMI has recently agreed that the ESCBshould sponsor the computation of an overnight reference rate for the euro area.As regards payment systems, the TARGET system will also contribute to therapid emergence of a unified money market throughout the euro area. TARGET will connect thedomestic real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems operated by the national central banks. Itwill enable participants to make totally safe cross-border settlements in euro, in real time and ata low cost, thereby facilitating interest rate arbitrage. All large-value payments related toBIS Review   112/1997
- 6 -monetary policy operations will have to process through TARGET. A common closing time fordomestic RTGS and the harmonisation of conditions under which intraday liquidity will beprovided by national central banks within the euro area should also help prevent any risk ofsegmentation of the single money market.2.1.2. Interest rate volatilityThe EMI has described in various publications the set of monetary policyinstruments that will be made available to the ESCB.7 This set will comprise open marketoperations, standing facilities and minimum reserves. It should fulfil two basic functions:firstly, to enable the ESCB to control efficiently its operational target; secondly, to signal theESCB monetary policy stance. It should also be consistent with the requirement laid down in theMaastricht Treaty that the ESCB should act in accordance with the principle of an open marketeconomy with free competition, favouring the efficient allocation of resources.In practice, the concrete design and use of monetary policy instruments willdepend crucially on the degree of volatility of the short-term rate chosen as the operationaltarget that the ESCB will be willing to accept. This volatility will in turn depend on severalfactors:•the width of the corridor defined by the two standing facilities available to absorb orprovide liquidity (the deposit facility for the floor and the marginal lending facility for theceiling). Under normal circumstances, the two facilities will bound the overnight interestrate. They will operate at the overnight maturity and will be accessible at the discretion ofcounterparties and for unlimited amounts, provided, in the case of the marginal lendingfacility, counterparties can supply adequate collateral. A very narrow corridor, allowing verylittle room for the functioning of the money market, would not be strictly in line with marketprinciples. On the other hand, a very broad corridor would not help contain excessive marketvolatility. As a consequence, the width of the corridor is likely to be set pragmatically(currently, it is around 2% for most central banks that operate an interest rate corridor similarto the one planned for the ESCB);•the frequency of fine tuning operations could be a more discriminating factor for interestrate volatility. Very frequent intervention of the ESCB in the money market would not, inmy view, be fully consistent with market principles. Moreover, excessive intervention mightcomplicate the extraction of information from movements in market interest rates, especiallyat the maturity at which the ESCB would intervene. Intensive recourse to fine-tuningoperations might also deprive regular refinancing operations and standing facilities of theirsignalling effect and be conducive to a centralisation of monetary policy operations;•provided they are set at a sufficient level, and include an averaging provision, reserverequirements constitute an efficient buffer against liquidity shocks ; this would helpstabilize short-term interest rates over the maintenance period. In turn, setting a fairly highlevel of minimum reserves might require remunerating them in order not to inducesignificant delocation or disintermediation;                                                  7 See the two EMI reports “The single monetary policy in Stage Three – Specification of the operationalframework”, January 1997, and “The single monetary policy in Stage Three – General documentation on ESCBmonetary policy instruments and procedures”, September 1997.BIS Review   112/1997
- 7 -••enhancing the signalling effect of the main refinancing operations should also contributeto lowering interest rate volatility. This may best be achieved through the normal conduct offixed-rate tenders, which send clear signals to the market, rather than variable-rate tenders.The latter may nevertheless be useful in certain circumstances where the ESCB wishes togauge market sentiment;•finally, the communication policy of the ESCB could also play a role in smoothing interestrate volatility. The ESCB will have to publish weekly a consolidated balance sheet. It willalso publish the results of its tender operations. It could equally wish to release dailyaggregate data on the reserve holdings, if averaged reserve requirements are in place, and onthe use of the two standing facilities, as measured in both cases at the end of the previousday.2.2. Intraday operations: the spillover from intraday credit into overnight credit as a borderlinecaseTo ensure the smooth functioning of the TARGET system, the national centralbanks will provide intraday liquidity to participants in the real-time gross settlement systems.This will be done in the form of fully collateralised intraday credit operations, in the sense that acredit extended during the day falls due before the end of the day. From a monetary policy pointof view, such operations create the risk of a spillover of intraday credit into overnight credit thatwould undermine the control of the ESCB over the euro monetary base. In other words, thespillover of intraday credit into overnight credit in the books of the central bank can be viewedas a borderline case between payment systems and monetary policy issues.Within the euro area, this risk will be limited as end-of-day debit positions will beautomatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility, i.e. anESCB monetary policy instrument that bears a penalty interest rate.Outside the euro area, a problem arises as the RTGS systems of non-participatingcountries will be connected to TARGET, whereas no central bank currently gives non-residentsaccess to its monetary policy instruments. As a consequence, different mechanisms are beingprepared in order to prevent intraday credit, if granted to non-euro area NCBs, from spillingover into overnight credit. These mechanisms include the limitation, possibly to zero, of theamount of intraday liquidity non-euro area NCBs could receive, a system of penalties andsanctions applied in case of overnight overdrafts and an early closing time for participants inRTGS systems in non-euro area countries. The decision on which mechanisms to implement willbe taken by the ECB.2.3. Foreign exchange operationsForeign exchange operations include foreign reserve assets management on theone hand, foreign exchange intervention on the other hand.The ESCB will hold and manage two different types of foreign reserve assets:•those that will be transferred from the national central banks to the ECB; according to theStatute, the ECB shall be provided with such foreign reserve assets up to an amountequivalent to euro 50 billion;BIS Review   112/1997
- 8 -•and those that will be kept by the national central banks; the management of these foreignassets will be subject to guidelines issued by the ECB to ensure that the operations ofnational central banks do not interfere with the monetary and exchange rate policies of theeuro area. These guidelines will include prior approval by the ECB for transactionsexceeding thresholds to be specified and will also apply to member states’ transactions withtheir foreign exchange working balances.The ESCB will have the technical capacity to conduct, if need be, foreignexchange intervention in order to counteract excessive or erratic exchange rate fluctuations ofthe euro against the major non-EU currencies (e.g., the US dollar).The need for intervention could also arise either in the context of G7 concertedoperations or within the framework of the ERM II. To this end, the ESCB will use the pool offoreign assets transferred from the NCBs to the ECB.The framework that has been designed for domestic as well as foreign exchangeoperations allows the ESCB to build on the expertise that NCBs have acquired over the yearsand to make an extensive use of existing operational capacities in NCBs (dealing room, frontoffice, back office). Common sense dictates making use of equipment, human resources andexpertise currently available at NCBs.2.4. A decentralised execution of operationsA key feature of the single monetary policy is indeed that it will be decided in acentralised manner, by the Governing Council of the ECB, and executed in a decentralisedmanner, by the national central banks. In my description of operational issues within the contextof the single monetary policy, I have made numerous and concrete allusions to this reliance ofthe ECB on the national central banks, in the areas of monetary policy, payment systems andforeign exchange operations. This organisation scheme of the ESCB is in line with the principleof subsidiarity laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. According to this principle, the ESCB shallhave recourse to the national central banks to carry out its operations, to the extent deemedpossible and appropriate. Consistently with this principle of decentralisation in the execution ofthe ESCB’s operations, the counterparties (credit institutions) will keep their accounts with theNCBs.Operational decentralisation within the ESCB will be in the very interest of theSystem. In this regard, let me quote the President of the EMI, Mr. Duisenberg: “Reliance on theinfrastructure and operational experience built up by the national central banks will prove avaluable asset. Given that the ESCB needs to be cognisant of differences between financialmarket participants and structures in the EU, operating through the national central banks willensure that it has the best possible knowledge of market conditions throughout the euro area”.8The credibility of the ECB as the decision-making centre will by no means beundermined by this decentralised scheme. It will not depend on the technicalities in theexecution of operations. The credibility of the ECB will crucially depend on its ability to                                                  8 Speech by the President of the European Monetary Institute, Dr. W.F.

Mr. Greenspan's remarks to the Economic Club of New York   Remarks bythe Chairman of the Board of the U S Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at theEconomic Club of New York in New York City, on 02/12/97.Dramatic advances in the global financial system have enabled us to materiallyimprove the efficiency of the flows of capital and payments. Those advances, however, havealso enhanced the ability of the system to rapidly transmit problems in one part of the globe toanother. The events of recent weeks have underscored this latter process. The lessons we arelearning from these experiences hopefully can be applied to better the workings of theinternational financial system, a system that has done so much to foster gains in living standardsworldwide.The current crisis is likely to accelerate the dismantling in many Asian countriesof the remnants of a system with large elements of government-directed investment, in whichfinance played a key role in carrying out the state’s objectives. Such a system inevitably has ledto the investment excesses and errors to which all similar endeavors seem prone.Government-directed production, financed with directed bank loans, cannotreadily adjust to the continuously changing patterns of market demand for domesticallyconsumed goods or exports. Gluts and shortages are inevitable. The accelerated opening up inrecent years of product and financial markets worldwide offers enormous benefits to all nationsover the long run. However, it has also exposed more quickly and harshly the underlyingrigidities of economic systems in which governments -- or governments working with largeindustrial groups -- exercise substantial influence over resource allocation. Such systems canproduce vigorous growth for a time when the gap between indigenous applied technologies andworld standards is large, such as in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s and Southeast Asiain the 1980s and 1990s. But as the gap narrows, the ability of these systems to handle theirincreasingly sophisticated economies declines markedly.In western developed economies, in contrast, market forces have been allowedmuch freer rein to dictate production schedules. Rapid responses by businesses to changes infree-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmetneeds to produce shortages. Recent improvements in technology have significantly compressedbusiness response times and enhanced the effectiveness of the market mechanism.Most Asian policymakers, while justly proud of the enormous success of theireconomies in recent decades, nonetheless have been moving of late toward these more open andflexible economies. Belatedly perhaps, they have perceived the problems to which their systemsare prone and recognized the unforgiving nature of the new global market forces. Doubtless, thecurrent crises will hasten that trend. While the adjustments may be difficult for a time, thesecrises will pass. Stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient internationaleconomic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake.While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, thesources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems thathave emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.Following the early post-World War II period, policies generally fostering lowlevels of inflation and high rates of savings and investment -- including investment in humancapital through education -- contributed to a sustained period of rapid growth. In some cases thisBIS Review   111/1997
- 2 -started in the 1960s and 1970s, but by the 1980s most economies in the region were expandingvigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew, but until recently were relatively modest. TheWorld Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt, foreign direct investment, and equitypurchases to the Asia-Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990, but exploded to morethan $110 billion by 1996; less comprehensive data suggest that inflows rose to a still higher rateearlier this year.Sustained, spectacular growth in Asian economies fostered expectations of highreturns with moderate risk. Moreover the global stock market boom of the 1990s provided theimpetus to seek these perceived high returns. As that boom progressed, investors in manyindustrial countries found themselves more heavily concentrated in the recently higher valuedsecurities of companies in the developed world, whose rates of return, in many instances, hadreached levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential in emerging economies,especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capital flows intothose economies. To a large extent, they came from investors in the United States and westernEurope. A substantial amount came from Japan, as well, owing more to a search for higheryields than to rising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen throughmid-1995 also encouraged a substantial increase in direct investment outflows from Japan.In retrospect, it is clear that more investment monies flowed into these economiesthan could be profitably employed at reasonable risk. It may have been inevitable in thoseconditions of rapid growth, ample liquidity, and an absence of sufficient profitable alternatives,that much investment moved into the real estate sector, with an emphasis by both the public andprivate sectors on conspicuous construction projects that had little economic rationale. Thesereal estate assets, in turn, ended up as collateral for a significant proportion of the assets ofdomestic financial systems. In many instances, those financial systems were already less thanrobust, beset with problems of poor lending standards, weak supervisory regimes, andinadequate capital.At the same time, rising business leverage added to financial fragility. Businesseswere borrowing to maintain high rates of return on equity and weak financial systems werepoorly disciplining this process. In addition, explicit government guarantees of debt or, moreoften, the presumption of such guarantees by the investment community, encouraged insufficientvigilance by lenders and hence greater leverage. But high debt burdens allow little tolerance forrising interest rates or slowdowns in economic growth, as recent events have demonstrated.Moreover, the rapidly growing foreign-currency-denominated debt, in part theresult of pegged exchange rates to the dollar, put pressure on companies to earn foreignexchange. But earning it became increasingly difficult. The substantial rise in the value of thedollar since mid-1995, especially relative to the yen, made exports of the Southeast Asianeconomies less competitive. In addition, in some cases, the glut of semiconductors in 1996 andthe accelerated drop in their prices suppressed export earnings growth, exerting further pressureson highly leveraged businesses.In time, the pressures on what had become fixed-exchange-rate regimes mountedas investors, confronted with ever fewer profitable prospects, slowed the pace of new capitalinflows. Fearing devaluation, many domestic Asian businesses sought increasingly to convertdomestic currencies into foreign currencies, or, equivalently, slowed the conversion of exportearnings into domestic currencies. To counter pressures on exchange rates, countries raisedinterest rates. For fixed-exchange-rate, highly leveraged economies, it was only a matter of timeBIS Review   111/1997
before slower growth and higher interest rates led to difficulties for borrowers, especially thosewith fixed obligations.Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-calledcontagion effect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive, rightlyor wrongly, similar vulnerabilities. This is an age-old phenomenon. When investors are unsettledby uncertainties and fears, they withdraw commitments on a broad front; the finer distinctionsbetween countries and currencies are lost. There is a flight to safe-haven investments, many ofwhich are in developed nations.Perhaps, given the circumstances, it was inevitable that the impressive and rapidgrowth experienced by the economies in the Asian region would encounter a temporaryslowdown or pause. I say temporary because there is no reason that above-average growth incountries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with the prevailing technologycannot persist for a very long time, provided their markets are opened to the full force ofcompetition. Nonetheless, free-market, even partially free-market, economies do periodicallyrun into difficulties because investment mistakes invariably occur. And, as I noted earlier, manyof these mistakes arose from government-directed or influenced investments. When thishappens, private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In these circumstances, individualcompanies should be allowed to default, private investors should take their losses, andgovernment policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structuralfoundations for renewed expansion. New growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge.Although the economies of the troubled Asian countries were usuallycharacterized by a combination of current account deficits, large net foreign currency exposures,and constraints on exchange rate fluctuations, one cannot generalize that these are always signsof impending difficulties.Large current account deficits, per se, are not dangerous if they result from directinvestment inflows that are not subject to rapid withdrawal and that generate an increase inincome sufficient to compensate the investors. Foreign currency exposures need not be aproblem if positions are properly managed and the risks are recognized. Fixed exchange rates,also, are not necessarily a problem. Indeed, if they can be sustained, they yield extensive benefitsin lower risk and lower costs for all international transactions. But a small open economy canmaintain an exchange rate fixed to a hard currency only under certain conditions. Both Austriaand the Netherlands, for example, have been able to lock their currencies against the DeutscheMark because their economies are tightly linked through trade with Germany, they mirror theBundesbank’s monetary policies, and they are perceived to engage in prudent fiscal policies.Were it not for issues of national identity and seignorage, they could just as readily embrace theDM as their domestic currency without any economic disruption. Other economies, such asArgentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.Changes in dollar reserves directly affect the monetary base of those economies.But when exchange rates are fixed, with or without currency boards, shouldmonetary and fiscal policies diverge significantly from those of the larger economy, the currencylock of the smaller economy would be difficult to hold irrespective of the size of reserves. Largereserves can delay adjustment. They cannot prevent it if policies are inconsistent, or prices in thesmaller country are inflexible.A well-functioning international financial system will seek out anomalies inpolicy alignments and exchange rates and set them right. In such a system, the exploitation ofBIS Review   111/1997
- 4 -above-normal profit opportunities, that is, arbitrage, will force prices to change until expectedreturns have been equalized. To policymakers in the country whose currency is not appropriatelyaligned, capital outflows are too often seen as attacks by marauding currency speculators. Therehave no doubt been some such attempts on occasion. But speculators rarely succeed indislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures. Moreoften, speculation forces currencies through arbitrage into a closer alignment with underlyingmarket values to the benefit of the international economic and financial system as a whole. Weused to describe capital flight as “hot money”. But we soon recognized that it was not the moneythat was “hot”, but the place it was running from.The prodigious expansion of cross-border financial transactions in recent yearshas tightened and refined the arbitrage process significantly. But, to repeat, the inestimableadvantages that it brings to trade and standards of living also carry a price. The inevitableinvestment mistakes and governmental policy failures are more rapidly transmitted to othermarkets by this process than was the case say twenty, or even ten, years ago. Moreover, there islittle evidence to suggest that the rate of increase of financial transactions will slow materially inthe years immediately ahead.Technology will continue to reduce the costs of finding and exploiting perceiveddifferences in risk-adjusted rates of return around the world, helping to direct capital even moreto its most efficient use. Already, covered rates of return on actively traded interest-rateinstruments have been equalized among many industrial countries.But the broader merging of world savings and investment markets, clearly, hasnot been achieved, largely because investors are fearful of investing in countries they do notunderstand to the extent that they do their own, or are uninformed of the opportunities.One measure of this so-called home bias in world investments is the degree thatportfolios remain substantially local. Foreign investments, on average, represent less than10 percent of U.S. portfolios, for example. The percentage of Japanese portfolios is only slightlyhigher, and 15 percent of German portfolios is in foreign assets. The partial exception is GreatBritain, where, with a longer history of global financial involvement, one-third of portfolios isinvested in foreign assets.Home bias in investments is considerably less than it was ten years ago, but weare still far from full globalization. Unless government restrictions inhibit the expansion of evermore sophisticated financial products that enable savers in one part of the world to reduce riskby investing in another, the bias will continue to diminish and the size of the internationalfinancial system will continue to expand at a significant pace. It is this overall diversification,and hence lowering of risk, that an effective international financial system offers. It facilitatesthe ever more efficient functioning of the global economic system and, hence, is a majorcontributor to rising standards of living worldwide.Nonetheless, there are those who ask whether the price of so sophisticated afinancial system is too high. Would it not be better to slow it down a bit, and perhaps achieve asystem somewhat more forgiving of mistakes, even recognizing that such a slowing may entailsome shortfall in long-term economic growth?Even if we could implement such a tradeoff, with only minor disruption, shouldwe try? For centuries groups in our societies have railed against, and endeavored on occasion toBIS Review   111/1997
destroy, new inventions. Fortunately for us the Luddites and their ilk failed, and recentgenerations have enjoyed the fruits of those technologies.Moreover such a slowdown may not even be possible -- at least without majordisruption and cost. Newer technologies, especially advanced telecommunications, make itexceptionally difficult for open markets, with associated opportunities, to be suppressed. Priceand capital controls, which might have been feasible a half century ago, would be very difficultto implement in today’s more technologically advanced environment. Tinkering at the edges ofour system in order to produce a less frenetic pace of change would be easily circumvented.Arguably, it would take massive government controls to substantially slow the advance towardgreater efficiency of our systems. This would surely produce a far more negative impact oneconomic growth than would be acceptable to even the most ardent advocates of reining in therapid expansion of our international financial system.If, as I suspect, it turns out after due deliberation and analysis, that slowing thepace of financial modernization is not in fact seen as a feasible alternative, what policyalternatives confront the international financial community to contain the periodic disruptionsthat are bound to occur in any free market economy?A financial system, like all structures, is as strong as its weakest link. As theinternational financial system has become even more complex, the particular areas of weaknessto be addressed have changed. At the risk of oversimplification, let’s examine some of the keylinks of our current infrastructure.Today, the organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets of industrialcountries can handle massive volumes of transactions. Even in emerging countries exchanges aredeveloping and expanding. In contrast, during the world-wide stock market crash of October1987, the transactions systems were under severe stress and, indeed, some broke down,incapable of handling the enlarged volumes. At that time, the Hong Kong stock exchange couldnot open for several days. The New York Stock Exchange was straining badly under the near400 million daily share volume of late October 1987, with long reporting delays creatinguncertainties that, doubtless, exaggerated the price declines. Those weaker links have since beenstrengthened by large infrastructure investments. Almost 1.2 billion shares traded on the NYSEon October 28 of this year, three times the 1987 volumes with no evident problems or delays.Our equity, debt, and foreign exchange trading systems, and their peripheralfutures and options markets have functioned well under stress recently. These systems are notweak links in the developed economies, nor, for the most part are they in other economies.Neither is the payment system, that complex network, which transfers funds andsecurities in huge and growing volumes domestically and internationally, rapidly and efficiently.The private and public sectors across the globe have endeavored diligently for years to expandthe capacity of the system to meet the increasing demands put upon it. And they have initiatedand strengthened procedures for reducing risk in settling transactions, and diminishinguncertainties. That they have generally succeeded is evident from the smoothness with whichhuge volumes of funds produced under recent stressed market conditions were transferred andsettled with finality, through various netting and clearing arrangements.Banks are another matter. These are highly leveraged institutions, financed in partby interbank credits and, hence, prone to crises of confidence that can quickly spread. In mostdeveloped nations banking systems appear reasonably solid. Japan has been somewhat of anBIS Review   111/1997
- 6 -exception, but there have been some positive signs there, as well. Banks have been recognizinglosses, and the government seems finally to be appropriately addressing their problems. In alarge number of emerging nations, as I indicated previously, banks are in poor shape. Laxlending has created a high incidence of non-performing loans, supported by inadequate capital,leaving banks vulnerable to declines in collateral values and non-performance by borrowers.How can such deficient institutions be elevated to a level that would allow theireconomies to function effectively in our increasingly sophisticated international financialsystem? Certainly, improved cost and risk management and elimination of poor lendingpractices are a good place to start.But these cannot be accomplished overnight. Loan officers with experiencejudging credit and market risks are in very short supply in emerging economies. Training willrequire time. The same difficulties confront bank supervision and regulation. Important effortsin this area have been underway for several years through the auspices of the Bank forInternational Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. But again, itwill take time to develop adequate systems and trained personnel.Moreover, robust banking and financial systems require firmly enforced laws ofcontract, and transparent, market-oriented systems of corporate reporting and governance. Thecurrent crisis in Asia is, to a much greater extent than many previous crises, one of private, notpublic, debts, at least de jure. Arguably, the absence of efficient and transparent work-outarrangements for troubled private borrowers makes the problems more difficult to deal with.Efficient bankruptcy arrangements reduce disruptions to economic activity that often arise whenlosses have to be imposed on creditors. Many developing countries do not have good work-outarrangements for troubled debtors, and, as a result, governments in these countries often feelcompelled to bail them out rather than accept the consequences of defaults.The most troublesome aspect of many banking systems of emerging countries, toexpand on the issue I raised earlier, is the widespread prevalence of loans driven by “industrialpolicy” imperatives rather than market forces.What is wrong with policy -- that is, politically-driven -- loans? Potentiallynothing if they were made to firms to finance expansions that just happened to coincide with arise in consumer or business or overseas demand for their newly-produced products. In thesecircumstances, the loan proceeds would have been profitably employed and the loan repaid atmaturity with interest. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Policy loans, in too manyinstances, foster misuse of resources, unprofitable expansions, losses, and eventually loandefaults. In many cases, of course, these loans regrettably end up being guaranteed bygovernments. If denominated in local currency, they can be financed with the printingpress -- though with consequent risk of inflation. Too often, however, they are foreign-currencydenominated, where governments face greater constraints on access to credit.Restructuring of financial systems, while indispensable, cannot be implementedquickly. Yes, the potential risks to the banking systems of many Asian countries and thepotential contagion effects for their neighbors, and other trading partners, should have beenspotted earlier and addressed. But flaws, seen clearly in retrospect, are never so evident at thetime. Moreover, there is significant bias in political systems of all varieties to substitute hope(read, wishful thinking) for possibly difficult pre-emptive policy moves, both with respect tofinancial systems and economic policy. There is often denial and delay in instituting properadjustments. Recent propensities to obscure the need for change have been evidenced byBIS Review   111/1997
unreported declines in reserves, issuance by the government of equivalents to foreign currencyobligations, or unreported large new forward short positions against foreign currencies. It is verydifficult for political leaders to incur what they perceive as large, immediate political costs tocontain problems they see as only prospective.Reality eventually replaces hope, and the cost of the delay is a more abrupt anddisruptive adjustment than would have been required if action had been more pre-emptive.Increased transparency for businesses and governments is a key ingredient in fostering morediscipline on private transactors and on government policymakers. Increased transparency cancounter political bias in part by exposing for all to see the risks of current policies to stability asthey develop. Under such conditions, failure to act would also be perceived as having politicalcosts.We should strongly stress to the newer members of the international financialsystem -- the emerging economies -- that they should accelerate the restructuring of theirfinancial systems in their own interests. But having delayed timely restructuring, many now findthemselves with major shortfalls in bank liquidity and equity capital that put their systems atsevere risk of collapse before any full restructuring is feasible. The IMF, the World Bank, andtheir major shareholders, the developed countries, may wish to facilitate adjustment throughtemporary loans to governments and the encouragement of private equity infusions to thesebanking systems. Since any severe breakdown can have contagion effects on a world-wide basis,it is in our interest to do so.These loans must be judged in their entirety. They transform short-termobligations into medium-term loans, but they do so contingent on the country using the time toreform financial systems as well as adopt sound economic policies. Such conditionalityaccelerates the adjustments in financial systems needed to lay the foundation for resumption ofrobust, sustainable, growth, while cushioning to some degree the economic effects of theimmediate crisis. Assistance without further reform of financial systems and economic policieswould be worse than useless since it would foster expectations of being perpetually bailed out.That, in turn, could induce perverse behavior on the part of emerging nations’ governments andof private sector investors in emerging nations. Believing that the international financialcommunity will support these economies, in part by backstopping the obligations they incur,induces investors to commit more than they would otherwise. This has tended in the past to pushthe expansion of investment beyond prudence -- given the limit of profitable opportunities.As the international financial system becomes ever larger and more efficient, thesize of the financial response -- whether to help banks or to add to foreign currencyreserves -- may have to be correspondingly larger per unit of crisis, if I may put it that way --unless we alter our approach. While it is precarious to generalize from one observation, it islikely that the Mexican financial crisis of the 1980s was broader than in 1994-95, but the size ofthe assistance program, to set things right, was much larger in the latter than in the former case.The reason appears to be that the increased efficiency of the financial system created a largernegative spillover, which had to be contained. Among other developments, the marked shiftfrom bank credits in the earlier crisis, to a more securitized, anonymous, set of liabilities madeworkouts far more complex.It is, hence, all the more essential that the weaker links in our internationalfinancial system, the banking systems of the emerging nations, be strengthened. Preventiveprograms should be accelerated sufficiently far in advance of the next crisis to effectively thwartor contain it.BIS Review   111/1997
- 8 -Moreover, it is incumbent on governmental policymakers to insure that unstableeconomic environments do not induce or exacerbate international financial disruptions. Butgovernments and international financial institutions should be brought on the scene only rarely.To do otherwise risks the perverse incentives I spoke of earlier. Markets should be allowed towork.Recent events in Asia have sharpened our understanding of the complexity oftoday’s international capital flows and, presumably, of similar episodes that may emerge in thefuture.The rapid integration of national financial systems has fostered the growth oftrade and standards of living worldwide. It has also forced a review of the soundness andviability of our burgeoning financial systems. We should welcome such pressures even as theyimpose challenges to all of us. The end result is very worthwhile having.BIS Review   111/1997
Mr. Fazio considers the issue of efficiency and instability in global financeAddress given by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, at an internationalconference celebrating 50 years of Quarterly Review/Moneta e Credito in Rome, on 20/11/97.In the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War, the new monetarysystem set up by the Bretton Woods agreements, together with the liberalisation and expansion ofinternational trade, laid the foundations for a long period of economic growth and stability.From 1950 to 1973 the world economy grew at an annual rate of 4.9%; the industrialcountries achieved 4.4%, Latin America, Asia and Oceania a higher rate. Inflation was a little above3% in the industrial countries and less than 5% in the world as a whole.The economic devastation of the Great Depression had undermined the classicalvision of the economy based on the hypothesis of equilibrium, in which the action of policy-makerswas constrained by the rigid rules of the gold standard. Following Keynes, in the new monetary ordereconomic policies were assigned a pre-eminent role in governing the cycle. Controls were imposedon capital movements to permit interest rates to be managed in pursuit of domestic objectives.The liberalisation of trade contrasted with a segmentation of the market for savingsand financial assets on a national basis. Current account imbalances were to be promptly corrected bymeans of a fiscal policy serving to re-establish the equality between saving and investment.The system broke down in August 1971, with the suspension of the dollar’sconvertibility into gold. The main cause of the crisis lay in the US budget and balance-of-paymentsdeficits, which generated an overhang that was incompatible with the dollar’s role of anchor. Otherfactors included economic policies in most countries focused primarily on domestic growth andemployment, the rise in public expenditure in relation to GDP, the emergence of internationalfinancial markets and increasingly large flows of hot money, which reduced the effectiveness of therestrictions on capital movements.In a situation where monetary policies were still concerned with the control of interestrates rather than credit flows and the quantity of money, floating rates ended up by fostering anincrease in inflation in the industrial countries and in the rest of the world. Monetary growth in theleading industrial countries continued, at an annual rate of 13%. The oil crisis had an impact that wassimultaneously inflationary and recessionary.The growth rate of the industrial countries slowed to around 2.5% in the years from1973 to 1980, inflation accelerated to 10%. Except in Germany, where monetary policy was directedwith greater determination to controlling inflation, the 1970s were marked by high negative realinterest rates.The shift in US monetary policy introduced by Paul Volcker in 1979 gave priority tocontrolling the quantities of credit and money; interest rates rose sharply to well above the inflationrate. The upward movement spread to all the other leading countries.1. Global financeDuring the 1980s flexibility of the exchange rates between the main economic regionsof the world was accompanied by the dismantling of the barriers to capital movements. Growth in theindustrial countries was no more rapid than in the previous decade; it slowed in the 1990s.BIS Review   110/1997
- 2 -The persistence of budget deficits and large external imbalances, the rapid advances indata processing and telecommunications, financial innovation and the activity of institutions thatcollect and invest savings on a world scale all contributed to the creation of a single, global marketfor currencies and finance. The harbinger of this development was the growth of the Eurodollarmarket, which had been boosted in the 1970s by the recycling of the surpluses of the oil-producingcountries. The new conditions made it possible for countries to adopt a gradualist approach tocorrecting budget and, above all, external deficits; it was no longer necessary for saving to equalinvestment in any given period. The global market was fuelled by the steady accumulation of external debt by theUnited States and the build-up of a net credit position by Germany and Japan. In all the leadingindustrial countries except the United Kingdom public debt continued to rise in relation to GDP.Gross financial assets and liabilities continued to grow much more rapidly thaneconomic activity. Between 1982 and 1995 the total liabilities of the six largest industrial countriesrose from US$ 25 trillion to US$ 110 trillion and from four to six times their GDP. Over the sameperiod the degree of financial integration increased; today, external liabilities are equal to 60% ofGDP. The growth in foreign exchange trading proceeded apace.Favourable investment opportunities encouraged huge flows of capital into theemerging economies; high rates of economic growth were often coupled with largebalance-of-payments deficits and stable exchange rates. Foreign investment in these marketsincreased from US$ 50 billion in 1990 to US$ 200 billion in 1995.In the OECD countries the assets managed by institutional investors rose over thesame period from US$ 14 trillion to US$ 23 trillion and from 85 to 102% of the area’s GDP. Theseintermediaries manage portfolios that tend to be global and take on technically complex risks. Theycan modify the composition of their assets extremely rapidly even for the sake of making small gains;they exploit the arbitrage opportunities stemming from fiscal segmentation or price differencesbetween different financial centres.2. Efficiency and stabilitySavings are now freer to flow towards what investors consider the most profitableinvestment opportunities. This results in a more efficient allocation of the resources available, supportfor capital formation and better growth prospects, especially for backward economies.The increase in lending to the developing countries, where the return on capital ishigher, is certainly evidence of the markets’ efficiency; on the other hand it brings with it the problemof the sustainability of these countries’ foreign debt and the associated risks for stability, includingthat of the international financial system.The Mexico crisis and that still open in South-East Asia, like the debt crisis of theearly 1980s in Latin America, have shown that a large inflow of funds can temporarily prop upunsustainable economic conditions. Anchoring the national currency to strong currencies wheneconomic policies are inadequate causes the real exchange rate to rise, creating the conditions for acrisis. Insufficient supervision of banks and markets is a contributory factor.BIS Review   110/1997
- 3 -The liquidity of markets, the belief that securities can be sold without incurringsubstantial losses can lead to an erroneous perception of the risk. Widespread expectations that theinternational organisations will intervene can accentuate behaviour on the part of intermediaries thatis not consistent with the riskiness of investments.It is becoming increasingly important to ensure sound and orderly economicconditions and at the same time to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the supervision ofintermediaries and markets at the supranational as well as the national level, with the aim offorestalling systemic crises.The restrictive monetary policies adopted in the industrial countries brought annualinflation down from 10% in the 1970s to 5.8% in the 1980s. In the 1990s the objectives have becomemore ambitious; inflation has fallen further, to an average of 3.1%. Prices have also slowed downconsiderably in the last three years in the countries of eastern Europe and above all in Latin America.Real interest rates rose substantially in the industrial countries in the 1980s and 1990s.They increased by around 6 percentage points in the early 1980s in response to the change in thefocus of US monetary policy. Real long-term rates stood at about 5% in the first half of the 1980s.Today, excluding Japan, they still stand at around 4%, above the rate of economic growth.The high level of real interest rates is a reflection of the high returns that can beearned on investments in the emerging countries and the growing risks of a financial nature, which,even though they originate in national markets, affect the whole system. To an even greater extent,with the money supply constant or even slightly declining in relation to GDP as a consequence ofrigorous monetary policies, real interest rates are influenced by the rapid growth in the volume ofprivate and, above all, public sector securities.The ratio of the quantity of money to nominal output has held steady or fallen a littlein the leading countries in the 1990s; in 1996 it stood at about 64%. After rising sharply in the 1980s,international liquidity as measured by cross-border deposits has remained virtually unchanged.For the private sector to acquire the growing stock of financial assets, real interestrates have to be high; the growth in public debt, due first and foremost to the imbalances in socialsecurity systems, is a source of pressure on real resources. The gap between interest rates andeconomic growth rates is a cause of rising unemployment.3. Italy’s role in international financeIn the course of the 1990s, with the complete liberalisation of capital movements,Italy has become a full participant in the international financial markets. Gross capital inflows andoutflows have increased enormously. This process has sustained the accumulation of financial assetsand encouraged residents to diversify their portfolios by type of instrument, country of issue andcurrency of denomination.Between 1990 and 1996 net portfolio investment abroad by the private sectoramounted to 190 trillion lire, accounting for 9% of the growth in total financial assets. The share offoreign instruments in the total financial assets of the private sector rose from 6% at the end of 1989to 14% at the end of 1996.The growing flow of savings invested abroad also reflects a domestic supply offinancial instruments that is still not sufficiently diversified in terms of risks and returns.BIS Review   110/1997
- 4 -Italy’s participation in the global market of finance has encouraged foreign capitalinflows, mainly directed towards the government securities market. At the end of last yearnon-residents held 370 trillion lire of Italian government securities or 20% of the total amountoutstanding, compared with 4% at the end of the 1980s.When doubts have emerged about the soundness of economic policy, foreign capitalinflows have ceased suddenly and given way to outflows, supplemented by substantial exports ofItalian capital. In late 1992 and again in early 1995 non-residents disposed of very large quantities ofItalian securities; at the same time residents’ purchases of foreign financial assets increasedconsiderably.These outflows put the lira and securities prices under very heavy pressure. Thereaffirmation of monetary policy’s counter-inflationary commitment, the continuation, albeit withpauses, of the efforts to adjust the public finances, and the policy of wage moderation were decisivein easing the pressure and restoring conditions for a stable inflow of capital from abroad.Looking ahead to a situation of recovery in economic activity and a reduction in theexternal current account surplus, the diversification of residents’ financial portfolios will not putpressure on the exchange rate if non-residents continue to buy large amounts of Italian securities.During the current year, characterised by favourable expectations regarding the Italianeconomy and the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union, non-residents’ purchases ofgovernment securities, totalling more than 80 trillion lire up to September, have contributed to thesharp contraction in the long-term interest rate differential between Italy and the countries with alonger record of price stability and a lower level of public debt. Exports of Italian capital have alsoincreased, however.One of the reasons for the gradualness with which monetary policy has been easedhas been to ensure favourable conditions for foreign investment in Italy, taking into account thecontinual, structural outflow of Italian capital.As Economic and Monetary Union draws closer and national monetary policy’s roomfor manoeuvre gradually narrows to the point of disappearing, the macroeconomic equilibrium ofeach country will come to depend increasingly on budgetary, incomes and structural policies. In theabsence of changes in the relative values of currencies, imbalances will impinge on competitiveness,production and employment.Public spending in Italy is now equal to more than 50% of GDP. Reducing this ratiowill make it possible to ease the burden of taxation and social security contributions. In order toenhance Italy’s competitiveness and reduce the cost of labour, it is also necessary to remove theobstacles hindering competition in the markets for goods and arrive at a more flexible use of labour.4. Concluding remarksIn addition to benefiting the participating countries, the creation of a stable monetaryarea in Europe will contribute to the stability of the real and financial macroeconomy at the worldlevel.In recent years Europe has been beset by modest growth and insufficient use ofavailable resources; between 1990 and 1996 employment declined by 2 million units. Adverse factorsinclude inefficiencies in some parts of the productive system, market rigidities and excessively largebudgets.BIS Review   110/1997
- 5 - The implementation of a closer economic union and the soundness of money andfinance over time cannot be entrusted exclusively to monetary policy. They require conditions ofgreater economic efficiency and the harmonisation of institutional arrangements in the participatingcountries. A sound currency requires a dynamic economy. Money is largely the product of thecredit granted to firms and the State. The stability of its value does not depend only on the quantity incirculation but also on the efficient use of credit.Economic convergence must therefore be pursued not only in the nominal variablesbut also in labour productivity, a level of taxation that will enhance international competitiveness, andan efficient use of the resources the public sector appropriates. These are the conditions for amonetary union to have the necessary stability and solidity.The global market for currencies and finance influences the performance of alleconomies. The conditions in that market increasingly appear as exogenous variables of decisiveimportance. The macroeconomic equilibria of individual economies have to be related to the level andmovements of interest rates determined in it and to the exchange rates established there between theleading currencies.The external constraint is increasingly taking the form of the need for each countryand economic region to be in overall balance, in terms of financial assets and liabilities, with respectto the rest of the world.The development of the global financial market in the last ten years parallels that ofnational financial markets in the later nineteenth century and the first half of this century. Theincrease in financial activity within each national market, the expansion of credit and the developmentof intermediaries all made a decisive contribution to investment, production and employment. But theneed rapidly emerged for overall control of money creation and even earlier for a system ofprudential supervision of intermediaries’ activities. Today’s central banks are the result.At the international level the expansion in the nominal amounts of credit and moneyhas no longer been limited by the availability of primary liquidity since the link with gold wasbroken. The present configuration of the market has evolved spontaneously, largely in conditions offierce competition. However, given the nature of the variables involved, it is unlikely that aPareto-efficient equilibrium will be reached.Money produces credit and credit produces more money; it is necessary to govern thegrowth of these aggregates; an anchor is needed to stabilise their value in terms of goods. In theabsence of binding rules and appropriate policies, national economies and the international economyare exposed to the risks of inflation and instability in intermediaries and markets.This inflationary drift is likely to lead to speculative bubbles, excessive increases inthe value of real and financial assets. The international crises that occur from time to time diminishthe value of financial wealth and curb inflationary pressures at the world level.With many economies suffering from stagnation and poor fundamentals, the low costand rapid expansion of dollar financing in the early 1990s and the subsequent restriction, togetherwith the more recent monetary expansion in Japan and loss of value of the yen, have probablycontributed to the instability of the global market for finance.BIS Review   110/1997
- 6 -The efforts, redoubled in recent years, to achieve monetary stability in most of theindustrial countries, the banking supervision started by the Group of Ten for developed countries, itsextension to the emerging countries and the surveillance performed by the IMF are playing a role ofgreat systemic importance.Faced with open and competitive markets, the strengthening of cooperation helps toforestall crises, increases the efficacy of corrective action. Effective action by central banks,supervisory authorities and the IMF is a first response to the new problems of monetary and financialstability raised by the globalisation of markets; it may require more certain and firmly basedinternational institutional arrangements.BIS Review   110/1997
Mr. McDonough gives a US perspective on Economic and Monetary Union inEurope   Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. WilliamJ. McDonough, before the Association of German Mortgage Banks in Frankfurt, on 17/11/97.I am honored to be invited by the German Mortgage Banks to be the keynote speakertonight at the Association’s annual Pfandbrief Forum. It is a great pleasure to be here in Frankfurtamong so many distinguished representatives of the German banking and financial community andmembers of the Bundesbank Council.In my remarks to you this evening, I would like to offer a few thoughts on theimplications of Economic and Monetary Union in Europe from my perspective as President of theFederal Reserve Bank of New York. Many in the United States today are following developments inEurope’s move toward monetary union with considerable interest. I am certainly among them.There can be no doubt about the magnitude and economic importance of the historicevent that will take place on January 1, 1999, when the currencies of up to 15 member countries ofthe European Union are scheduled to be unified. It is a goal toward which Europe has been workingever since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 creating the European Economic Community.While some might claim that this historic development will have little impact on the U.S. economy,nothing could be further from the truth.The United States will be directly affected in several important ways by the start ofEconomic and Monetary Union in Europe, or EMU. I would like to review some of the mainchannels through which EMU is likely to affect American business and policymaking over the nextseveral years. Further, I think it may be useful to highlight some of the important similarities anddifferences between the currency union that exists in the United States today and the currency unionthat you are in the process of creating in Europe.The most obvious implication of the start of EMU for the United States -- as well asfor the world community -- is the coming into existence of a new currency, the euro, which isintended to function as a major international currency alongside the U.S. dollar. I should make clearat the outset that it would be a mistake to think that the United States looks at this prospect withconcern, as if the introduction of the euro could somehow compromise the ability of the United Statesto continue to conduct trade and financial transactions with the rest of the world.As you well know, the dollar is currently used in roughly 50 percent of world tradetransactions and in at least one side of 80 percent of world financial transactions. The introduction ofanother major international currency will neither harm the depth and liquidity of the dollar market norhinder the ability of the United States to conduct its external transactions smoothly. On the contrary,to the extent that the birth of the euro fosters deeper trade and financial markets globally and a moreefficient international monetary system, all countries stand to benefit, particularly an activeparticipant such as the United States.Let me be more specific. In my view, for the United States and the internationalmonetary system, the implication of a growing international role for the euro over the foreseeablefuture will be most significant with respect to financial rather than trade transactions.It is quite true that the euro may quickly become the currency of choice in theinvoicing of trade between companies in the European Union and their foreign counterparts.Companies in regions with strong links to the European Union, such as those in eastern and centralEurope, North Africa, and the CFA French franc zone, may also choose to invoice trade in euros.BIS Review   109/1997
- 2 -More generally, the euro may well expand its importance in world trade beyond the relative tradeweight of the European Union countries, following a path similar to that taken by the U.S. dollarand -- before that -- by the pound sterling.Nevertheless, I would argue that the economic effects of these potential changes ininvoicing practices are likely to be limited. Why do I say this?First, to a large extent, the re-denomination of a significant share of world trade intoeuros will mainly represent a shift in invoicing practices from the use of former European currenciesto euros. Moreover, third-country effects are unlikely to be major, because the European currencies asa whole are already somewhat over-represented in their share of world trade transactions relative totheir countries’ weights in world trade -- not as much so as the dollar, but certainly more so than theyen.Finally, changes in trade invoicing practices have a direct economic impact only onthe two parties involved in the transaction, and these effects are limited to determining who ultimatelybears the exchange rate risk. In fact, because of the wide variety of risk-hedging instruments that areavailable to traders exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of exchange rate risk on tradepatterns is likely to be secondary. This conjecture is confirmed by a substantial amount of empiricalresearch.In short, the economic impact of the euro in international trade transactions is likely tobe limited. The same cannot be said of the euro’s potential role in international financial transactions.Partly because of their sheer magnitude -- some estimates place the volume ofinternational capital transactions at more than 40 times the volume of international tradetransactions -- growth in the use of the euro as the currency of choice in global capital markets willhave much more significant repercussions for the United States than will increasing use of the euro inglobal product markets. To a large extent, these repercussions reflect the well-known gains that stemfrom increasing returns in the use of a currency as a store of value. As the market for a currencybecomes more liquid, the costs of carrying wealth denominated in that currency fall, raisinginvestors’ preferences for denominating their portfolios in that currency. These increased preferencesin turn lead to a further deepening and broadening of the market for that currency, costs of holdingsare reduced further, and the process continues.As in trade transactions, the dollar is the predominant means of exchange ininternational financial transactions. Its predominance is especially apparent with respect to largeissues of international bonds -- a clear reflection of the low cost of covering exchange rate andinterest rate risk for long-term dollar instruments.I would suggest, however, that the current role of the dollar should not be taken forgranted. Once the euro comes into existence, the simple conversion of the EMU countries’outstanding securities into euros will contribute to the immediate creation of a major securitiesmarket.This development alone will create a critical mass for a market in euro-denominatedsecurities. It will give the market depth and liquidity, and, in so doing, bring down the costs ofconducting transactions, issuing loans, and trading securities below those currently seen for Europeannational currencies -- possibly to levels comparable to those for dollars. The development of such avirtuous cycle could well feed upon itself and lead to the continuous growth of the market for euros.In this context, I would like to suggest that the experience the United States has hadwith a large, unified capital market may point to ways in which a unified European capital marketBIS Review   109/1997
may evolve after the advent of EMU. If the U.S. experience is of any relevance, we may expect to seea decreasing use of bank loans in favor of a growing use of securities in Europe after 1999.Repo markets would also likely grow, potentially along the lines we have seen in theUnited States, where institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds, state and localgovernments, and insurance companies have become the largest providers of capital under repoarrangements -- in contrast with Europe’s experience, where these types of investors tend to holdbank deposits. A growing role for repurchase arrangements is already apparent in Europe, and thisgrowth may be expected to accelerate once the European central bank starts to operate in this market,accepting -- and fostering -- the use of a wide range of government paper as collateral.It is useful to keep in mind that the move to a single-currency, highly securitizedEuropean capital market cannot be expected to be completely painless. Clearly, since banks are themain intermediaries of cross-border transactions, the banking sector will bear the brunt of the costsassociated with the changeover to a common currency. For example, it will suffer losses fromreduced foreign exchange trading and transfer revenues. It will also have to pay for the retooling ofinformation management and delivery systems, as well as face increased uncertainties in its coredeposits.At the same time, however, the larger single market will create new opportunities forbanks, particularly in the areas of investment banking and the cross-border sale of deposits, mutualfunds, and other savings products. On balance, it seems fair to conclude that the commercial positionand earnings of many European banks are likely to come under pressure. This may accelerate theongoing restructuring of Europe’s banking industry, a process that has been confined, to date,primarily to developments within each country.More broadly, there can be no doubt that the implications of the growth of a moreefficient and cost-effective market for euro-denominated capital would extend well beyond Europe.The availability of a new, low-cost channel for portfolio investment, for example, could help reversethe traditional reluctance of households and many institutional investors worldwide to investinternationally -- a reluctance that has long puzzled academics and policymakers.Moreover, a well-developed market for euro-denominated capital would encourageinstitutional investors from the United States and elsewhere to acquire diversified Europeanportfolios offered in a single currency. In fact, this development could be accelerated if membergovernments chose to deepen the euro market by increasing the available range of bond maturities,which in some countries is somewhat limited at the short and long ends. In addition, capital mightalso flow in the opposite direction, as non-European firms and governments tap theeuro-denominated capital market as an efficient source of funds, in the same way as Europeanbusinesses and governments have chosen to borrow dollars in recent decades.While the potential benefits of a more integrated European capital market in the longrun are apparent, a number of observers have suggested that the economics of EMU -- as well as itsplain mechanics -- may have unwelcome consequences for the dollar and world trade. Morespecifically, some have argued, EMU may cause a short-run glut of dollars in the international capitalmarkets, leading the dollar to depreciate and the euro to appreciate, with resulting undesirable effectson trade flows.The reason there could be a dollar glut, these observers maintain, is that EMU wouldeliminate the need for intra-European intervention, reduce the importance of exchange ratemanagement, and allow national central banks to pool reserves for external intervention, thusgenerally reducing the European central banks’ need for dollar reserves. Moreover, if the euro wereBIS Review   109/1997
- 4 -to become an attractive reserve currency for non-European central banks, the dollar glut couldbecome even more severe.While some decline in the reserve role of the dollar is certainly plausible over timewith the creation of EMU, I believe that the risk of a dramatic shift in official dollar reserve holdingsboth in and outside Europe in the wake of EMU has been exaggerated in terms of both its potentialscope and effects.I would suggest that it will take some time before the objectives and operatingprocedures of the European central bank become clearly understood by market participants. Althoughlow inflation will be the ultimate objective of the new European central bank, markets will have tounderstand precisely how that objective will be pursued: What price aggregate will be the focus ofmonetary policy? How will intermediate instruments such as monetary aggregates be used to achievethe ultimate objective? What channels will the central bank choose to signal and implement changesin its policy stance?As these longer-term questions are addressed, the policy importance of the externalvalue of the euro, particularly the euro/dollar exchange rate, will certainly be watched carefully. Bothmarket participants and foreign central banks are likely to focus on the euro exchange rate as ahigh-frequency and widely available -- if somewhat noisy -- indicator of the current and likely futurestance of European monetary policy. Given its need to instil confidence in the markets and to ensurethe stability of the euro exchange rate, the European central bank is likely to want to be perceived asready and able to operate effectively in the dollar market, for which substantial dollar reserves may berequired.In the short term, the response of non-European central banks to the introduction ofthe euro is also likely to be cautious. Ultimately, the desired euro holdings of these central banks willlargely depend on the decisions they make about their exchange rate regime. A number ofcountries -- including the central European countries that have applied for membership in theEuropean Union and other countries in Africa -- may decide to peg their currency to the euro. Yetthese countries may well wait for the newly-formed European central bank to establish its policyrecord and clarify its operating procedures before they commit their currencies to a euro peg.Indeed, history suggests that a currency’s role as an international reserve, means ofexchange, and store of value is slowly gained and slowly lost -- as the examples of the dollar andpound sterling illustrate. The dollar, in particular, may have seemed on the way to losing much of itsinternational prominence after the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. After declining as ashare of international reserves and a means for international transactions from 1974 to the mid-1980s,however, the dollar’s relative use has not changed significantly during the past decade. Indeed, as theU.S. economy has grown more efficient and internationally competitive in the past ten years, thedollar has retained its strong role in the international monetary system. In short, it seems safe toassume that significant changes in the international role of the dollar and the functioning of theinternational monetary system would occur only gradually, and surely in a manner that could beeasily coped with, given the turnover in capital markets we observe today.But should a different international monetary system ultimately emerge in which othercurrencies, such as the euro, play an increasingly important role alongside the dollar, there would bebenefits for the United States as well. Such a development would, for example, impose greatermarket-led discipline on the United States and, in the process, help us address our chroniclow-savings problem.There is another indirect -- although potentially more important -- way in which EMUmay affect U.S. business and policymaking. This implication of EMU has to do with the contributionBIS Review   109/1997
a currency union is likely to make to increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the economies thatjoin it. At least since the publication of the “One Market, One Money” study by the EuropeanCommission in 1990, observers and analysts of EMU have paid significant attention to the decline intransaction costs that can be achieved by unifying up to 15 different currencies, and to the resultinggains in efficiency for Europe’s economies.The experience of the United States is useful in this respect. The fact that 50 states inthe United States share a common currency -- and have done so for over 130 years -- provides thecritical foundation for an integrated and efficient capital market that extends from Maine to Californiaand on to Alaska and Hawaii. In this market, capital flows smoothly from high-saving tohigh-investment areas, as required by changing business conditions, without any thought of exchangerate risk.A common U.S. currency, it is important to note, has many advantages beyond simplyreducing transaction costs. It also simplifies choices for households and corporate management,enhances the efficiency with which financial institutions and the payments system function, andpromotes competition across the whole productive spectrum.While a common currency in Europe can be expected to lead to similar efficiencygains, the economies of the United States and Europe differ in several important dimensions, so that acommon currency is likely to work in substantially different ways in the two regions. The ways inwhich Europe and the United States differ most have to do with the degree of integration of theirlabor markets and their fiscal systems.The United States enjoys a very mobile labor force -- across sectors and states --which allows job losses arising during sector-specific or state-specific recessions to be rapidlyabsorbed where jobs are growing faster. This contributes to aggregate unemployment being keptreasonably in check. This willingness of American workers to move themselves and their family is acultural characteristic of our people, no doubt based in the history of the United States as a nation ofimmigrants.To complement its high degree of labor mobility, the United States also has in place afederal fiscal system that allows the federal government to channel large transfers from fast-growingregions to slow-growing regions. Progressive income taxation, a high elasticity of corporate taxprofits to changes in income, and an integrated federal budget are the main components of thissystem.In contrast to the United States, Europe is characterized by a more segmented labormarket and very limited integration of its national fiscal systems. Both these characteristics limit theability not only of Europe’s private sector to shift resources in response to regional recessions, butalso of Europe’s public sector to compensate for this rigidity. This lack of flexibility is widelyacknowledged to be one of the root causes of the high unemployment rates that Europe hasexperienced during the last decade.But, we may well ask, does it necessarily follow that because of the greater rigidity ofits labor markets and the lack of a federal fiscal system, Europe cannot accommodate a commoncurrency and instead needs to rely on periodic exchange rate adjustments as surrogates for productiveflexibility? I do not think so. While less flexible labor markets and the absence of a federal fiscalsystem will certainly pose constant challenges for the management of a common European currency,a fluctuating exchange rate need not be the optimal way to respond to these shortcomings.The argument that Europe -- even a core component of Europe -- can ill afford torenounce exchange rate flexibility rests crucially on the view that Europe is significantly moreBIS Review   109/1997
- 6 -heterogeneous than the United States and, therefore, more vulnerable to country-specific shocks thatcan best be corrected by exchange rate changes. I do not support this view. Rather, I believe that inmany respects differences among the European economies have been over-emphasized in the publicdebate.It is possible to suggest, for example, that the economies of some European countrieshave more in common today than do those of some individual states in the United States, such asNew York and Michigan or California and Idaho. Moreover, as a result of the convergence ofeconomic policy objectives, the economic cycles among many European countries have become moresynchronized over the last ten years, a trend that is likely to be reinforced by monetary unification.Furthermore, when shocks are mainly at the industry level -- for instance, when a recession hits theautomobile or steel industry in Germany and France -- the German and French economies wouldhardly benefit from an exchange rate change. Such a change, in this case, simply would not affect theappropriate relative prices.By contrast, American policymakers might have found it helpful to devalue the dollarin Texas when oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s or the dollar in New England at the end of thedefense-led growth of the late 1980s. These options, however, simply were not available. Inretrospect, it was the discipline fostered by the absence of the opportunity to alter regional exchangerates that forced our firms, local governments, and workers to reorganize, become more efficient, andgrow in what are now some of the most productive areas of the United States.Similarly, if national labor markets in Europe become more flexible and efficient inthe presence of a common currency and firms learn to count only on their own resources -- with nohelp from an occasional exchange rate adjustment -- European capital and labor markets maythemselves become more integrated. And if greater integration of labor markets can only proceedslowly -- given persistent and unavoidable cultural and language differences -- this need not be thecase for financial markets, where the disappearance of exchange rate risk will cause capital to movein response to interest rate differentials of only a very few percentage points.In this context, I would like to make clear that I do not view as ideal the U.S. modelwhere the burden of recessions tends to fall heavily on the shoulders of workers, who may be obligedto move across regions and industries in response to the business cycle. How to deal with the realityof the business cycle is an area where Europe -- with its tradition of social safety nets -- and theUnited States -- with its tradition of flexible work arrangements -- can perhaps learn something fromeach other. To date, neither of us seems yet to have found the optimal way to cope with theunavoidable reality of the business cycle to enable us to avoid both high unemployment rates and tooskewed a distribution of income.My last general observation about the implications of EMU for the United States hasto do with the dramatic changes in macroeconomic policies that will accompany the creation ofmonetary union in Europe. Naturally, the main change will concern monetary policy, and it is in thisarea that the similarities between Europe and the United States will ultimately be the greatest.The first similarity is that, with EMU, the formulation of monetary policy in bothEurope and the United States will be highly centralized and the European central bank will enjoy, asthe Federal Reserve does, a considerable degree of independence. These institutional features willreduce the scope for national governments to bend monetary policy to the needs of their country’sbusiness cycle and will help keep the focus of the European central bank on the objective of pricestability.The second similarity we may expect to see between Europe and the United States isthat, with EMU, external considerations -- such as the trade balance or the value of the exchangeBIS Review   109/1997
rate -- will over time impinge less and less on the conduct of monetary policy, as now is the case inthe United States. Once monetary union is in place for all 15 countries, the openness of Europe’sunified economy -- as measured, for example, by the share of exports in relation to GDP -- is likely tobe quite similar to that of the U.S. economy, on the order of 10 percent.While the conduct of monetary policy in Europe may increasingly resemble that in theUnited States, the conduct of fiscal policy will continue to differ significantly in the two regions,largely reflecting the different paths Europe and the United States have taken to monetary unification.In the United States, political union came well ahead of a common monetary policy. The FederalReserve was not created until 1913, when political unification had been long in place. The situationis, of course, quite different in Europe, where EMU member countries plan to retain substantialpolitical and fiscal independence.Despite this independence, EMU may well foster fiscal coordination among themember countries. This may happen in part because the EMU countries have chosen to subscribe to aset of common guidelines on the magnitude of their fiscal deficits, and in part because these countrieswill compete for a common pool of savings in an integrated capital market.The prospect of market-based discipline on the fiscal policies pursued by the EMUcountries is not so different from the situation faced by individual states and municipalities in theUnited States. The need for these entities to tap a common capital market to finance their deficitsplaces their actions under a stricter market test than they would face if they could rely mainly oncaptive local savings. The municipal bond market in the United States is today a very active andcompetitive market, where yield differences on public debt reflect investors’ perceptions of defaultrisk, and inefficient state and local administrations are quickly penalized for fiscal profligacy.Similar markets are likely to evolve in Europe after 1999. In fact, the major ratingagencies are already planning for European issues of government debt following the creation ofEMU. By all accounts, the agencies expect these ratings to mirror those currently assigned tocountries’ foreign currency debt, with fiscal factors driving rating changes once EMU is well underway.As I hope I have made clear in my remarks this evening, we in the United States, aselsewhere, have been observing the progress toward monetary unification in Europe with greatinterest. In the process, I think we have learned to appreciate the complexity of this enormousundertaking. One conclusion I have drawn from my observations over the years is that many of thereforms Europe is pursuing on its path to monetary unification -- including fiscal stabilization, taxharmonization, welfare and labor market reform, trade liberalization, and capital market integration --are goals that are worth pursuing in their own right and for which EMU provides a consistent frameof reference.Continued progress toward furthering these broad-based goals is in the interest notonly of Europe but also of the United States. There can be no question that the United States hasbenefited greatly in the past two decades from Europe’s deepening integration. Europe has provided asteady opening of markets for American products and served as a source of an increasingly efficientsupply of goods to U.S. households and firms. Europe’s growing participation in international capitalmarkets, which a successful EMU and a strong euro are intended to further, has also encouraged anincreasing flow of savings between Europe and the United States in response to changingmacroeconomic conditions in our two regions. We in the United States have much at stake inEurope’s and EMU’s future and we stand ready to work with you and support you in the furtheranceof your historic efforts.BIS Review   109/1997
Mr. Brash looks at the implications of the global financial marketplace forNew Zealand    Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. DonaldBrash, to the Single Financial Services Market Conference in Wellington, on 19/11/97.IntroductionIt’s a great pleasure to be here today to share some thoughts with you on theglobal financial marketplace, and its implications for New Zealand. We have recently had adramatic example of how events in one country can spread rapidly. The recent share marketcollapse that began in Hong Kong and spread to equity markets around the world, includingNew Zealand, illustrates just how integrated global financial markets have become. Designingand implementing an effective financial policy in pursuit of national goals, in a world of highlyintegrated capital markets, is one of the most topical and challenging tasks in central bankingtoday.To keep my presentation today within manageable bounds, and reflecting myprofessional interest, I will constrain my comments to one of the important functions of a centralbank, namely, the preservation of stability in the financial system. Our focus at the ReserveBank is on promoting the maintenance of a sound and efficient financial system in New Zealand.This focus involves establishing a policy environment to counteract the possibility of contagiousspread of financial distress, and in particular is aimed at encouraging prudent bank behaviour.I will begin by sketching out some of the key trends in global finance, and willthen describe the international regulatory response to these developments. Along the way, I willtease out the implications for New Zealand, and test our approach to banking supervision againstthese global developments. I will conclude with some crystal ball gazing.Trends in the global financial marketplaceLet me begin then with some observations on the rapidly changing globalfinancial marketplace.It is now a commonplace that barriers between countries and financial markets, atleast in developed countries, have largely disappeared, and this fact, together with newtechnologies, new financial instruments and new funding techniques, means that financialintermediation is increasingly global.Fundamental to this trend has been the way in which advances in computer andcommunications technology have reduced the costs of cross-border transactions by lowering thecosts of collecting and analysing data, undertaking transactions, clearing and settling paymentsand monitoring financial flows. And the cost reductions have been very dramatic. A recentarticle in The Economist noted that “the cost of a three-minute telephone call between Londonand New York has fallen from US$300 (in 1996 dollars) in 1930 to US$1 today”. The samearticle stated that “the cost of computer processing power has been falling by an average of30 percent a year in real terms over the past couple of decades”. Such trends allow both the usersof financial services and financial institutions themselves to look to global solutions to meettheir financial needs. Funds can now be raised and invested, currencies exchanged, and financialrisk positions changed around the world at almost anytime.BIS Review   108/1997
- 2 -Contributing to the globalisation of finance has been the rapid trend towardsfinancial market liberalisation. This has seen country after country freeing up their financialsystem. In that process, exchange controls (that had been intended to isolate domestic marketsfrom global influences) have been dismantled. In the increasingly integrated global capitalmarket that has resulted, global financial firms with often complex financial and corporatestructures have emerged as dominant players. These firms are to be found operating around theglobe -- relatively low transaction costs and the application of new technologies allow suchfirms to be active players in whichever of the world’s financial markets they want to participatein. Distinctions between different types of financial institutions are breaking down as a result ofthe growth of these conglomerate structures, the relaxation in regulatory constraints, and the wayin which derivatives can be used to transform the risk characteristics of institutions’ portfolios.A related development is that the risk management practices of global financialfirms are becoming increasingly centralised as competitive pressures drive financialorganisations seeking the highest risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. With the processingpower of modern computers, it is now possible for the risk and return characteristics of large andcomplex portfolios to be managed centrally and, if not real time, at least on an intra-day basis.Virtually all large bank holding companies are now operated and managed as integrated units.This trend towards centralised risk management raises some fundamental policy issues as to howbest to regulate and supervise such large and complex banking organisations.Product innovation has gone hand in hand with liberalisation. One of the moresignificant developments has been the emergence of derivatives such as financial futures, swapsand options. The total risk of more traditional financial products has been broken intocomponent parts and repackaged into synthetic products that have risk profiles similar to otherfinancial instruments. The synthetic products can then be sold to those domestic and globalinvestors willing and able to bear the associated risks. Such products are now used extensivelythroughout the world to help firms manage the exposure to interest rate and exchange ratemovements that occur in liberalised financial markets. And innovation is ongoing, as is evidentwith the increasing application of derivatives to credit risk.The rapid globalisation of finance is well illustrated by the phenomenal growth incross-border financial activity. An April 1995 survey by the Bank for International Settlementsestimated that an average of US$1.2 trillion flowed through the world’s foreign exchangemarkets each day, up 45% on three years earlier. Estimated turnover of over-the-counterderivatives on an average day was US$880 billion, 70% of which involved transactions withcounterparties in different countries. An article in Institutional Investor in August 1997 providesanother illustration of the magnitude of cross-border finance -- “nearly US$150 billion of netnew private capital poured into the main Latin American and Asian economies in 1996, almostdouble the 1995 level”. These numbers are enormous however you want to look at them.New sources of systemic riskThe globalisation of finance, the liberalisation of financial markets and rapidtechnological change have opened up new opportunities in commerce for achieving economiesof scale, and facilitating the international rationalisation of production and distribution. Theresulting benefits include productivity growth and improving living standards. Innovations likederivatives improve the efficiency of financial markets. New technology allows sophisticatedBIS Review   108/1997
management information and control systems, and the application of complex analytical modelsto help institutions manage risks more effectively.But while considerable benefits flow from such developments, they alsoinevitably bring with them new risks. One of the most important from a central banker’sperspective is the introduction of new sources of risk to the stability of the financial system:•Liberalisation and globalisation bring competition, which squeezes out the rents created bypreviously protected markets. This produces efficiency gains but it also means that financialinstitutions in the new environment have less of a buffer of protected profits and aretherefore more vulnerable to distress caused by either mismanagement or misfortune.•Derivatives bring new risks in that they can expose financial institutions to greater leverage,thereby allowing for shocks to be amplified. In addition, they increase the linkages betweennational financial markets, which means that adverse events are quickly transmitted from onemarket to another.•Furthermore, market participants can now react very rapidly to a problem in a particularcountry, or even a perceived problem. Capital can move rapidly and in large volumes. Again,a disturbance in one country can now flow rapidly to other countries with the result thatother countries’ financial systems, and the international financial system more generally, arearguably more exposed to disturbance than before globalisation.In the light of these increased risks, it is worth recalling that there have beenrelatively frequent episodes of national financial instability over the past couple of decades.Since 1980, over two-thirds of IMF member countries have experienced at least one seriousbanking-sector difficulty. And, in more than 65 emerging country cases, bank losses nearly orcompletely exhausted the banking system’s capital. In more than a dozen countries in theemerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, financial collapses have requiredbudgetary expenditure of more than 10% of GDP to resolve. Some industrial countries have alsoexperienced major financial problems over the same period. The list includes the United States,Japan, France, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Spain. In Sweden, for example, 18% of bank loanswere lost between 1990 and 1993 with two of the largest banks being bailed out by the state.These and more recent episodes of bank distress, such as Mexico and Thailand, suggest thatthere is no evidence that financial sector fragility is reducing with time.While New Zealand has not experienced bank problems of the magnitude that Ihave just described, there have nevertheless been occasions of serious bank distress. In 1989-90,the Bank of New Zealand (which was government-owned at the time) had to be re-capitalisedtwice by the Government, at a total cost of about 3% of government expenditure. NZI Bankwould certainly have failed had it not been re-capitalised by its parent in Scotland. A verysignificant non-bank financial institution, the DFC, was placed in statutory management in 1989when it became insolvent.A national financial crisis can not only have a severely adverse impact on theeconomy of the country directly concerned, it may also threaten the stability of the internationalfinancial system. A recent example was Mexico in early 1995. A build up of short-term USdollar-linked debt, combined with the devaluation of the peso and a sharp rise in interest rates,undermined the solvency of most of the Mexican banking system and resulted in a liquiditycrisis. International investors shifted their claims away not just from Mexico, but also from othercountries where similar weaknesses were suspected.BIS Review   108/1997
- 4 -Instability in the international financial system can arise not only from thetransmission of a national problem but also from a breakdown in the normal functioning ofcritical financial interconnections between countries. What I have in mind here are the paymentsand settlements processes that link national financial systems. This is not a new source of risk,and the best known illustration of the problem was the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974.This small German bank was active in the foreign exchange market. It defaulted after receivingDeutsche Marks from international banks but before the matching US dollar leg was processedlater in the day. This left its counterparties exposed to the full value of the Deutsche Marksdelivered. This event severely disrupted CHIPS, the main clearing system for US dollars, led toa collapse in trading in the US dollar/Deutsche Mark market and even resulted in disorder in theinter-bank money markets. The circumstance that led to Herstatt risk is still present today,namely the time lapse between the payment and receipt of currencies in foreign exchangetransactions. What is different now is the exponential growth that has occurred in foreignexchange transactions since 1974. In the late 1990s, if a major international bank were unable tomeet its obligations in settling an average day’s foreign exchange transactions, it would haveserious ramifications for the stability of the international financial system, as well for domesticfinancial markets.Globalisation of finance to date has been most marked in wholesale business. Buttechnology in the form of the Internet is now beginning to allow for retail products to beadvertised and sold from anywhere in the world, and paid for electronically by anyone in anyother country. There seems little doubt that, when our next conference on financial services isheld, this trend to the globalisation of retail financial services will be an important theme.In any event, there is no doubt that finance is now global. Nor is there any doubtthat new sources of systemic risk have emerged from the liberalisation of financial markets,from the increased size and greater complexity of institutions, from the greater complexity ofsome of the new financial instruments, from the greater volume and speed of transactions, andfrom the increased involvement in the global financial system of national banking systems whichare themselves suffering considerable strains. It is probably fair to conclude that, while the threatof serious disruption to the international financial system remains relatively small, shouldserious disruption occur it could have disastrous consequences for living standards around theworld.Regulatory responseFaced with these new sources of risk, the objective of safeguarding the soundnessof financial systems has become a top policy priority both nationally and internationally.Most obviously, the trend towards large and complex global financial institutions,centralised risk management and the blurring of boundaries between different types of financialinstitutions is leading to a change in regulatory structures.Generalising somewhat, the traditional approach to regulating the financialindustry was for there to be a bank regulator, a securities industry regulator, an insuranceindustry regulator and so on. This decentralised approach to regulation was seen as beingappropriate when institutions were clearly delineated and decision-making was decentralised.However, in today’s world of conglomerate financial institutions where decision-making andrisk management are centralised, the traditional regulatory approach is seen as being inadequateBIS Review   108/1997
by many countries. Exposure of a bank to potential risk, for instance, cannot be evaluatedindependently of the condition and management policies of any conglomerate to which the bankbelongs.Whereas efforts have been made in some countries to co-ordinate and exchangeinformation between different kinds of supervisors, in other countries the supervisory structurehas been changed so that all financial institutions are supervised by one “umbrella-type”supervisory body. Recent developments in this direction have been seen in Australia, with theAustralian Government adopting the recommendations of the Wallis Inquiry. This will see theestablishment of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to oversee all financialinstitutions in Australia. Similarly, the new United Kingdom Government has decided toestablish a new “super-regulator” that will bring together nine financial regulators in oneorganisation.New Zealand’s regulatory approachGiven that the banking industry in New Zealand has always been dominated byforeign-owned banks, particularly from Australia and the United Kingdom, any developmentthat makes supervision of the parent bank more effective is welcomed by us. From the ReserveBank’s perspective, though, we have not seen a pressing need to change our regulatory structuresin a similar way. The reasons for this are two-fold.First, we take a rather different approach to promoting financial system stability,an approach which relies less on direct regulation and more on the use of market disciplines andthe internal incentives for banks to behave prudently (I will return to this shortly).Secondly, we see our present regulatory structure as being effective. Over recentyears, our regulatory structure has been closely aligned to a public policy approach thatrecognises that open and competitive financial markets are desirable. Within this, all of the keyareas where private sector failure may occur have been covered in a way that meets ourcircumstances. Hence, the Reserve Bank is responsible for the maintenance of the financialsystem’s soundness and efficiency, with our attention focused on the banking sector, where anysystemic problems, if they were to occur, would arise. The Commerce Commission hasresponsibility for protecting the consumer against exploitation and unfair trading. And theSecurities Commission is focused on improving the efficiency and fairness of the markets forsecurities (widely defined) of entities that raise funds in New Zealand. This approach recognisesthat in New Zealand systemic issues are central in the supervision of banks, whereas in non-bankfinancial services consumer-protection issues are more important.There has been a strong presumption in economic policy development in NewZealand over the last decade or so that market forces generally produce better outcomes thanthose arising from bureaucratic rules and regulations. Our approach to banking supervisionreflects this.We start with the presumption that financial markets contain powerful andflexible disciplinary mechanisms for rewarding good bank performance and penalisingimprudent bank behaviour. Given the widespread public belief in most countries that“governments never allow banks to fail”, we do not argue that market forces alone will do thejob, but we do see the disciplines of the market as being the dominant and most effective meansBIS Review   108/1997
- 6 -for promoting a robust financial system. There are three key elements in our market-basedapproach to banking supervision.•The first is to ensure that the marketplace has sufficient and reliable information on banks onwhich to base financial assessments and decisions. This is achieved through a publicdisclosure regime which requires banks to publish a comprehensive range of financial,corporate and risk-related information for the bank and its banking group at quarterlyintervals.•The second important element is to promote market discipline by ensuring that governmentpolicy supports, or at least does not impede, the development of active inter-bank markets,the diversification of funding instruments and sources, the development of institutionalinvestors and the entry of sophisticated foreign players to the financial market. The rationaleis that professional players are the market’s strongest disciplinary force.•The third key element has been to strengthen the incentives for the directors andmanagement of banks to manage their banks’ affairs in a sound and responsible manner. Animportant aspect of this is a requirement for the directors of banks to attest to the accuracy ofthe information in the quarterly disclosure statements, to the fact that their banks havesatisfactory risk management policies and to the fact that these are being properly applied.This approach, of harnessing market forces and using improved internalgovernance to promote financial system soundness, is gaining some support in the internationalsupervisory community, and among academics. This can be highlighted by recent commentsfrom three prominent and highly respected individuals.•“As financial transactions become increasingly rapid and complex, I believe we have nochoice but to harness market forces, as best we can, to reinforce our supervisory objectives.The appeal of market-led discipline lies not only in its cost effectiveness and flexibility, butalso in its limited intrusiveness and its greater adaptability to changing financialenvironments. Measures to enhance market discipline involve providing private investors theincentives and the means to reward good bank performance and penalise poor performance.Expanded risk management disclosures by financial institutions is a significant step in thisdirection.” Alan Greenspan, May 1997.1•“For major banks in industrial countries ..... there needs to be a shift of emphasis towards there-inforcement of internal managerial risk-control mechanisms, and a recasting of the natureand functions of external regulation, away from generalised rule-setting and towardsestablishing incentives/sanctions which reinforce such internal control mechanisms.” CharlesGoodhart, June 1997.2•“Much recent thinking has focused on incentive-compatible regulation -- using the market’sown internal forces -- as the promising next step for strengthening the financial system. It is                                                  1  Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr Alan Greenspan, atthe Conference on Bank Structure and Competition of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on 1 May 1997.2  From “Financial Regulation: Why, How and Where Now?” Charles A.E.

banks’ shareholders and management that have the strongest interest to measure riskaccurately.” Andrew Crockett, September 1997.3To illustrate the evolution that is taking place in supervision, let me cite oneexample. In a recent initiative by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision to amend theCapital Accord to include market risk, a greater role has been given to banks’ own internalmodels in the measurement of market risk. This reflects a move away from regulation that relieson detailed rules to an approach that places more emphasis on the adequacy of internal riskcontrol mechanisms. Such an approach recognises that it is bank directors and management thathave the strongest interest and ability to measure risk accurately, and that an internally-generatedmeasure of risk should be better than one derived from that imposed by supervisors. Theongoing challenge to regulators is to ensure that incentive structures are conducive to thisoutcome.My own perspective is that a paradigm shift in supervision towards harnessingmarket forces will make a more significant contribution to promoting sound and efficientfinancial systems than simply changing regulatory structures within the same external regulationparadigm.Although it is far too early to make conclusive assessments of the success orotherwise of our new supervisory approach (which has now been in operation for nearly twoyears), I am satisfied that it is encouraging prudent behaviour by banks in New Zealand, andthereby is reducing the likelihood of financial system instability in the future. Moreover, I amconfident that it is doing this at lower efficiency, compliance and taxpayer costs than othersupervisory options might be expected to achieve.Payments system reformSo far, I have discussed the regulatory response to the globalisation of finance interms of the health of the individual institutions that make up the financial system. Of equalsignificance to financial stability in this new environment is how resilient payment andsettlement systems are, both domestically and internationally.In common with most central banks around the world, we have been devotingconsiderable attention to payments system reform. Our main focus to date has been developing areal time gross settlement system for large-value transactions between banks. Until quiterecently, the standard form of settlement was end-of-day net settlement: all payments andreceipts between banks were allowed to accumulate during the day, to be settled by transfer ofthe very much smaller net amount at the end of the day. The risk of this form of settlement isthat it usually requires participants to grant unsecured and unlimited credit to other participantsduring the period until final settlement occurs. Credit extended to a single counterparty can insome cases exceed a bank’s entire capital. One important solution which has been implementedin some countries, and which we have as a high priority to implement within the next fewmonths in New Zealand, is the replacement of this traditional end-of-day settlement arrangementwith an RTGS system. Individual transactions under RTGS are settled one-by-one during theday rather than being allowed to accumulate, thereby removing the very large exposures that can                                                  3  Speech by the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr Andrew Crockett, at the Money,Macro and Finance Conference held in Durham on 11 September 1997.BIS Review   108/1997
- 8 -build up between banks. Once implemented, RTGS will be a significant milestone in thereduction of domestic payment system risks.Another important initiative that we are promoting to reduce systemic risk is tomake bilateral and multilateral netting arrangements for certain transactions legally binding.With legally enforceable netting arrangements in place, the various “gross” obligations to makepayments can be offset against one another, and it is only the net amounts due which are calledinto question in the event of a bank failure.Our attention is also being actively focused on dealing with settlement risk incross-border foreign exchange transactions. As already noted, the value of foreign exchangedeals that are now being settled is so substantial that the resulting settlement risks can be of asize to cause systemic concern for both national and international financial systems. This risk,mentioned earlier in my presentation, is often referred to as Herstatt risk. As in New Zealand,much international attention is currently being focused on this problem.Co-operation amongst supervisorsMy final comments on the response of regulators to global financial trendsconcern the co-operation among supervisors and international agencies to address the potentialfor systemic disruption.These efforts have gained momentum over the last decade as the inherent tensionbetween nationally-based regulatory structures and an increasingly globalised financial sectorhas become apparent. Co-operation among bank supervisors under the auspices of the BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision has produced a number of important agreements on thesupervision of banks, including minimum capital standards and minimum standards governingthe supervision of banks’ cross-border establishments. Similarly other supervisors, such as theInternational Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the InternationalAssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), have pursued co-operation in their areas ofresponsibility. And in the early 1990s, in recognition of the emergence and growth of financialconglomerates, banking, securities and insurance supervisors from G-10 countries began to worktogether to identify problems that conglomerates can cause and to consider ways to overcomethem.The Mexican crisis in 1995 in particular, and the widespread incidence and highcost of banking problems more generally, have prompted calls for concerted international actionto promote the soundness of financial systems. These calls have strengthened over the lastcouple of years with the G-7 countries calling for “the adoption of strong prudential standards inemerging countries” and encouraging the international financial institutions to “increase theirefforts to promote effective supervisory structures in these economies”. The Basle Committee onBanking Supervision has been at the forefront of this effort over the past year with the release ofits Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. These principles have quickly become thefocal point for the increased efforts to strengthen financial sectors around the world. Also aimingat more effective bank supervision, the IMF is making the evaluation of financial supervisionand regulation part of its annual country reviews, and the World Bank is emphasising thestrengthening of financial infrastructure as an important part of its structural assistanceprogrammes.BIS Review   108/1997
A comment on the international supervisory responseWhile the international regulatory response has many positive elements, to me ithas not always been appropriately focused. Often following a crisis, there are calls to“strengthen supervision”. For various reasons, I feel that these calls, or the ways in which theyhave been answered, have not always been well directed. Let me briefly elaborate on why I thinkthis.At both the national and the international levels, the nature of the policy responseto a crisis needs to be based on a careful analysis of the “problem”. It is certainly clear from therecord that there have been significant weaknesses in some countries’ banking systems, and thatthese weaknesses have both contributed to the emergence and severity of financial crises andcomplicated the task of resolving them. However, I am somewhat sceptical of the generalproposition that “poor supervision” has been the primary cause of these weaknesses. There hasbeen a tendency to give supervision the “blame” for problems which have originated elsewhere,and/or to seek supervisory remedies for problems which might well be better solved in otherways. I would note further that “supervision” (in its general sense) has sometimes been part ofthe “problem” rather than part of the “solution” -- particularly when it has involved excessiveforbearance by the regulatory authorities, and/or excessive reliance on the public safety net. Ithink it important that we supervisors should be appropriately modest about what we canachieve, and supervision should not be seen as an assured remedy for all potential problems.Establishing price stability and a sustainable fiscal position are also criticalelements in the pursuit of sound financial systems. While weakness in the financial system canhave macroeconomic implications, the reverse is also undoubtedly true -- unsoundmacroeconomic policies can have long-lasting effects that lead to weakness in financial systems.Excessive credit creation and inflation are obvious examples. Some observers have suggestedthat virtually every major financial system problem in the last two or three decades was caused,directly or indirectly, by unsound macroeconomic policies.Some of the international regulatory responses also do not sufficiently recognisethat the objectives of bank supervision, and the infrastructure within which supervision takesplace (for example, the quality of company law, accounting standards, and external auditors), arenot the same in all countries. To have any chance of being successful, international initiativeswill need to be flexible enough to suit this wide variety of national circumstances.For emerging countries where the banking infrastructure may not be welldeveloped, it may well be sensible to actively pursue financial stability through improving thequality of prescriptive rules. In this regard, the initiative by the Basle Committee to establish aninternational standard of core principles for effective supervision may be helpful.But regulators in many developed countries are finding that the complexity ofbanking, the blurring of functional dividing lines amongst financial institutions, globalisation,and the speed of portfolio adjustment are making external regulation based on standard rules lesseffective and less feasible. This is resulting in an increasing emphasis being placed on internalrisk management processes and in harnessing market disciplines to promote prudent bankingbehaviour.What this suggests to me is that the regulatory approach followed by a particularcountry will need to fully reflect its own circumstances. Attempting to apply a “one-size-fits-all”approach to all countries is likely to be ineffective, and may even be counterproductive.BIS Review   108/1997
- 10 -The FutureSo, what do I see as being the likely issues of the future? What is certain is thatthe future will surprise us! But some things seem likely.Innovation in the financial sector will continue, as will the integration of theworld’s financial markets. Using market disciplines to strengthen the financial system also seemslikely to grow in relative importance.New Zealand’s approach to promoting financial system stability is entirelyconsistent with the global trends that I have described and, in particular, with the“incentive-compatible” approach to regulation. It seems absolutely appropriate for ourcircumstances. There will inevitably need to be refinements made to our regulatory approachfrom time to time, but I believe that the principles on which it has been established, and its basicdesign, are soundly based and will remain so for the foreseeable future.At some point in the future the “special” status of banks in the New Zealandsupervisory approach may need to be reassessed. This might be prompted by the continuedgradual breaking down of the traditional distinction between banks and non-banks in financialintermediation, or perhaps by banking services being provided in New Zealand by institutionsnot physically located here. It may also be prompted by a risk-proofing of payments andsettlements systems that effectively prevents the problems of one bank contagiously spreading toothers. Concerns about financial system stability might ultimately be best addressed bydesigning a supervisory framework that is focused on those systems themselves rather than onthe main institutions. For the foreseeable future, though, concerns about financial systemsoundness in New Zealand are likely to continue to be focused on the banking system, as it ishere that systemic risks are likely to remain concentrated.BIS Review   108/1997

- 2 -•The third common denominator of the Asean crisis has been the failure on the part of theauthorities to ensure that their financial sectors were strong enough to deal with a volatile cycle.There was neither adequate prudential supervision nor adequate financial disclosure by localfinancial institutions.”Despite all the good macroeconomic management in these countries, they failed inpursuing the basic elements of sound monetary and financial controls. They did not control thegrowth in the money supply; they did not check excessive growth in bank credit extension; they triedto maintain unrealistic interest and exchange rates, and they allowed the quality of their banking andfinancial systems to deteriorate.There was a time when countries could get away with this type of easy money and laxfinancial policies. But that was when countries were more isolated and when national policiesdifferent from international norms and standards, could still be pursued within economies shieldedfrom international competition through excessive, protective government controls. But theglobalisation of the past decade, and the integration of the world financial markets, created a newsituation where even the smaller countries of the world are now subjected to the universal disciplinesof integrated financial markets.2. The South African experience with the international financial marketsWhat happened recently in the East Asian countries is not a new experience. TheMexicans and a number of South American economies were similarly affected late in 1994 and in thefirst half of 1995. South Africa and a few countries in Central Europe, for example the CzechRepublic, were tested in 1996. Some of these countries are only now recovering from the afflictions,others are still going through the process of painful correction.South Africa was not excluded from the new game of global market participation. InFebruary 1996, the international financial markets threw down the gauntlet when the rand came underpressure and painful macro-economic adjustments were forced on the country. At the time, certainpolitical developments in South Africa, supported by unfounded rumours about the health ofPresident Mandela and resignations in the public sector, may have triggered the speculation againstthe rand. With the advantage of hindsight, it is now clear that various unfavourable developments inthe South African economy over the preceding two years justified the forceful action of theinternational financial markets.Firstly, during 1994 and 1995, real gross domestic expenditure in South Africa grewby about 6 per cent per year, and gross domestic product by about 3 per cent. It stands to reason thatthis kind of disequilibrium growth could not be sustained for too long. Either production had to bestepped up, or expenditure curtailed. No country can consume more than it produces for ever. Theinternational financial markets brought this message home to South Africa very clearly in 1996.Secondly, the disequilibrium in overall domestic real economic activity affecteddevelopments in the current account of the balance of payments over this period. In value terms, totalimports of merchandise rose by about 28 per cent during each of 1994 and 1995, whereas exports ofmerchandise increased by only 3 per cent in 1994 and by 16 per cent in 1995. At the same time, netgold exports declined by 8 per cent per year. The current account of the balance of paymentstherefore switched from a surplus of R6 billion in 1993 to deficits of R1.2 billion in 1994 and R10.2billion in 1995. During the second quarter of 1996, the seasonally adjusted annualised rate of thecurrent account deficit increased to R13 billion. With a low level of foreign reserves and a process ofgradually removing exchange controls, South Africa became very dependent on a continuous largeBIS Review   107/1997
- 3 -capital inflow from the rest of the world. When this capital inflow disappeared in the second quarterof 1996, a painful downward adjustment in the economy became inevitable.Thirdly, the increase in real domestic economic activity, and particularly in grossdomestic expenditure, was financed to an important extent by large increases in bank credit extensionand the creation of additional money. In both 1993 and 1994, total bank credit extended to the privatesector increased by more than 17 per cent, and the M3 money supply by more than 15 per cent. Thiswas clearly excessive in an environment of real economic growth of 3 per cent (measured from theproduction side), or 6 per cent (from the expenditure side).The message signalled by the international financial markets to South Africa in 1996therefore was to restore macroeconomic equilibrium and to come to live within the means of its ownproduction capacity, or to lift the production potential permanently to a higher level. South Africatook on the challenge both ways. The financial policy reaction was:•to let the exchange rate depreciate to a level that would satisfy the markets in respect of theirexpectations of future sustainability. The rand depreciated by 23.2 per cent from 15 February1996 up to 31 October 1996;•to let the outflow of foreign currency payments related to the overall balance of payments deficitdrain domestic liquidity from the South African banking sector. In the process, the average dailyamount of the money market shortage increased from R4.9 billion in January 1996 to R10.6billion in March 1997;•to allow interest rates to adjust to underlying conditions and to reflect the shortage of funds thatdeveloped in the markets. Interest rates indeed already started moving up during the course of1994/95 under the pressure of the increasing domestic demand for loanable funds. The rate onthree months bankers’ acceptances, for example, rose from 10.15 per cent at the end of 1993 to12.50 per cent at the end of 1994, 14.60 per cent at the end of 1995 and 17.00 per cent at the endof 1996. In line with these movements, the Reserve Bank raised its Bank rate in five steps from12 per cent at the end of 1993 to 17 per cent in November 1996;•a rise in the rate of inflation became inevitable after the depreciation of the rand in 1996. Theauthorities nevertheless adopted a restrictive monetary policy stance to ensure that the adjustmentin relative prices of tradable and non-tradable goods would not perpetuate into a long-lasting newera of high inflation. The rate of increase in consumer prices rose from 5.5 per cent over thetwelve months up to April 1996, to 9.9 per cent in April 1997.The Government’s response to the other part of the challenge, that is to raise theproduction capacity of the South African economy permanently to a higher level, was provided withthe publication of the Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution(GEAR). This economic structural adjustment programme will obviously take a longer time toproduce results than the shorter-term measures introduced last year to restore business cycleequilibrium by restricting growth in demand.3. Economic consolidation in 1997The economic consolidation process forced on South Africa by the events of February1996 provided satisfying results so far in 1997. The international financial markets already signalledtheir satisfaction in November 1996, when stability returned to the market in foreign exchange, theoutflow of capital through the balance of payments receded, and the exchange rate recovered some ofits losses earlier last year.BIS Review   107/1997
- 4 -After the middle of 1996, there was a substantial slow-down in the rate of expansionin gross domestic expenditure. In the second half of 1996 and during the first quarter of 1997, totalgross domestic expenditure actually declined at an annualised rate of about 2 per cent, before growthwas resumed again in the second quarter of 1997. The growth rate in production unfortunately alsoslowed down marginally but at this stage better equilibrium has now been restored between these twobasic macroeconomic activities.The current account of the balance of payments also improved as the rate of growth inimports slowed down. In the second quarter of 1997, the seasonally-adjusted, annualised currentaccount deficit amounted to only R3.4 billion.In addition, although adjusting only very slowly, the rates of increase in both bankcredit extension and in the money supply have slowed down since the middle of 1997. Measured overa twelve months’ period, the total amount of bank credit extended to the private sector still rose by14.6 per cent in August 1997. However, over the three-month period from June to August 1997, theseasonally adjusted annualised rate of growth in the total amount of bank credit extended to theprivate sector declined to 5.9 per cent. Over the same period, the rate of increase in M3 slowed downto 11.4 per cent on an annualised basis.Finally, inflation, which threatened to run out of control earlier this year, also abatedand, after peaking at 9.9 per cent in April 1997, the rate of increase in consumer prices slowed downto 8 per cent over the twelve months that ended in September 1997.The international financial markets confirmed approval for these macroeconomicadjustments that were achieved, not without pain, but with a substantial improvement in the basicfundamentals. Over the first nine months of 1997, non-residents increased their holdings of SouthAfrican bonds and equities by no less than R39.1 billion which enabled South Africa to continue withthe process of removing exchange controls, and also to increase its foreign reserves. The grossamount of gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank increased by R16.2 billionfrom 31 December 1996 to R26.5 billion at the end of September 1997.The improved underlying conditions were also reflected in a decline in interest rates.As the overall money market situation eased and the Reserve Bank acquiesced in a gradual decline inthe money market shortage to an average daily amount of only R4.5 billion in the first three weeks ofOctober, money market interest rates moved downwards. The rate on three months’ bankersacceptances gradually declined from 17.00 per cent at the end of 1996 to 14.25 per cent last week.The Reserve Bank endorsed these movements in the underlying financial aggregatesby reducing the Bank rate from 17 to 16 per cent on 20 October 1997.4. The role of monetary policy in the adjustment processAs the globalisation process progresses, financial markets, and particularly those ofthe smaller economies, lose some of their independence. In these countries, the task of central banksbecomes more difficult. They can no longer follow an independent monetary policy that will pleasepoliticians or internal pressure groups, but must learn to understand to respect and to respond tointernational market pressures.In most of the countries referred to above, international economic disciplines weretransmitted to domestic economies through financial markets. Adjustments in exchange rates, interestrates and financial asset prices provided the main transmission mechanism used by the markets toBIS Review   107/1997
- 5 -force the disciplines of the international markets on central banks and governments. As with the EastAsian countries, excessive increases in bank credit extension and in the money supply, and unrealisticinterest and exchange rates, or unacceptable fiscal deficits, were severely punished.South Africa will have to learn to live with, and to adapt to, these market disciplines.This country can not on a permanent basis maintain lower interest rates than those ruling in most ofthe other emerging markets. Our inflation rate will have to be reduced to come more in line with theaverage rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners and international competitors.There is no magic formula to determine what the level of the exchange rate or interestrates should be on any particular day in South Africa. The world financial markets are too volatile,changes too erratic and unpredictable, and economic models based on past experiences unreliable.Against this background, monetary policy decisions must of necessity often be based more ondiscretion, and less on pre-established rules. This makes short-term forecasting of financialdevelopments even more difficult, if not impossible.In this environment, it is important to have flexible markets that will emitunderstandable signals to all the participants in the economy, including the monetary policyauthorities. Or even better, to have markets that can be trusted to determine prices with a minimum ofgovernment intervention.5. Prospects for the South African economyNow that the consolidation process in the South African economy has been achievedwith some success, the basis has been laid for a new phase of steady and, hopefully, more sustainablegrowth. In the sphere of real economic activity, some scope has been created for higher growth inboth production and expenditure. It will, of course, be good for future development if any increase inexpenditure at this juncture could be concentrated in fixed investment rather than in private sector orgovernment consumption expenditure.The South African balance of payments remains vulnerable and dependent upon asustained inflow of capital from the rest of the world. We must continue to nurture the confidence ofall potential foreign investors, and particularly of the long-term investors who are prepared toparticipate directly in real economic activity. Without foreign capital inflows, any recovery indomestic economic activity will be short-lived.Finally, the short-term consolidation process in the financial sector has not yetreached its final and acceptable destination. International financial markets observe the still relativelyhigh rates of expansion in bank credit extension and in the money supply, the above average-rate ofinflation, and the growing indebtedness of particular private individuals with circumspection.Provided we can continue with the process of also improving equilibrium in the financial markets, theprospects are good for a better overall economic performance next year.In the longer term, economic growth at a suitably high level will, however, onlybecome possible once the more fundamental economic reforms envisaged in GEAR have beenimplemented. The restoration of business cycle stability in the short-term was an importantprecondition for a revival of economic development, but it also paves the way for a more determinedeffort by all of us over the next few years to raise the overall production capacity of the economy on apermanent basis to a higher level.BIS Review   107/1997
Mr. Greenspan’s remarks at the Center for Financial Studies in FrankfurtRemarks by the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at theCenter for Financial Studies in Frankfurt-am-Main, on 7/11/97.The remarkable progress that has been made by virtually all of the major industrialcountries in achieving low rates of inflation in recent years has brought into sharper focus the issue ofprice measurement. As we move closer to price stability, the necessity of measuring prices accurately hasbecome an especial challenge. Biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter wheninflation is high. They do matter when, as now, a debate has emerged over whether our economies aremoving toward price deflation.In today’s advanced economies, allocative decisions are primarily made not bygovernments but by markets, and the central guide to the efficient allocation of resources in a marketeconomy is prices. Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions ofconsumers and producers, directing resources toward their highest valued use. Of course, this signalingprocess would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure individual andaggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overallefficiency of the market economy. Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before governmentagencies were established to measure prices.Nonetheless, in a modern monetary economy, accurate price measurement is ofconsiderable importance, increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financialstability. Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments, not onlyinvolving inflation but also involving real output and productivity. If the general price level is estimatedto be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in realoutput and productivity. Real incomes and living standards are rising faster than our published datasuggest. Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of ourpublished price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences. Clearly,central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designedto promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. Moreover, many economictransactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index,most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a publishedprice index may nevertheless take such an index into account less formally. If the price index is notaccurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economictransactions will be skewed.The measured price indexes have played an especially prominent role in Germany, bothin terms of public perceptions of inflation performance and as a guide for policymakers. TheBundesbank’s long-standing commitment to price stability and the public’s support for that commitmentderive at least to some extent from Germany’s experiences with hyperinflation earlier this century. Giventhis experience with the devastation that such inflation can bring to the economy and to people’s lives, itcomes as no surprise that your public and your policymakers give such careful scrutiny to the availablemeasures of inflation. Germany has a reputation for special vigilance in guarding the stability of the pricelevel and has achieved an admirable record of success in maintaining low inflation over the postwarperiod. From the standpoint of monetary policy, this very success makes accurate price measurement allthe more important. When measured inflation is high, we can be confident that the proper direction ofmonetary policy is to bring inflation lower. But when measured inflation is low, the proper direction ofmonetary policy, as I indicated, could depend crucially on the accuracy of those measurements.The importance of accurate price measurement was particularly apparent duringunification, when it became necessary to gauge productivity in East and West Germany on a comparablebasis. Initial estimates of East German productivity relative to that of the West were considerably higherthan later, more accurate estimates showed to be the case. These differences, we are told, owed largely toBIS Review   106/1997
- 2 -the difficulties in adjusting the prices of East German products to take into account that they were, onaverage, of lower quality than the equivalent items produced in the West.In thinking about the problems of price measurement, a distinction must be madebetween the measurement of individual prices, on the one hand, and the aggregation of those prices intoindexes of the overall price level, on the other. The notion of what we mean by a general price level -- ormore relevantly, its change -- is never unambiguously defined. Moreover, in practice, aggregation can becomplicated because standard price indexes frequently assume that individuals and businesses purchasethe same basket of goods and services over time -- whereas, in fact, people substitute some goods forothers when relative prices change and as new goods are introduced. How one aggregates individualprices, of course, depends on the purpose of the measure. Still, the problems of aggregation are wellunderstood by economists, and workable solutions are within reach. Many countries have made progressin utilizing aggregation formulas that do take into account product substitutions, and further progress inthis area seems likely in the years ahead.It is the measurement of individual prices, not the aggregation of those prices, that is sodifficult conceptually. At first glance, observing and measuring prices might not appear especiallydaunting. After all, prices are at the center of virtually all economic transactions. But, in fact, the problemis extraordinarily complex. To be sure, the nominal value -- in dollars or Deutsche Marks, forexample -- of most transactions is unambiguously exact and, at least in principle, is amenable to highlyaccurate estimation by our statistical agencies. But dividing that nominal value change into componentsrepresenting changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is toremain constant over time. Defining such a constant-quality unit of output is the central conceptualdifficulty in price measurement.Such a definition may be clear for unalloyed aluminium ingot of 99.7 percent purity forthe vast proportion of transactions; consequently, its price can be compared over time with a degree ofprecision adequate for virtually all producers and consumers of aluminium ingot. Similarly, the prices ofa ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or of a linear meter of cotton broad woven fabric, can be reasonablycompared over a period of years.But when the characteristics of products and services are changing rapidly, defining theunit of output, and thereby adjusting an item’s price for improvements in quality, can be exceptionallydifficult. These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as service prices, which aregenerally more difficult to measure, become more prominent in aggregate price measures. One does nothave to look to the most advanced technology to recognize the difficulties that are faced. To take just afew examples, automobile tires, refrigerators, winter jackets, and tennis rackets have all changed in waysthat make them surprisingly hard to compare to their counterparts of twenty or thirty years ago.The continual introduction of new goods and services onto the markets creates specialchallenges for price measurement. In some cases, a new good may best be viewed as an improved versionof an old good. But, in many cases, new products may deliver services that simply were not availablebefore. When personal computers were first introduced, the benefits they brought households in terms ofword processing services, financial calculations, organizational assistance, and the like, were trulyunique. The introduction of heart bypass operations literally prolonged many lives by decades. And,further in the past, think of the revolutionary changes that automobile ownership, or jet travel, brought topeople’s lives. In theory, economists understand how to value such innovations; in practice, it is anenormous challenge to construct such an estimate with any precision.The area of medical care, where technology is changing in ways that make techniques ofonly a decade ago seem archaic, provides some particularly striking illustrations of the difficultiesinvolved in measuring quality-adjusted prices. Cures and preventive treatments have become availablefor previously untreatable diseases. Medical advances have led to new treatments that are more effectiveand that have increased the speed and comfort of recovery. In an area with such rapid technologicalchange, what is the appropriate unit of output? Is it a procedure, a treatment, or a cure? How does oneBIS Review   106/1997
- 3 -value the benefit to the patient when a condition that once required a complicated operation and a lengthystay in the hospital now can be easily treated on an outpatient basis?Although there is considerable uncertainty, the pace of change and the shift towardoutput that is difficult to measure are more likely to quicken than to slow down. How, then, will wemeasure inflation in the future if our measurement techniques become increasingly obsolete? We mustkeep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.Embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to those whobuy and sell the product if not to the outside observer. A company that pays a sum of money forcomputer software knows what it is buying, and at least has an idea about its value relative to software ithas purchased in the past, and relative to other possible uses for that sum of money in the present.Furthermore, so long as people continue to exchange nominal interest rate debtinstruments and contract for future payments in terms of dollars or other currencies, there must be apresumption about the future purchasing power of money no matter how complex individual productsbecome. Market participants do have a sense of the aggregate price level and how they expect it tochange over time, and these views must be embedded in the value of financial assets.The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds, while providing us with useful information,does not solve the problem of ascertaining an economically meaningful measure of the general pricelevel. By necessity, the total return on indexed bonds must be tied to forecasts of specific published priceindexes, which may or may not reflect the market’s judgement of the future purchasing power of money.To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction.Moreover, we are, as yet, unable to separate compensation for inflation risk from compensation forexpected inflation.Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analyticaltechniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision. In thosecircumstances, then -- at least for purposes of monetary policy -- these measures could obviate the moretraditional approaches to aggregate price measurement now employed. They may help us understand, forexample, whether markets perceive the true change in aggregate prices to reflect fixed or variable weightindexes of the components or whether arithmetic or logarithmic weighting of the components is moreappropriate.But, for the foreseeable future, we shall have to rely on our statistical agencies to producethe price data necessary to assess economic performance and to make economic policy. In that regard,assuming further advances in economic science and provided that our statistical agencies receiveadequate resources, procedures should continue to improve. To be sure, progress will not be easy forestimating the value of quality improvements is a painstaking process. It must be done methodically,item by item. But progress can be made.One improvement that has been made in recent years is a better ability to capture qualitydifferences by pricing the underlying characteristics of complex products. With an increasingly widerange of product variants available to the public, product characteristics are now bundled together in anenormous variety of combinations. A “personal computer” is, in actuality, an amalgamation ofcomputing speed, memory, networking capability, graphics capability, and so on. Computermanufacturers are moving toward build-to-order systems, in which any combination of thesespecifications and peripheral equipment is available to each individual buyer. Other examples abound.Advancements in computer-assisted design have reduced the costs of producing multiple varieties ofsmall machine tools. The variety of commercial aircraft is much larger now than it was twenty years ago.And in services, witness the plethora of products now available from financial institutions, which haveallowed a more complete disentangling and exchange of economic risks across participants around theworld. Although hard data are scarce, there can be little doubt that products are tailor-made for the buyerto a larger extent than ever. Gone are the days when Henry Ford could say he would sell a car of anycolor “so long as it’s black”.BIS Review   106/1997
- 4 -In such an environment, when product characteristics are bundled together in so manydifferent combinations, defining the unit of output means unbundling these characteristics and pricingeach of them separately. The so-called hedonic technique is designed to do precisely that. This techniqueassociates changes in a product’s price with changes in product characteristics. It therefore allows aquality comparison when new products with improved characteristics are introduced.Not surprisingly, one area in which this approach has been especially useful is incomputer technology. In the United States, prior to the mid-1980s, computer prices simply were heldconstant in the national accounts. Now, with the introduction of hedonic techniques, the accounts showcomputer prices declining at double-digit rates, surely a more accurate estimate of the truequality-adjusted price change. The few other countries that have introduced these techniques -- Francebeing the most recent -- show computer prices declining much more rapidly than in the majority ofcountries that have not yet done so.But hedonics are by no means a panacea. First of all, this technique obviously will be ofno use in valuing the quality of an entirely new product that has fundamentally different characteristicsfrom its predecessors. The benefits of cellular telephones, and the value they provide in terms of makingcalls from any location, cannot be measured from an examination of the attributes of standard telephones.In addition, the measured characteristics may only be proxies for the overall performancethat consumers ultimately value. In the case of computers, the buyer ultimately cares about the quality ofservices that computer will provide -- word processing capabilities, database services, high-speedcalculations, and so on. But, in many cases, the number of message instructions per second and the othereasily measured characteristics may not be a wholly adequate proxy for the computer services that thebuyer values. In these circumstances, the right approach, ultimately, may be to move toward directlypricing the services we obtain from our computers -- that is, word processing services, databasemanagement services, and so on -- rather than pricing separately the hardware and software.The issues surrounding the appropriate measurement of computer prices also illustratesome of the difficulties of valuing goods and services when there are significant interactions among usersof the products. New generations of computers sometimes require software that is incompatible withprevious generations, and some users who have no need for the improved computing power neverthelessmay feel compelled to purchase the new technology because they need to remain compatible with thebulk of users who are at the frontier. Even if our techniques allow us to accurately measure consumers’valuation of the increased speed and power of the new generation of computer, we may miss the negativeinfluence on some consumers of this incompatibility. Therefore, even in the case of personal computers,where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomenastill may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.Despite the advances in price measurement that have been made over the years, thereremains considerable room for improvement. In the United States, a group of experts empanelled by theSenate Finance Committee -- the Boskin commission -- concluded that the consumer price index hasoverstated changes in the cost of living by roughly one percentage point per annum in recent years.About half of this bias owed to inadequate adjustment for quality improvement and the introduction ofnew goods, and about half reflected the manner in which the individual prices were aggregated.Researchers at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere have come up with similar figures. Although theestimates of bias owing to inadequate adjustment for quality improvements surely are the most uncertainaspect of this calculation, the preponderance of evidence is that, on average, such a bias in qualityadjustment does exist.The Boskin commission, along with most other estimates of bias in the U.S. CPI, havetaken a micro-statistical approach, estimating separately the magnitude of each category of potential bias.Recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added corroborating evidence of pricemis-measurement, using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of theBIS Review   106/1997
- 5 -micro-statistical exercises. Specifically, employing disaggregated data from the national income andproduct accounts, this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in theservice sector is implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparentlyhas been well-maintained. Indeed, the published data indicate that the level of output per hour in anumber of service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades. It is simply notcredible that firms in these industries have been becoming less and less efficient for more than twentyyears. Much more reasonable is the view that prices have been mis-measured and that the truequality-adjusted prices have been rising more slowly than the published price indexes. Properlymeasured, output and productivity trends in these service industries might be considerably stronger thansuggested by the published data. Assuming, for example, no change in productivity for these industrieswould imply a price bias consistent with the Boskin commission findings.Of course, the United States is not the only country that faces challenges in constructingan accurate measure of inflation. Other countries -- Germany among them -- confront similar issues. In arecent survey of consumer price indexes in its member countries, the OECD found that most countriesfelt that measurement bias was smaller in magnitude in their own countries than in the United States.Certainly regarding quality adjustment, however, I doubt that this is generally the case. Many countries’responses were prepared by the countries’ statistical agencies, which tend to take a somewhat moresanguine view of the adequacy of the existing price statistics than do outside economists. But, in anycase, the OECD survey did indicate that many countries reported that measurement bias was a concernand that most countries do not adequately adjust their statistics for quality improvements. Indeed, as Inoted previously, most European countries still have yet to adopt the most up-to-date techniques formeasuring computer prices in their national accounts. As the OECD survey recognized, the challengespresented by rapid technological advances have affected all of us -- not just the United States. Thus,potential sources of measurement bias should be seriously examined in all countries.Indeed, issues of price measurement may be especially important for the Europeancountries entering into monetary union. For a region with a single monetary policy, a single, consistentlyestimated measure of inflation is necessary to gauge the region’s economic performance. Toward thatend, as you know, Eurostat publishes harmonized indexes of consumer prices that are constructed using acommon basket of goods and services for each EU member state and using similar statisticalmethodology. These measures should go a long way toward providing a conceptually sound basis forjudging convergence of EU member states in the selection of countries to participate in monetary union.Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure ofinflation in the Euro area.However, as it now stands, the harmonized measures do not contain a broad coverage ofconsumer services. Most notably, the costs of owner-occupied housing -- a sizable share of consumerexpenditures -- are excluded from the harmonized indexes. In the United States, for example, the CPIcalculated on this harmonized basis would have increased three or four tenths of a percentage point moreslowly than the published CPI, on average, over the past few years, largely because prices ofowner-occupied housing have been rising more rapidly than the other components. Arguably, thepublished index, with broader coverage, is more relevant to assessing inflation trends in the United Statesthan would be the harmonized index. As long as relative prices can and do diverge across countries, theharmonized indexes need to contain as broad a range of items as is practical.As monetary union proceeds, then, it would be to the advantage of monetary authoritiesin the Euro area to have a consistent measure of inflation defined over a broad basket of goods andservices that is measured according to established statistical methods. Most useful would be for themember countries to continue the harmonization process until the national statistical agencies are trulyworking on a consistent basis. Indeed, measuring prices consistently across countries could be animportant step toward making price measurement more accurate everywhere, if harmonization results ineach country’s best practices being adopted throughout the monetary union. Moreover, different prices ofthe same tradable good across the community might signal inefficiencies of distribution which were notevident from other sources.BIS Review   106/1997
- 6 -Harmonization of CPIs in Europe is just one of many examples demonstrating why pricemeasurement techniques cannot be static. With innovation constantly leading to new products, greatervariety, and higher quality, the statistical agencies must work ever harder just to stay in place. Agovernment official in the United States once compared a nation’s statistical system to a tailor,measuring the economy much as a tailor measures a person for a suit of clothes -- with the differencethat, unlike the tailor, the person we are measuring is running while we try to measure him. The only waythe system can succeed, he said, is to be just as fast and twice as agile. That is the challenge that liesahead, and it is, indeed, a large one.There are, however, reasons for optimism. The information revolution, which lies behindso much of the rapid technological change that makes prices difficult to measure, may also play animportant role in helping our statistical agencies acquire the necessary speed and agility to better capturethe changes taking place in our economies. For example, computers might some day allow our statisticalagencies to tap into a great many economic transactions on a nearly real-time basis. Utilizing data fromstore checkout scanners, which the United States is now investigating, may be an important first step inthat direction. But the possibilities offered by information technology for the improvement of pricemeasurement may turn out to be much broader in scope. Just as it is difficult to predict the ways in whichtechnology will change our consumption over time, so is it difficult to predict how economic andstatistical science will make creative use of the improved technology.Such advances must be taken to ensure that our economic statistics remain adequate tosupport the public policy decisions that must be made. If the challenge for our statistical agencies is notto lose in their race against technology, the challenge for policymakers is to make our best judgementsabout the limitations of the existing statistics, as we design policies to promote the economic well-beingof our nations.BIS Review   106/1997
Mr. Stals considers the role of monetary policy in stabilising the business cycleduring the pre- and post-election period   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of SouthAfrica, Dr. Chris Stals, at the Annual Conference of the Bureau for Economic Research, in Cape Town,on 7/11/97.1. IntroductionIn the implementation of monetary policy the Reserve Bank should not be influenced bythe fact that an election will take place in South Africa in May 1999. The reference to the “pre- andpost-election period” in the title of this address should therefore be regarded as coincidental. As always,monetary policy should be guided by developments in financial aggregates such as the money supply andIn contemporary monetary policy, central banks are normally also not guided by theobjective of “stabilising the business cycle”. It is the task of monetary policy to promote a stablefinancial environment at all times, irrespective of the current phase of the business cycle. There is,however, a definite relationship between developments in real economic activity (“the business cycle”)and in the financial aggregates relevant for monetary policy. By concentrating on the trends in thefinancial aggregates, and not in real economic activity, monetary policy, however, has a better chance ofmaintaining financial stability that will, in the longer term, be conducive for sustainable economicgrowth at a higher level.A former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia once said the following:“There was a recognition that (monetary) policy had to do more than stabilise the cycle:the problem with an exclusive focus on the business cycle was that we may well stabilise the real side ofthe economy without stabilising the price side of the economy”. (Governor M.J. Phillips, When theMusic Stops, Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin, July 1990).A slowdown in the business cycle will normally also include a slowdown in real grossdomestic expenditure, incorporating declines in the growth rates of both consumption and investmentexpenditure. Such slowdowns, however, may not yet at the time of the decline in expenditure justify therelaxation of monetary policy. The slowdown in real expenditure will after some normal time-lags befollowed by a decrease in the demand for bank credit, which will also lead to a decline in the rate ofgrowth in the money supply. Timing monetary policy decisions to coincide rather with changes in themonetary aggregates and not with changes in real economic activity reduces the danger of a prematurere-stimulation of the demand for bank credit, and a too early injection of excessive amounts of additionalmoney. A monetary policy linked to changes in the business cycle could easily lead to the re-emergenceof the harmful stop-go policies so often pursued by central banks in the 1960s.2. 1997 - A year of macroeconomic consolidationDevelopments in the South African economy in the early months of 1996, andparticularly the currency crisis of February last year, exposed certain weaknesses that were developing inthe South African economy at that time, and that needed early correction. The signs were already there inthe first half of 1996 that the calendar year of 1997 would turn out to be a year of macroeconomicconsolidation.Now, eighteen months later, we can look back with some satisfaction on the progress thathas been made in restoring overall economic equilibrium. Firstly, in the area of real economic activity,equilibrium has been restored not only in the growth rates but also in the absolute levels of total grossBIS Review   106/1997
- 2 -domestic product and total gross domestic expenditure. After increases of about 6 per cent per year in1994 and 1995, the growth in gross domestic expenditure slowed down to 3 per cent in 1996, and toalmost zero so far in 1997. The rate of growth in total production also slowed down marginally, but wasstill maintained at a positive level of about 2 per cent in the first nine months of 1997.These developments in real economic activity over the past eighteen months werereflected in an improvement in the overall balance of payments. The seasonally adjusted and annualisedrate of the current account deficit declined from R13 billion in the second quarter of 1996 to R3½ billionin the second quarter of 1997. This improvement contributed to the adoption of a more positive attitudeby foreign investors and the net capital inflow increased from less than R4 billion in the full year of 1996to more than R16 billion in the first half of 1997. In light of the surplus that emerged on the overallbalance of payments, the total gross gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the banking sectorincreased by R14 billion from about R17 billion at the end of December 1996 to about R31 billion at theend of June 1997.Thirdly, the excessive rates of increase in the money supply and in bank credit extensionin 1995 and 1996 also marginally slowed down in 1997. In the third quarter of 1997, the seasonallyadjusted amount of the money supply increased at an annual rate of 12.2 per cent, and that of totaldomestic credit extension by the banking sector by only 6.3 per cent.Finally, in the consolidation process, South Africa succeeded in absorbing theunavoidable increase in inflation in the aftermath of the depreciation of last year. As was expected, therate of increase in consumer prices accelerated from 5.5 per cent in April 1996 to 9.9 per cent in April1997 but then declined again to 8 per cent in September 1997. In the third quarter of 1997, inflation wasindeed running at an annualised rate of 6.6 per cent, back on track again towards the medium-termobjective of bringing the rate of inflation in South Africa more in line with the average rate of inflation inthe economies of our major international trading partners and competitors.The parts played by changes in the exchange rate of the rand, and in interest rates, inbringing about better equilibrium should not be underestimated. The average weighted value of the randagainst a basket of currencies first depreciated by about 23 per cent during the first ten months of lastyear, before it appreciated again by 11 per cent from 31 October 1996 to 13 March 1997. Since then itfollowed a more steady path and depreciated by about 10 per cent in the next seven months. At the end ofOctober 1997, the average weighted value of the rand was only marginally down from its level of31 December 1996.Liquidity was initially drained from the money market after the foreign capital inflowssubsided in February 1996, and the money market shortage gradually increased to reach a peak of morethan R10 billion in March 1997. Since then, the situation eased again to an average daily shortage of onlyabout R5 billion in October 1997. Interest rates obviously followed these trends and increased quitesharply during the course of 1996 but then declined again in 1997. The rate on three months bankers’acceptances for example reached a peak of almost 17 per cent at the end of November 1996, beforedeclining to 14.9 per cent at the end of October 1997.The macroeconomic consolidation process therefore without any doubt created a sounderand better balanced overall economic basis on which a next phase of more rapid economic expansion cannow develop.3. The role of monetary policyAfter the exchange rate crash of February 1996, the monetary policy approach was to letmarket forces work with some intervention by the Reserve Bank in the foreign exchange and in themoney markets, but mainly with the intention of supporting an orderly adjustment in market prices. ItBIS Review   106/1997
- 3 -was never the intention to try and fix the exchange rate of the rand at any predetermined artificial level,neither did the Bank try to keep interest rates unrealistically low.It was furthermore accepted that, after the relatively large depreciation in the exchangerate and taking account also of the “openness” of the South African economy, the rate of inflation wouldrise. The challenge for monetary policy was, however, to constrain the rate of increase in inflation to afirst round effect only, and to prevent prices from going into an uncontrollable and perpetuatinginflationary spiral.In retrospect, the policy seemed to have worked quite well. The restrictive monetarypolicy, and particularly the rise in interest rates, were not received with unanimous support by all sectorsof the South African community. Interest rates, however, remain one of the main disciplines of themarket economy and countries that are not prepared to bear the effects of this discipline from time totime will be punished by the markets. This basic lesson is now being learned again by a number ofcountries in the East Asia region where interest rates recently soared to a much higher level than everexperienced by South Africa.Now that the overall macroeconomic consolidation process has made good progress,there are some impatient pressures building up on the Reserve Bank to relax monetary policy quickly anddecisively. Some of these pressures are still based on the now defunct Phillips curve or an assumedtrade-off between inflation and growth -- an argument that was buried in most countries of the worldalready in the 1980s when macroeconomic policy switched the emphasis from a demand-managementapproach to a supply-side solution. The rapid expansion of communications and the increase inelectronically driven capacity for economic analyses further contributed to the more effectiveimplementation of pre-empting expectations, and reduced the opportunity for central bankers to stimulateeconomies in the short term by applying over-expansionary monetary policies.The South African Reserve Bank now follows the lead of many other central banks in theworld to base monetary policy decisions on developments in financial or monetary aggregates, and noton changes in real economic activity. Indeed, the latest fashion is for central banks, together withgovernments, to target inflation more directly. Taking account of typical time-lags that exist between theimplementation of monetary policies and their eventual effect on prices, monetary policy adjustments arebased on the expectation of what the rate of inflation may turn out to be twelve to eighteen monthsdownstream. Reliable forecasting therefore has become as important for the monetary authorities as theyare for private sector operators in the markets. For this purpose, the familiar monetary aggregates such asthe money supply, bank credit extension, the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve andchanges in the exchange rate provide the best indicators available in the short term to guide monetarypolicy decisions.What will be important for the stance of monetary policy over the next year will not bethe approaching election in 1999, but rather current developments in these well-known basic financialaggregates. Apart from contending with the after-effects of the depreciation of the rand last year, themajor concern for the Reserve Bank recently has been the continuous increase at a high rate in the totalamount of bank credit extended to the private sector. Over the past few months there has been asignificant slowdown in the annualised rate of increase in bank credit extended to the private sectorwhich amounted to 21.2 per cent in the second quarter of 1997, before declining to 9.5 per cent in thethird quarter. After the recent downward adjustment in the financial markets in South Africa, we mayfind some further slowdown in the rate of increase in bank credit extension, to reflect more truly theslowdown which already occurred in real economic activity.Recent events in the international currency markets proved once again that theforecasting of possible future developments in financial aggregates can be very perilous. As South Africaliberalises its financial markets further and as the South African financial system gets more integratedinto an extremely volatile international environment, the hazards of forecasting will increase. For thecentral bank, this unfortunately reduces the value of strictly defined monetary policy models, and makesBIS Review   106/1997
- 4 -the task of implementing policies more discretionary. Market participants prefer a monetary policy basedon pre-announced rules and want to be in a position where they can pre-empt important changes inmonetary policy for their own advantage, and for the sake of giving good advice to their clients. This,however, is not possible in the present environment where unpredictable events in far-away places suchas Thailand can have profound influences on monetary developments in South Africa.Forecasting possible developments in the exchange rate of the rand, for example, mustnot only take account of developments in South Africa, but also of possible changes in the crossexchange rates of major currencies, developments in international capital markets, economic and politicaldevelopments in a number of emerging economies and a multitude of other possible globaldevelopments. As illustrated over the past year, changes in the effective exchange rate of the rand in turncan have many effects on monetary policy decisions in South Africa. In this multi-complex environmentit is just unreasonable to expect of any governor of any central bank anywhere in the world to signal tomarkets in advance what adjustments in interest rates or other monetary policies could be expected overthe next year.4. A greater reliance on marketsIn the situation, it is advisable to rely more on market forces for the necessary correctionof imbalances that may develop from time to time in the macro economy. Markets must therefore beencouraged to become more flexible, more efficient and more responsive to changes in underlying supplyand demand conditions.In the case of South Africa, three important changes will be introduced in the structure offinancial markets over the next few months:•Firstly, the existing national payment, clearing and settlement system will be upgraded in March1998 to pave the way for real-time on-line settlement of large transactions on a gross basis, andfor the daily settlement on a net basis of other (smaller) transactions between bankinginstitutions. This versatile new system will provide challenging opportunities for thedevelopment of a more active interbank funds market.•Secondly, the Reserve Bank will introduce a new system for providing liquidity to bankinginstitutions through daily repurchase transactions that will establish a floating interest rate forcentral bank accommodation.•Thirdly, the Department of Finance intends to introduce a new system for the primary sale of andsecondary market making in government bonds by the appointment of a number of securitiesdealers from the private banking sector to operate as authorised dealers on behalf of the Treasury.These changes are all intended to serve the needs of more liberalised and free financialmarkets in South Africa. At the same time, they should open up the way for further exchange controlrelaxations and encourage greater integration of the South African financial markets in the globalfinancial system.5. Concluding remarksNext year holds the prospects for being an interesting one for the South Africaneconomy.•Firstly, there is the prospect for better economic growth in South Africa, following upon themacroeconomic consolidation of the past year.BIS Review   106/1997

Mr. Greenspan’s testimony before the House of Respresentatives’ Commmittee onBanking and Financial Services   Testimony of the Chairman of the Governing Board of the USFederal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Servicesof the US House of Representatives in Washington DC, on 13/11/97.Recent developments in world finance have highlighted growing interactions amongnational financial markets. The underlying technology-based structure of the international financialsystem has enabled us to improve materially the efficiency of the flows of capital and payment systems.That improvement, however, has also enhanced the ability of the financial system to transmit problems inone part of the globe to another quite rapidly. Doubtless, there is much to be learned from the recentexperience in Asia that can be applied to better the workings of the international financial system and itssupport of international trade that has done so much to enhance living standards worldwide.While each of the Asian economies differs in many important respects, the sources oftheir spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged arerelevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.Following the early post-World War II period, policies generally fostering low levels ofinflation and openness of their economies coupled with high savings and investment rates contributed toa sustained period of rapid growth, in some cases starting in 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s mosteconomies in the region were expanding vigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew, but until recentyears were relatively modest. The World Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt, foreign directinvestment, and equity purchases to the Asia Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990, butexploded to more than $110 billion by 1996.A major impetus behind this rapid expansion was the global stock market boom of the1990s. As that boom progressed, investors in many industrial countries found themselves more heavilyconcentrated in the recently higher valued securities of companies in the developed world, whose rates ofreturn, in many instances, had fallen to levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential inemerging economies, especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capitalflows into those economies. To a large extent, they came from investors in the United States and WesternEurope. A substantial amount came from Japan, as well, owing more to a search for higher yields than torising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen through mid-1995 also encouraged asubstantial increase in direct investment inflows from Japan. In retrospect, it is clear that moreinvestment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk.I suspect that it was inevitable in those conditions of low inflation, rapid growth, andample liquidity that much investment moved into the real estate sector, with an emphasis by both thepublic and private sectors on conspicuous construction projects. This is an experience, of course, notunknown in the United States on occasion. These real estate assets, in turn, ended up as collateral for asignificant proportion of the assets of domestic financial systems. In many instances, those financialsystems were less than robust, beset with problems of lax lending standards, weak supervisory regimes,and inadequate capital.Moreover, in most cases, the currencies of these economies were closely tied to the U.S.dollar, and the dollar’s substantial recovery since mid-1995, especially relative to the yen, made theirexports less competitive. In addition, in some cases, the glut of semiconductors in 1996 suppressedexport growth, exerting further pressures on highly leveraged businesses.However, overall GDP growth rates generally edged off only slightly, and imports,fostered by rising real exchange rates, continued to expand, contributing to what became unsustainablecurrent account deficits in a number of these economies. Moreover, with exchange rates seeming to besolidly tied to the dollar, and with dollar and yen interest rates lower than domestic currency rates, asignificant part of the enlarged capital inflows into these economies, in particular short-term flows, wasBIS Review   105/1997
- 2 -denominated by the ultimate borrowers in foreign currencies. This put additional pressure on companiesto earn foreign exchange through exports.The pressures on fixed exchange rate regimes mounted as foreign investors slowed thepace of new capital inflows, and domestic businesses sought increasingly to convert domestic currenciesinto foreign currencies, or, equivalently, slowed the conversion of export earnings into domesticcurrencies. The shifts in perceived future investment risks led to sharp declines in stock markets acrossAsia, often on top of earlier declines or lackluster performances.To date, the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has beenmodest, but it can be expected not to be negligible. U.S. exports to Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,and Malaysia (the four countries initially affected) were about 4 percent of total U.S. exports in 1996.However, an additional 12 percent went to Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (economies thathave been affected more recently). Thus, depending on the extent of the inevitable slowdown in growthin this area of the world, the growth of our exports will tend to be muted. Our direct foreign investmentin, and foreign affiliate earnings reported from, the economies in this region as a whole have been asmaller share of the respective totals than their share of our exports. The share is, nonetheless, largeenough to expect some drop-off in those earnings in the period ahead. In addition, there will be indirecteffects on the U.S. real economy from countries such as Japan that compete even more extensively withthe economies in the Asian region.Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagioneffect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive, rightly or wrongly, similarvulnerabilities. Even economies, such as Hong Kong, with formidable stocks of international reserves,balanced external accounts, and relatively robust financial systems, have experienced severe pressures.One can debate whether the turbulence in Latin American asset values reflects contagion effects fromAsia, the influence of developments in U.S. financial markets, or home-grown causes. Whatever theanswer, and the answer may be all of the above, this phenomenon illustrates the interdependencies intoday’s world economy and financial system.Perhaps it was inevitable that the impressive and rapid growth experienced by theeconomies in the Asian region would run into a temporary slowdown or pause. But there is no reasonthat above-average growth in countries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with theprevailing technology cannot persist for a very long time. Nevertheless, rapidly developing, free-marketeconomies periodically can be expected to run into difficulties because investment mistakes areinevitable in any dynamic economy. Private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In thesecircumstances, companies should be allowed to default, private investors should take their losses, andgovernment policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structural foundations forrenewed expansion; new growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge. Similarly, in providing anyinternational financial assistance, we need to be mindful of the desirability of minimizing the impressionthat international authorities stand ready to guarantee the external liabilities of sovereign governments orfailed domestic businesses. To do otherwise could lead to distorted investments and could ultimatelyunbalance the world financial system.The recent experience in Asia underscores the importance of financially sound domesticbanking and other associated financial institutions. While the current turmoil has significant interactionwith the international financial system, the recent crises would arguably have been better contained iflong-maturity property loans had not accentuated the usual mismatch between maturities of assets andliabilities of domestic financial systems that were far from robust to begin with. Our unlamented savingsand loan crises come to mind.These are trying days for economic policymakers in Asia. They must fend off domesticpressures that seek disengagement from the world trading and financial system. The authorities in thesecountries are working hard, in some cases with substantial assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, andthe Asian Development Bank, to stabilize their financial systems and economies.BIS Review   105/1997
- 3 -The financial disturbances that have afflicted a number of currencies in Asia do not atthis point, as I indicated earlier, threaten prosperity in this country, but we need to work closely withtheir leaders and the international financial community to assure that their situations stabilize. It is in theinterest of the United States and other nations around the world to encourage appropriate policyadjustments, and where required, provide temporary financial assistance.BIS Review   105/1997
Ms. Phillips discusses trends and challenges in Federal Reserve bank supervisionRemarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at Houston Baptist University, Houston, Texas on 30/10/97.Trends and Challenges in Federal Reserve Bank SupervisionI am pleased to be here today to talk with you about some of the important,fundamental changes taking place within the U.S. banking system and the effects those changes arehaving on the Federal Reserve’s supervisory process.As you know, the U.S. economy and banking system have enjoyed more than half adecade of improving strength and prosperity in which U.S. banks have become better capitalized andmore profitable than they have been in generations. Moreover, in the past 13 months not a singleinsured bank has failed, and the Bank Insurance Fund is now capitalized at a level requiring mostbanks to pay only nominal fees for their insurance.While this situation is a vast improvement over conditions in earlier years, experiencehas demonstrated that at times like these -- if we are not vigilant -- risks can occur that set the stagefor future problems. That’s what makes supervising banks so interesting and such a challenge.When the economy and the banking industry are in difficulty, supervisors mustidentify and address immediate problems in an effort to protect the U.S. taxpayer and the federalsafety net. When conditions are good, as they are today, supervisors have the opportunity to reviewtheir oversight process and promote sound practices for managing banking risks in an effort to avertor mitigate future problems. This and keeping up with the pace of financial innovation and industrychange that has occurred in the past 5 to 10 years has been a challenge, indeed.As I begin my remarks, I would like to point out that no system of supervision orregulation can provide total assurance that banking problems will not occur or that banks will not fail.Nor should it. Any process that prevents all banking problems would be extremely invasive tobanking organizations and would likely inhibit economic growth. As financial intermediaries, banksmust take risks if they and their communities are to grow. As risk-takers, some banks will necessarilyincur losses, and some will eventually fail. The objective is to contain the costs of risk-taking, both toTherefore, our goal as regulators is to help identify weak banking practices so thatsmall or emerging problems can be addressed before they become large and costly. To do that intoday’s markets, and in an environment in which technology and financial innovation can lead torapid change, the Federal Reserve is pursuing a more risk-focused supervisory approach.We are well underway toward implementing this new supervisory framework, andinitial indications about it -- from both examiners and bankers -- have been favorable. Thisrisk-focused approach to supervision is seen as a necessary response to a variety of factors: thegrowing complexity and pace of change within the industry, the increasingly global nature of U.S.and world financial markets, and the methods available today for managing and controlling risk. Asbanking practices and markets continue to evolve, I believe this emphasis on risk-focused supervisionwill be even more necessary in the years to come.What is “Risk-Focused” Supervision?With that introduction, let me clarify what I mean by risk-focused supervision. Howdoes it differ from the way supervisors have traditionally done their job? What does it mean to theBIS Review   104/1997
- 2 -banking system? What is it? In short, risk-focused supervision simply means that in conducting bankexaminations and other supervisory activities, we will seek to direct our attention and resources to theareas that we perceive pose the greatest risk to banks. In many respects, that would seem ratherobvious and hardly earth shaking, and in many ways it is, indeed, nothing new. The Federal Reserveand the other banking agencies have long sought to identify exceptions and to prioritize examinationactivities.In the past, though, the business of bank supervision has focused on validating bankbalance sheets, particularly the value of loan portfolios, which have been historically the principalsource of problems for banks. Much of the prior emphasis was on determining the condition of abank at a point in time. In the process, we would go through the balance sheet, assuring ourselves thata bank’s assets and liabilities were essentially as stated and that its reserves and net worth were real.As part of the process, there was a review of sound management practices, internal controls, andstrong internal audit activities, but that review was not the initial or primary focus.In earlier times that approach was adequate, since bank balance sheets were generallyslow to change. Banks held their loans to maturity; they acquired deposits locally and at a pacesimilar to local economic growth; their product lines were stable; and management turnover, itself,was typically low. By tracking the quality of loans and other assets, examiners could generally detectdeterioration and other business problems through their periodic on-site examinations. If done oftenenough, those examinations typically gave authorities sufficient time to take action and to either closeor sell a bank before the losses became significant to the deposit insurance fund.Developments Driving ChangeDuring the past decade, though, the U.S. banking system experienced a great deal ofturmoil, stress, and change. Ten years ago, many of the country’s largest banks announced huge loanloss provisions, beginning the process of reducing the industry’s overhang of doubtful developingcountry loans. At the same time, many of these institutions and smaller regional banks werestruggling with energy and agricultural sector difficulties or accumulating commercial real estateproblems. I am sure that many of you here today can easily recall those times, and that these andother difficulties took a heavy toll -- if not in your own banks, in those of your competitors. By theend of the 1980s, more than 200 banks were failing annually, and there were more than 1,000 bankson the FDIC problem list.This experience provided important lessons and forced supervisors and bankers, alike,to reconsider the way they approached their jobs. For their part, bankers recognized the need torebuild their capital and reserves, strengthen their internal controls, diversify their risks, and improvetheir practices for identifying, underwriting, and managing risk. Supervisors were also reminded ofthe need to remain vigilant and of the high costs that bank failures can bring, not only to the insurancefund but to local communities as well. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 emphasized that point,requiring frequent examinations and prompt regulatory actions when serious problems emerge.Beyond these mostly domestic events, banks and businesses throughout the worldwere dealing in the 1980s and 1990s with new technologies that were leading to a multitude of newand increasingly complex financial products that changed the nature of banking and financialmarkets. These technologies have brought about an endless variety of derivative instruments,increased securitization, ATMs, and a broader range of banking products. By lowering informationcosts, they have also led to dramatic improvements in risk management and have expanded themarketing and service capabilities of banks and their competitors.In large part, these changes and innovations are unequivocally good for society andhave produced more efficient markets and, in turn, greater international trade and economic growth.BIS Review   104/1997
They have also, however, greatly increased the complexity of banking and bank supervision. In bothcases, these developments have spurred the demand for highly trained and qualified personnel.Within the United States, our banking system has also experienced a dramaticconsolidation in the number of banking institutions, due not only to technology and financialinnovation, but also to legislative changes allowing interstate banking. The number of independentcommercial banking organizations has declined 40 percent since 1980 to 7,400 in June of this year.While possibly stressful to many bankers and bank customers, this dramatic structural change hasalso contributed to industry earnings by providing banks with greater opportunities to reduce costs.A challenge now for many institutions may be to manage their growth and thecontinuing process of industry consolidation. This challenge may be greatest as bankingorganizations expand into more diverse or nontraditional banking activities, particularly throughacquisitions. Growth into a wider array of activities is especially important if banks are to meet thewide-ranging needs of their business and household customers, while competing effectively withother regulated and unregulated firms.As you know, the Congress has been wrestling with the issue of banking powers foryears and -- with the exception of interstate branching -- has yet to make much progress. The FederalReserve has long believed that legislation is needed and that the industry can best move forward ifthis issue is resolved by lawmakers, rather than by regulators in a piecemeal fashion. Nevertheless,with or without legislation, we must all deal with changing markets and with the opportunities andpressures they present.Utilizing existing legislative authority, regulators have been able to approve newbanking products that were not available a decade ago, as financial markets and products haveevolved. However, whether future expansion comes through new laws or merely through newinterpretations of current laws and regulations, it is important that the banking industry use its powerswisely and that its performance remain sound.Supervisory Challenges AheadIn supervising this “industry-in-transition”, the Federal Reserve has no shortage oftasks, despite the virtually unprecedented strong condition of the U.S. banking system today. We, too,must deal with the evolving financial markets and advances in technology. At the same time, we mustensure that our own supervisory practices, tools, and standards take advantage of improvingtechnology and financial techniques so that our oversight is not only effective, but also as unobtrusiveand as appropriate as possible. These tasks are wide ranging, extending from our own re-engineeringof the supervisory process to the way supervisors approach such issues as measuring capitaladequacy and international convergence of supervisory standards.Constructing a sound supervisory process while minimizing regulatory burden hasbeen a long-standing and on-going effort at the Federal Reserve and an objective we have sought toadvance with our emphasis on risk-focused examinations. Particularly in the past decade, thedevelopment of new financial products and the greater depth and liquidity of financial markets haveenabled banking organizations to change their risk profiles more rapidly than ever before. Thatpossibility requires that we strike an appropriate balance between evaluating the condition of aninstitution at a point in time and evaluating the soundness of the bank’s on-going process formanaging risk.The risk-focused approach, by definition, entails a more formal planning phase thatidentifies those areas and activities at risk that warrant the most extensive review. This pre-planningprocess is supported by technology, for example, to download certain information about a bank’sBIS Review   104/1997
- 4 -loan portfolio to our own computer systems and then, through off-site analysis, target areas of theportfolio for review. This revised process should be less disruptive to the daily activities of banksthan earlier examination procedures and has the further advantage of reducing our own travel costsand improving examiner morale.Once on-site, examiners analyze the bank’s loans and other assets to ascertain theorganization’s current condition, and also to evaluate its internal control process and its own ability toidentify and resolve problems. As a result, the Federal Reserve is placing greater reliance than beforeon a bank’s internal auditors and on the accuracy and adequacy of bank information systems. Thereview of a bank’s information flow extends from top to bottom, and with the expectation that banksenior management and boards of directors are actively involved in monitoring the bank’s activitiesand providing sufficient guidance regarding their appetite for risk.As in the past, performance of substantive checks on the reliability of a bank’scontrols remains an important element of the examination process, albeit in a more automated andadvanced form. For example, we are pursuing ways to make greater use of loan sampling in order togenerate statistically valid conclusions about the accuracy of a bank’s internal loan review process.To the extent we can validate the integrity of a bank’s internal controls more efficiently, we can placemore confidence in them at an earlier stage and can also take greater comfort that management isproviding itself with an accurate indication of the bank’s condition. Moreover, as examiners are ableto complete loan reviews more quickly, they will have more time to review other high priority aspectsof the institution’s operations.A significant benefit of the risk-focused approach is its emphasis on ensuring that thebank’s internal oversight processes are sound and that communication between the bank and FederalReserve examiners occurs between examinations. That approach is generally supported byinstitutions we supervise and provides a more comprehensive oversight process that complements ourannual or 18-month examination cycle. It also strengthens our ability to respond promptly ifconditions deteriorate.Importantly, the Federal Reserve’s examination staff indicates that this risk-focusedprocess may be reducing on-site examination time by 15-30 percent in many cases and overallexamination time of Reserve Bank personnel by perhaps 10 percent. While those results are tentative,partial, and unscientific, they are certainly encouraging in terms of resource implications.Complementing the risk-focused approach to supervision are enhancements to thetools we use to grade a bank’s condition and management. Since 1995, we have asked our examinersto provide a specific supervisory rating for a bank’s risk management process. This Fed initiativepreceded, but is quite consistent with, the more recent interagency decision to add an “S” to the endof the CAMEL rating. That “S”, as you know, addresses sensitivity to market risk and reflects inlarge part a bank’s ability to manage that risk. Any managers in the audience who are with U.S.offices of foreign banks may appreciate that these rating changes simply highlight the importance ofrisk management that the Federal Reserve has for some time emphasized in its review of foreignbanks.How effective is the risk-focused process?Since economic and industry conditions have been so favorable in recent years, therehas not been a sufficiently stressful economic downturn to provide a robust test. The market volatilitybeginning in 1994 offered some insights about supervisory judgements of the risk managementsystems of large trading banks, but there have been few other indications. Even the rise to recordlevels of delinquencies and defaults on credit card debt may reflect factors other than the ability ofsupervisors to ensure that management has all the important bases covered. The real test, of course,BIS Review   104/1997
would come with a major economic downturn. Even then, though, it will be hard to know what mighthave occurred had our oversight procedures not changed.Nevertheless, there are indications that both banking and supervisory practices arematerially better now than they were in the 1980s and early 1990s. Because of technology and lowercomputer and communications costs, information is much more readily available than in earlierdecades, and sound management practices are more widespread. Risk measurement and portfoliomanagement techniques that were largely theoretical when some of us were in college are now fullyoperational in many banks.Moreover, the costly experience with bank and thrift failures in the early 1990s hasnot been forgotten. As a result, most bankers and business managers today have a greaterappreciation, I believe, for the value of risk management and internal controls. To that point, we arefinding, with increased frequency, that banks are designing personnel compensation systems toprovide managers with greater incentives to control risk. Implementing a risk-focused supervisoryapproach has not been an easy task. It has required significant revisions to our broad and specializedtraining programs, including expansion of capital markets, risk assessment information technology,and global trading activities as well as courses devoted exclusively to internal controls. Theseeducation programs will, of course, need to be continually updated as industry activities andconditions evolve.With the greater discretion examiners now have to focus their efforts on areas ofhighest risk, it has also become more important that we ensure the consistency and overall quality ofour examinations. To address that point, we have developed automated examination tools, based on adecision-tree framework, that will help guide examiners through the procedures most relevant toindividual banks, given their specific circumstances and risk profiles.Moreover, both domestically and abroad, the Federal Reserve is working with otherbank supervisors and with the banking industry to develop sound practices for management for avariety of bank activities. Initiatives in recent years include guidance on disclosure and on managinginterest rate risk and derivative activities. Such efforts, and the growing worldwide recognition of thevalue of market forces, should lead to clearer expectations of supervisors, greater reliance on marketdiscipline, and less intrusive regulation.In that connection, the Federal Reserve in recent years has worked closely with theFDIC and with state banking departments to coordinate our examination procedures and supervisorypractices. A prime example of these efforts is the adoption last year of the State and Federal Protocol,through which we all seek to achieve a relatively seamless supervisory process for banks operatingacross state lines. We are also working together on a variety of automation efforts, some of which Ihave referred to already.The Year 2000Under the category of “problems we don’t need”, I find it difficult to talk withbankers these days without raising the “Year 2000” problem. Fortunately, most U.S. banks appear tobe taking this matter seriously and are generally well underway toward identifying their individualneeds and developing action plans. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bankingagencies are actively reviewing the efforts of banks to address this vital issue.Some banks, particularly large ones, have stated, themselves, that if an institution isnot already well underway toward resolving this problem, then it is already too late. I hope that all ofyou are giving this matter adequate attention, and are taking the steps necessary to ensure thatchanges are being made within your banks, and also by your vendors and customers.BIS Review   104/1997
- 6 -A critical aspect of the year 2000 problem is that we are all so inter-linked. Not onlyare we exposed to our own internal computer problems, but also to those with whom we do business.This matter has far-reaching implications for banks, covering not only operating risk, but also creditrisk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, and others if material problems emerge. This is yet anotherillustration of the many challenges faced by bankers today.ConclusionIn conclusion, the history of banking and of bank supervision shows a long and ratherclose relationship between the health of the banking system and the economy, a connection thatreflects the role of banks in the credit intermediation process. We can expect that relationship tocontinue and for bank earnings and asset quality to fluctuate as economic conditions change.In many ways, however, the banking and financial system has changed dramaticallyin the past decade both in terms of its structure and the diversity of its activities. Risk managementpractices have also advanced, helped by technological and financial innovations. I believe that bothbank supervisors and the banking industry have learned important lessons from the experience of thepast ten years, specifically about the need to actively monitor, manage, and control risks.Through its supervisory process, the Federal Reserve seeks to maintain a properbalance: permitting banks maximum freedom, while still protecting the safety net and maintainingfinancial stability. Maintaining responsible banking and responsible bank supervision is the key. Wemust all work to identify risks and to ensure they are adequately monitored and controlled. That resultwill lead to better banking practices, to more stable earnings and asset quality for the industry, and toless regulatory and legislative risk. These are goals we all share.BIS Review   104/1997
Mr. Macfarlane’s statement to the House of Representatives StandingCommittee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration   Statement by the Governorof the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. Ian Macfarlane, to the House of Representatives StandingCommittee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration in Sydney on 6/11/97.Thank you, Mr Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here in front of your Committeefor the second time under the new arrangements set out in the Statement on the Conduct ofMonetary Policy. On the basis of the first hearing, we think the new arrangements are workingvery well. On that occasion, we received some very penetrating and constructive questioningfrom Committee members, and there seemed to be quite a lot of public interest in theproceedings.Of course, we should always be trying to improve our procedures, but the onlyimprovement we have been able to make on this occasion is to get our half-yearly report to theCommittee two hours ahead of the hearing, compared with one hour last time. You willappreciate that in order to follow due process we cannot finalise the document until after ourBoard Meeting which was on Tuesday. I should also say that I was hoping that we might havebeen able to have this hearing somewhere other than Sydney. While it is very convenient for usto be meeting again in the New South Wales Parliament House about 100 metres from myoffice, we see merit in this hearing moving to other State capitals and Canberra on a regularbasis if that is possible.The main reason for these hearings is to improve the accountability of the ReserveBank, both directly to Parliament, and via the press coverage to the public more generally. In thespirit of increased accountability, I should, I suppose, be accountable for what I said to thisCommittee at the previous hearing, as well as for what I am going to say today. I covered anumber of subjects at the previous hearing which I thought were important for an understandingof how the economy was going to perform over coming years. I also mentioned a couple ofoutcomes we expected for 1997. It is those which will probably be of the most immediateinterest. I said that, after a sluggish 1996 where GDP had grown at about 3 per cent -- at onepoint, it got to not much more than 2 per cent on a 12-months-ended basis, we should expect itto pick up to about 4 per cent in 1997. I also said that I expected inflation to stay at the bottomof the 2-3 per cent range, with the possibility that it could go a little lower for a while.Now I think I could be excused for wanting to walk away from earlier forecasts asa result of the current turmoil in Asian and world financial markets. While I intend to say quite alot about those events later on, I do not propose to invoke that excuse at this stage, because theyhave not had any effect on the economy to date. They have affected financial markets, but notthe economy yet. Instead, I want to start by saying that the baseline we have to work from, i.e.,the growth of the economy in the first three quarters of 1997, has been at least as good as I waspointing to in May, if not a little better.•We now have the GDP growth rates for the first two quarters of 1997, which show theeconomy grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent during that time. And we havefurther monthly figures for the September quarter which are somewhat stronger thanthose recorded during the first half of the year. This is true for the major monthlyindicators such as retail trade, imports and exports. It is also true for the labour market,especially for vacancies, and to some extent also for employment. There is also evidencefrom the business surveys that confidence is picking up, but these surveys were generallycompiled before the Asian headlines of a fortnight ago.BIS Review   103/1997
- 2 -•On inflation, the outlook changed a little. New figures brought underlying inflationbelow 2 per cent, and our on-going assessment caused us to lower our forecasts. As aresult, we have had two further easings of monetary policy -- one in May and one in July.An important reason for the lower inflation forecasts was the better outlook for wages.You may recall that shortly after the previous hearing in May we received revised figureson earnings from the ABS that suggested not only that they were lower in the quarter inquestion -- the March quarter of 1997 -- but that an upward trend had been revised away.This better picture was confirmed again in the June quarter figures, but the picture hasbeen muddied somewhat by the recent September quarter figures which show anunexpectedly strong rise.On balance, therefore, we at the Bank judged that the information becomingavailable over the past six months was tending to confirm this relatively benign view of thefuture -- GDP growth of about 4 per cent (enough for some further reduction in unemploymentfrom the 8.8 per cent we had at the time of the last hearing) and inflation a little below 2 per cent(enough to justify the May and July easings in monetary policy).The picture was not all rosy -- the slower output growth of 1996 was still makingits presence felt in the form of sluggish employment growth in the first half of 1997, there weresome doubts about the strength of investment, and the effects of El Niño were around the corner.But economies nearly always present a mixed picture, and this mixture was a lot better thanmost. In addition, financial conditions had become clearly easier than in May. The overnightcash rate had come down from 6 per cent to 5 per cent as a result of the two easings of monetarypolicy, and yields on 10-year bonds were down from 7¾ per cent to 6 per cent. The exchangerate against the US dollar has come down from 77.7 US cents to 70.3 US cents; against thetrade-weighted index, it has come down from 60.2 to 57.0.I come now to the point where I should say a few things about what has beenhappening in Asia and the rest of the world. I will do my best to be specific, but you should bearin mind that the ground is constantly changing. The first thing I would like to say is that in thelong run I am still very optimistic about Asian growth prospects. These countries still retain a setof characteristics that are conducive to long-run growth:•they can still achieve rapid productivity growth through technology transfer, i.e., theyhave started from a long way behind and have a fair way to go;•they are oriented towards international trade;•they have high savings rates and high investment and a relatively small governmentsector;•they have generally sound fiscal and monetary policies -- although they have got someway to go in terms of the soundness of their banking and financial sectors; and•they have great respect for, and devote considerable effort to, education.I do not see the end of the Asian miracle, partly because I do not think it ever wasa miracle; it was just the application of some tried and tested rules of good economic policy. It isstill fortunate for our long-run prosperity that we have strong links to Asia.BIS Review   103/1997
- 3 -Having declared my optimism about the long run, I should now turn to the shortrun. Clearly, there are going to be difficulties here, in particular among four ASEANcountries -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. From the moment the Thai bahtwas floated on 2 July, attention quickly broadened to encompass these four. Their currencieshave fallen sharply, as have their stock markets and property prices. These countries arebattening down the hatches -- in two cases with the help of the IMF -- to sort out their problems.The principal problem, it is now apparent, concerns how to handle the fall of previouslyover-inflated asset prices, undisciplined lending by local banks and foreigners, and some veryopaque inter-relationships between business and government which have obscured the truefinancial position of a lot of companies and banks. There also appears to have beenover-investment in some areas. Property played its usual major role, but on this occasion therewere also more contemporary avenues, particularly electronics and semi-conductors, where thereis clear over-capacity and intense competition among these countries (and with Korea andTaiwan). Of course, these problems have been around for years -- they did not just start on 2July.A part of this adjustment must inevitably involve a sharp curtailment of growth inthe short run and a contraction of credit. Imports will fall, and so the effects will be spread toother countries. The good news for Australia is that these four countries account for only 10 percent of Australia’s exports. If the difficulties remain confined to these four countries, the effecton Australia’s exports, and hence our growth, would be modest.The rest of Asia is, in fact, a lot more important to Australia. Japan -- our largestmarket -- has been limping along at an average annual growth rate of about 1 per cent now forabout five years. Our exports to Japan have virtually not increased at all during that period. Theother big Asian markets for Australia are Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. These arecollectively much more important than the ASEAN four. Of course, some of the underlyingproblems that afflict the ASEAN four also apply, although more modestly, to some of thesecountries. For a time, it looked as though the ASEAN problems would spill over to these in a bigway, but that seems less likely now, although we should not speak too soon. Even so, we shouldbuild in the assumption of some slowing in aggregate for these countries.To judge the effects on Australia, we should, in principle, have a view on howeach country will fare in regard to economic growth, imports and the health of their bankingsystems (and we should look outside Asia, which I will do later). It is never easy and some surebets turn out to be wrong. For example, virtually everyone thought the simultaneous sharemarket crash of 1987 and associated company failures would presage at least a slowdown, if nota recession. In the event, 1988 turned out to be a boom year for the OECD economy and forAustralia.Let us hope we can be a little closer to the mark this time. Most analysis to datehas consisted of a relatively mechanical application of lower growth and lower imports amongthe ASEAN four to lower Australian exports and lower Australian GDP growth. The orders ofmagnitudes are quite small and the most commonly cited figure for GDP growth in Australia is areduction of about a quarter of a percentage point. According to press reports, the OECD hasrecently suggested figures of 0.3 per cent for Australia in 1997 and 0.4 per cent in 1998. Quitehow they got an effect on 1997, which we are already 80 per cent through, I do not know, but, asI said, I am only relying on newspaper reports. These sorts of figures can become considerablylarger if we also bring in lower growth rates for Korea, China, etc., but we are getting into therealms of speculation if we do so.BIS Review   103/1997
- 4 -The only guide that we have is that this will not be the first time that it hashappened. In 1984 and 1985 we saw a big drop in Asian currencies and a big drop in theirgrowth rates. It had the predicted effect and our exports to Asia for a time were quite weak.Again, last year -- in calendar 1996 -- there was zero growth of imports in the ASEAN four, andour exports to them slowed. I think we will have to put up with a period of weakness again.Frustrating as this instability may be, it seems to be an inevitable part of an open competitiveeconomic system which is the only type capable of achieving strong growth in the long run.So far I have only talked about Asia, but the outcome for the world economy willdepend on more than Asia. We have to bring in two bigger regions -- North America andEurope. North America (mainly the United States but also including Canada and Mexico) isgrowing quite strongly. The recent disturbances in financial markets which were imported intoNorth America from Asia do not seem to have had a lasting impact. If anything, their maineffect seems to have been to hose down some overheated asset markets slightly, and hence toreduce the likelihood of an imminent tightening of US monetary policy. Such a tightening in thenext six months cannot be ruled out, however.Europe is finally recording some gains after years of disappointingly slowrecovery from the early 1990s recession. In fact, European growth has picked up to the pointwhere six European central banks recently tightened monetary policy slightly to head offpossible inflationary pressures down the track.So far, I have talked about Asian and world economic events as though their onlyeffect on Australia was via our exports. Of course, that is only part of the story. The otherimportant part is that we now have to face the possibility of further financial market instability.For better or for worse, through knowledge or through fear, the international investmentcommunity is taking a more sceptical look at things Asian, and that includes all countries in theAsian region, including Australia. That means they have become more risk-averse, and morelikely to judge countries and their policies harshly. We have already seen some of the effects onsome Asian countries:•falling exchange rates;•falling share prices;•rising risk margins in interest rates;•downgrades by rating agencies.We are in a better position to handle this financial instability than we have been atany stage in the last 30 years. We formerly had a reputation as a boom-bust economy, andinvestors used to build in quite a large premium for risk when holding Australian assets. Wehave come a long way in convincing investors that this is largely a thing of the past. A goodexample of this is that our bond yields are now virtually the same as US bond yields, whereasfive years or ten years ago it was not uncommon for the gap to be as high as five percentagepoints; some of this was a risk premium and some of it reflected our higher inflation. Anotherexample is that the Australian dollar used to be one of the most volatile currencies in the world,whereas in the 1990s it has been no more volatile than the major currencies such as the USdollar, the yen or the Deutsche Mark.BIS Review   103/1997
- 5 -Over the past four or five months, this has served us well. While the Australiandollar has gone down a fair amount against the US dollar, it remained relatively steady intrade-weighted terms. It is true that over the last fortnight the Australian dollar has declined intrade-weighted terms, but it has done this in a relatively orderly fashion, and it is not anunreasonable market response given that our export markets have weakened.This new-found reputation for stability may surprise some people, because thereis still a tendency to read so much into the small month-by-month or quarter-by-quartervariations in economic statistics. But if we take a longer sweep, we can see how many of theeconomic problems that used to concern us have now been eliminated, or are at least under somereasonable sort of control. The headlines are no longer full of stories about the current accountdeficit or the level of foreign debt. The budget deficit is small. High inflation and its inevitabletwin, high interest rates, no longer fill the papers. This does not mean, of course, that we havesolved all our economic problems, but we have clearly narrowed them down. This has alsotended to concentrate minds on the one that remains -- namely, the level of unemployment.This is a reasonable priority because less progress has been achieved onunemployment than on the other imbalances in the economy that came to the fore in themid-1970s and persisted through the 1980s. It is not as though no progress has been made -- theunemployment rate has come down from a peak of 11.2 per cent to its present 8.6 per cent -- butit has been disappointing progress. With six years of the expansion now behind us at an averagegrowth rate of 3.6 per cent per annum -- the third highest in the OECD area -- we could havehoped for more. I think some further progress can be made over the next year, although we haveto accept that it will probably be slow, and monetary policy will only be part of the story -- inthe long run, only a small part. History suggests this will remain the case.Australia moved from 2 per cent unemployment to over 10 per cent in the decadefrom 1973 to 1983. The damage was really done during that period. Despite good output andemployment growth in the 1980s expansion, the unemployment rate was back to 11 per centfollowing the 1990 recession. So in net terms no progress had been made in a decade.What we want this time is good growth in output and employment, with adifference -- we want it to last a lot longer. The six-and-a-half years that the previous twoeconomic expansions lasted was not good enough. Although progress was made in reducingunemployment -- particularly in the second one -- it was all lost in the ensuing recession.This time around we must make sure we have a much longer expansion, reducingthe likelihood and severity of any future slowdown as much as possible. I do not know how thatwill be possible, but the surest way of ameliorating the business cycle in this way is to avoid theimbalances occurring during the later stages of the expansion. The main imbalance in Australia,as elsewhere, has always been the emergence of inflation. The story is never exactly thesame -- inflation can be accompanied by a wage push, an asset price boom or an externalimbalance -- but the result has been the same following each of the past three booms. That iswhy we need to have a more medium-term focus in our monetary policy and why the inflationtarget is such a central part of it. The inflation target is not anti-growth; low inflation is not anend in itself, we are interested in sustaining a good inflation performance because we areinterested in growth and employment. Keeping inflation in check is the key to longerexpansions.It has sometimes been said that we are too cautious in following this policy. Ithink that is a little unfair. Of course, we are cautious in that we like to look at a range ofBIS Review   103/1997
- 6 -information and think carefully before we make a move on monetary policy. But we try to beforward looking and pre-emptive. For example, we did not wait till measured inflation wasbelow 2 per cent before easing -- in fact, it was 3.1 per cent when we first eased in July last year.Similarly, there have been suggestions that the Reserve Bank has a speed limitabove which the economy cannot be allowed to grow (the figure usually cited was 3½ per cent).Such a suggestion is, of course, incorrect and I have pointed this out on several occasions. Incase there is still any doubt, you only have to look at our behaviour in 1997. As I said earlier, theeconomy has been growing at 4 per cent per annum so far in 1997, yet it did not stop us easingmonetary policy twice this year. If we are getting reasonable news on inflation and our inflationforecasts are in good shape, we have no objection to the economy growing by 4 per cent or 4 percent plus.When looking at the whole picture of employment and unemployment, monetarypolicy is only a small part of the story, and it mainly concerns the cyclical aspect ofunemployment. If you look at the really big changes in employment or unemployment overdecades, rather than years, monetary policy plays a very small role. The biggest change inemployment performance of which I am aware is the contrast between the United States andcontinental Europe. In the United States, the unemployment rate is back to its 1960s level,whereas in Europe it is about five times as high as it was in the 1960s. A few European countrieshave done better than that -- including the United Kingdom -- but others have done worse.If you try to explain the superior US employment result by faster economicgrowth you get nowhere. Europe has grown as fast as the United States over three decades -- itjust has not generated jobs. The explanations for the poor European performance on jobs allcentre around various types of rigidities, especially in wages and conditions of employment, butalso the social security system and the difficulties involved in starting businesses and thesubsequent lack of entrepreneurship.I do not intend to go into this in any depth because it is a huge topic. I only raiseit to point out that there is much more to the story than the growth of demand, and the role thatmonetary policy plays in it. In other words, even if we succeed in having good economic growthand sustaining it for a longer period than in earlier expansions, it will not solve all ourunemployment problems. We will make some progress, but it is too optimistic to think that wewill be able to emulate the Americans and return to the 1960s level of unemployment throughmacro-economic policies alone.I saw in the paper yesterday someone from ACOSS saying that the big challengefor Australia was to achieve US-style economic growth and low unemployment withoutUS-style inequality and poverty. I think this is a realistic way of looking at it. It shows anawareness of the current trade-off, and I suspect a hope that, with some ingenuity, we might beable to improve on it somewhat. My only quibble is that we already have achieved US growthrates -- in fact, exceeded them -- it is the US unemployment rate that has eluded us. This issomething that people like myself, who studied economics in the 1960s, find surprising. In the1960s it was the United States that was always criticised by countries like Australia and most ofEurope for their high unemployment. Now the boot is on the other foot.There is a lot more that I could talk about, but I will confine myself to only onefurther topic. That is the subject of bank lending and bank margins, particularly bank lending tosmall business. This is a subject that this Committee has taken a particular interest in. In fact, thefirst large-scale inter-country study of Australian banks’ margins and banks’ profitability wasBIS Review   103/1997
- 7 -undertaken by the Reserve Bank at the request of this Committee in August 1994. We didanother study at the Committee’s request recently which was published in our October Bulletin.As Committee members also know, the Reserve Bank has been meeting with its Small BusinessFinance Advisory Panel since 1993 to discuss the provision of finance to that sector. We formedthis Panel because we were worried that banks had become excessively risk-averse and werereluctant to lend to small business in the early part of the recovery from the 1990/91 recession.It has been a slow process, but competitive pressures have been gradually workingtheir way into banks’ margins, i.e., the difference between the average rate they earn on theirloans and the average rate they pay on their deposits. These margins are now lower than at anytime since we have been collecting the statistics, and the biggest fall has occurred over the pasttwo years. Clearly, the entry of mortgage originators into the housing market was a veryimportant development, and it led to the margin on housing lending falling from a level whichwas high by international standards to one which is about average. We are now beginning to seehotter competition in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Partly this is a result of theneed felt by many banks, particularly the regional ones, to reduce their reliance on the now muchless profitable mortgage market. In this sense, it shows how competition slowly works its waythrough the system. I confess that it has taken longer than I expected, and longer than I hoped,but we are finally getting there. That brings me to the end of my introductory remarks. We havecertainly had a very eventful period in the month leading up to this meeting and we have all beenworking hard to keep up with events, particularly in the international scene.BIS Review   103/1997

- 2 -about the profitability of investments and will not be distorted by unexpected exchange ratemovements. Comparing prices of the same goods in different countries will become much easieras they will all be expressed in the same currency. Competition will thus be enhanced.Monetary union will also most likely contribute to lower interest rates in at leastthose participating countries which now have interest rates above the average. This shouldfurther enhance growth prospects.All of these advantages depend of course on the belief that monetary union willbe a success. The likelihood of this happening is relatively high. The new ECB will have as itsprimary statutory goal price stability. In the performance of its task, it will enjoy a high degreeof political independence. Both factors are viewed today as important elements in the quest forstable prices which are a prerequisite for sound economic development. Stable prices can onlybe achieved when those responsible for monetary policy are in a position to take decisions basedon a longer-term view. Short-term activism, caused by an attempt to finetune the economy,invariably results in higher inflation, higher interest rates and a loss of credibility. Giving thecentral bank a clear goal and protecting it from outside interference is thus a basic ingredient ofa successful monetary policy. Viewed from that angle, the ECB is in a comfortable position.However, a good legal framework is not sufficient for ensuring a successfulmonetary union. The ECB must also be in a position to conduct a coherent monetary policy forall participating countries. There will no longer be a German monetary policy and there will nolonger be a French monetary policy: There will only be a European monetary policy. It will thusno longer be possible to conduct a monetary policy that is in tune solely with the economicsituation in a specific country. For a European monetary policy to be successful, the economicsituation in the member states of EMU must therefore be comparable. To put it another way: theeconomic situation in the participating countries should converge before EMU starts.The EU tries to achieve convergence by making membership of the EMU subjectto a country’s ability to satisfy so-called convergence criteria. Inflation and interest rates shouldbe low and in line with those in the other participating countries. The exchange rate should bestable. Last, but certainly not least, the budget deficit should be under control and the level ofofficial debt sustainable. Over the last five to ten years, most member states of the EU havecome a long way towards fulfilling these criteria. Inflation rates are at or close to historical lowsin various countries. The same is true for interest rates, where differentials have diminishedconsiderably. Much less successful was the quest for fiscal stability. Budget deficits in mostcountries are still too high and debt levels have often, instead of falling, risen over the last years.Without any doubt, the pursuit of the convergence criteria with a view to joiningthe EMU has been instrumental in improving economic policies in various member states of theEU. Who, for instance, would have thought ten years ago that Italy would today post an inflationrate lower than the one in Germany? Yet, despite the progress achieved over the last decade, twoproblems remain: First, convergence in important areas is still far from being satisfactory.Second, the convergence criteria require the aspiring members of the EMU to achieve certaingoals by spring 1998. But what about their future policies?There is a widespread belief in the economics profession that nominalconvergence -- as expressed by the convergence criteria -- is less important for a successfulmonetary union than real convergence. Real convergence encompasses factors such as labormobility, price and wage flexibility, exposure towards external shocks, industrial structures, andso on. Judged by these factors, convergence among future members of the EMU still has a longBIS Review   102/1997
- 3 -way to go. This is important because to be successful a European monetary policy dependsexactly on these factors. Without a high degree of real convergence, monetary policy is bound tohave different effects in different parts of the monetary union. The very idea of a singleEuropean monetary policy would thus become unrealistic. The ECB would come under politicalpressure to accommodate mutually incompatible wishes from different parts of the monetaryunion. The result could only be a less than optimal monetary policy and rising inflation andinterest rates. For EMU to be successful the member states of the EU should therefore makedetermined efforts to further real convergence.The convergence criteria as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty require memberstates of the EU to achieve certain goals by spring 1998. Convergence, properly understood, canhowever never be something that can be pinpointed to a certain point in time, but must be anongoing process. It does not make sense to require countries to get their fiscal situation undercontrol by a certain date, just to let them go unpunished on a public spending spree shortlyafterwards. Prudent fiscal policies should not only be a requirement for becoming, but also forremaining part of the EMU. What is necessary is not only a commitment to achieve fiscalstability at a certain point in time, but a commitment to conduct, from there on, a sustainablefiscal policy.The member states of the EU answered this challenge by agreeing on theso-called Stability and Growth Pact. The main goal of this pact is to ensure that countriesbelonging to the EMU continue to follow prudent fiscal policies after the start of the singlemonetary policy. Countries that deviate from the target will -- in certain circumstances -- besubject to fines which depend on the degree and the duration of the violation of the target. Thesesanctions will certainly contribute to a more prudent fiscal policy in the participating countries.They will also help in signalling to the public and the markets the determination of theauthorities to continue with fiscal consolidation.However, it is not clear whether the Stability and Growth Pact will be enough toensure fiscal stability. Stability is not something that can be achieved simply by institutionalizedsolutions. It can only be the result of the shared conviction of those that are involved in thedecision-making process and the societies behind them. Only time will tell whether this sharedconviction exists in the EU. Nonetheless, the Stability and Growth Pact is an importantingredient in the quest for a sustainable fiscal policy in the EU.The EU is -- as I have tried to show -- well poised to seize the opportunitiesoffered by EMU. There are, however, still various risks associated with the introduction of asingle currency. Two I would like to mention: First, problems related to the decision on whichcountries are allowed to participate right from the start, and second, problems related to thetransition period.In an ideal world, the decision on which countries can participate in EMU wouldbe based primarily on economic factors. Given the various expectations associated with thesingle currency, it is unavoidable that EMU is as much a political as it is an economic project.The decision on membership will thus be influenced by both political and economic factors. Asthe likelihood rises that some important countries will not be able to comply strictly with theconvergence criteria, political factors will become more important. A loose interpretation of theconvergence criteria for some countries would make it politically much more difficult to excludeother countries, which also miss some convergence criteria, from participating in the EMU.Depending on how well this selection process is handled, expectations about the future course ofmonetary policy by the ECB will be either positively or negatively affected. Should politicalBIS Review   102/1997
- 4 -factors unduly dominate economic factors, there is undoubtedly a potential for creatingexpectations about a less than optimal degree of political independence for the ECB. The ECBwould therefore face an uphill battle at the start of EMU. It would have to convince the publicand the markets even more than it would have to in more normal circumstances that it isdetermined and able to deliver price stability. This might involve a more restrictive monetarypolicy than otherwise required. Such an undesired development can only be avoided if thedecision on the initial members of the EMU is based on sound economic foundations.Once the decision on membership of the EMU has been taken, several monthswill pass before the ECB takes over the reins of monetary policy. This transition period will becritical in ensuring a good start for the single monetary policy. One of the most importantelements will be the determination of those exchange rates that will be used for convertingnational currencies into Euro. What might sound trivial is in fact a very difficult problem. TheEU intends to announce bilateral conversion rates at the same time it announces the participatingmember states. It is hoped that by so doing, market turbulence due to volatile expectations canbe avoided. Making these exchange rates public will mean that monetary policies of theparticipating countries will have to be coordinated several month before EMU starts. This willrequire much closer cooperation among the central banks involved than exists today. All thecompetent bodies in the EU have to make sure this cooperation is put in place. Otherwise,market turbulence, exchange rate fluctuations and a heavy burden on the new ECB would result.Neither the EU, nor, as a matter of fact, Switzerland can be interested in such a development.Like any other country in Europe, Switzerland has a vital interest in EMUbecoming a success. Switzerland’s economy is closely linked to the economy of the EU. Highgrowth in Europe is essential for a sound economic development in Switzerland, whereas alackluster economic situation in the EU contributes to sluggish economic growth in our country.The success or failure of EMU will thus directly affect our economic well-being. In fact, notonly our economic well-being, but also our ability to conduct a relatively autonomous monetarypolicy will be affected.Market turbulence during the transition period, uncertainties about the futuremonetary policy of the ECB and unfulfilled expectations about the stability of the new currencyand the degree of political independence of the ECB all have the potential to create an upwardpressure on the Swiss franc. An appreciating currency would make it more difficult for ourexport-oriented companies to compete on the world market and would increase the competitionfaced domestically from abroad. Should the Swiss franc appreciate to an extent that economicactivities in Switzerland were severely disrupted, we would have several courses of action opento us.The Swiss National Bank (SNB) could relax monetary policy in an effort tocounteract the effects of the strong Swiss franc on the domestic economy. Attractive as thisresponse may be, its major drawback is that we would have to walk a tight rope. Relaxingmonetary policy too little might not be enough to break the upward pressure on the franc;relaxing monetary policy too much might lead to inflationary tendencies later on.The dilemma faced by the SNB would become even greater should the pressureon the Swiss franc to appreciate become more pronounced. In such a situation, we could react bypegging the exchange rate of the franc to the Euro. A peg could either be temporary or the Swissauthorities could decide to link the Swiss franc permanently to the new single currency through afixed exchange rate.BIS Review   102/1997
- 5 -A permanent peg could do away with the problem of an appreciating currency. Itwould, however, have major drawbacks: First, we would give up our relative autonomy insetting the course of monetary policy in Switzerland. Monetary conditions in our country wouldbe determined entirely by the ECB. As a consequence, interest rates would rise close to the levelprevailing in the EMU. Adapting to this new level of interest rates would pose major problems,especially for the real estate sector and for those sectors of the economy which rely on lowinterest rates to finance their capital-intensive production. Second, choosing the right parity in asystem with fixed exchange rates is a very difficult task. A peg that would leave the Swiss francovervalued would force the SNB to follow a monetary policy that is too restrictive. Conversely,a peg that would leave the franc undervalued would lead to a monetary policy that is too lax.Third, as a rapid appreciation of the Swiss franc would most likely be the result of problems inthe EMU, it would be illogical to link our currency to an anchor currency whose stability isdoubtful and questioned by the markets. We would give up our record of stability in favor of ayet unproven monetary policy.A temporary peg would alleviate some of the problems associated with apermanent fixing of exchange rates. Monetary autonomy would be further restricted, but notcompletely lost. Interest rates would thus most probably not rise to the same level as in the caseof a permanent peg. However, by placing a temporary ceiling on the exchange rate of the Swissfranc, the SNB would lose -- albeit temporarily -- control over the money supply. It would thusrun the risk of triggering a subsequent rise in inflation. I would regard a temporary peg only as ameasure of last resort in the event of extreme exchange rate disturbances.It is sometimes argued that impediments to inflows of foreign capital might behelpful in fighting an appreciation of the Swiss franc. Historic evidence, however, lends littlesupport to this view. In the second half of the 1970s, Switzerland was confronted with a strongappreciation of the Swiss franc. To curb this appreciation, our authorities, among other things,tightened existing and introduced additional controls on inflows of foreign capital. Thesemeasures proved to be nearly ineffective as they were easily circumvented. Today, in anenvironment of even more integrated markets, the result would be the same. Introducing suchmeasures to combat an appreciation of the Swiss franc would thus be no solution.Consequently, the SNB would certainly be able to smooth excessive fluctuationsin the exchange rate should doubts about the stability of the Euro lead to portfolio shifts into theSwiss franc. However, in the face of extreme capital inflows, we would most likely not be ableto entirely insulate the domestic economy from harmful disturbances unless we were willing tojeopardize price stability in the long run. Therefore, Switzerland, like any other country inEurope, has every interest in a successful transition towards EMU and a stability-orientedmonetary policy by the new ECB.Let me finish with some thoughts on the consequences of the introduction of theEuro on payments executed in Switzerland. Two cases have to be distinguished: paymentsrelated to domestic and payments related to cross-border transactions. As regards domestictransactions, there is no reason to expect that the Euro would to any considerable extent replacethe Swiss franc as Switzerland’s main medium of exchange. The costs associated with using theEuro in domestic transactions will be and will remain higher than the ones associated with theSwiss franc. Historically, only in cases of extreme inflation have domestic currencies beenreplaced by foreign currencies as the main medium of exchange.Things are different as far as payments related to cross-border transactions areconcerned. In today’s situation, cross-border payments are executed through correspondentBIS Review   102/1997
- 6 -banks in each country. These payments are then processed through national payment systems.With the introduction of the Euro, this procedure will change for those countries that belong tothe EMU. Correspondent banks will no longer be necessary for payments executed in Euros asthe national payment systems will be directly linked through a system called TARGET.This development will put Swiss financial institutions at a competitivedisadvantage as they will still have to rely, for payments executed in Euros, on a less efficientsystem of correspondent banks. It would therefore be desirable to link the Swiss payment systemwith TARGET. To accomplish this, three conditions have to be fulfilled: The Swiss paymentsystem must be compatible with TARGET, it must be able to execute payments denominated inEuros, and the European authorities must allow the Swiss system to be linked with TARGET.The first condition is satisfied: The Swiss Interbank Clearing System (SIC) isfully compatible with TARGET. As regards the second condition, work is underway to create anEuro-SIC capable of executing payments in Euros. As regards the approval by the Europeanauthorities, a decision can only be taken once the ECB becomes operational. We would certainlywelcome a positive answer.BIS Review   102/1997
Mr. Tietmeyer asks whether the euro can assume the role of a majorinternational currency   Speech given by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. HansTietmeyer, at a luncheon at the American Express Company in Paris on 28/10/97.I.The “American Express Company” is not only a financial institution, but also a brand-name familiar throughout the world. The “American Express credit card” and “American Expresstravellers’ cheque” are acknowledged in most countries as safe and convenient means of payment,which facilitate not just travel. For decades past, therefore, “American Express” has been a symbol ofincreasing globalisation. There are not many other enterprises that can claim that.Today, however, I do not want to talk about payment instruments. Even so, myreference to the travellers’ cheque takes us straight to our topic: alongside the “greenback”, thetravellers’ cheque is likewise a symbol of the dollar’s status as the absolute Number One among thecurrencies of the world.II.A currency which serves at the same time as a unit of account, a medium of exchangeand a store of value -- for private investors and public monetary authorities alike -- is known as aninternational key currency.What are the pre-requisites that a national payment medium needs, in order to assumethese functions?Monetary history teaches us that the international role of a currency may oftendevelop spontaneously with the country’s political and economic significance. Hence it is notsurprising that, besides gold, the pound sterling played the overriding role in the internationalmonetary system for many decades. A well-functioning banking system and efficient capital marketshad evolved in the United Kingdom at an early date. The industrial revolution began in Great Britain,and helped the British economy to gain an edge over all other countries.The role of sterling was primarily based on the UK’s position as a great power, inboth economic and political terms. What is more, over a period of two centuries sterling did notdepreciate against other currencies. Once the significance of sterling started to decline, the dollar tookthe stage as the principal international currency. This was due not only to the US’ rise to the status ofa world power. Another important factor was that, for a long period, the dollar was far less exposedto inflationary pressures than other currencies.By virtue of the Bretton Woods system, the US dollar became the official keycurrency in 1944. It served national central banks as a benchmark currency, an intervention currencyand a reserve currency alike. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and given thedomestic stability problems in the United States, the dollar forfeited that formal function.Even so, it retained a leading role. As before, the United States remains the world’sleading industrial and trading nation. That is why dollars are so highly acceptable worldwide.Moreover, the magnitude of the US financial market ensures a wide variety of investment options.The decontrol of exchange rates, the increasing freedom of capital movements anddiverging stability records are the reason why other currencies, such as the Deutsche Mark, have beenBIS Review   101/1997
- 2 -able to establish themselves alongside the dollar -- albeit on a far more modest scale. After all,currencies, too, compete to an increasing extent for the favour of the international transactor.Besides economic significance, a dynamic economy and a sufficiently large economicarea (duly integrated in world trade), it is primarily monetary conditions that must be met. Aninternational key currency must be able to exhibit a successful stability record over a lengthy period.While the markets may forgive short-lived slips, long-term failures are penalised. The markets’memory often stretches back a surprisingly long way. They heed the faintest signs that a currency’sstability may be at risk.It is that which makes the credibility that the responsible monetary authority enjoys allthe more important. It has transpired that such credibility increases with the degree of independencefrom government instructions. If a central bank has to serve two masters, namely monetary stabilityand the promotion of economic activity, it usually comes to grief in both areas. Then its credibility iscompromised for a long while.III.The introduction of the euro marks a watershed, not only for the monetary situation inEurope but also for the global monetary system. Little more than a year before its plannedintroduction, the world’s financial markets are now wondering: will the new currency be strong orweak? Can it become a serious alternative to the dollar as a reserve, investment and transactioncurrency?In Europe, great economic and political hopes are being pinned on the euro. The oldcontinent is to be strengthened as a global economic power, European integration is to be fostered. Itis hoped that it will be possible to cope more effectively with the challenges posed by globalisation.Moreover, many people are hoping that the euro will constitute a significant counterweight to thepre-eminent dollar. That is what Jacques Chirac, the French President, said recently in an interviewhe gave to a German news magazine.But the crucial factor will be whether the euro turns out to be sustainably stable, andwhat the market expectations in that respect are. The institutional conditions for a stability-orientedmonetary policy in Europe are pretty well assured, thanks to the Maastricht Treaty and theindependent central bank envisaged therein. However, a good deal will also depend on theappointments to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Independence chiefly means theindependence of individuals.Among the European central bank governors in the European Monetary Institute,there is a broad consensus today about monetary policy objectives and strategy. That consensus mustbe preserved in the European Central Bank. That applies also to the view that internal stability haspriority over external stability. The external value of the euro is inseparably associated with theprecondition of internal stability: “stability begins at home”. But the crucial event for the newcurrency will be the convergence examination in the spring of 1998, and the selection of theparticipating countries.Only countries with virtually identical stability orientations and sufficiently soundpublic financial positions right from the start can accede to a durably stable monetary union. Theselection of the participating countries is therefore a matter of paramount importance. The vital issueis the sustainability of the convergence achieved and the necessary adaptability of the participatingeconomies to the constantly changing challenges. In this connection, special attention will be focusedon Germany and France, since monetary union is almost inconceivable without the participation ofeither of these countries.BIS Review   101/1997
- 3 -However, the task of achieving and maintaining convergence in anti-inflation policydoes not apply merely at the time of entry into monetary union. Even after that, the policy mix mustbe right. This is because, in the monetary union, we shall be pursuing a single monetary policy, but atthe same time largely national economic, financial and social policies.When adopting the Stability and Growth Pact in Amsterdam in June 1997, theparticipating states undertook “immediately to take corrective budgetary action if there are signs ofany considerable departure from the objectives of the stability and convergence programmes, andparticularly from the medium-term budgetary target of a nearly balanced or in-surplus budget, or if anexcessive deficit is in prospect.” That is a far-reaching undertaking.In the event of excessive deficits, the Stability and Growth Pact provides that theEuropean Council should automatically impose sanctions. The sanction mechanism is designed notonly to foster confidence but also to protect the single currency from unbridled public deficits and toprevent conflicts between monetary and fiscal policy. It sets strict limits to national financial policy.IV.An international key currency generally has to assume the function of an anchorcurrency. The markets expect it. In the present EMS this function has been, and is being, performedby the Deutsche Mark. In the case of EMS II, the exchange rate arrangement for those countrieswhich are not participating in the single currency from the outset, the euro is to perform this functionof an anchor currency.Furthermore, in future a strong orientation towards the euro is to be expected,particularly in central and eastern European countries. The euro will exert a strong attraction,especially on potential candidates for admission to the monetary union -- at any rate, if it provesstable.V.In themselves, however, the future larger economic area and credible compliance withthe convergence criteria will not guarantee that the euro actually, and above all globally, developsinto a serious alternative to the dollar. Ultimately, the real economic environment in Europe mustlikewise be right. The former Chairman of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank, AlfredHerrhausen, once said: “A currency becomes good if its underlying economy is also good”.At present the European continent is being handicapped, above all, by the high degreeof official regulation and the manifold inflexibilities on the labour market. In Germany, in particular,a confusing tax system with a high tax ratio is crippling economic dynamism. With respect tocompetitiveness, if Europe’s economy loses touch with other regions in the long run, this is bound tohave adverse effects on the euro as well. At all events, the euro will not in itself solve the structuralproblems besetting Europe.Worldwide locational competition calls for flexibility and the willingness to undertakestructural reforms. Nowadays these characteristics are distinctly more marked in the United Statesthan in most European countries. But there are some examples, on the old continent as well, whichwarrant hope.BIS Review   101/1997
- 4 -VI.In some quarters, the planned European monetary union is being viewed with concernthrough American eyes. That is understandable, for a soft euro -- let alone a failure of the monetaryunion -- is in the interest neither of Europe nor of the United States.But there are a number of reasons for hoping for a stable euro that can play a leadingrole in the international monetary system:•In Europe international investors find sophisticated financial markets encompassing a broad rangeof products and maturities. Structural changes in the international financial markets over the lastfifteen years have worked to the detriment of the dollar. They have resulted in a rising marketshare of European currencies.•Given roughly equal economic potential, the European Union is more closely integrated in theinternational division of labour than the United States. That suggests that the demand for euros asa transaction currency will be strong.•The European Central Bank will be independent of political instructions. It is committed solely tothe priority of internal monetary stability.•The potential for excessive budget deficits is strictly limited by the Treaty of Maastricht and theStability and Growth Pact.•The Maastricht Treaty has noticeably fostered stability-consciousness in Europe. Inflationperformance here is better than ever before. Only countries which can show evidence oflong-standing stability are supposed to participate in monetary union.•The euro can take up the torch from some illustrious currencies. That applies particularly to theDeutsche Mark -- today the world’s second biggest reserve currency, after the dollar.Of course, ultimately the development of the euro will hinge on whether it proveslastingly stable and to that extent can assume the legacy of those currencies which are already stabletoday. But all those involved are quite convinced: the euro has to be a success.Despite all the headway made up to now, however, a great deal remains to be done. Inthe forefront are the sustained consolidation of public finance and the dismantling of structuralrigidities. I am sure these needs are increasingly being recognised.Anyway, there is certainly a good prospect of the euro duly playing its role of beingan international investment, reserve and transaction currency alongside the dollar. That is, after all, inthe best interests of Europe, the United States and third countries alike.BIS Review   101/1997
Mr. Wellink discusses recent developments in the Dutch economy   Addressgiven by the President of the Netherlands Bank, Dr. A.H.E.M. Wellink, at the XXIst Europeanmeeting of the Trilateral Commission in The Hague on 25/10/97.Recent successAs you all know, the Dutch economy has been doing remarkably well lately. Overthe past three years, Dutch GDP has grown by an annual average of 3%, i.e., considerably morethan was the case in most major continental European countries. For this year and the next, theprospects for growth are even better. Growth has furthermore been attended by considerable jobcreation, averaging nearly 100,000 man-years per annum, or 1.8%, since 1995. The Dutchunemployment figure has consequently dropped to around 6%.All this is in sharp contrast to the picture presented by most countries on thecontinent of Europe. Until very recently, they were seeing no more than a moderate cyclicalrecovery. Still, this year the growth of output in these countries would seem to be acceleratingsubstantially. This has not yet, unfortunately, fed through to the employment situation. InGermany and France, for instance, unemployment is expected to rise even further this year. Theunemployment figure there is about twice that in the Netherlands.The Dutch upturn has drawn widespread attention, and has come to be known insome circles as the Dutch model. In my speech today, I will guide you through the roots of theDutch success. Let me start by saying that the recent favourable economic development isdefinitely not a miracle. It simply boils down to sound macro-economic policies andderegulation, in particular of labour markets (including some country-specific deregulationpolicies). Every country in the world can effectively copy it. The implementation of thesepolicies was possible because of a broad consensus in the Netherlands on their necessity. This islacking in many of our neighbouring countries. But to my mind this consensus among allrelevant parties was not caused by the so-called consensus model -- on the contrary. Theconsensus emerged after the consultative framework -- which had led to paralysis in the1970s -- was made much leaner. I will come back to that later. Let my first give you anoverview of the facts and figures surrounding the so-called “Dutch miracle”.Making up for lost groundTo see the developments of the last few years in their proper perspective, we musttake a look at the situation in the early 1980s. In those years, Dutch business was in serioustrouble. The international recession, when it struck, hit the Netherlands much harder than itsneighbours, because in the 1970s business sector profitability here had been structurally erodedby excessive rises in wage costs and the consequent deterioration of competitiveness. A viciouscircle of labour shake-out set in, leading -- via the social security system -- to higher socialinsurance contributions and thus contributing to further job destruction. The problem wascompounded by an inappropriate policy reaction to the two oil crises, in the form of anexpansive budget leading to unsustainable deficits (of over 10% of GDP) and, after some delay,to soaring central government indebtedness.The figures show only too clearly that in those years the Netherlands was muchworse off than other countries. In 1970, the Netherlands had still held the sixth place in Europein terms of per capita GDP (10% above the European average). But by 1988 it had fallen tobelow that average, and the Netherlands had dropped to the eleventh place. Looking at theBIS Review   100/1997
- 2 -figures for subsequent years, we see that the Netherlands has since regained some of the groundwhich it had lost earlier. In 1996, per capita GDP held the seventh place (at nearly 5% above theEuropean average). A similar pattern is in evidence for the employment situation; between 1972and 1983, job losses were much worse than in the rest of Europe. But here the relative recoveryset in around 1985. In other words, the Dutch success has until now been no more than anexercise in making up for ground lost earlier. In fact, we still have not caught up with Europe inall respects.Explanatory factorsIn my view, the turnaround which began in 1982-1983 can be ascribed to acombination of sound macroeconomic policy, as well as specific measures aimed at improvingthe operation of markets.•The gradual restructuring of public finance, starting in 1982 and resulting in a deficit of2.1% of GDP in 1997, compares favourably with those of most countries in the vicinity. Theintroduction of real expenditure ceilings at the start of this Cabinet has proved instrumental tothis success. Also, the better control of the budgetary process contributed to the outcome. It isgratifying that our efforts to achieve healthier public finances have mainly taken the form ofexpenditure cuts. The cuts have also made it possible to alleviate the burden of taxation andsocial insurance contributions. The positive evaluation made by the ECOFIN Council this springis a good incentive to strive over the next few years for a balanced budget. I will be going intothe need for that later.•The fact that since 1983 monetary policy has given absolute priority to stability of theguilder/Deutsche mark exchange rate is another contributing factor. That has enabled us toimport, as it were, the usually favourable price climate prevailing in Germany. Because ofmoderate wage developments at home, this exchange rate policy provided for real exchange ratestability as well, resulting in a favourable competitive position of our business sector. Thiscontrasted sharply with Germany, where excessive wage increases during the reunification boomcontributed to a substantial real appreciation of the German mark of about 12% between 1990and 1995. The real guilder appreciation was instead negligible. The policy also enhancedconfidence in the financial markets, which in turn contributed to a sustained decline of (the riskpremium contained in) interest rates. For over a decade, Dutch capital market rates have beenamong the lowest in Europe, making for an improved investment climate as well.•The wage restraint -- I mentioned it already -- ensuing from the much cited accord ofWassenaar (1982) was the third factor. This entailed a trade-off between the employers’organizations and the trade unions, the latter relinquishing automatic price compensation for ashorter working week. A condition was that business costs should not increase. It wasfurthermore agreed that wage negotiations would be decentralized. The process of wagemoderation was boosted further by the government-initiated alleviation of taxation and socialinsurance contributions. In the longer term, the results can be seen to be truly impressive. Overthe past fifteen years, unit wage costs have remained well-nigh stable in the Netherlands,allowing a recovery of profitability, and an improvement of the business sector’scompetitiveness.•The economy has moved towards greater market orientation, a goal which has been highon the political agenda since the beginning of the 1990s. The labour market was the first to betargeted, with social security legislation being amended to give the market mechanism greaterleeway. In the period from 1983 to 1990, minimum wages and social insurance benefits hadBIS Review   100/1997
been delinked from the general development of wages. A wide range of measures was directedat the lower end of the labour market, the aim being to stimulate businesses to employlow-skilled personnel by way of a reduction of social insurance contributions payable byemployers, wage cost subsidies and subsidized jobs. Furthermore, society has come to acceptflexible forms of labour, such as part-time working and temporary staffing, which have boostedthe expansion of the number of jobs in the services sector. In this respect, the Netherlands holdsa vanguard position internationally, with 40% of all work now being done on flexible contracts.Not only does this greater flexibility meet the needs of the business sector, employees, too, seemto find it suits their changing preferences. Global calculations show that the potentialemployment gains for other countries, if part-time jobs had developed to the same extent as inthe Netherlands, could be sizeable (around 3 million jobs in both Germany and France). Thesecalculations are highly mechanical and therefore one should be cautious in interpreting theoutcome. Nevertheless, I think that part-time work arrangements could be helpful in addressinga serious unemployment situation, under strict conditions, i.e., they are applied tailor-made anddo not increase businesses’ operating costs. So far the main result in the area of product marketimprovement has been the 1996 liberalization of the statutory establishment rules for businesses.With boundaries disappearing and new technology being developed all the time, we cannot butgo with the grain of the market on an increasing scale. We must always keep in mind that allcountries around us are doing exactly the same thing. Introducing new rules and amending oldones may be painful at first, apart from being time-consuming, but there seems to be nothing forit but to go on doing so, if we wish to maintain our prosperity in the longer term.With so much praise being heaped on the Netherlands and its consensus economy,people tend to forget that consensus about how a recovery should be brought about did notmaterialize out of the blue; in fact, it was enforced by the unfavourable economic developmentsduring the 1980-81 recession, which, as I noted before, hit us much harder than others.Ultimately, it was that very fact which compelled the employers’ organizations and the tradeunions to give up their entrenched views, views which had been characteristic of the 1970s. Thatepisode illustrates only too vividly that having a consultative framework for employers andemployees does not guarantee fruitful negotiations. The consultative process has beenstreamlined in the meantime. One could say that the “consensus model” of the 1970s has givenway to the consensus of the 1990s.Where do we go from here?For all our fifteen years of conducting a policy aimed at recovery, we cannotafford to indulge in complacency. Things may be going in the right direction, but we still haveseveral major long-standing problems to see to:• First, there is the continued high rate of economic inactivity. The low participation rateof our population in general is a major factor underlying our internationally modest position interms of prosperity. This applies especially to the older members of the labour force. More thanhalf of those aged between 50 and 65 do not hold a job. We should really be seeking to reduceour rate of economic inactivity to the levels prevailing in neighbouring countries.•Secondly, there is our considerable public debt. Although it has been falling in recentyears, our debt ratio (of over 70% of GDP) continues to be more than 10 percentage pointsabove the EMU criterion. A rapid further reduction to well below 60% is called for if we wish tobe able to cope with the growing burden which the imminent ageing of the population willimpose on public finance. In addition, as we have seen in the past, high debts make us moreBIS Review   100/1997
- 4 -vulnerable in the event of interest rate rises. European interest rates are currently low, but theywill not stay that way for ever.Our fundamentals are favourable. One major advantage is our structurally highsavings surplus, indicating that macro-economically there are no financial impediments to highergrowth. Furthermore, we seem to have scope for further growth, provided we succeed inharnessing the current labour reserve. To complete our recovery, we will need further budgetaryrestructuring and continue on the path toward greater market orientation.Policy conclusionsThis brings me to the concluding part of my speech: what can we learn from theDutch experience? There are five lessons which can be drawn from it.Firstly, monetary stability is an important ingredient of a stable economic climate.However, not only nominal but also real exchange rate stability matters. If relative price andlabour cost developments are out of line, a country’s competitiveness is seriously affected, evenif the nominal exchange rate remains stable. This is an important lesson with a view to EMUwhen nominal exchange rate stability is a given factor.Secondly, sound budgetary policy is not only about deficit reduction and cuttingexpenditure. It is about redefining the role of the public sector in an economy.Thirdly, more market pays off. We should not forget that the private sector is theengine of our economy. So why not give the market sector more leeway? Of course, always onthe basis of a good analysis of what can and can’t be done by the market.The fourth lesson is related to the latter. Policies geared at increasing labourmarket flexibility work. However, it is important to note that -- as far as labour market policiesis concerned -- there is no overall recipe which can be applied. Policies should be tailor-madedepending on frictions on certain parts of the labour market.Last, but not least -- and related to the fourth lesson -- reduction in working hourscan, under conditions, play an important role in an economy. In the short term, it simply boilsdown to a redistribution of work, without affecting the performance of an economy. However,redistribution of work can (in return for moderate wage claims) contribute to the necessaryconsensus between employee and employers organizations in an economy. And the latter doesimprove the performance of the economy in the longer run, as the Dutch experiences teach us.To conclude, there is not really anything new under the sun. The combination of economicpolicies which the Netherlands have opted for have been advised by -- for instance -- theInternational Monetary Fund for a long period. The issue is how to make society embark onthese policies; in other words, how to create consensus. Not by forcing all relevant parties into astalemate, but by creating an awareness that a certain combination of policies -- the five lessonswhich I mentioned before -- is beneficial for all parties involved.BIS Review   100/1997
Mr. Gaddum discusses Germany as a financial centre and the strengths of theGerman capital market of today   Speech by the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank,Mr. Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, at the Financial Centre Roadshow in New York on 14/10/97.1. Strengths of the German capital market of todayFinanzplatz Deutschland -- the financial centre Germany, which is the “home port” of theD-Mark -- is characterised by the long-standing stability culture of the Deutsche Bundesbank. And thefinancial centre Germany has benefited considerably from the currency’s stability. With the introductionof the euro everything will change. The financial centre Germany will lose its D-Mark bonus. However,it will gain the opportunity to display its competitiveness with the euro in a larger market. The banks, theGerman parliament and the Bundesbank have been working for years to increase the attractiveness ofGermany as a financial centre. With a view to the introduction of the euro, it is important to furtherstrengthen the competitiveness reached so far through additional innovations. It is essential to prepare forcompetition in the large European market. But we can say with some satisfaction that even today thefinancial centre Germany, which is the biggest and most dynamic financial market in continental Europe,is in a good position.Germany is currently the third-largest industrial nation in the world and, since Germanreunification, it has had the highest population of any country in the European Union; in the wake ofreunification, however, it has also changed from a capital-exporting country into a capital-importing one.The large current account surpluses which had prevailed until 1990 have turned into sizeable deficits.But the era of Germany’s current account deficits could soon be a thing of the past. Aftera seasonally adjusted positive balance was recorded in the second quarter of this year, I expect theGerman current account will show an annual surplus again in 1998 at the latest.BIS Review   99/1997
- 2 -The deficit on current account was covered in part by sales of fixed-ratebonds -- especially Federal securities -- abroad. In view of the D-Mark’s role as a reserve currency andthe high creditworthiness of the Federal Republic of Germany as a borrower (triple A rating), it isnot -- and never has been -- a problem for Germany to raise funds abroad. German banks are among thepremier credit institutions worldwide in all sectors of traditional banking business. In only a short periodof time they have diversified into new areas of business (investment banking, derivatives, etc.); here, too,they have meanwhile established professional and efficient lines of business.This trend has been and is being accompanied by modernisations undertaken at theGerman stock exchanges, which are acquiring new structures, opening up new markets and, in doing so,consistently put their faith in the use of electronic systems. Concerning the speed, security andcost-effectiveness of securities trading, the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse leads the field. It hasmade rapid progress towards full computerisation and soon will offer a trading platform which will betrend-setting in the European context. The tool needed for this -- XETRA (Exchange Electronic Trading)is currently being implemented. The aim of XETRA is to facilitate full electronic handling of stockexchange trading with up to 40,000 securities -- with a worldwide remote membership facility. This willmean lower costs, more efficiency and a high degree of liquidity.In this context the centralised securities settlement system of Deutsche Börse ClearingAG, the leading German stock exchange clearing house, deserves a mention. Its functionality and speed,together with its cost-effective settlement procedures, are unmatched internationally. In Germany,settlement is generally completed within just two days (T+2) -- if necessary, even on the same day; thatis faster than anywhere else. And, for the sake of security, they are working on cutting the time evenfurther. The question of deregulation proved to be a less pressing problem in the traditionally liberalGerman financial market than in other countries; however, in Germany, too, further steps in this directionwere necessary. Thus -- to cite just a few examples -- the securities transfer tax was abolished in 1990.Since 1992, foreign non-banks have been able to issue commercial paper denominated in D-Mark.BIS Review   99/1997
- 3 -In 1994 investors’ protection was reinforced by the establishment of the FederalSupervisory Office for Securities Trading and the legal ban on insider dealing. In 1994, too, genuinemoney market funds were admitted. In January 1997 minimum reserve requirements on repo transactionswere abolished. In March 1997 the new stock exchange segment “New Market” was introduced for smalland medium-sized fast-growing enterprises. Since May 1997, banks have been allowed to collateraliseand sell loans in the form of asset-backed securities. Measured by the volume of securities outstanding,the German bond market is currently the third-largest debt securities market in the world. Within Europeit leads the field.Approximately 40 per cent of the German government bonds outstanding are held byforeign investors. This shows that the long-standing benchmark position of German Federal bonds restson a sound real base. And it is surely not surprising either that, with a 42% market share, the trade inD-Mark-denominated interest-related products is the leading business in the European financial futuresexchanges. Annual net sales of fixed-rate bonds issued by German borrowers amounted to the equivalentof more than US$ 100 billion in each of the past few years. The primary and the secondary marketsexhibit a very high degree of liquidity, especially in respect of Federal securities.In order to maintain its leading position in the market, the Federal Government hasgradually streamlined its array of issue instruments. Thus, the maturity range was complemented both atthe short end (“Bubills”) and at the long end of the market (30-year bonds). The further fixing of issuedates has meanwhile led in effect to a regular issuance calendar over the entire year. The concentration onstandardised instruments and regular issue dates, in combination with re-openings of issues, ensures largeand liquid issue amounts. The introduction of stripping for Federal bonds is likewise part of the strategyto protect the Federal Government’s benchmark position. Whereas in the primary market the Governmentfocuses on certain maturity segments, by allowing the stripping of government bonds it offersinternational institutional investors facilities for investment along the entire yield curve.BIS Review   99/1997
- 4 -Some regional Land governments in Germany have meanwhile started to combine theirissues into joint bonds, which has proved to be rather successful. Another important segment of theGerman debt securities market is constituted by mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe) which, as “jumbo” issues,have met with a positive response in the international capital market for some time now. The picture iscomplemented by the German Financial Futures Exchange (DTB). Although it was established relativelylate, it has already conquered a major market position.In conjunction with MATIF in Paris and SOFFEX in Zurich, the DTB is seeking to builda joint continental European trading and clearing platform. Not least because of its efficient settlementand its electronic access facilities installed in foreign financial centres, the DTB offers global capitalmarket players access to all derivative business. In its efforts to catch up with the longer-establishedfutures exchanges, it has already made ground especially with the introduction of the Bobl future; in thisrespect, it has even surpassed LIFFE. The DTB’s range of products meanwhile cover maturities from onemonth to ten years. Contracts such as the 1-month and the 3-month Euro-Mark future and the future on2-year Federal Treasury notes are the most recent examples of the DTB’s market orientation.2. Further capital market improvements in the pipelineThe launch of European monetary union will change the operating framework in Europe.Thus, the D-Mark will cease to exist as an internationally renowned reserve currency. For the emergingsingle currency area and the larger single financial market, a number of European Union directives willhave to be incorporated into national law.You may rest assured that in doing so we will endeavour to further strengthen Germanyas a financial centre. These measures are being supported by practical considerations aimed at smoothingthe transition from the D-Mark to the euro for capital market players. The Federal Government will dojustice to its leading position as an issuer also by converting its marketable old issues to euros right at theBIS Review   99/1997
- 5 -start of monetary union on January 1, 1999. That will prevent any split in the market between D-Markand euro-denominated Federal Government bonds. In other words, large and liquid euro issues coveringthe entire maturity range will be available from the outset.With regard to the conversion procedures, due consideration has to be given, amongother things, to avoiding costs and to agreeing general practical rules in the interest of ensuring asmoothly functioning capital market. This includes a simple and relatively cost-effective concept forbonds in respect of the conversion of (even) D-Mark nominal amounts into (odd) euro amounts, i.e. theso-called 1-cent method. As far as equities are concerned, conversion is likely to be facilitated by theintroduction of stock based not on par values, but on divisible units. Thus an instrument which has longbeen common in the United States will be established in Germany, too.To put it in a nutshell: the German capital market is itself in excellent shape and is orwill be very well prepared for the future challenges.3. Trends in other market sectors3.1. Foreign exchange marketThe launch of monetary union in Europe will definitely have far-reaching consequencesfor the foreign exchange market, too. Monetary union will lead to the elimination of dealings incurrencies belonging to the European Monetary System. On the other hand, the odds are that theremaining foreign exchange dealings will concentrate further within continental Europe in favour ofFrankfurt.BIS Review   99/1997
- 6 -At a roughly constant level of trade in US dollars, German banks have been able toincrease their operations in sterling, Swiss francs and yen distinctly already during the past few years.And further growth prospects look likely. Another cause of optimism is undoubtedly that Frankfurt willcontinue to be the location of one of the three central banks which issue the major internationalcurrencies, i.e. the US dollar, yen and euro.3.2. Money marketIn the German money market, too, progress has been recorded in the past few years. Andthe Bundesbank has made a major contribution to that. The list is headed by the drastic lowering of theminimum reserve ratios to a level of 1.5% to 2.0% in several stages up to 1995. That has lessened theincentives to circumvent the regulations while preserving the instrument’s functional effectiveness. Sincethen the growth of short-term D-Mark-denominated deposits in the Euro-market has come to a halt. Thiseffect has been reinforced by the exemption from minimum reserve requirements of liabilities under repotransactions with maturities of up to one year, which came into force at the beginning of this year. Withina short period of time this measure fostered the growth of a repo market in Germany and led to a shift ofD-Mark-denominated repo business from the Euro-market, particularly London, back to Germany.The set of monetary policy instruments of the future European Central Bank are expectedto incorporate key elements of the Bundesbank’s tried and tested toolkit. And I am convinced that even ifthe minimum reserve instrument is likewise employed, solutions will be found which exclude anynegative effects on financial markets in the euro area, especially shifts to offshore financial centres.In comparison to the existing national markets, the money market in the euro area islikely to become considerably wider and deeper. The harmonisation of market practices which iscurrently being vigorously pursued will create a level playing field conducive to boosting competition. AEuropean Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) is to be determined by a representative selection of banksfrom the euro area as the benchmark interest rate for the financial markets. It will enhance the profile ofthe European continent and of Frankfurt against London’s Euro-Libor. The EURIBOR will establishitself as a major benchmark for derivative financial instruments such as options, futures, floating-ratenotes, etc. The fast, smooth and secure settlement of money market transactions is ensured by efficientpayment systems.One of the linchpins of the Bundesbank’s payment system facility is the FrankfurtElectronic Clearing System (EAF 2). This system is exceptional in that it combines theliquidity-conserving elements of a net settlement procedure with the risk-reducing features of grosssettlement systems. The second linchpin is the express electronic intercity credit transfer system knownas EIL-ZV. This gross settlement system will constitute the interface to the ESCB’s TARGET system instage 3 of EMU which links the national RTGS systems. Money market transactions within the euro areawill then take just a few seconds.4. Concluding remarkLadies and Gentlemen, as you can see, Finanzplatz Deutschland -- the German financialcentre -- is entering the European competition from a good starting position. We are in favour of an openexchange with other financial centres in Europe and are looking forward to this competition. No oneshould have any doubt that our ambition is to remain the best in those fields which we already lead andto become the best in those fields in which we are still trailing at the moment.Colour charts for this text can be found on the BIS Website (for address see last page)BIS Review   99/1997
Bank of Japan presents its quarterly economic outlook for autumn 1997   BANK OFJAPAN, QUARTERLY BULLETIN, November 1997 (advance issue).Summary1.Japan’s economic growth has been decelerating since April, partly reflecting theimpact of the consumption tax hike. Corporate sentiment has also weakened somewhat. However, thesupported by the rise in exports and business fixed investment.Among final demand items, public-sector investment has been declining, and housinginvestment has also dropped significantly, mainly reflecting the decline after the surge in demand prior tothe consumption tax hike. Personal consumption has continued to be sluggish on the whole, although theimpact of the consumption tax hike has gradually subsided. However, net exports and business fixedinvestment have been increasing. In these circumstances, excessive inventories are seen in someindustries such as in consumer durables, and industrial production has stayed virtually unchanged.Employment and income conditions have continued to improve, although the pace of recovery hasmoderated somewhat.Prices remained stable on the whole, excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike.Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have been relatively weak, reflectingeasy supply and demand conditions for construction-related goods. The year-to-year decline in corporateservice prices has slowed steadily, and the year-to-year growth in consumer prices (nationwide,excluding perishables) has been stable at around 0.5-0.6 per cent. Meanwhile, changes in land pricesvaried by type, and have not stopped declining on the whole.2.In the financial markets, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) stayed at thelevel slightly below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The long-term government bond yieldtemporarily rose to near 2.7 per cent at the end of May, but it followed a declining trend since then,reflecting the uncertainty about future economic growth. It has been moving at around the record lowlevel of around 1.7 per cent since early October. Stock prices also moved at a low level of around17,000 - 18,000. Meanwhile, the yen depreciated somewhat against the U.S. dollar as the contrastbetween Japan's and U.S. economic growth gained more attention. The yen has recently moved at around120 - 122 to the U.S. dollar.Growth in bank lending continues to be lackluster. Fund-raising activities through capitalmarkets fell below the previous year's level. Growth in monetary aggregates in terms of M2 + CDsyear-to-year average outstanding has continued at around 3 per cent.3.With respect to the outlook, public-sector investment is expected to continuedeclining, judging from the government's budget. On the other hand, net exports are expected to followan increasing trend, reflecting firm overseas demand and the depreciation of the yen to date, although thepace of increase will be slower than that recorded up to the second quarter.According to the Bank of Japan’s Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprisesof September 1997, the increase in corporate profits overall is expected to be maintained, albeit at aslower pace. While profits of small non-manufacturing firms are expected to decline owing to the declinein demand in addition to structural factors, those of large manufacturing firms are projected to continueon an increasing trend, largely supported by exports. In these circumstances, the pace of increase inbusiness fixed investment may slow down somewhat as investment in telecommunications is expected toremain unchanged after surging in the previous fiscal year. However, given that stock accumulation isnot excessive and demand for information-related investment is strong, business fixed investment willcontinue a steady increase.BIS Review   99/1997
- 2 -As for the household sector, the growth in bonus payments and overtime payments hasbeen slowing. This may suggest that the economic deceleration since spring 1997 has started to affecthousehold income. However, the significant deterioration of household confidence is unlikely to betriggered by these developments, as the current employment conditions are very different from those ofaround 1993 when the risk of severe employment adjustment was large. Also, the recent weaknesses inpersonal consumption and housing investment partly reflect the temporary factors, such as the reaction tothe front-loading of demand before the consumption tax hike. The downward pressure from fiscalpolicies is likely to weaken gradually in the near future. Therefore, once the impact of the consumptiontax hike subsides, an early recovery of household expenditure may translate into the positive cycle ofproduction, income and expenditure. Still, there are uncertainties about the recovery in personalconsumption, as consumer confidence is susceptible to psychological elements.4.With respect to price developments, domestic wholesale prices are likely tocontinue to be weak for the time being. This is because inventory adjustment pressures are being exerted,and the downward pressure from electrical goods prices caused by technological innovation remainsstrong, although the downward pressure coming from import prices has been subsiding. Meanwhile,corporate service prices will stay virtually unchanged, and consumer prices are likely to continue asimilar moderate rise.5.In sum, fiscal policies, including the consumption tax hike, continue to affectJapan’s economy, and the slowdown in domestic demand seems to have influenced corporate profits,employment and income conditions gradually through a deceleration in production activity.However, corporate profits and employees’ income have maintained their growth, although at asomewhat slower pace. Also, labor adjustment and capital stock adjustment pressures are not so large,and the risk of deflation is negligible. In light of this, the basis for economic recovery has not beenundermined. If household expenditure picks up and inventory adjustment pressures subside steadily, theeconomic recovery is likely to gather momentum again, albeit gradually. Given the cautious corporatesentiments and the uncertainty about future developments in demand, it is essential to monitor closelyfuture economic developments, particularly the pace of recovery in household expenditure, and theprogress in inventory adjustment.BIS Review   99/1997
Mr. Tietmeyer considers European monetary integration and its implicationsfor the international monetary system   Lecture delivered in honour of Professor XenophonZolotas, Honorary Governor of the Bank of Greece, by the President of the DeutscheBundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, in Athens on 17/10/97.I.The twentieth century does not lack for experience or lessons derived fromdifferent international monetary arrangements. Now -- just before this century comes to aclose -- Europe is about to embark on a new experiment with far-reaching implications: amonetary union of nation states with a supranational central bank.Some economists see this as things coming full circle. The century began with thegold standard. It will end with a monetary union. As at the beginning of this century, at its endthere will be a “denationalised” currency. Countries cannot produce this money more as they seefit. Whereas earlier this century they tied themselves to the availability of gold, in the futureEuropean monetary union the guardian of the currency will be a European Central Bank whichis independent of national decision-making and which is committed solely to the objective ofinternal monetary stability.Those economists who stress this historical connection generally take anoptimistic view of it. They expect the single currency to bring about an economic and politicalcommitment which is in itself strong enough permanently to compel the participating countriesto abide by the rules of the game. Without the option of altering the exchange rate and withoutthe option of an autonomous interest-rate policy, national monetary policy will not be availableas an instrument for correcting a current account deficit within the Union. The only possibilitywill be an adjustment in the real economy.According to this view, monetary union will have a strong disciplining effect. Itwill exert sufficient pressure on countries to tackle their real problems and to solve theminternally, too. To that extent, it will carry on those effects of the gold standard which areregarded as having been successful. This optimistic reference to experience of the gold standardFirst of all, one might ask how far that view idealises the way in which the goldstandard worked. That is something which historians may argue over. At all events, that era wasby no means a golden age. Be that as it may -- above all, the conditions for the functioning ofthe gold standard were different then. Countries’ government ratios were in the order of scarcelymore than ten per cent at that time. The adjustments that were necessary given a change incompetitive conditions -- which, naturally enough, primarily concern the private sector -- werespread comparatively widely over the major part of the economy.By contrast, the government ratio in many European countries nowadays isaround fifty per cent or more. Adjustment in line with market conditions is thus nowconcentrated -- more or less -- on half of the economy. Prices and wages were also more flexiblea hundred years ago; at any rate, more flexible than they are now in the majority of countries onthe European continent. And, above all, the government had a different perception of its ownrole. Its core tasks at that time were to frame and protect the domestic legal system and to pursuenational interests abroad.BIS Review   97/1997
- 2 -Nowadays, in the eyes of citizens and the electorate, the nation state and thegovernment have a much deeper and more general economic and social responsibility forgrowth, incomes and employment. It is, at any rate, very optimistic under present-day conditionsto assume that monetary commitment by the monetary union and the supranational central bankwould only have to be strong enough and that it would then be able to enforce any desiredadjustment needs automatically.What should not be overlooked is that abiding by the rules of the game dependson countries having an adequate capacity to be correspondingly flexible, just as it presupposesthe common political will to submit to those rules of monetary stability on a lasting basis. Thatfar-reaching economic and political dimension of monetary union should not beunderestimated -- precisely in the world of today and tomorrow. The abolition of the exchangerate is, at all events, an occurrence of far-reaching importance.II.The exchange rate is a price; one of the most important in an economy. Like allprices, its prime task is to manage allocation. Put in simple terms, this means that if theexchange rate is at a level which is appropriate to competitive conditions and if the fundamentaldeterminants -- such as differences in the inflation rate and productivity or the conditions ofdemand -- remain largely constant, then the exchange rate can and should be as stable aspossible, too. It is then that its information content is at its highest. And this also brings about ahigh degree of certainty in planning for economic arrangements.If, on the other hand, there is a change in the fundamental determinants, theexchange rate should realign as rapidly as possible -- unless an economy is in a position tocorrect disequilibria quickly and efficiently by virtue of its own adjustment measures. These tworequirements which exchange rates are expected to meet appear at first glance to pose a dilemmafor monetary policy.On the one hand, the exchange rate should be stable; on the other, it should reactas quickly as possible to fundamental imbalances. But, given appropriate policies, this is apseudo-problem. It is largely solved for a monetary policy which is guided by the internalobjective of stability; a steady policy geared to monetary stability helps in both respects. Itreduces volatility because it introduces calm into the markets. At the same time, it is the bestcontribution that monetary policy can make to keeping fundamentally forced exchange ratechanges at a low level and to strengthening flexibility and market mechanisms domestically.This pseudo-dilemma is then essentially solved for exchange-rate policy, too.That is because a country cannot in any case freely decide between exchange-rate systems -- say,more fixed or more flexible rates -- in line with its preferences like a visitor to a restaurantbetween different dishes on the menu. Fixed exchange rates presuppose the ability to cope withthat arrangement. It is therefore not a matter of whether one finds less flexible exchange rates, oreven their final elimination in a monetary union, “appealing” or “attractive”. The crucial pointis: fixed exchange rates must be feasible and, above all, sustainable under prevailing politicaland economic conditions.III.Post-war global and European monetary history was inseparably linked for aquarter of a century with the Bretton Woods system. In origin, it was a gold exchange standardwith fixed but adjustable exchange rates against the US dollar, for which there was an obligationto exchange currency for gold. At its inception there was, above all, the desire to overcome theBIS Review   97/1997
monetary conditions of the 1930s. Competitive devaluations, far-reaching import restrictions andexchange controls seriously hindered world trade and economic cooperation between countriesat that time. Against that historical backdrop, many economists rightly celebrated the BrettonWoods system as a great success.Without doubt, it put in place important groundwork for today’s high degree ofopenness in the goods and financial markets. Admittedly, a comprehensive assessment must notoverlook at least three problem areas. Firstly, even the Bretton Woods system displayed the“vulnerability” of almost all systems of fixed exchange rates. Current account imbalances werecombated too hesitantly. Corrections of exchange rates were made too late and often broughtabout new misalignments.Secondly, the years in which the system flourished have to be seen against thebackdrop of restricted convertibility. It was not until 1961 that most west European countriesintroduced full convertibility. And precisely in the United States, too, capital controls were afrequently deployed instrument into the 1960s. Incidentally, even the financial marketswhich -- from the present perspective -- were still not very developed at that time showed theirstrength in that situation. There was, on the one hand, the ability to bypass administrativeregulations. The Euro-dollar market came into being as early as the late 1950s, for example. Onthe other, there was the ability to exert speculative pressure on a currency with an exchange ratethat appeared no longer to deserve confidence.Thirdly, countries with a better domestic stability record than the anchor countryat that time, the United States -- such as Germany in the 1096s and early 1970s -- importedinflation through the fixed rate system. The expression “dollar inflation machine” was in use fora time. A firm anchor and a timely realignment of parities -- those are the basic requirements ofany stability-oriented system of fixed exchange rates.The European Monetary System established at the end of the 1970s hasperformed better than the Bretton Woods system in a number of respects. It has provided a bettersolution for the question of the nominal anchor -- without officially designating the D-Mark forthat role. Rather, it is a role which the D-Mark has acquired on account of its long-standingstability and its early convertibility.The parity-grid system permits the currency which is most stable on a long-termbasis to set the standard. The anchor in the ERM is a position which can be recalled, however.Admittedly, even in the ERM there have been times when exchange rates that had becomedoubtful have not been corrected in time -- as the events of 1992 and 1993, in particular,showed. At all events, it was possible to guide the ERM out of the crisis by a formal widening ofthe fluctuation margins and largely stabilise it in the ensuing period.IV.Despite a number of earlier reform efforts, the Bretton Woods system eventuallycollapsed in 1973. Since then, the exchange rates of most European countries and of Japan havefloated against the US dollar. By abandoning the fixed rates against the US dollar, monetarypolicy gained new freedom. From that time onwards, it has, above all, been able to pursue adomestic goal.The initial phase in the era of flexible exchange rates was clearly marked bydifferences in the domestic stance of monetary policy in a large number of countries. That wasapparent particularly in the 1970s when most countries were hit hard -- although to differingBIS Review   97/1997
- 4 -degrees -- by oil price movements. A number of countries -- including Germany -- wereprincipally concerned with restoring domestic monetary stability or with ensuring that it wasjeopardised as little as possible in the long term. Others attempted to use a relaxed monetarypolicy to cushion the adjustment needs of their economies caused by the oil price shocks.In line with that, there came to be wide differences between inflation rates. Thosedifferences had the following results. Firstly, the countries which gave priority to safeguardingmonetary stability adapted more quickly to the new conditions and also achieved better results inthe medium term with regard to the goal of employment. Secondly, a disparity arose betweenindividual countries in terms of the reputation and credibility of their anti-inflationarystance -- some of the effects of which are still felt today. Thirdly, the plan to realise a Europeanmonetary union which was initiated at the end of the 1960s at the Hague Summit founderedbefore a real political decision had been taken.The initial phase of world-wide flexible exchange rates thus up to now has twocrucial messages. Firstly, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to lasting growthand employment is a clear anti-inflationary stance. In the long term, jobs cannot be “bought” byhigher inflation. That was already true even in the 1970s when unemployment -- at least in manyindustrial countries -- was still predominantly cyclical in nature. That is all the more the casetoday when unemployment in Europe has largely structural causes. The permanentanti-inflationary stance of the monetary union is therefore an essential condition for Europe’sfuture success in creating and safeguarding jobs.Secondly, it would be disastrous for the monetary union if political differencesconcerning the role of monetary policy were to emerge as they did in the 1970s. That is becausecountries cannot pursue different monetary policies in the monetary union. That would lead topolitical conflicts -- with the European Central Bank, which operates supranationally, andprobably also between the political opinions that prevail at the national level.V.That first phase with -- in some cases -- high rates of inflation initially broughtthe system of flexible exchange rates into disrepute. The 1980s taught new lessons, however -- atleast following the change of course in domestic policy starting in France after 1983. Inflationrates gradually receded in many countries. This was a broad process. It took place in theEuropean countries which belonged to the European Monetary System. It also took place incountries without fixed exchange rates, however. Obviously, many countries changed theirorientation. External exchange rate pegging, such as to the D-Mark in the European MonetarySystem, certainly made that easier for some countries. But it also became apparent that whatmattered crucially in the final analysis was the political will for monetary stability.This reorientation was undoubtedly in part a reaction to the negative experienceof an inflation-accommodating monetary policy in the 1970s and early 1980s. At the same time,it was made easier by the fact that over the years, together with a clear-cut target, a number ofcentral banks had also gained greater independence. For that reason, the system of flexible (or, atleast, sufficiently, flexible) exchange rates is now regarded in a certain way as having beenrehabilitated. It is precisely on the condition of free movement of capital and financial marketswhich nowadays largely operate internationally that it can indeed exert pressure for a monetarypolicy geared to stability.Another hope of the supporters of flexible exchange rates is likely to remainunfulfilled, however: the hope that speculation will always have only a stabilising impact andBIS Review   97/1997
that, following a change in the fundamentals, the exchange rate will glide smoothly and gently toa new equilibrium level. In actual fact, the path taken by exchange rates is often quite bumpyand cannot always be explained convincingly even ex post. Overreactions are not infrequent.Obviously, expectations of future economic and political trends play a major role in theformation of exchange rates. Not only do they contribute to higher volatility because swings inmood often set in abruptly. They can apparently also superimpose themselves on current data sostrongly that misalignments may occur, at least for a while. The sharp appreciation of theD-Mark against the US dollar in spring 1995 was a development of that kind.Admittedly, a fair critic has to concede two mitigating arguments to the system offlexible exchange rates. First of all, it is undoubtedly too simplistic to blame the system forevery obviously excessive exchange rate movement of currencies whose rates are formedflexibly. There are some, for example, who regard the excessive trend of the US dollar in the1980s as the nightmare of the present global monetary system. But one has to recognise, ofcourse, what lay behind this. It was during that period that the resolute reversal in the Fed’smonetary policy under Paul Volcker coincided with the expansionary fiscal policy of the Reaganadministration. In particular, US fiscal policy stood in marked contrast at that time with Germanfiscal policy, which was on a course of moderate consolidation.It is quite possible to ask the question: “What other exchange rate arrangementwould have actually withstood those tensions?” If anything, fixed exchange rates wouldprobably have increased those tensions or would at least have politicised them more strongly.The Plaza and Louvre cooperation initiatives were probably the most that could be achieved atthat time, although it has to be said in passing that the results were by no means only positiveones -- as is shown by the example of the development of asset price inflation in Japan, whichwas encouraged at that time by an expansionary monetary policy, and its consequences -- fromwhich that country is still suffering.As a second line of defence it can be pointed out that world trade is developing ata furious pace despite flexible exchange rates between the major international currencies. Thatmay be due to the fact that incorrectly valuated exchange rates tend to correct themselves in themedium term. It may also be due to the fact that good possibilities are now available forguarding against sharp exchange rate fluctuations.This can take the form of hedging operations in the financial markets. It can alsotake the form of a diversification of production centres. To that extent, highly volatile exchangerates can influence not only trade but also direct investment. And that undoubtedly haslonger-term effects which should not be underrated. For that reason, exchange rates which are asstable as possible are, of course, important -- but more in terms of real rather than nominalstability. However, the question remains of how the objective of real exchange rate stability canbe achieved as comprehensively as possible. There is unlikely to be an answer which is valid forall countries and their relations with each other.VI.In the current debate in Europe the question is also asked repeatedly whether thefuture euro/dollar exchange rate will be more stable than, say, the present relationship betweenthe D-Mark and the dollar. Ultimately, this is an empirical question, of course. It can really beanswered only in the light of the monetary union. There are a number of considerations whichpoint in differing directions.BIS Review   97/1997
- 6 -The euro will probably have a larger and deeper financial market than theD-Mark. That means, first of all, that the price effects will tend to be slighter when assets areswitched by the individual investors and that the exchange rate will also be moved less as aresult. The larger euro financial market might, however, also lead to investors generallyregarding the euro -- more than the D-Mark now -- as a substitute for the US dollar. That mightincrease the desire to switch funds in certain situations. In that case, the exchange rate wouldtend to fluctuate more.At times, one also encounters the argument that the euro area -- as a largeeconomic and currency area -- will be relatively less dependent on foreign trade, particularly asthe structure of exports is heavily diversified. The outcome would be -- at least, according to thestandard textbooks -- that the euro/dollar exchange rate is not as important for Europe. Thisargument is undoubtedly fundamentally correct and also of significance. The comparison withother major currency areas -- such as the dollar area -- has only limited validity, however. Thehigh share of domestic transactions is not the only reason why the United States can, if anything,neglect the dollar’s exchange rate. It can also do that because its own currency area correspondsto its national boundaries. In the United States, not only is there a comparatively high degree oflabour mobility and flexibility in labour costs, there are also compensatory and cooperativemechanisms in the area of public finance at the level of national government. These are able tocushion remaining regional and sectoral tensions which cause major exchange rate fluctuations.The supranational monetary union in Europe has neither comparable mobility andflexibility nor compensatory mechanisms in the area of public finance. This, too, reveals, theparticular conditions of monetary union in Europe. In the European monetary unionasymmetrical effects will probably tend to lead more quickly to a need for real adjustment in thecountries or regions concerned.VII.The present world monetary system is, of course, not just characterised by themajor international currencies floating against each other. At the same time, many countrieshave entered into arrangements to peg exchange rates of varying intensity. There are essentiallytwo motives for this:Firstly -- particularly in the case of smaller economies -- the foreign trade motive.Countries want to strengthen their international economic integration with a fixed exchange rate.Secondly, the stability motive. By pegging the exchange rate, countries want toimport credibility for an anti-inflationary stance -- particularly one which is to be newlyestablished.The record of these arrangements is as varied as the forms of pegging themselves.A number of emerging countries and countries in transition have had mixed experiences ofpegging their exchange rates to other currencies. However useful it was for them in an initialphase to gain confidence in the international markets by pegging their exchange rate, it hasalmost always been the case that tensions have arisen and, unfortunately, often erupted after afew years if the trend in domestic competitiveness was not able to keep up with the anchorcountry on a long-term basis. That has become apparent not only for some countries in LatinAmerica and in eastern Europe but only just recently in South-East Asia, too -- especially ifexchange rates have not been adjusted quickly enough to changed competitive conditions. Theprospects of a pegging of exchange rates being successful have to be seen in the context of theBIS Review   97/1997
present-day international financial markets. Their impact on the permanence of exchange ratepegging is an ambivalent one.On the one hand, the international financial markets can make arrangements ofthis kind obsolete more or less overnight if the conviction disappears that the pegging will hold.On the other hand, they encourage strategies of this kind since they offer the countries the optionof financing quite sizeable current account deficits. Mainly two problems arise when pegging theexchange rate. Firstly, it may be that a country is currently achieving a comparatively high levelof monetary stability but the markets still doubt the country’s determination to persist with thatstrategy. In that case, real interest rates -- at least in a transitional phase -- are relatively high.Doubts about sustainability threaten to become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. That was atcertain periods the French problem with its franc fort policy. Secondly, it may be that a countryachieves a significant fall in inflation by pegging the exchange rate. But a certain -- if onlyslight -- inflation differential vis-à-vis the reference currency often stubbornly remainsnonetheless. That may be due to inflation expectations from the past which are not entirelyeliminated. That may also be due in part to a political deficit; a fiscal policy that fails to giveadequate support to the pegging of the exchange rate or an overgenerous domestic monetarypolicy in the light of capital inflows.Be that as it may, the outcome is that the currency gradually appreciates in realterms. The current account shows a chronic deficit. In a situation of that kind, a country mustconsider a strategy to find its way out. The fixed parity is not sustainable on a lasting basis, evenif the financial markets go along with it for a time. This implies an important message for theenvisaged monetary union in Europe since monetary union does not offer the possibility of away out.The requisite ability to achieve lasting domestic and external stability must beestablished and proven before entry in all the member states. That is what the entry criteria aimfor. It would be a risk to hope that a country’s necessary ability to achieve stability willgradually come about after entry into monetary union. Even if this were achieved over time,price competitiveness might already have been seriously impaired by then. And the catching-upprocess would be even more ambitious. There will, in fact, be certain regional differences ininflation rates within the monetary union. That is a normal process, to the extent that it willreflect differing trends in productivity or shifts in patterns of demand. Enormous economictensions would occur, however, if it were also a reflection of varying ability to achieve stabilityand hence to accept the supranational monetary policy. Sufficient anti-inflationary convergencemust therefore precede entry into monetary union, not the other way round. At all events, thereverse order would not be without considerable risks.VIII.It is desirable and beneficial to have as high a degree of exchange rate stability aspossible against the currencies of other EU and non-EU countries, too. Stable exchange ratesneed convergence -- either in the sense that fundamental deviations do not occur or in the sensethat existing imbalances are rapidly eliminated owing to a high level of flexibility in domesticprices and in the structure of the economy. In principle, that is a valid statement irrespective ofthe exchange rate system, in fact.It just happens to be the case that in the reverse situation -- if there is a lack ofconvergence -- the exchange rate system plays a major role. If exchange rates are flexible,divergence in anti-inflationary policy can increase volatility but it is less dramatic overall. Inturn, the degree of convergence is also lower, of course. The degree of convergence tends to beBIS Review   97/1997
- 8 -higher with fixed but adjustable exchange rates. If there is, nevertheless, no adequateconvergence, costs will depend on whether there is a timely realignment. If prompt action istaken, the consequences will be contained. By contrast, if the realignments take place only underpressure from the markets, high costs can easily arise -- not just for the country itself, by theway.A “case” like this can easily negate the credibility of a whole system or make theunilateral pegging of other countries -- even those in other continents -- more difficult. For thatreason the fact that the alignment of the exchange rates in ERM II is to be made easier than inthe present system is a positive development. It is to be hoped that this will prove its value inpractice, too, in future.The choice of the exchange rate system must, at any rate, be consistent with theeconomic and political conditions which obtain in the participating countries. A mixed worldmonetary system -- with floating key currencies, on the one hand, and regional integrationthrough monetary union and fixed exchange rates, on the other -- might not be the best of allhypothetical worlds. But that system is probably the one that corresponds most closely toconditions in the real world. It is not inherently a badly designed structure or a non-system.There can indeed be appropriate graduations of flexibility that are in line with the realities.IX.Understandably, the question is now frequently being asked: “What place will theeuro take in the future world monetary system?” The answer which is often given is the notionof a future tripolar system consisting of the dollar, the yen and the euro. That vision is, at least,not very accurate. If one wants to speak of a tripolar system at all, the weights in it will differquite considerably. Even now, it is becoming apparent that the yen’s potential relative to theother two currencies will, if anything, remain limited. At all events, in the foreseeable future itwill probably lack the regional base in Asia itself which the euro is likely to have in Europe.But the euro will first have to earn its position. That is because an internationalcurrency essentially needs three properties:•a high level of lasting stability•a strong base in the real economy•and efficient financial markets.The euro has the potential to fulfil those three conditions. But that will not occurautomatically. For that to happen, the preconditions have to be right.Replacing the dollar as the leading currency is, however, probably not on theagenda. Monetary history has shown that a key currency being superseded is ultimately due to aninternal crisis in the country in question. The former leading country loses the confidence of themarkets. The capacity for domestic stability diminishes. The economy becomes less competitive.That was also the history of the decline of the pound sterling as a global key currency followingthe Second World War.There are no indications whatsoever of a comparable development in the case ofthe US dollar. On the contrary, the dollar is a strong currency and -- despite a current accountdeficit and growing external debt -- the US fundamentals do not point to a change in thatsituation.BIS Review   97/1997
X.The euro and the dollar can enter into fruitful competition, however. The worldmonetary system as a whole will be able to benefit from healthy competition between twocurrencies which are geared to stability. There are three particular factors which would promoteproductive competition of this kind:Firstly, that the current high degree of correspondence in the anti-inflationarystance of the United States and Europe continues; secondly that fiscal policy in both the UnitesStates and Europe remains on a similar course of consolidation and -- particularly in Europe --achieves further progress; and thirdly, that both the United States and Europe fulfil theexpectations of meeting the economic challenges which they face.The United States must demonstrate that its high debtor position and hence itsfuture financial obligations are covered by the dynamism, efficiency and innovative potential ofits economy. The Europeans must show that they are making structural changes to tackle theproblem of unemployment and that they are improving their competitiveness in global markets.Productive competition of this kind does not imply a rejection of greater world-wide cooperationin economic and monetary policies with the aim of contributing to higher exchange rate stability.On the contrary, it is precisely in the future, too, that cooperation of this kind will be meaningfuland desirable.In saying this, what should not be overlooked is that exchange rates are not theactual operational parameters. Rather, they are the result of economic developments andeconomic policy in the participating countries. For that reason, there is one lesson which shouldconclude this lecture. It is perhaps as old as monetary history itself. A suitable monetaryframework can help a country to carry out the structural reforms which are needed. Being asubstitute for the adjustments which an economy has to make to changed conditions, however, issomething which monetary policy -- however good it is -- cannot do.BIS Review   97/1997
Mr. Heikensten considers inflation and the interest rate in Sweden   Speech given bythe Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the Sweden Financial Forum,Örebro, on 15/10/97.What I have to say is based in the main on the Riksbank’s latest inflation report, whichwas published less than a month ago. In some respects, I shall be developing what we said there aboutthe outlook for inflation, though our assessment of the situation is essentially unchanged. I shall begin,however, with some remarks about why monetary policy is constructed as it is, with the objective ofsafeguarding the value of money.1.  Monetary policy’s foundationsExperience advocates a stable environmentThe reason why the Riksbank’s objective is to safeguard the value of money is basicallysimple: low, stable inflation contributes to a good environment for the growth of production andemployment.Support for this view is readily found in the pattern of economic developments indifferent industrialised countries. In those countries where inflation has been allowed to accelerate,growth has normally been weaker and more erratic. We have seen this in Sweden. In the firsttwo-to-three post-war decades Swedish economic policy was characterised by stable rules and inflationwas low. Economic growth in those years was good and new jobs were created to a greater extent than inthe past two decades, when inflation shot up and there was a series of devaluation cycles.There is really nothing odd about this. We all know that stable conditions make it easierto arrive at wise economic decisions. When wages and prices chase each other in an unpredictable way,and both interest rates and the exchange rate fluctuate widely as a result of this, with a certain amount ofluck or smartness it is sometimes possible to do good business. But most people surely realise that this isnot the best setting for either long-term investment or for those who have to live on an earned income ora pension. The head of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has formulated his view of whatmonetary policy’s objective should be in roughly these words: inflation should be so low that economicagents do not have to worry about it.Limited room for employment policyWhy, then, are there those who still argue that higher inflation would be a good thing? Ibelieve this is mainly because they perceive a conflict between price stability and low unemployment.This perception in turn has its roots in a short-run, cyclical perspective. When economic activity is risingor falling on account of transitory demand fluctuations around a long-term trend, this negativerelationship does exist. Rising demand for goods and services generates increased demand for labour andlower unemployment; this tends to be accompanied by rising wages and higher inflation. The oppositealso applies.But this does not mean that higher inflation results in permanently higher employmentand lastingly lower unemployment. On the contrary, as a result of the economic setback that normallyfollows a return to an inflation economy, unemployment is liable to rise even higher. Against this itmight be argued that it is not a matter of giving inflation its head, but of allowing just a little moreinflation. Nor is it a matter of doing this as a systematic policy, but just for once. Once again, theSwedish experience in the 1970s and 1980s is both instructive and representative of what has happenedin many other countries. A little more inflation over a short period can very easily become inflation thatis high and persistent.BIS Review   96/1997
- 2 -In any event, in the longer run the level of unemployment is determined by factors otherthan the demand situation, factors such as institutions, rules and conventions in the economy and aboveall in the labour market and wage formation. If the causes of unemployment were in fact solely or evenmainly cyclical, then unemployment would not differ so greatly as it does between countries that are inthe same cyclical phase and have had much the same growth rate for a long time.Targeting inflationThe Riksbank has the objective of safeguarding the value of money. In practice, theRiksbank targets inflation. The target rate is 2 per cent (with a tolerance interval of –1 percentage point),assessed in annual terms. As there is a time lag of 1 to 2 years before an interest rate adjustment has itsfull effect on the rate of price increases, the Riksbank has to work with forecast inflation. When we havereason to fear that inflation is rising above the targeted rate, it will soon be time to raise the instrumentalrate and vice versa.Assessments of future inflation are presented by the Riksbank four times a year in theseries of inflation reports. The assessments are published as a guide to economic agents in their owndeliberations about what the future level of interest rates is likely to be. The reports also provide a basisfor the discussion of monetary policy’s construction that the Riksbank is interested in encouraging.Simplifying somewhat, inflation is determined by two factors: the situation concerningdemand and supply and economic agents’ expectations of future inflation. The first factor is fairlystraightforward; when demand tends to exceed what the economy is capable of producing, the resultantshortages and bottlenecks will normally push prices and wages up. The part played by expectations maybe less evident. If firms and employees expect increased inflation, they will tend to raise prices anddemand higher wages, respectively. This may be sufficient to start and continue an inflationary process.Another factor of importance for inflation is the value of the krona, both because it directly affectspricing and demand and because it can serve as an indication of expected inflation.2.  Economic activity and inflation expectationsNow for the assessment in our latest inflation report. First let me say something about theRiksbank’s appraisal of the economic situation.Demand and supplyThe statistics from recent months clearly point to an upswing in the greater part of theeconomy. This largely confirms the Riksbank’s assessments last spring. Developments to date in 1997have been more balanced than before. Demand growth is now coming not only from exports andinvestment, but to an increasing extent from private consumption as well.The growth of household income has been held back for some years by the programmefor fiscal consolidation. Activity has been further depressed by the need to cut spending on publicactivities. The fiscal withdrawal of household purchasing power is continuing both this year and next, sodisposable income is largely unchanged in 1997, but will rise in 1998. After that, when the consolidationprogramme has been completed, fiscal policy is not expected to be as restrictive on households. Someincrease in public activities can also be expected in the coming two years.After rising for some years at a rather modest rate, private consumption has picked up inthe past year. Households’ expectations concerning their own as well as the national economy improvedin September after a minor setback in August. Households are also more optimistic about the outlook inthe labour market. Moreover, the August survey by the National Institute of Economic Research showsthat firms in both everyday and infrequent trade are optimistic about sales trends in the near future.BIS Review   96/1997
- 3 -It is not just disposable income that determines private consumption. The appreciation ofwealth in the past year is probably important, too. Since the turn of 1996, house prices have risen 9 percent and share prices 28 per cent. This suggests that in 1997 households could realise capital gains thatmay reach the equivalent of about 25 per cent of disposable income. It would be surprising if such anincrease in wealth did not contribute to stronger consumer demand.To sum up, most signs point to a good development of demand in the years ahead. In anexpanding world market, export growth should continue to be relatively high. The Riksbank also countson an accelerating increase in private consumption and at least an end to the fall in public consumption.The broad increase in all the major demand components naturally exerts some pressureon the available resources. This implies rising capacity utilisation and a decreased availability ofunutilised resources. The business tendency surveys for manufacturing, which provide information aboutcapacity there, consistently indicate that unutilised resources fell from the first to the second quarter. Anincreased proportion of firms reported that output was being restricted by production factors rather thandemand. This was accompanied by rising shortages of skilled workers and salaried technicians.An important, though elusive, indicator of inflationary pressure is the gap between totaldemand and total output. Most indicators suggest that this gap has become somewhat smaller. In theinflation report, however, the Riksbank judges that the supply of unutilised resources is still relativelygood. It is not least the high level of total unemployment that indicates this. A high rate of investmentand rapid increases in productivity have contributed, at least to date, to an expansion of potential outputto meet the growing demand. This has eased inflationary pressure during the upswing.Inflation expectationsAnother important indicator of inflationary pressure is the expectations of economicagents about future inflation. Along with actual inflation, these expectations have declined in recentyears. They also show a tendency to converge around the 2 per cent inflation target. If this is the case, itis a good sign because it can be seen as increased confidence in the inflation target. This means that to agreater extent, economic agents are basing their own plans on expectations of low inflation, whichprovides better conditions for monetary policy to fulfil the inflation target.In recent months the expectations of future inflation have tended to move up, but thisseems to be mainly an adjustment to the increase in registered inflation. The tendency, however, must beclosely watched; a clear increase in inflation expectations above the inflation target would give cause forconcern.3.  Inflation in the coming yearsIn the course of 1996 CPI inflation decreased markedly and the annual level wassomewhat below the lower limit of the tolerance interval. Transitory factors partly explain the drop.Falling house mortgage interest costs, occasioned in part by the Riksbank’s own interest rate cuts, playeda large part in the low inflation figures. The trend has now turned and the rate of inflation is beginning tomove up. But the main reason for this is that the transient downward factors are no longer at work to thesame degree; the increase in underlying inflation is therefore more subdued.In the light of the assessments of economic activity and other factors that affect inflation(e.g. inflation expectations), in the inflation report the Riksbank forecast that annual CPI inflation wouldbe around 1 per cent in 1997 and around 2 per cent in both 1998 and 1999. Some acceleration wasenvisaged in the latter two years.The assessment carried some reservations. Matters discussed in the report included therisks associated with rising activity, the difficulties in knowing how the supply side would react and theBIS Review   96/1997
- 4 -coming round of wage negotiations. There may be reasons for elaborating on that discussion in somerespects.Output gap closing by degreesIn the inflation report the Riksbank considers that Sweden’s gross domestic product willgrow by around 2 per cent in 1997 and around 3 per cent in 1998. In 1999 the GDP growth rate isexpected to be rather more than 3 per cent.This implies that in 1998 and 1999 growth will be stronger than the increase in potentialoutput, for which the annual trend is estimated to be just over 2 per cent. That means that today’s surpluscapacity will be activated by degrees. It is difficult to tell how quickly this will happen. The Riksbankconsiders that the output gap -- a way of attempting to gauge unutilised capacity in the economy as awhole -- is currently about 2 per cent of GDP. With the growth rates envisaged above, the gap wouldthen close some time in 1999.Other information with a bearing on when inflation might be likely to accelerate was alsoincluded in the inflation report. Estimates of structural unemployment and thereby, indirectly, of the levelof unemployment that can be combined with stable, low inflation, suggest that risks of inflation alsoexist less than two years ahead. The rate at which capacity utilisation rises may likewise play a part. Arapid reduction of unutilised resources might generate inflationary impulses even though there is still acapacity surplus at total level.Risks in the wage negotiationsWage formation is particularly relevant at present because the settlements that are due inthe coming six months will cover a large part of the labour market. Labour shortages are not yet beingreported from more than a few sectors, but experience shows that the domino effects can be substantial.The Riksbank’s assessment of inflation in the latest report is based on an assumption thatthe rate of wage increases will be lower than in recent years. Support for this assumption can be found,for example, in recent wage statistics. The report, however, does not envisage a downward shift to, oreven below, the level that has prevailed in the European Union in recent years, a shift that would make iteasier for Sweden to tackle unemployment.Wage formation is primarily a matter for the labour market organisations to arrange. Thelevel of wage increases that different segments of the economy can cope with depends, for example, onthe initial profit level, together with the development of that segment’s productivity, costs and prices. Forthe economy as a whole it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if an effective reduction ofunemployment is to be feasible, a rate of wage increases which equals the inflation target plus expectedlong-term productivity growth represents a ceiling. Lower wage increases would make labour cheaperrelative to capital investment and would thereby stimulate employment.It is important to understand today’s rules for economic policy. In keeping with thesituation a quarter of a century ago, when Sweden was participating in the Bretton Woods system, whichwas a functional and efficient arrangement with fixed exchange rates, for some years now the rules of thegame have been clear. If the Riksbank judges that inflation will rise above the 2 per cent target, it is up tous to raise interest rates. Consequently, excessively high wage increases will not lead, except possibly inthe very short run, to higher inflation. Instead they will result in weaker economic activity and loweremployment in the years ahead. In the earlier situation with a fixed exchange rate, excessively high wageincreases primarily affected manufacturing and other parts of the economy that are exposed tointernational competition. Today the effects will be felt in particular by sectors that are sensitive tointerest rates, such as distributive trades and a debt-burdened public sector.BIS Review   96/1997
- 5 -4.  Conclusions for monetary policyThe overall assessment in the inflation report is that the monetary stance is wellbalanced. Today there is no reason to modify that conclusion. In the past month there has been noappreciable change in the outlook for inflation.After the interest rate increases in Germany and other countries almost a week ago, manypeople have asked how this affects the Riksbank’s actions. As stated already on several occasions, theanswer is: not much as long as the conditions for inflation have not changed. The Riksbank targetsinflation and it is this target that guides policy.In view of what has happened in the past month, there is reason, finally, to highlight acouple of points in the report. The first is that monetary policy is being conducted against the backgroundof an economic upswing. A gradual increase in capacity utilisation is therefore probable. Sweden doesnot differ from Germany in that particular respect. The other point is the diminished risk of adevelopment that is appreciably weaker than in the main scenario; this assessment is supported by thelatest statistics.In the light of the rising activity, the main difficulty in assessing future inflation currentlylies in an uncertainty about developments on the supply side, wage formation in particular. It is difficultto foresee how the Swedish economy will react to a broad economic upswing. It is therefore important,not least on that account, to analyse incoming information.BIS Review   96/1997
Mr. Grenville considers Asia and the financial sector   Talk given byMr Stephen Grenville, a Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the 10th AnnualAustralasian Finance and Banking Conference in Sydney, on 4/12/97.The Managing Director of the IMF described the Mexican economic problems of1994/95 as “the first crisis of the 21st century”, with the implication that this was something newand, more ominously, perhaps there would be more of them. Before the new century hasdawned, there has now been a series of similar problems, concentrated in the region of mostinterest to us -- East Asia.This is relevant to a conference on finance and banking, because the financialsector in each of these countries has been the key factor in the crisis and is central to itsresolution. Those who spend time thinking about financial sectors and how they evolve overtime may find some interest in examining what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how itmight be put right. It is also of considerable importance to Australia -- not just for the effect onour economy (which is hard to quantify at this stage), but also for the opportunity it presents forAustralia to deepen its engagement with the region.What went wrong?The problems in Asia, like the Mexican crisis of 1994, exhibit a variety ofsymptoms, with the most prominent being large falls in exchange rates and equity markets. Butexchange rate changes of this size are not unknown in other countries which have notexperienced the trauma currently underway in Asia. In Australia in the mid-1980s the exchangerate fell by 35 per cent, and in the early 1990s it fell by close to 25 per cent. Nor is thisuncommon internationally. Even the mighty US dollar went up and down by amounts like this inthe mid-1980s. More recently, Japan, between April 1995 and April 1997, experienced adepreciation of similar size. These exchange rate changes may well have been a trigger which setoff a chain reaction of other events. But by themselves, the exchange rate changes would havebeen an uncomfortable policy problem, not a crisis.An uncomfortable problem became a crisis because the weakness in the exchangerate infected the financial sector. This occurred through a variety of channels -- in some cases,banks had borrowed heavily in foreign currency; more often, the borrowers were the non-bankbusiness sector. As the exchange rate fell, their burgeoning foreign exchange obligations pushedthe enterprises under water, and they defaulted on their debts to the domestic banking sector. Atthe same time, foreign lenders, who had felt protected by the foreign currency denomination ofthe loans, now realised that a fall in the exchange rate increased their credit risk, and so theypulled credit lines or failed to roll over short-term debt.This exchange rate shock impinged on financial systems which already hadfracture lines and structural tensions. There were a number of specific weaknesses -- connectedlending, government-directed loans, poor credit evaluation, lack of transparency, and inadequateprudential supervision. The situation was sustainable if growth and capital flows weremaintained, but was not sustainable in the harsh world in which we live, where confidence isfragile, capital flows are flighty, and the stabilising forces of the “fundamentals” are slow toassert themselves.BIS Review   113/1997
- 2 -Why did it happen?The first point that should be made is that the praise which had been heaped onthese countries for several decades is entirely understandable. These countries have been highsavers, budgets have been balanced or in surplus, inflation has been reasonably well contained,and exports had been the dynamic driving-force of growth (with the globalisation that thisimplies). They ran high current account deficits because, however much they were saving, theywere investing even more. Who could, ex ante, have criticised the broad-brush developments inthe financial sector? Open capital markets were a merit-badge of economic maturity and arequirement for entry into the industrial-nations’ economics club -- the OECD.Not only were these markets generally opened up and linked in with internationalcapital markets, they embraced this eagerly, including the latest sophisticated products of thefinancial sector. Equity markets burgeoned and the arcane products of Wall Street were readilyavailable. International agencies urged further and faster deregulation, commercial financialinterests (domestic and foreign) were eager to stake out a role for themselves in the fast-growingsector, and sophistication in financial products was seen as being as important as having thelatest in industrial technology.While it is easy enough now to see the fracture lines and lack of resilience ofthese financial sectors, it was less easy to predict the outcomes beforehand. The transition from aregulated financial system to a deregulated financial system is intrinsically difficult. Under thebest of circumstances, it was inevitably going to be accompanied by false starts and mis-cues.The pace of growth of credit is difficult to evaluate in a world where you would expect it to begrowing quickly because financial repression (McKinnon’s phrase) is ending. The transitionleaves the financial system quite fragile during the process. There is a fair bit of evidence thatproblems have arisen for almost every country during the transition, with the problem usuallytaking the form of excessive lending as each institution in the deregulated financial sectorcompetes vigorously for its share in the new world. In the process, poor loans are made and assetprices are bid up.These two things come together in mutual reinforcement when the problems cometo a head. Lenders who had used collateral as their main loan-evaluation technique find theirsecurity to be illiquid and inadequate. At the same time, it is almost inevitable that the process offinancial deregulation will run ahead of the capacity of the prudential supervisors to devise asuitable regulatory framework. To start with, the climate of deregulation is often inimical to theregulators. This was certainly our experience in Australia during the 1980s: as we tried to put inplace the basis of some “rules of the game” for the new deregulated financial sector, manypeople who should have known better were calling this “re-regulation by the back-door”, andcriticising us for being out of sympathy with the brave new world of deregulation.This experience seems to have been repeated elsewhere. Managers at all levelshave been dealing with products and systems with which they are unfamiliar (but to admit thiswould disqualify them from participating in this exciting new world), and commercialimperatives encouraged them “to boldly go where no man has gone before”. As we look at theproblems of foreign currency borrowings in some of our Asian neighbours, one might recall thesimilar experience with Swiss franc loans in Australia during the 1980s, with the (fortunate)difference that these were, in a macro sense, quite small for Australia.There is another difficult issue here for the authorities. Even when problems wereidentified, there was the classic dilemma well known to prudential supervisors -- do you “blowBIS Review   113/1997
- 3 -the whistle” on the problem and precipitate a crisis (for which you will surely be blamed), or doyou quietly work behind the scenes to try to avert the perceived problem, in the hope that youwill succeed or the problem will go away of its own accord, but knowing that if it doesn’t, it willbe a bigger problem than if you had precipitated it early on. No credit is given for precipitating acrisis early, but there is plenty of blame for being present at the scene of the crime. So it is notsurprising that there was, beforehand, a certain amount of hand-wringing about financial sectorweaknesses, but this was muted background noise in the general enthusiasm to embrace the newworld.What might be done?The first point that should be made here is that the main burden for getting thingssorted out again clearly rests with these countries themselves. The related point here is that, forsome, (to borrow the catch-cry from positive-thinking management texts) “this isn’t a problem,it’s an opportunity”. For some of these countries, the process of institutional reform may be likepunctuated development in evolutionary theory, where progress takes place in jerky stages, witha crisis such as this causing people to focus on the issues and to reform weaknesses. In this view,countries can come out of this trauma stronger than before. It seems quite likely that somecountries will be better than others at turning these problems into opportunities.While part of the reaction to these problems must be institutional strengthening ofthe financial system, there remains a question whether the broad thrust of macro policy -- and,by implication, the spanking rates of growth which these countries have achieved over the pastcouple of decades -- is sustainable. To put this more specifically, is it possible to achieve thesorts of integration with international markets, the large inflows of capital which went with thisand the rapid transformation of economies, without leaving these economies vulnerable to thesorts of changes of sentiment that we have seen in recent months? The constraint on growth isnot the conventional one of resources and technology. The constraining factor here is just howresilient can the financial sector be made: the more robust it can be made, the faster thesecountries will be able to travel.We know the historical experience of Singapore, which ran current accountdeficits averaging 10 per cent of GDP for more than two decades. We know, too, that this wasan important element in the extraordinary progress that Singapore has made. We know,however, that large current account deficits were one of the elements which made the otherASEAN countries vulnerable in recent years (and this vulnerability has always been a concern inAustralia, too, despite the academic case that current account deficits resulting from privatesector decisions were matters between “consenting adults” and therefore not something withwhich policy should concern itself).Analysts have pointed to the problems caused by the US-dollar-fixed exchangerates that prevailed in these countries until recently. They argue that, if exchange rates had beenallowed to appreciate, credit growth would have been better contained and the economy held ona tighter rein. Greater exchange rate flexibility is surely an element in the new policy regimes.But the lesson of recent months is that, once a fixed exchange rate is freed, it can move by largeamounts. Over-shooting is par for the course. All the more reason why a resilient and robustfinancial sector must be in place if flexible exchange rate regimes are now the norm.Much of this involves careful, slogging, time-consuming institutionalimprovement -- making accounting systems better, tightening up legal and bankruptcy systems,BIS Review   113/1997
- 4 -improving disclosure, and strengthening and deepening experience in prudential supervision.One point that might be noted is that some capital flows seem to create more vulnerability thanothers, so there is a case for discouraging short-term flows and encouraging directinvestment/equity and longer-term bond flows.The best talent in these countries should go into the core financialinstitutions -- principally banks -- even if this means that the latest whiz-bang innovation of thefinancial rocket scientists remains unexploited. This is not to argue for stepping back fromfinancial development -- on the contrary, these countries must move forward to deepen markets.But the resources should go into design and implementation of a robust financial architectureand -- to continue the analogy -- useful design parameters are simplicity, a strong basic structure,and attention to detail.One useful objective is to put the banking system in a central position as theguardians on the gateway of investment. If a project has to pass the scrutiny of a bank which willhold the loan on its balance sheet, there is still no guarantee of success, but maybe the chancesare improved. What is clear is that private businesses have mis-assessed the risk they faced,tempted by attractively-lower foreign currency interest rates but not sufficiently aware of theneed to worry about the variance of the prospective cash flows. An experienced banker mighthave helped. Of course, this will only work if the banking system is allowed to do its job,untrammelled by connected or directed lending. Banks cannot provide “due diligence” scrutinyon loans which they were required to make.The first priority, always, is to get the banks -- the core of the financialsystem -- sorted out quickly. The need is to keep the process of financial intermediation flowing:it is the life-blood of the real business sector. The problems are not, in fact, examples of somenew “crisis of the 21st century”: they are, at heart, the old problems of bank collapses and theremedy is, in principle, well established. Restoring confidence is the critical factor and for this(as Bagehot observed) central banks should “lend freely, but at a penalty rate”. Insolventinstitutions must be separated from the solvent, dealt with, and the remaining institutionssupported.None of this is easy. Intractable problems of moral hazard exist, but this shouldnot be allowed to paralyse action. Serious money will be required to fix the problems.Experience over the past couple of decades shows just how expensive these financial sectorrescues can be. The 1994 Mexican problems have cost about 12-15 per cent of GDP; the Nordiccountries spent 4-8 per cent of their GDP fixing their problems a few years ago; even the S&Lproblems in the United States (merely a small sub-group of the financial sector) cost around3 per cent of GDP to sort out. But the cost of failing to address these problems decisively can bemore painful still -- a long drawn-out period of financial introspection and inertia which severelyretards real activity. A positive point is the strong fiscal positions (and therefore low governmentdebt outstanding) of these countries, so the capacity to fund the restructuring exists.All this is, clearly, largely a matter of domestic policy, with the costs to be bornemainly by taxpayers in these countries. In a more speculative vein, let me return to the idea thatwhat we are witnessing is a problem of the 21st century, and acknowledge that, while what wesee has many of the characteristics of an old-fashioned financial sector crisis, it has oneimportant new element -- the major role played by international capital flows. Domesticfinancial intermediation takes place within a broad set of “rules of the game”, laid down byprudential regulators. There is no international analogue of this. Over time, it can develop, ascountries implement consistent rules of prudential supervision, perhaps along the lines of theBIS Review   113/1997
- 5 -BIS Core Principles. This might -- together with better information on private capital flows andcross-country position-taking -- provide a response to this new element of the currentproblems -- the role of large-scale capital flows.What relevance is it to Australia, and to this audience (Australian and overseas)?We acknowledge our stake in the outcome, with two-thirds of our exports going to East Asia(including Japan). Australia is taking part in the IMF-co-ordinated facilities for Thailand,Indonesia and Korea. These funds help restore confidence and help the process of adjustment.We will use our relationships -- via our regional central bankers group EMEAP and, in duecourse, the newly-formed Asian Surveillance Group -- to provide examples of how prudentialsystems work elsewhere, analysis of how the specifics might be done in particular countries,technical assistance where it can be useful, and -- the most difficult and subtle task ofall -- understated and understanding support for the reform elements who have the task offashioning a stronger financial sector.A last word directed specifically at this audience. Some of you come from thecountries involved: I wish you well in the vital task ahead. For the rest of us, is this, too, not aproblem but rather an opportunity? The countries to our near north are going to be devotingconsiderable resources to strengthening their financial sectors. I hope some of you will find arole for yourselves in this process, and by doing so will look back on this as an opportunity tostrengthen our links with our northern neighbours.BIS Review   113/1997
Mr. Yam looks at the future of Hong Kong as a financial services centre forChina and the Asian region   Speech by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, Mr. Joseph Yam, JP, to Coopers and Lybrand Financial Services Conference in HongKong on 28/10/97.I have been asked to speak on Hong Kong’s role as a financial services centre forChina and the Asian region. As you know, many of the economies of the Asian region, includingof course the mainland of China, have been undergoing a rapid process of financialliberalization. This has brought tremendous benefits to the region, through providing themechanisms for channelling savings into investments, domestically and internationally, thuspromoting growth and development of the region. The process has brought substantial risks tothe region as well, as clearly you have witnessed in the past few months when financial turmoilspread in the region.2. Notwithstanding the financial problems now being faced by the region, thebalance of opinion is still firmly that financial liberalization is of long-term benefit. The correctresponse to such problems is clearly, at least for the immediate future, to take the right medicineand implement the necessary economic adjustment programmes, prescribed if necessary by theInternational Monetary Fund. Indeed, this has very much been the focus of recent attention whenone looks at individual economies in this region that have been subject to financial turmoil. Butprevention is always better than cure. Much attention will also be required, in the fullness oftime, to make sure that the financial systems through which financial intermediation takes placeare robust so that the benefits of financial liberalization could be maximized and the associatedrisks could be minimized and prudently managed.3. As a financial services centre which operates with a highly liberal regime,Hong Kong has important roles to play in all this. There is not enough time to go into detailshere on this occasion, so I shall just identify three general areas for your consideration.4. The first area concerns financial intermediation within individual economies, inother words, the channelling of domestic savings into domestic investments. Here Hong Kong,at this stage at least, largely only plays an advisory role. The less liberalized financial systems inthis region are very much dominated by domestic financial institutions, particularly in thebanking market. Further, domestic politics and a desire to protect domestic financial institutionsfrom undue competition are such that liberalization to admit foreign financial institutions to takepart in domestic financial intermediation would only proceed at a pace dictated by theseconsiderations. For example, it will, I think, take some time and patience for Hong Kong-basedbanks to gain a physical presence in the mainland of China, be allowed access to renminbi5. But Hong Kong’s expertise in developing markets, in building the marketinfrastructure and, where necessary, in regulating markets and supervising market participants touphold the efficiency and integrity of financial markets is there for everybody to see and tap.Furthermore, we know the region, and particularly in the case of the mainland of China, I wouldargue that we know a lot more than others, and so we are in an advantageous position to performan advisory role. And the financial community of Hong Kong, including the regulators, havebeen actively playing that advisory role. I can speak from experience here, although it would notbe appropriate for me to be too specific. In many of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’sBIS Review   112/1997
- 2 -contacts with, for example, our counterparts in the mainland of China, the subjects fordiscussion are increasingly on financial affairs in the mainland rather than those in Hong Kong.6. I believe that in performing this advisory role effectively we will open upopportunities for the financial services industry of Hong Kong. As markets are built andliberalized in these neighbouring economies, I am confident that our own financial institutionswill gain access to the business in those markets through establishing a presence there, andeventually compete, I hope, on a level playing field with the domestic financial institutions. Inany case, the need for a physical presence with a large branch network in the provision offinancial services may soon become a thing of the past with the advancement oftelecommunications and information technology. It is still early, I think, to come to a definitiveview, but the prospects are that electronic money and the use of the internet for banking andother financial services are breaking down geographical boundaries. Barriers to entry andrestrictive practices may lead to the diversion of business to offshore markets in locations withliberal practices.7. The second area concerns financial intermediation in the internationaldimension, involving the flow of savings into investments across international boundaries. HongKong as a financial services centre has a business role of providing the markets, in banking, debtand equity, supported by other efficient financial services and the rule of law, to facilitate theinternational flow of funds in this region. Our markets have the freedom, the liquidity and theintegrity to attract international investors managing institutional savings to come here and thosein need of funds to raise them here. The opportunities in this region, in particular in China, areenormous, and international investors would have a preference to operate in markets in whichthe rules of the game are transparent and familiar to them, and are of internationally acceptedstandards. And that means coming to Hong Kong.8. The banking market in Hong Kong is of course a very international one, with atotal of 182 licensed banks, 151 of which are incorporated outside Hong Kong. 81 of the largest100 banks in the world are licensed in Hong Kong. Collectively they provide a wide range ofbanking and other financial services, not just for Hong Kong but for the region as a whole. Thebanking sector of Hong Kong is reputed to be amongst the most efficient and profitable in theworld.9. Hong Kong’s debt market, which has developed quite rapidly in the past eightyears, is also playing a significant role in the region. Financial intermediation through the debtmarket is still relatively underdeveloped in the region, but the prospects are good. As the verysubstantial savings of the region is increasingly institutionalized through the establishment ofprovident funds and pension funds, the demand for debt securities would grow, perhaps muchfaster than that for banking and equity instruments. At the same time, the huge investmentsenvisaged for the development of the physical infrastructure in the region will require much debtfinancing, thus increasing the supply of debt securities. With the first class infrastructure in ournewly developed debt market, Hong Kong is in a very favourable position to take advantage ofthese good prospects.10. Hong Kong’s equity market is of course one of the largest and most liquid inthe world, and, notwithstanding recent volatility, is the favourite market for institutionalinvestors and for those wishing to raise funds. One popular area recently is, of course, the use ofHong Kong’s stock market for raising funds by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Up to lateOctober, 38 enterprises from the mainland of China have made their initial public offerings inHong Kong in the form of the issue of “H” shares. These shares were bought by investors bothBIS Review   112/1997
- 3 -in Hong Kong and overseas. It is important to note that when mainland enterprises sought to belisted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, they are required to comply with all the listing rulesand other relevant regulations in Hong Kong. No favouritism or preferential treatment has beenor will be given to mainland companies. Thus, in addition to fund raising, the listing of mainlandcompanies in Hong Kong facilitates the upgrading of corporate governance of these listedcompanies in line with the international standards practised in Hong Kong. Through this process,Hong Kong has also played a strategic role in the reform of the state-owned enterprises in themainland.11. The third area concerns the management of systemic risks arising from but notlimited to financial liberalization in this region. There is clearly identified a need for muchgreater monetary cooperation in this region, and here Hong Kong has been actively playing, andhopes to continue to play actively, a promotional role. We have been instrumental in promotinggreater Asian monetary cooperation, not just in the more visible efforts to deal with the financialturmoil we all are facing, in one way or another, but also the upgrading and standardization ofsupervisory practices, and the building of the financial infrastructure of this region to facilitatesafe and efficient international financial intermediation in this region. Our ability to play thisrole no doubt enhances Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, which isconsistent with the requirement laid down in the Basic Law.12. We took the initiative on the wake of the Mexican crisis in early 1995 to drawthe central banking fraternity of this region together to talk about Asian monetary cooperation,which led first to a set of bilateral agreements for the provision of liquidity to each other in caseof need. This was followed by the establishment of three working groups to share knowledgeand expertise on financial market development, central bank operations and banking supervisionissues. Separately, we are also promoting the establishment of linkages of the financialinfrastructures of economies in this region, such as payment systems and debt clearing systems,to facilitate the efficient and safe flow of funds amongst ourselves. These efforts will havelong-term benefits for the region, both in terms of the maintenance of financial stability and thedevelopment of the financial sector.13. While important progress is being made, this has recently been overshadowedby financial turmoil in the region, and the focus of attention has as a consequence been divertedto the provision of credit to assist Asian economies in need in making structural adjustments. Wehad the financial package for Thailand, and there have since been many ideas put forward for ageneral facility of some sort. These are being actively considered and we are taking an activepart in the discussion, although there are currently still quite significant differences of opinion.The position that we are taking is that whilst regional solidarity is highly appropriate for a regionwith increasing economic, trade and financial integration and increasing interdependence, anyregional financial arrangement must be structured with regard to international standards andpractices. It would not be appropriate, for example, for a regional institution, if there is to beone, to prescribe medicine, along with financial assistance, that is different from thoseprescribed by the International Monetary Fund. It would immediately be seen as a soft windowfor financial support, thus creating moral hazard problems. I am hopeful that well-structuredarrangements will emerge in due course. Certainly the climate is right and the momentum isthere.14. Perhaps I should take this opportunity to put the recent financial turmoil inAsia in a global perspective. First, the world is in very good economic shape. World economicoutput is estimated by the IMF to expand by 4-4½% in 1997 and 1998, the strongest pace in adecade. In the OECD countries, especially in the US, there is solid growth with low inflation,BIS Review   112/1997
- 4 -while we are seeing signs of broad-based recovery in Europe. Only in Asia have we seen aslowing of growth, but the growth rates have still been high by world standard and last yearJapan grew by 3.6%, the fastest since the late 1980s.15. Second, because of high global liquidity and low inflation, asset marketsaround the world are at record levels. Capital flows have increased with globalization, and addedto record high stock and bond prices. The fact that Europe has recently raised interest rates, andthe Fed is considering whether to pre-emptively raise rates to prevent wage-push inflation, hasmade the financial markets much more nervous despite the growth environment. This explainswhy the financial volatility in Asia has become global in nature. It is very flattering to know thatHong Kong can move even the mighty US and European markets, as much as the other wayaround.16. Third, Asian fundamentals, and especially Hong Kong fundamentals, arestrong. But there have been different degrees of strength in Asia with respect to thefundamentals. The adjustments in exchange rates of currencies in this region reflect partly themarket perception of fundamentals. But as I said recently at the Per Jacobsson lecture, there isno perfect exchange rate regime. Some economists think that a shift from a rigid exchange rateregime to a free float would result in lower interest rates to ease the interest rate pain. However,recent experience in Asia has shown that the market demands even higher interest rates thanbefore under a floating rate regime due to the need for hedging, since there is a perception ofhigher credit risks and exchange rate risks.17. I interpret the currency turmoil in the region not as exchange rate volatility,but as a painful but necessary adjustment in the real economy (manifested through the financialsystem and markets) to the new world of greater competition. In essence, we must all workharder to get greater productivity gains to meet the new challenge. No one can afford to becomplacent in this global world. To the extent that the free market is demanding higher interestrates because there is a reverse flow of capital from Asia to the OECD markets, we will all haveto bear the pain and adjust accordingly.18. And not all interest rate pain is bad. Higher interest rates would increasesavings in Hong Kong and bring inflation down further, thus increasing our competitiveness. Tothe extent that higher interest rates would reduce house prices, they would also make housingmore affordable.19. The currency board system with a fixed exchange rate is appropriate for asmall and highly externally-oriented economy like Hong Kong. It further imposes a strictdiscipline on public finances. Hong Kong runs budget surpluses, not deficits. On the other hand,a floating exchange rate adds huge volatility to the businesses of the external sector of theeconomy, requiring further costs in terms of hedging. A volatile exchange rate by contrast doesnot have quite such serious implications for a large and relatively less externally-orientedeconomy like Japan, where external trade accounts for less than 20% of GDP. In Hong Kong,with external trade accounting for 285% of GDP, a volatile exchange rate creates hugeuncertainties for much of our livelihood, thus undermining our fundamental competitiveness.20. Hong Kong has always understood that there is no free lunch. We have built up our strengthsand our savings through sheer hard work. If there is greater competition out there, we will adjustour quality and our skills accordingly. As accountants in a service economy, you know very wellthat you cannot price yourselves cheaply in order to compete. Our reputation depends on ourability to deliver quality service that is value for money. This is the strength for Hong Kong. LetBIS Review   112/1997
- 5 -me conclude by merely giving you the assurance that our linked exchange rate system, whichhas served us so well in the past 14 years, is here to stay.BIS Review   112/1997
Bank of Japan’s November review of monetary and economic trends inJapan   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 26/11/97.Japan’s economic growth is decelerating further. Although corporate profits,employment and income conditions continue to improve moderately, weak householdexpenditures since April have gradually begun to affect production, and corporate sentiment isalso weakening.With respect to final demand, public-sector investment has been decreasing, andhousing investment has also dropped significantly. Personal consumption has continued to beweak on the whole, although the impact of the consumption tax hike has gradually begun tosubside. On the other hand, net exports have continued to increase and business fixed investmenthas been rising moderately against the background of the increase in corporate profits. Excessiveinventories are seen in some industries. Owing to weak final demand and inventory adjustments,industrial production has recently declined somewhat. The pace of improvement in employmentand income conditions has slowed somewhat. Prices have remained stable on the whole, with theexception of wholesale prices which have declined somewhat. The growth of monetaryaggregates has recently slowed.Personal consumption has continued to be weak on the whole. Outlays for travelhave been increasing moderately, and there are some signs in the sales of goods which suggestthat the impact of the consumption tax hike has gradually begun to subside. However, sales atdepartment stores and supermarkets have been below the previous year’s level, while passengercar sales have fallen below the level recorded in the second half of fiscal 1996 when salessurged, and have not even recovered the levels recorded before then.Among leading indicators of business fixed investment, machinery orders havecontinued on an increasing trend since early 1997 after having surged in the second half of 1996.Recently, however, orders from non-manufacturing firms have been weak. Construction floorarea has followed a moderate recovery trend, albeit with some fluctuations.With respect to housing investment, housing starts in terms of theseasonally-adjusted annual rate declined in July to 1.24 million, the lowest level since September1985, following the surge in demand in the second half of 1996 ahead of the consumption taxhike. Housing starts have since remained weak at around 1.3 - 1.35 million.Regarding public-sector investment, the amount of public works contracted hasfollowed a decreasing trend reflecting the restrained budget for fiscal 1997.Against the background of steady overseas demand and the yen’s depreciation todate, real exports remained high in the third quarter 1997, although they decreased somewhatfrom the second quarter when exports showed a significant rise. Real exports rose again inOctober. Real imports, on the other hand, have remained virtually unchanged on average. As aresult, the real trade surplus has been increasing with some fluctuations. Reflecting thesedevelopments in exports and imports, the nominal current-account surplus has also beenexpanding significantly since April 1997.Industrial production has recently been somewhat weak. Production in the thirdquarter 1997 remained virtually unchanged on the whole. This is because production has beenBIS Review   112/1997

Production in October and November is expected to decrease as aresult of inventory adjustment pressures.With respect to labor market conditions, the unemployment rate has remained at ahigh level, and the ratio of job offers to job applications has recently eased somewhat. Growth inovertime working hours and nominal wages has slowed slightly reflecting weak production.However, year-to-year employment growth has been moderate but steady. Thus, employmentand income conditions continue to improve moderately on the whole, but the pace of recoveryhas slowed somewhat.Prices remained stable on the whole, excluding the effect of the consumption taxhike. Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity rates) have declined to someextent as domestic demand and supply conditions started to ease, particularly inconstruction-related goods. The year-to-year declines in corporate service prices on the wholehave been narrowing further owing to the improvement in supply and demand conditions,particularly for real estate rents and information services, although leasing charges continuedeclining. Consumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables) rose year to year in September,reflecting the temporary factor; i.e., a rise in medical charges which resulted from medicalinsurance reform. Excluding this, however, consumer prices have remained stable at a levelslightly above that of the previous year.Monetary aggregates, measured in terms of year-to-year growth of M2 + CDsaverage outstanding, declined somewhat in October to 2.7 per cent.Regarding money market rates, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) hasmoved at a level slightly below the official discount rate. The 3-month CD rate has stayed ataround 0.50 - 0.55 per cent. Against the background of uncertainties about future economicgrowth, the long-term government bond yield had been declining since the end of May andreached the record low of 1.5 - 1.6 per cent at the end of October, but recently rose to 1.6 - 1.8per cent.With respect to bank lending rates, the short-term prime lending rate hasremained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term primelending rate has been lowered since June and reached a record low of 2.3 per cent in October. Inthese circumstances, short- and long-term contracted interest rates for new loans and discounts(up to September) have stayed at record low levels.On the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average has been declining sinceAugust, partly reflecting uncertainties about future economic growth and the fall in U.S. stockprices, and fell below ¥18,000 in early September. It dropped further after late October as aresult of the precipitous decline in Hong Kong stock prices and temporarily reached around¥15,000, but has recently recovered to around ¥16,000.In the foreign exchange market, the yen moved at around ¥119-123 to the U.S. dollar betweenSeptember and October. However, the yen later depreciated in early November, owing togrowing concerns about future economic growth, as well as the fall in stock prices. Recently, ithas moved at around ¥125-128. Meanwhile, the yen started to depreciate against the DeutscheMark, after having peaked at around ¥62 in mid-August, and has recently moved at around ¥71-74.BIS Review   112/1997
Mr. Camdessus considers the lessons from Southeast Asia   Remarks by theManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund, M. Michel Camdessus, at a pressbriefing in Singapore, on 13/11/97.How could events in Southeast Asia unfold as they did, after so many years ofoutstanding performance? We have a fairly clear analysis of what happened in Thailand. Themore difficult question is how the crisis spread so quickly to other economies in the region. I’mnot sure we have the full picture yet, but let me give you my perspective on the causes of thecrisis and where we go from here.I. How could it happen?Certainly, the Thai crisis did not strike out of the clear blue sky. On the contrary,there were numerous signs of a gathering storm. Macroeconomic indicators pointed tosubstantial imbalances: substantial real exchange rate appreciation; a marked slowdown inexport growth; a persistently large current account deficit financed increasingly by portfolioinflows, including a substantial amount of short-term capital; and rising external debt.These problems, in turn, exposed other weaknesses in the Thai economy,including substantial, unhedged foreign currency-denominated borrowing by the private sector,an inflated domestic property market, and a weak and over-exposed banking system. Marketsissued their own warnings in the form of declining equity prices and mounting exchange ratepressure, as doubts about the sustainability of policies grew. And as you know, the Fund alsostressed these problems and pressed for urgent measures in a continuous dialogue with the Thaiauthorities.It was, of course, difficult for the authorities in Thailand and elsewhere in theregion to recognize, after so many years of outstanding macroeconomic performance, thatserious underlying deficiencies could seriously jeopardize their track record. This certainlycontributed to the delay in taking the necessary corrective action. And at last, in the absence ofconvincing policy action, the storm broke.We all have been troubled by developments in the Thai economy, both becausethey have been so costly for Thailand and its neighbors and because they were so preventable.But at least their origins are by and large clear. What is less evident, and therefore moreunsettling to all who are trying to make sense of broader regional developments, is how thecrisis spread as it did to economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, wherecurrent account deficits were generally smaller and foreign direct investment more substantial.Although it may be some time yet before we have the complete answer to this question, someelements of the explanation are becoming clear.Part of the explanation lies in the extent to which developments in Thailand haveaffected conditions in neighboring countries. For example, in expectation that the depreciation ofthe baht would erode the competitiveness of Thailand’s trade competitors, their currencies alsoweakened. And as these currency slides acquired an almost self-perpetuating character, the debtservice costs of the domestic private sector increased. Uncertainty about how far these currencieswould slide and how much debt service costs would increase encouraged a rush to hedgeexternal liabilities that only intensified exchange rate and interest rate pressures.BIS Review   111/1997
- 2 -Another factor is that problems in the Thai economy prompted markets to take acloser look at the risks in other countries. And what they saw -- to different degrees in differentplaces -- were many of the same problems affecting Thailand: among them, overvalued realestate markets, weak and over-extended banking sectors, poor prudential supervision, andsubstantial private short-term borrowing in foreign currency. Moreover, after Thailand, marketsbegan to look more critically at weaknesses they had previously considered minor, or at leastmanageable in an orderly way, given time.I see two other factors that hastened the stampede: one, the lack of transparency,and hence the increased uncertainty, about government and central bank operations, about thetrue state of financial sectors, about the links between banks, industry, and government and theimpact these links might have on economic policy; and two, the controls -- and threat ofcontrols -- on market activity. Given the tendency of financial markets participants to run withthe herd, this was a sure-fire way to send the herd scrambling for safer pastures and set backefforts to restore confidence.II. What lessons should we draw from all of this?The first lesson is the most obvious one: the necessity of taking early action tocorrect macroeconomic imbalances before they precipitate a crisis. This did not happen inThailand, despite timely and vigorous warnings. On the contrary, policymakers attacked thesymptom of the crisis, the pressure on the baht, accumulating large reserve losses and forwardforeign exchange liabilities in the process. This, together with delays in addressing Thailand’ssevere financial sector problems and lingering political uncertainties, clearly contributed to adeepening of the crisis and its spread to other economies in the region.The second lesson is that other countries can find that their vulnerability to crisesin other markets is greater than economic fundamentals would suggest. Consequently, they needto take pre-emptive actions to strengthen their policies. Where might such action be needed?Several suggestions come to mind:•one, maintaining an appropriate exchange rate and exchange rate regime. Clearly, there is nosingle “right” choice, but more flexible exchange rates can help provide early and visiblesignals of the need for policy adjustments and are less likely to invite reckless behavior onthe part of borrowers and lenders. But regardless of the exchange rate arrangement chosen,appropriate macroeconomic policies are essential to ensure its success;•two, maintaining a proper policy mix -- among other reasons -- so that high domestic interestrates do not damage the domestic economy, attract excessive amounts of short-term capital,or preclude further monetary tightening if market conditions require; indeed, it is importantto keep the option of using the interest rate instrument open, so that the authorities havesome room for manoeuvre in times of international instability;•three, strengthening structural policies -- especially the policies and institutions such as betterprudential supervision, needed to underpin a sound financial system;•and four, carrying out other supporting reforms -- what we call “second generation”reforms -- to promote domestic competition, increase transparency and accountability,improve governance, help ensure that the benefits of future growth are widely shared, andotherwise strengthen the foundations for future growth.BIS Review   111/1997
III. Restoring confidenceAs developments have shown, confidence, once lost, is hard to regain. Restoringconfidence takes a strong commitment to economic adjustment and reform demonstrated by theimplementation of often painful measures. It also requires a free flow of timely, accurate, andcomprehensive information so that markets can assess the extent of underlying problems and theseriousness of efforts to correct them and uncertainty can be reduced. And, of course, restoringconfidence takes time.This process is now under way in Southeast Asia. With the support of the IMF,Japan, and a number of other countries in the region, Thailand has launched a courageous andcomprehensive program that addresses the problems of large external deficits and troubledfinancial institutions.As a result, the budget is moving back into surplus and a comprehensiverestructuring of the financial sector is getting under way. The Philippines, for its part, has takennecessary measures and extended its program with the IMF under which a substantial amount ofeconomic adjustment and reform had already taken place. Malaysia is also adapting to changingconditions by scaling back investment plans, tightening its fiscal stance, and strengtheningprudential banking regulations.Indonesia has strengthened its policy stance in continuous dialogue with us, andhas recently reached agreement with the Fund on a major program consisting of: strongmonetary and fiscal policies to bring about orderly adjustment in the economy and restoreconfidence to financial markets; a major restructuring of the financial sector, along withmeasures to ensure its future soundness; and significant deregulation measures and trade reformsthat should improve economic efficiency immediately and over the longer term.The Fund has agreed to support this program with a loan of $10 billion in a totalpackage of $23 billion, of which $18 billion will consist of multilateral financing. On top of that,a contingency safety net is being established through which an important group of countrieshave declared their readiness to complement our package in the case of unexpected need.Naturally, it will take time for these efforts to bear fruit. But developments inrecent months have by no means wiped out the achievements of past decades. On the contrary,the region’s longer term fundamentals -- including its high domestic saving rates, strong fiscalpositions, dynamic private sectors, and recent gains in competitiveness -- remain favorable.Moreover, all of these countries still have a long way to go to catch up with advancedeconomies. Thus, with sound policies, they should be able to sustain high rates of growth foranother two decades or more.In the less distant future, growth can be expected to rebound strongly after arelatively short, but sharp, weakening of economic activity, especially in Thailand, and a rapidnarrowing of external deficits. In fact, we are already seeing improvements in exports, eventhough recent exchange rate changes have not had much opportunity yet to generate their effects.And as these adjustments take place, each of these countries will have seized the opportunity tostrengthen their economies in fundamental ways. This leads me to agree with those in the regionwho see this crisis not as a blight on the future, but as a blessing in disguise. Indeed, after thisperiod of adjustment, these economies will emerge stronger than before.BIS Review   111/1997
- 4 -In the meantime, I hope that some perspective about the benefits of globalmarkets will be maintained. First, we must give credit where credit is due: the capital providedby global markets has been a key factor in Southeast Asia’s exceptional growth rates and itsability to lift so many out of poverty. Certainly, there are risks in tapping global markets towhich no country is immune. At times, markets can be slow to react to changes in economicconditions and then react sharply; and in some instances, herd instinct seems to prevail.But let us not forget that markets also provide tremendous opportunities toaccelerate growth and development, as Southeast Asia itself so vividly shows. Thus, the lessonto be drawn from recent developments is not about the risks of global markets, but rather aboutthe importance of approaching markets in a responsible manner -- with strong macroeconomicfundamentals and sound structural policies that give markets confidence and therefore encouragelong-term investment; with respect for the signals that markets provide; and with transparent andmarket-friendly policies that allow markets to allocate resources efficiently.IV. Perspectives for stronger regional cooperationSpillover and contagion effects can be so rapid, so costly, to countries withbasically sound policies, that every country has an obligation to keep its own house in order. Nocountry should run the risk of becoming the tinder for a wider conflagration. At the same time,there is also much that can be done on a regional and multilateral basis to bolster the efforts ofindividual countries seeking to manage their economies well.At the regional level, countries can make a valuable contribution to regional andglobal stability by joining voluntarily with their neighbors in mutual surveillance. The objectiveshould be to complement IMF surveillance by developing a “club spirit” through whichneighboring countries can encourage one another -- and, at times, exert some peer pressure onone another -- to pursue sound policies. We welcome the efforts being made in this direction invarious fora.To be effective, such regional surveillance will, of course, have to be based onsound economic analysis. In this connection, the management and staff of the IMF are ready tocontribute to regional surveillance in Asia, as they already do in Europe, the G-7, and other fora.Indeed, one of the tasks of our new regional office in Tokyo could be to help promote moreintensive regional surveillance.V. The response of the FundAt the multilateral level, the international community sees it as indispensable towork and cooperate through a central institution, the IMF, in order to help countries deal withthe opportunities and risks of globalization. And given the challenges of the global financialmarkets, the international community has encouraged the Fund to strengthen its capacity in thisrespect. The Fund’s response centers on four broad areas.First, we have strengthened Fund surveillance, which, as you know, lies at theheart of the IMF’s efforts to maintain an orderly international monetary system. In order todetect financial tensions as early as possible, we have sought to make our dialogue with membercountries more continuous and probing and put more emphasis on the continuous and timelyprovision of accurate data. We are also concentrating more on policies decided at a regionallevel, on the regional implications of national economic policies, on banking and financial sectorsoundness, and on the policies and institutions that sound financial systems require.BIS Review   111/1997
Second, we are doing what we can to help markets function more smoothly.Considerable progress has been made in liberalising current account transactions worldwide sothat countries can take advantage of the opportunities offered by the expansion of world trade.Now, we must turn our attention to fostering an orderly liberalization of capital accounttransactions, so that countries can also reap the benefits of global capital markets, whileminimizing their risks.To this end, IMF members have agreed that the Fund’s charter should beamended to make the liberalization of capital movements one of the purposes of the Fund and toextend the Fund’s jurisdiction to capital movements, with appropriate safeguards, includingtransitional arrangements, to ensure that liberalization is neither premature nor unduly delayed.At the same time, the IMF is actively encouraging all countries to be transparentabout their economic performance by improving the dissemination of economic and financialdata to the public. Greater transparency will help strengthen market discipline and avoid marketsurprises that can lead to disruptive market reactions.To this end, the Fund has developed a set of standards regarding the quality,coverage, frequency, and timeliness of data made available to the public and has established aDissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet to which 43 economies have nowsubscribed, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, andThailand. Procedures have also been put in place through which countries can make known tothe markets, and to the public in general, the Fund’s views on their economic policies andsituation.Recognizing the importance for growth of creating an environment thatencourages private sector activity, the Fund has also become more active -- in closecollaboration with the World Bank, regional development banks, and others -- in promoting the“second generation” reforms that I referred to earlier. These include developing an institutionalframework that will, among other things, provide an efficient, professional justice system, helplimit arbitrary and corrupt government practices, and set clear regulatory and supervisorystandards for markets, including financial markets.They also include policies to improve the quality of public expenditure, makingadequate allocations for education and health to help ensure that individuals are able to realizetheir potential to participate actively in a market economy, and providing social protection tothose who bear the brunt of the changes of a dynamic economy.Third, the Fund has taken action on several fronts to strengthen its resource baseand adapt its procedures and financing facilities. As you may know, the membership has justagreed to an increase of 45 percent, equivalent to about $90 billion, in IMF quotas. This willraise the capital base of the institution to some $290 billion. In addition, the Fund has taken stepsto augment its financial resources through the agreement on the New Arrangements to Borrow.Under these arrangements, participants would be prepared to lend up to theequivalent of some $47 billion when additional resources are needed to forestall or cope with animpairment of the international monetary system, or deal with an exceptional situation that posesa threat to the stability of the system. We hope that participants who have not yet done so willcomplete the necessary legislative action so that these arrangements can enter into force soon.BIS Review   111/1997
- 6 -Furthermore, in order to allow all members to participate on an equitable basis inthe SDR system, agreement has been reached on a proposal to amend the Fund’s Articles ofAgreement to authorize a special one-time allocation of SDRs of about $30 billion that wouldequalize all members’ ratios of SDR allocations to quotas and would double the amount of SDRsallocated to date. These resources will supplement members’ reserves, giving them moreflexibility in economic policies and a cushion against adverse developments.Last but not least, recent experience has demonstrated once again that earlywarnings cannot always prevent crisis from blowing up. This makes it indispensable for theinternational community to strengthen the financial capacity of its central monetary institution toassist countries in a crisis situation. This is also why the Fund has established an emergencyfinancing mechanism to allow financial assistance to be provided more speedily, when countriesfacing external crises are willing to take strong corrective action.This mechanism was used effectively to expedite the recent programs for thePhilippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. Even if it would be naive to believe that such programscould produce an immediate return to the status quo ante, we are confident that once theseprograms have produced their full effects in the next months, these economies will be in a muchbetter position to start growing again at a strong, but more sustainable, rate.In conclusion, these are trying times in Southeast Asia. But the mechanisms are inplace at the national and multilateral levels—and soon, I hope, at the regional level -- to enableyour countries not just to pull through this crisis, but to emerge stronger than before. The onlyother pre-requisite for your success is the resolve to put current problems behind you. I see noreason why we will not see the same determination in Southeast Asia in the future as we haveseen in the past.BIS Review   111/1997
Mr. Plenderleith considers what is new in the financial markets in the UnitedKingdom   Speech by Mr. Ian Plenderleith, an Executive Director of the Bank of England, at the 6thCentral Banking Conference, in London on 18/11/97.1. This has been a year marked by important developments in the UK financialmarkets and I am delighted to have this opportunity to take you through some of the highlights.The UK’s new monetary framework2. Perhaps the single most momentous change in the financial landscape in the UKhas been the new government’s decision, in May, to give operational responsibility for interest ratesto the Bank of England -- essentially, to establish operational independence for the central bank. Thissignificant reform, which took effect immediately, and is to be the subject of legislation recentlyintroduced in the UK Parliament, represented an immediate concrete demonstration of the newgovernment’s commitment to monetary stability. It ensures that monetary policy will continue to bedirected to the pursuit of low inflation, recognising that that is an essential pre-condition forachieving the sustained growth in output and employment that we all seek to achieve. The step waswarmly welcomed by the markets, as was evidenced by the immediate fall of around 50 basis pointsit precipitated in long bond yields.3. The framework put in place with that announcement has been carefully constructedand I would like to point to four features of it that I believe will be important to its long-runeffectiveness.4. First, the target the Bank of England is to pursue -- a low inflation target of2½% -- is set by the government. In an open market economy, the conduct of an effective monetarypolicy is helped enormously if the authorities can be clear and open about the price stability objectivethey are pursuing; and in a democratic system, it is absolutely right that the elected governmentshould set this critical strategic objective for the central bank to pursue.5. Secondly, it is then the responsibility of the Bank of England to achieve this lowinflation target, principally through management of interest rates. But this responsibility is to beconducted within a structured framework. Decisions on interest rates are taken by a Monetary PolicyCommittee in the Bank, consisting of nine members: five of these come from within the Bank -- theGovernor, the two Deputy Governors and the two Executive Directors responsible for monetarypolicy; the other four are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and are recognised experts intheir field -- in fact, four economists of outstanding reputation. A representative of the Treasuryattends the meetings and can contribute to the discussion, but has no vote. The Monetary PolicyCommittee meets monthly. It announces its decision each month as soon as its meeting concludes,and the minutes of its meetings are published within six weeks, including details of how eachmember voted.6. A third important feature is that monetary policy is conducted with a high degree oftransparency. I have indicated that the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions on interest rates areannounced immediately; and that the minutes of its meetings are published. In addition, the Bank ofEngland publishes a quarterly Inflation Report, which gives a full account of its monetary actions,and their effect, over the past quarter, and a detailed assessment of the forward outlook for inflation,including a projection looking two years or so ahead and an assessment of the relevant upside ordownside risks. This degree of transparency is, we believe, important in generating greater publicunderstanding of the stance of monetary policy, as well as better-informed public debate and greaterpublic confidence in the process.BIS Review   110/1997
- 2 -7. Closely related is a fourth key feature of the arrangements -- a high degree ofaccountability by the central bank for its actions. We are accountable in the first instance to our ownCourt of non-executive Directors, who are specially charged with monitoring the process by whichthe Monetary Policy Committee discharges its responsibilities. We are accountable also to thegovernment, for which purpose we are required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of theExchequer if inflation deviates by more than 1% either side of the 2½% target, explaining thedivergence and the action taken to bring it back on course -- an open letter, and hence a furtherelement of transparency. We are accountable also to Parliament, which will entail members of theMonetary Policy Committee giving evidence to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee,most probably on the basis of our quarterly Inflation Report, as well as the Bank’s Annual Reportbeing debated in the full House. And we are accountable to the public through the framework oftransparency.8. Put together, these elements provide for greater transparency and accountability ofthe monetary policy process than in any other country in the world. None of this, of course,guarantees success. But I believe that this new, and carefully-constructed, framework provides thebest prospect we have had for years of delivering price stability as a steady foundation for thesustained growth of output and employment that the UK is capable of achieving. This framework formonetary stability, combined with the parallel commitment the government has demonstrated tofiscal responsibility and to promoting a flexible and competitive supply-side structure for theeconomy, provides a basis for the UK economy to continue to grow on a sustainable basis in theyears ahead.Preparations for EMU9. These changes in the monetary framework have been a major focus of interest ofthe UK financial markets over the past summer. But in parallel there has also been close focus on thecontinuing progress being made within the European Union towards Economic and Monetary Union(EMU).10. The UK government’s statement on EMU last month provided a clear account ofUK policy in relation to the monetary union. That statement indicated that, in principle, a successfulsingle currency within a single European market would be of benefit to Europe and to Britain. But, inorder for EMU to be right for Britain, the economic benefit should be clear and unambiguous. If, inthe end, a single currency is successful, and the economic case is clear and unambiguous, then thegovernment believes Britain should be part of it. The statement identified five economic tests thatdefine whether a clear and unambiguous case can be made for the UK to join EMU. These are:whether there can be sustainable convergence between Britain and the economies of a singlecurrency; whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope with economic change; the effect oninvestment; the impact on the UK’s financial services industry; and whether it is good foremployment.11. Applying these five economic tests has led the government to the conclusion thatBritish membership of a single currency in 1999 could not meet the tests, so that joining at the start ofEMU is not in the country’s economic interests. The government will therefore be notifying ourEuropean partners, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, that we will not seek membership of thesingle currency on 1 January 1999; and, barring some fundamental and unforeseen change ineconomic circumstances, making a decision during this Parliament to join is not seen as realistic. Thestatement therefore indicates that it is therefore sensible for business and the country to plan on thebasis that, in this Parliament, the government does not propose to enter a single currency. However,the government has said that if a single currency works and is successful, Britain should join it. TheBIS Review   110/1997
- 3 -government believes that we should therefore begin now to prepare ourselves so that, should theeconomic tests be met, a decision to join a successful single currency can be made early in the nextParliament. To help with the essential preparations, the Chancellor has invited the Governor of theBank of England and the heads of the two main bodies representing industry and commerce, and twoother Ministers, to join him on a Standing Committee to lead the preparations for EMU.12. In the UK wholesale financial markets, practical preparations are accordinglyproceeding apace.13. We at the Bank of England have been taking an active role in helping the UKfinancial markets to prepare for the euro. We do this because, even though the UK will not be in atthe start, it is plain that banks and financial institutions in the UK, in their wholesale business fortheir corporate and institutional customers, in the UK and overseas, will want to be able to offer thefull range of financial facilities in the euro from the outset. They will want to be able to offer theircustomers deposits and foreign exchange facilities in the euro, lending and borrowing in the euro,hedging and collateral in the euro and financing and settlement facilities. The London markets willneed to be able to operate in euro from the outset across the full range of their wholesale activities,and practical preparations are now well advanced to achieve that by January 1999.14. The Bank of England’s part in this extensive process of market-wide preparation,besides equipping ourselves internally for operations in the euro, is a co-ordinating one, in three mainways:•first, our job is to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is developed in the UK to allow anyonewho wishes to do so to use the euro in wholesale payments and across the financial markets fromthe first day of EMU.•second, we aim to promote discussion between the EMI, national central banks and marketparticipants across Europe about practical issues on which the market is seeking a degree ofcoordination.•and third, we provide information: for example, through a quarterly publication on PracticalIssues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro, which is distributed to around 32,000 recipients,including 4,000 directly overseas. The next edition will appear shortly, neatly timed for people’sChristmas reading, and I confidently expect it to be on the best sellers’ list for the festive season.And following the successful symposium we held early this year, we are planning to hold afurther symposium, next January at the Bank, on London as the international financial centre forthe euro.15. This exercise -- to prepare the UK markets for wholesale activity in the euro byJanuary 1999 -- has now gathered substantial momentum. Let me touch on a few of the mainpriorities being pursued:16. First, market participants agree on the need to be able to trade in London the fullrange of euro-denominated instruments.17. Secondly, they also agree on the need for appropriate payments mechanisms inLondon to carry out transactions in euro both between parties within the UK and cross-border to andfrom the UK.18. Thirdly, efficient, cost-effective mechanisms for settling transactions ineuro-denominated securities also need to be made available in London.BIS Review   110/1997
- 4 -19. Fourthly, there is agreement on the desirability of harmonised market conventionsfor the issuing and trading of euro-denominated instruments.20. Fifthly, there is agreement on the need for as sound a legal basis as possible foreuro transactions, to provide legal certainty and to ensure continuity of contract.21. Sixthly, there are tax and accounting issues to be addressed, related to theintroduction of the euro.22. There is work going on in each of these areas, and good progress on many ofthem. Let me give you one example -- the payments system, which lies at the heart of the UK’spreparations for the euro. The UK’s sterling Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system is beingdeveloped to accommodate the euro, so that from the beginning of 1999 euro wholesale paymentsmay be made in a safe, efficient and cost-effective way as sterling payments can now, even thoughthe UK will not be a participant in the monetary union at the outset. That development remains onschedule, and it is encouraging that the UK system (CHAPS) has had expressions of interest recentlyfrom a number of overseas banks wishing to join.23. The UK euro system -- CHAPS euro -- will allow payments to be made bothbetween parties within the UK and cross-border from and to the UK through its link to TARGET.Using the knowledge and expertise we have acquired through developing and operating by far thelargest RTGS system in Europe -- with average daily volumes of some 70,000 payments, worth some£150 bn -- we are contributing a great deal to the technical development of TARGET. Because itextends the benefits of RTGS systems, in reducing the risk in payments, for the first timecross-border, it is a project we wholeheartedly support.24. But we also want to see TARGET as efficient and effective as possible, so that itbecomes the payment system of first choice for banks, in order to maximise its benefits in reducingsystemic risk. We have to recognise that TARGET will be competing with alternative euro paymentsmechanisms, including correspondent banking and the European Banking Association’s netend-of-day settlement systems. Consistently with this view, we believe that it is essential thatpayments be able to flow freely throughout the TARGET system.25. Why do we devote this effort for preparing for the euro? The reason is verystraightforward. London’s pre-eminent position as an international financial centre rests on the factthat it provides broad and liquid markets for the full range of internationally-traded currencies and forthe vast array of different instruments and facilities denominated in them. The euro will undoubtedlybecome a major internationally-traded currency, and it is therefore certain that it will be tradedextensively in the London markets. The euro thus represents an opportunity, rather than a threat, forthe London markets, and it is important that the London markets prepare in good time the systemsand infrastructure needed to take advantage of this opportunity.London as a financial centre after EMU26. The reason why we are convinced that the euro represents a major opportunity forthe London markets relates essentially to the strengths that the London markets have displayed overthe years:•London is a global financial centre rather than just a European centre, with much of its businessgenerated around the world, not just within Europe.BIS Review   110/1997
- 5 -•London has always thrived on financial innovation, and has a strong track record of capitalisingon new opportunities.•The euro may very well bring greater financial activity to the main Continental financial markets.But expansion in these markets is not, on past experience, a zero sum game: it is likely to lead tomore, not less, activity in London since London is the major interface with the rest of the world inthe European time zone.•The economics of financial market activity point to concentration, to gain economies of scale andfacilitate better management control. That is why many firms have been moving their operations,and even headquarters, to London as the preferred financial centre. Uncertainty about UKparticipation in the single currency has been with us for some time. But undeterred by thatuncertainty, firms have continued to concentrate their trading activities in London.•London has an unrivalled range of markets and ancillary services; and an associated deep skillbase; and an unbureaucratic approach to financial regulation, which has been developed workingwith the grain of the market.27. All these advantages and more help to explain why there are more people workingin financial services in the City of London -- over 600,000 -- than there are in the entire population ofFrankfurt and its surrounding region!28. None of this gives any grounds for complacency: the financial services industry isan intensely competitive business. But importantly, if we can harness the strengths of the Londonmarkets to the opportunity presented by the euro, I believe that will be an important contribution tothe success of the single currency. Of course, London will benefit. But London is not just a UKfinancial centre. It is a European financial centre, and by providing competitive trading facilities inthe euro London can help provide better facilities for business and industry across the whole singlemarket and bring more business into Europe from the rest of the world.Opportunities in euro for market participants29. I have talked so far principally about the steps the authorities are taking to helpprepare the London markets for the euro. But of course, at the end of the day, the authorities can onlyfacilitate: the real challenge in seizing the opportunities presented by the single currency has to bemet by market participants themselves. Let me touch on three areas where the advent of the euro islikely to usher in significant changes -- but, I believe, positive changes, offering new businessopportunities -- for financial market participants.30. First, in the bond markets, monetary union will serve to unify the various nationalgovernment bond markets of the EMU participants, and the already substantial ECU bond market,into a single market in a single currency with multiple national government issuers. Currency riskwill be removed, at a stroke. This does not, of course, mean that all government bonds of the differentnational issuers will trade at the same price: differences will still remain in trading structures andliquidity, in perceptions of sovereign risk and the scale of supply by different governments, and ininvestors’ basic preferences. But the different national government bonds will tend to trade onessentially the same yield curve, with the focus of the market being concentrated, even more so thanat present, on spread relationships.31. This of course raises the interesting question -- spread over what? Who willprovide the benchmark issues? Moreover, the intensified focus on spread may produce two furtherresults. First, there will be even greater incentives than at present for national governments, who willBIS Review   110/1997
- 6 -remain responsible for their own debt management, to converge in their techniques for issuing andmarketing their debt. It will be interesting to see whether this will generate greater co-ordinationamongst debt management authorities in managing their debt programmes, including, for example,their auction timetables.32. A second effect in this area flowing from the concentration on spreads may begreater interest in developing a diversified, deeper corporate bond market in euro, as has long beenpresent in the United States, but much less so in other countries. If this happens, it could be aconsiderable boon to corporate borrowers as a whole because it would extend the range of financingopportunities open to them.33. A second area where financial market activity in the euro is likely to generate newopportunities is in the short-dated money markets. Foreign exchange traders do clearly face somecontraction in their activity, as an inevitable consequence of currency unification. But I do not expectto see too many destitute foreign exchange traders miserably wandering the streets in search ofcharity or menial employment because of course, as trading amongst the EMU currencies disappears,new international trading is developing in a range of currencies of leading emerging marketeconomies. But more importantly, the advent of the euro will usher in potentially much deepermarkets than exist in the individual national centres at present in a range of different money marketinstruments -- short-dated government and/or central bank paper, commercial bills, CDs, inter-bankdeposits, commercial paper, repos, interest-rate futures, swaps, FRAs, options and a miscellany oftailor-made variants on these basic products. Markets in these products are of very varying depth andliquidity, where they exist at all, in the individual local-currency markets of the countries likely toparticipate in EMU. But all of these instruments are, as it happens, traded in London in the maininternational currencies; and with the advent of the euro, all of them will also, for the first time, betraded in the major European currency. This represents a tremendous business opportunity for banksand financial institutions with the capacity to trade these instruments and to harness them to the needsof their customers.34. But there is a third impact on financial markets from the euro that is essentially anecessary prerequisite that must be fulfilled if the benefits from integration of the bond and moneymarkets that I have identified are to be achieved. This is that the new single-currency, euro, marketsdevelop trading practices and standards of conduct, and the necessary infrastructure, that willgenuinely facilitate integration. In terms of infrastructure, for example, real-time, same-day wholesalepayments are essential to tie together money market activity conducted in different centres in thesame instrument in the single currency; and similarly, linkages may also need to be consideredbetween different settlement systems. Common trading practices, and market conventions, will alsoneed to be developed. The lead here lies in many cases with market participants themselves, and withthe systems they have developed to serve their trading needs. But it is a process we are very familiarwith in London, where we have sought when necessary to encourage just such common initiatives inorder to enhance the effectiveness of international trading activity in London. And with an eye onEMU, we have encouraged trading activity in the ECU, particularly in the money markets: hence, forexample, the regular programme of monthly auctions for UK government ECU treasury bills, and thequarterly auctions of UK government three-year ECU notes, which have been running for someyears. Because of the international flavour of our markets, and because we are conscious that thesemarkets will want to trade the full range of euro instruments in London, we will continue to supportinitiatives aimed at achieving the necessary market structure where we feel we can make acontribution.Reforms in the London marketsBIS Review   110/1997
- 7 -35. In parallel, we have been pressing ahead with reform in the structure of the UKsterling financial markets, and the pace of progress has notably quickened in 1997. Last year saw twonotable events -- the start of the gilt repo market and the completion of the Stock Exchange’sSequence project, to provide it with a new and modern integrated electronic platform for its tradingand information services. This year we have already doubled up on last year, with four majorinitiatives -- reform of the structure of the Bank of England’s money market operations; thecompletion of migration to electronic settlement of equities on CREST; the successful launch ofSETS, the Stock Exchange electronic order book for equity trading; and a major upgrade of the CGOelectronic settlement system for gilts. We have a fifth advance to come next month, with the start of astrips facility for gilts. But for the fact that a central banker is not supposed to reveal that he knowshow to play poker, I would call that a “full house”!36. I believe these are major steps forward to improve trading market facilities, andthe essential market infrastructure, in London. And the fact that the London markets have been ableto bring so many major projects to a successful conclusion in so short a space of time speaks highlyof the resources in depth available in the London markets and the ancillary services. But I woulddraw attention to one particular feature, which I think is of wider significance. The upgrade of CGOhas been effected utilising CREST software -- deliberately, in order to align those two electronicsettlement systems -- CGO for gilts, CREST for equities -- more closely. This was a considerabletechnical achievement, because the operating processes in the two markets are different -- equitiessettle on T+5, gilts on T+1 (and in some cases T+0); the equity market comprises a large number ofrelatively moderate-value deals, the gilt market a smaller number of much higher-value deals; hencedelay in settlement in gilts is much more disruptive, and needs to be much less frequent, than inequities. Overcoming these differences has been a considerable challenge to the Bank team and Iwould like to pay tribute to their dedication and expertise and to their achievement in bringing theCGO upgrade to a successful and so far smooth launch just last week. I say this without immodestybecause, though I was closely involved in overseeing the project, it was their technical proficiencythat delivered the goods.37. But this achievement has a wider significance. By utilising CREST software inCGO, we have now achieved for the market much of the benefit sought by those who favour amerger of the two systems. In particular, both utilise the same hardware, and the same softwareapplication; they operate on the same networks; and users can access both systems via a singleterminal using a common gateway. The Bank is, as already announced, planning to seek the views ofmarket participants on what the relative priorities should be in developing payments and settlementsystems in London in the year ahead. This will include the possibility of full merger between CGOand CREST, but recognises that merger is only one of a number of IT projects UK financial marketsmay have to contemplate over the next few years, all of which represent potential claims on scarce ITresources. What is important in the meantime is that a big step towards integration of systems hasbeen achieved, to the benefit of all market users.Conclusion38. I have tried in these remarks to explain major developments in UK financialmarkets over the past year. Looking ahead, there is more to do, and I believe EMU will open up newopportunities for the financial markets. I believe this will be particularly so for the internationalmarkets in London. We intend to be ready to take full advantage of these opportunities, right from theoutset in January 1999, even though the UK will not participate in EMU at that stage. The reason forthis is very simple: London is the major European financial market, and we think that extending itsactivity to include financial services in euro is a significant contribution we in the UK can make fromthe outset to the success of the monetary union and of the single European market as a whole.BIS Review   110/1997
Mr. Sheng looks at asset prices, capital flows and risk management   Addressgiven by the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Andrew Sheng, atthe Asian Securities Analysts Federation Conference in Bangkok, on 17/11/97 (slightly abridged).1. I am very honoured to be invited today to address this distinguished Conference.The title of my paper is “Asset Prices, Capital Flows and Risk Management”. All these factors havebeen the main players in the recent market turbulence in the region. I will therefore focus mydiscussion today on the lessons from the recent Asian market turmoil and also the impact on HongKong.The Surge in Capital Flows2. In the past decade, capital flows surged within the Asian region and globally.According to IMF statistics, average annual net capital inflows to developing countries exceededUS$150 billion in 1990-96, and more than 40% of which actually came to Asia. In the last two yearswe saw even more capital inflows to the region, recording a net total of US$107 billion in 1996 and asimilar growth rate in the first half of 1997. In some Asian economies, net inflows have averaged5-8% of GDP over long periods, with over half of such capital flows in the form of foreign directinvestment.3. The growth in international capital flows is the result of greater financialliberalization and sophistication in markets around the world, the rise of institutional investors suchas mutual and pension funds, and growing financial innovation and intermediation, especially inderivative products. We all know that capital movements help growth through a more global efficientallocation of resources and bring new knowledge and technology to emerging economies.4. On the other hand, international capital flows can be very volatile in nature, withthe tendency of reversing direction when there is the slightest hint of risk, whether it is in the conductof macroeconomic policies or concerns over the fragility of the financial sector. Capital flows nowdrive the balance of payments more than trade flows. Portfolio shifts operate on the basis of marketexpectations of risk, return and liquidity. A high level of arbitraging, such as the borrowing of fundsfrom one market to invest in another market, leads to contagion effects. Losses in one markettherefore result in sales in another. This is a risk that should be addressed not only by those who arenow under the process of capital liberalization, but also by the whole international community.Global markets mean global contagion. This is no longer a uniquely Asian problem.5. Let us now consider the recent Asian market turbulence in the global context. Untilrecently, Asia enjoyed the benefits of the high global liquidity, and recorded admirable levels ofcapital inflows, as driven by the high global liquidity in G-3 economies. Indeed, high global liquidityis also the consequence of strong productivity growth, low inflation and improved governmentsavings, especially in the United States, which has resulted in the strongest growth in world trade indecades.6. With well-behaved inflation, the ample international liquidity has resulted in aglobal stock market boom in the 1990s, in both Europe and the US, as well as emerging markets inLatin America and Eastern Europe. But this has also caused a global compression of interest ratespreads and record levels of new issuance in both domestic and international bond markets. Suchnarrowing of spreads did not reflect the potential credit and market risks associated with the emergingmarkets. So when investors finally realize that the emerging markets are carrying more risks thanthey have assumed, the risk premium as measured by the yield spreads will widen sharply to reflectthis.BIS Review   109/1997
- 2 -7. This scenario was complicated by the fact that the flood of global liquidity has beenlargely channelled to the bond, equity and property markets of East Asia. Buoyed by optimism aboutthe Asian miracle growth of the last decade, both domestic and foreign investors committed theclassic “fallacy of composition”. Initially, each individual may perceive a high return and increasetheir investments in assets, leading in aggregate to excess demand and a market overshoot. A reversalof perception leads to a sharp market correction, which is exactly what is happening not only in Asia,but globally. As Chairman Greenspan said recently, "in retrospect, it is clear that more investmentmonies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk".8. The strong Asian growth would have continued but for the fact that globalcompetition in external trade has emerged with newly industrialized and export-oriented economieswith cheap labour, such as China, India, Latin American and Eastern Europe. The failure of centralplanning has brought at least three billion new workers and consumers into the global market. Thesenew markets began to benefit from the growing trade liberalization and inflows of foreigninvestments, thus putting greater pressure on the markets of the earlier “tigers” of East Asia, leadingto a widening of their current account deficits as they continued their investments in infrastructureand real estate.Issues in Asia9. If we look more closely at the situation in Asia, the economic fundamentals remainintact. Asia has been the fastest-growing region in the world, recording growth rates of around5%-9%. Asian economies have low inflation rates and exchange rates were stable until recently.Current account for the region as a whole is broadly in balance, while the fiscal account, excludingJapan, is in surplus. Asia has exceptionally high savings rates of above 30% of GDP. Officialsavings, in terms of foreign currency reserves, were even higher. In Asia, 70% of the inflowscontributed to reserve accumulation. As a result, Asian central banks are now holding about 40% ofthe world’s foreign exchange reserves. Five of the top six foreign exchange holders in the world arenow Asians.10. The strong fundamentals -- a young, educated, flexible workforce, stablegovernment, good natural resources and communications infrastructure, openness to trade andinnovation, and high savings and investment rates -- these have not basically changed. Asia is stilloutward-looking, with open markets and openness to technology and innovation. The aspirations ofAsia are also real: an entrepreneurial approach to innovation, competition and better standards ofliving for the rising urban population. Where Asians have perhaps kept their eyes off the ball is theneed to develop the services sector in complementary step with the manufacturing or export sectors.Delays in opening the financial sectors to global competition make them vulnerable to real sectorexcesses or imbalances, such as the overconcentration of risks in certain areas, including the assetmarkets.11. The momentum of growth depends critically on continued vigorous trade reform,fiscal prudence and improvements in finance, health and education policies. Increasingly, exports arechanging from labour-intensive industrial production, and more toward higher value-added industriesand services. This poses the challenge of sustaining productivity growth.12. The Asian turmoil being a financial turmoil on the surface, let me focus on theinteresting way Asia recycles its surplus savings. As my colleague Joseph Yam has consistentlypointed out, a large portion of Asian foreign exchange reserves is invested in assets of the OECDcountries, which provides safe and liquid instruments. These funds return to the region in the form offoreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment. This global recycling also exposes Asianeconomies to volatile portfolio adjustments due to policy mistakes or shifts in the internationaleconomic environment. Currently, there are no deep, liquid and mature debt markets in Asia for theBIS Review   109/1997
intermediation process to function more efficiently. The process has begun in the last few years, andwith the building of better financial infrastructure, this round of turmoil should add greater impetus togreater cooperation in building better regional financial intermediation.13. As we all can see in hindsight, the risks involved in international capital flows areexacerbated when short-term capital flows are all attracted to the asset markets. This has led to assetbubbles, with all the painful consequences of asset price deflation.14. But what is much more evident in Asia is that the process of hedging, arbitrageand “carry trade”, whereby arbitrageurs borrow in one market and invest in another market that offershigher interest rates, has created both regional and global contagion. Portfolio shifts mean that whenasset prices change (and in this I would include: consumer prices, interest rates, exchange rates, debtand equity prices and property prices) funds will flow in and out to follow the “law of one price”.This suggests that open economies must adjust to global prices. The speed of such adjustments isonly determined by the degree of openness of the domestic economy and financial markets. In otherwords, whether we like it or not, we are being priced globally by the market.15. Many of us have not fully appreciated the full logic of this. The financial turmoilsuggests that while the real sector causes of the stress is global competition, the financial effect isstress on domestic banking systems, as the banks intermediate the global portfolio adjustments. In anopen economy, capital inflows will increase the deposit base of domestic banks which may bechannelled through credit mistakes into fuelling domestic asset price bubbles. There are twoimplications. First, asset price inflation eventually feeds into domestic inflation and erodes externalcompetitiveness. Second, excessive lending concentration into less productive assets, either realestate or over-investment in infrastructure and production capacity, exposes the financial institutionsto huge risks.16. From the viewpoint of financial intermediation, there are three major risks in Asiathat underlie the shocks there:•First, maturity mismatch -- Asian markets made the mistake of borrowing short-term capitalflows to finance illiquid non-tradables, such as property, thus exposing themselves to hugeliquidity needs when capital flows reversed.•Second, currency mismatch -- corporations who borrowed foreign currency funds to financeinvestments that do not generate sufficient foreign exchange to repay the debt run a currencymismatch.•Third, credit risk -- lending or investments ultimately must be against sound profits that generatelong-term returns higher than the borrowing rate or prospective dividends. Undue exuberance onthe part of investors, when price-earning ratios grow beyond fundamentals, or on the part ofbankers who failed to assess the impact of high interest rates on collateral or cash flows, wouldexpose both the investor and the lender to asset losses.17. Specifically, banks in Asia, having easier access to funds as a result of high globalliquidity, were able to expand lending much more quickly and, thereby, incurred higher risks in theirportfolios that they need to manage more soundly. Ironically, domestic banks may have been inducedto move into more risky lending due to increased competition in the form of new entrants andfinancial intermediation. There is no question that they need to manage these new risks better.18. There is also one distinguishing feature of the Asian turmoil. The debt problemshave not been those of the public sector. On the contrary, the fiscal positions of Asian governmentshave by and large been quite sound. East Asia, excluding Japan, ran a fiscal surplus of US$5.4 billionBIS Review   109/1997
- 4 -or 0.1% of GDP in 1996. The debt burden, in fact, has been largely one of private sectoroverborrowing. The resolution of the debt of the private sector makes the Asian problems quitedifferent from the experience of the sovereign debt issues of the 1980s.19. In essence, the Asian problem is the age-old question of efficient resourceallocation. Asia has no shortage of funds, only that its high level of savings are invested in less liquidlong-term investments. Thus, one of the more pressing issues in Asia is to build a more competitive,stable financial system and a robust infrastructure to facilitate efficient financial intermediation. Thebetter risk management of the financial system would also assist both corporations and investors tomanage also their risks better. Ultimately, a balanced and flexible economy with sound riskmanagement will then be in a better position to withstand global shocks and avoid crisis.The need for national risk management20. We are all aware of the complexities of risks in financial markets. Aside fromcredit risks, market risks such as interest rate, exchange rate, legal risks, operational risks andsystemic risks all have to be managed, both at the micro level and at the macro level. All marketssuffer from the “fallacy of composition”. Mistakes at the corporate or bank level will add up tonational mistakes, which now may add up to regional or international crisis through contagion.Traditional risk management at corporate or sectoral level simply shift risks from one sector toanother. Risks still remain in the economy as a whole. Thus, increasingly in the 1980s, there emergedthe awareness that financial sector regulation was all about national risk management.21. National risk management covers six major aspects:•Credible policies, with monetary and fiscal policies consistent with each other, and appliedconsistently.•Capital account liberalization should be phased appropriately.•Sound fundamentals include a high domestic savings rate, sustainable fiscal and balance ofpayments positions, high foreign exchange reserves and prudent debt management.•Good supervision involves the maintenance of solid capital adequacy and liquidity requirementsfor the financial sector, as well as regular examination and monitoring of financial institutions andmarkets. The banking system must have the capacity to avoid excessive credit concentrations andrisks, and to manage market risks well.•A robust financial infrastructure would encompass an efficient payments and settlements systemfor domestic and international transactions. In essence, the world is moving towards Real TimeGross Settlement (RTGS) system, which support Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) and Payment vs.Payment (PvP). RTGS reduces payment risks and allows central banks to monitor flows indomestic currency as well as exposure of banks on a real time basis.•A non-distortive incentive structure, such as taxation or regulatory restrictions that would notencourage risk concentrations or excessive leverage in any economic sectors.22. Put simply, managing national risks is equivalent to achieving three objectives.First, lower national gearing, because leveraging adds risks, especially if this is leveraged fromexternal borrowing. The more you borrow abroad, the more you become vulnerable to externalshocks. Second, the higher the level of domestic savings, which should be reflected in higher bankcapital, lower credit/GDP ratio, and higher fiscal surpluses, the greater the resilience to the pain ofadjustment to external or internal shocks. Third, irrespective of the exchange rate regime, there mustBIS Review   109/1997
be a commitment to a stable currency, and this means strong external reserves, low inflation and asound banking system.Asset prices and the exchange rate regime23. The Asian market turmoil also raises the question as to whether the exchange rateregime matters. I believe the debate about whether the nominal exchange rate should be floating orfixed misses the point in Asia. The real issue is the real effective exchange rate of the economy,namely, its underlying productivity and global competitiveness.24. For example, there is a mistaken perception that fixed exchange rates give rise toasset bubbles. But if you look at the recent evidence of asset price bubbles in advanced economies,asset price bubbles also occurred in the 1980s in countries with flexible exchange rates, such asJapan, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. Asset price appreciation cannot be tackled alone byinterest rates, since there are multiple reasons for such appreciation25. In Asia, we can perhaps identify four main reasons:•First, the Asian household has always looked upon house ownership not only as a socialnecessity, but also as the best hedge against inflation.•Second, Asia is a young market, experiencing a high rate of urbanization. The strong demand forhousing arising from demographics alone will fairly quickly eliminate excess capacity in manyeconomies.•Third, housing supply constraints also gave rise to high housing costs. Examples are inadequatesupply of land, excessive tax burden on housing and construction, and inefficient urban planningand approval procedures that delay market responses to the rising demand for housing.Over-rapid liberalization of supply constraints were also one reason for the emergence of excesssupply.•Fourth, the high global liquidity that appeared has improved access to funds, which resulted inexcessive exuberance on asset price inflation.The Impact on Hong Kong26. Amidst the recent attacks to the regional currency markets, no economy in Asiahas been totally immune, not least Hong Kong, despite the strong fundamentals.27. If we identify the real issues in Asia as one of structural competitiveness in theglobal economy, caused by shifts in global resources and rising productivity outside the region, thenstructural adjustment must come through changes in either the internal price or the external price.With a fixed exchange rate regime and therefore a fixed external price, such as in Hong Kong, theadjustment comes through changes in the internal prices, especially the asset markets. In thoseeconomies with floating exchange rates, there may be adjustment in both the internal and externalprices. This is exactly what is happening right now. Using the US dollar still as the benchmarkcurrency, it is very interesting to see that since the beginning of the year, the Hang Seng Index hasdeclined by 26% as of last Friday, Singapore Strait Times Index by 32%, the Nikkei 225 by 28% andthe other ASEAN indices by between 50-60%. Thus, markets adjust irrespective of the exchange rateregime and the unit of account.28. Is there any easy way of avoiding the pain of adjustment in Asia due to risingglobal competition? The answer is clearly no. As a general rule, the faster we adjust, the less the pain.BIS Review   109/1997
- 6 -There have been different approaches to this issue. There are some who think that a floating exchangerate regime would cushion the pain, but many forget that Hong Kong has tried the floating exchangerate regime before, in 1974-83. During that period, growth was more volatile and inflation muchhigher than what we are experiencing now. As an open economy with trade accounting for 285% ofGDP, any inflation would be immediately imported under exchange rate volatility. The recentexperience in Asia actually shows that contrary to the theory, floating exchange rates requires evenhigher interest rates, because of the higher risks associated with exchange rate volatility.29. Here I would like to correct the common image that the Hong Kong’s exchangerate regime is a peg. The Hong Kong dollar is a fixed exchange rate, not a peg which can be adjustedfrom time to time. The linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong operates as a currency boardsystem whereby the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is fully backed by the US dollar at the fixed rateof US$1 to HK$7.80. Such a note-issuing mechanism ensures that currency issued is fully backed byforeign exchange. With the sustained budget surplus and accumulated surplus on the Exchange Fundand Land Fund assets, the actual amount of foreign reserves in Hong Kong amounted to US$88.1billion at the end of September, the third largest in the world. This is more than seven times HongKong dollar cash in circulation or over three times HK$ M1.30. The currency board system has an automatic adjustment mechanism to maintainexchange rate stability. When there are outflows of funds from the Hong Kong dollar, the HongKong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will sell US dollars to banks for Hong Kong dollar. Onsettlement day, the HKMA will debit the clearing accounts of the banks for the necessary amounts ofHong Kong dollars in return for the US dollar that will be credited to the New York accounts of thesame banks. Since banks may have sold more Hong Kong dollars than they have in their clearingaccounts with the HKMA, they can only obtain Hong Kong dollars by borrowing from other banks,by bidding up the interbank rates, or selling back the US dollars to the HKMA, that is, by reversingtheir short position. In fact, the banks do not hold excess Hong Kong dollars because they aregenerally long in foreign currency. The latest data at the end of July shows that the Hong Kongbanking system is short roughly HK$33 billion or US$4 billion.31. In addition to the robust currency board mechanism, the linked exchange ratesystem is underpinned by some of the strongest fundamentals in Asia, if not the world:•Growth is strong, at 5.5%.•Fiscal position has been consistently strong, with an average fiscal surplus averaging 2% of GDPfor the past decade. Fiscal surplus in 1997 so far is 4.4% of GDP and is expected to exceed 5% ofGDP.•The government has no external debt.•Exchange Fund and Land Fund together have more than US$100 billion in assets.•Corporate debt ratios are amongst the lowest in Asia.•The external account is broadly in balance.32. The free markets and strong fundamentals mean that the nature of the shock isabsorbable. Hong Kong does have a strong competitive edge, since we are a service economy with83% in the services sector. As a major investor and integrator of production in the region, withmanufacturing concerns in China and Southeast Asia, Hong Kong companies could adjust productionto areas which have the greatest export competitiveness. In addition, the mainland Chinese economyis still growing at 8-9% per annum, with low inflation, a balanced external account and strongBIS Review   109/1997
commitment to reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors. All these auger well for Hong Kong asthe main gateway to the Chinese market.33. The current higher interest rates reflect somewhat a slightly higher risk premiumin Asia due to the currency turmoil. We do admit that the higher interest rates affected the stockmarket and property market. But we should also remember that high interest rates are necessary tocool the overheating in the asset markets that prevailed until recently. Given the excess demandsituation in Hong Kong as the economy grew by 6.4% in the second quarter, a correction wasexpected. A moderation in property prices will help bring houses to more affordable levels tohomebuyers.34. Higher interest rates will also bring down inflation, by encouraging savings. Onceinflation and the asset markets correct under the free market regime, Hong Kong will become muchmore competitive. In real effective exchange rate terms, the competitive effect of neighbouringdepreciation will be offset somewhat by a rise in domestic inflation. Higher interest rates will alsobring the external account more in line with the fundamentals and improve the trade balance. HongKong, as a free market economy, is adjusting exactly according to the textbook.35. Moreover, our banking sector is very robust and strongly capitalized to withstandany shocks. Operating profits of the local banks grew by about 18% in the first half of 1997 and thebad debt charged fell in the first half of 1997 as the level of classified loans was 2.08%, down from2.91% a year earlier. The capital adequacy ratios of local banks as a whole exceeds 17%. The averageloan-to-value ratio is 70%, with the actual measured loan-to-value ratio being 53.3%, according toour survey at end September 1994. Therefore, HKMA’s efforts to build a strong banking sector,including the distribution of maturity risks through the mortgage corporation and the creation of anefficient RTGS payment system are all necessary efforts to prevent an external shock from affectingthe banking system. In particular, the RTGS system allows the HKMA to monitor closely banks’settlement transactions on a real time basis. Banks would also have to fund their settlements andprovide ample liquidity on a more prudent basis. All these are in line with our objective of makingthe markets more efficient to enable the free market to clear aggregate supply and demand at anequilibrium price quickly.36. But we should always remember that there is no free lunch. The fixed exchangerate regime implies a flexible economy to adjust to the exchange rate. Hong Kong has high flexibility,attributable to a high savings rate, entrepreneurial spirit and high labour productivity. A fixedexchange rate is a discipline on both the private and public sectors: the economy adjusts to theexchange rate, not the other way around. We do not pretend to say that a fixed exchange rate is theperfect system, because even the IMF admits that there is no perfect system. But it is the best systemfor Hong Kong. The linked exchange rate system is here to stay.Conclusion37. As one of the contributors to the World Bank study on the Asian Miracle, I havenever considered the Asian growth story as a miracle. Paul Krugman called it perspiration, notinspiration. Yes, it was the result of hard work, high savings, stable governments and goodaspirations. But no one can deny that Asian corporations rank amongst some of the most productiveand efficient in the world. Perhaps we were victims of our own success. Global capital inflows werethe most sincere form of flattery, and those of us who succumbed to the easy money have nowwakened to new challenges and risks.38. Asia is now in a new growth league, with greater global competition. Theadjustments will not be easy, especially building stronger and more robust financial systems to handlethe new risks of globalization. There is a new realism in Asia, that however painful the adjustment,BIS Review   109/1997
- 8 -we have to make the necessary changes. As competition intensifies at all levels, there can be noreversal to the globalization, and we simply have to recognize that we live in one globe and we sharethe same growing pains. I am confident that Asia’s basic strength of flexibility, realism and pragmaticpolicies will see the region through, with a little bit of help from the IMF. In the words of Mr. MichelCamdessus, IMF Managing Director, what has happened is a blessing in disguise. Asia will emergestronger and more resilient, and it will continue to be a pillar of growth in the new global economy.BIS Review   109/1997
Mr. Stals discusses monetary policy challenges in South Africa   Address bythe Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. Chris Stals, at a South African FinancialMarkets Conference arranged by Standard Bank of South Africa Limited in Cape Town, on7/11/97.1. Challenge number one - to find consensus on what the objective of monetary policy should bein South AfricaIn the international community of central bankers, there is widespread consensusthat the primary goal of monetary policy must be domestic price stability. Price stability,however, is only a means to an end, and not a final goal of overall macroeconomic policy. Theultimate goal is determined by governments and is normally linked to the objective of maximumeconomic growth, development and the creation of more employment opportunities.Contemporary economic theory supports the view, however, that financialstability, as measured by a low rate of inflation, is a precondition for the attainment of optimumeconomic development. Furthermore, monetary policy, being only one of the sub-elements ofoverall macroeconomic policy, is tasked with the responsibility to create and maintain such astable financial environment that will be conducive for sustainable economic growth at anoptimum rate in the medium and longer term.In South Africa, however, confusion remains on what the task and the functionsof the central bank should be. The most important delusion, supported by certain businesspeople, politicians and even some academics, is linked to the now defunct Phillips curveapproach in terms of which the assumption is made that a higher inflation rate can produce asustained lift in growth and employment. World-wide experience, as long back as in the 1970s,provided sufficient evidence that the assumed trade-off of higher inflation for lowerunemployment could only be exploited over the limited period in which inflation expectationsdid not fully adjust to the new higher rate of inflation. With a more effective implementation ofthe theory of rational expectations within modern communities, this limited period has indeedbecome very short.Another reason why the conventional theory of demand management through theapplication of monetary policy is no longer appropriate is the major shift that took place inrecent years in macroeconomic management, away from conventional Keynesian demandmanagement to contemporary supply-side economics. The Phillips curve approach is based onthe theory of demand-driven inflationary or deflationary conditions. The world-wide situation inthe 1970s, when there was a simultaneous rise in inflation and in unemployment in many of theindustrial countries, refuted the theory of the trade-off and forced new thinking on particularlythe implementation of monetary policy.The present universal approach on monetary policy therefore takes account of thenew electronic environment of instant communication leading to a more swift dissection ofpolicy actions and immediate reaction by markets, and of the more general need in mostcountries to raise production capacity, and not to stimulate demand. In this environment, theappropriate role for monetary policy has been redefined as a responsibility for the creation andmaintenance of stable financial conditions that will be reflected in low inflation. This is whatcentral banks can do best to support governmental programmes for overall economic growth anddevelopment.BIS Review   108/1997
- 2 -In South Africa, considering the many attacks made on Reserve Bank policyduring this past year, there is still a major lack of consensus on what the prime objective ofmonetary policy should be. Unless we can get consensus and support for the almost globalapproach of contemporary central bank policy, and unless we can agree to pursue these policiesalso in South Africa, the road to the internationalisation of the South African economy will berough and difficult.2. Challenge number two -- deciding on an appropriate framework for monetary policyGiven the objective of price stability, each central bank must design a frameworkor a consistent model within which monetary policy can be implemented, taking account of thestructure of the financial system and of the economy of the country. Various models areavailable to choose from, but whatever model is preferred, the final objective of monetary policyshould always be the protection of the value of the currency.In the Bretton Woods system of fixed par values, the main intermediate objectiveof monetary policy was the protection of exchange rates, or the external value of the currency.By linking global exchange rates through fixed gold parities, there was a convergence ofinflation, at a relatively low level, at least for the many countries that succeeded in maintainingfixed exchange rates over relatively long periods of time. Needless to say, the system brokedown in the late 1960s and early 1970s when more expansionary monetary policies werefollowed by some of the major industrial countries, and inflation escalated. Today, some smallercountries still attach their exchange rates to a selected major international currency, and thenaccept the unavoidable consequence that the rate of inflation in the smaller country mustconverge with the rate of inflation in the economy of the anchor currency. A good example ofthis approach is provided by Argentina with its convertibility law of 1 Peso = 1 US dollar.A second widely-used model is the one of monetary targeting where an importantmonetary aggregate such as the money supply or the amount of bank credit extension is used asan anchor for monetary policy. Within the context of the prime monetary policy objective ofmaintaining low inflation, a monetary target (or exchange rate target) represents but anintermediate objective of the policy.South Africa is one of the many countries that introduced money supply targetingas an anchor for monetary policy during the course of the 1980s. Initially, the policy served thecountry well. It made an important contribution to a better understanding of policy decisions,and also made a major contribution towards the successful reduction in the level of the rate ofinflation from an average of about 15 per cent over the twenty years from 1973 to 1992, to about8½ per cent over the past four years.The South African experience with money supply targeting is not very differentfrom those of other comparable countries such as Canada and Australia -- with the differencethat the process in South Africa is a slower and lagged one, mainly because of the economicisolation of this country from the rest of the world up to 1993. Australia introduced moneysupply targets in 1976, and then abandoned them “with reluctance” in February 1985. At thetime, Australia tendered two reasons for ending the M3-targeting stage:“The first was the problem of controllability. The fact that targets were oftenmissed was an indication that close control was either not possible, or would have requiredundesirable movements in the policy instruments. The second was the instability of theBIS Review   108/1997
relationship between money supply and the ultimate objective of policy such as inflation ...”.(Address by Governor Macfarlane at a Conference of Economists in Hobart, 29 September1997.)It was Governor Gerald Bouey of Canada at the time who made the famousstatement: “In Canada, we did not abandon money supply targets, they abandoned us”.In view of the liberalisation of the South African financial markets in recentyears, the integration of the South African economy in the world financial markets and theincreasing importance of large and volatile international capital flows, South Africa may havereached the same stage now where the usefulness of the M3-money supply as a target formonetary policy has been diluted to a point where some alternative anchor should be considered.Following the demise of money supply targeting during the mid 1980s, bothCanada and Australia went through a transitional period which lasted until the early 1990s.During this transitional period a policy of “monetary pragmatism” was followed. There wasindeed no formal or strictly defined framework to guide monetary policy. A “check-list” of anad hoc mixture of intermediate objectives was introduced and the central bank was allowed awide degree of discretion in the implementation of monetary policy. After the “rule” ofmonetary targeting broke down, the policy was “to look at everything”.Although such a pragmatic approach may have some advantages, particularly inan environment of major structural changes and volatile international shocks, it has the majordisadvantage of not being transparent. As Charles Goodhart put it:“Supporters would describe it as sensible pragmatism, detractors as a reversion toa muddled discretion which, once again, allows the authorities more rope than is good for them,or us”. (The Conduct of Monetary Policy, Economic Journal 1989.)Both Australia and Canada, and a growing number of other countries, haverecently moved to direct targeting of inflation. In all these countries, however, not only centralbanks but also governments commit themselves jointly with the central banks to a predeterminedtarget for inflation. In the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of the Exchequer indeed sets thetarget for inflation in his Annual Budget, and then instructs the Bank of England to pursue thegoal with its monetary policy instruments. Nowhere does the central bank on its own decide onan inflation target.For an inflation target to be credible, there must be a commitment at least of thecentral bank and the government, and, if possible, also of the business community and labour, tothe achievement of the goal. Furthermore, it will do more harm than good for a country tointroduce a formal inflation target that is much out of line with the rest of the world. Of theseven countries reported in the BIS Annual Report for 1996 with formal inflation targets, no onehas set a goal for inflation of more than 3 per cent per annum. The central bank must be givensufficient operational autonomy to pursue the inflation target with vigour and without the fear ofintimidation by politicians or other pressure groups. And, finally, markets must be free, flexibleand responsive to underlying changes. Inflation is often a symptom of malfunctioning marketsand the cure lies not with monetary policy, but with a restructuring of the markets.It is a big challenge for South Africa to prepare itself for this new age of directinflation targeting as an anchor for monetary policy. The proposals made by the Reserve Banklast week for the introduction in March next year of a more flexible system of providingBIS Review   108/1997

Challenge number three - establishing an effective institutional framework for monetarypolicyThere is a lot of misunderstanding in South Africa about what is meant with theindependence of the Reserve Bank. The Bank can never be made responsible for determining theoverall macroeconomic policy objectives of the country. This is a prerogative of government.The central bank must, however, be given a clear mandate from government on what its policyobjective should be, but should then be given the necessary autonomy to pursue and achieve thisobjective.Taking account of the powers and influences of central banks, the obviousdirective by government to the monetary authority should be to protect the value of the currencyin the interest of sustainable optimum economic growth and development in the longer term. Toachieve this objective, a central bank must at times apply financial disciplines that areunpopular, will be opposed by pressure groups and are perceived to be against the interests ofprivate sector profiteers, and political popularity. It is inter alia for this reason, and only inrespect of the implementation of measures that may at times prove to be unpopular, that centralbanks should be given “independence” from governments. To quote once more from what aformer Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia once said:“The Reserve Bank must be given all the freedom of the prison exercise yard”.(R.A. Johnston - “Comments on Professor Schedvin - Economic Papers - 1992.)Although this autonomy has been given to the South African Reserve Bank interms of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, the disciplinary actions applied by theBank in the pursuance of its mandate are often challenged by economists, business people andpoliticians whenever they believe their vested interests are impeded by the actions. Many SouthAfricans must still learn to be more tolerable towards the need of painful financial disciplines,when justified by adverse macroeconomic situations. These may often be forced on us byinternational developments over which we have no control.Apart from an effective institutional framework for the Reserve Bank, SouthAfrica also needs well-managed private sector banking institutions, well-functioning financialmarkets and an effective clearing, settlement and payment arrangement for inter-banktransactions. The challenge is therefore not only to liberalise the South African financial sectorfurther, but also to ensure good and prudent financial regulation, and to provide the country witha modern electronically-based national payment system. The new system to be introduced by theReserve Bank in March 1998 for an improved clearing and settlement system will provide afurther step on the road of preparing for an effective integration of the South African financialsystem in the global economy.The challenge for South Africa is not to isolate itself from the adverse effects ofthe globalisation process, but to continue to participate in the programme of gradualinternational integration.4. The overriding challenge for monetary policy is to keep inflation lowBIS Review   108/1997
Financial stability in South Africa is threatened from time to time by new andmore intensive inflationary pressures. We have not yet succeeded in suppressing the prevailinginflation psychosis in this country. Expectations at this juncture may have settled around the8 per cent per annum level, which is about half of what it used to be at the beginning of thisdecade. But this is still about three times the amount of actual inflation in the economies of ourmajor trading partners.The process of globalisation unavoidably leads to a convergence of the majorfinancial aggregates such as inflation, real rates of interest and budget deficits. South Africa willeither continue to be part of the globalisation process, together with its inevitable convergenceeffects, or will be marginalised and excluded from the advantages of being part of theworld-wide process.In this period of transition from monetary policy targeting to the introduction of anational inflation objective, monetary policy must continue to maintain overall financialstability. This is essential in order to buy time while other policies (as proposed in GEAR) areput in place to handle the more deep-seated structural deficiencies that must be corrected beforeSouth Africa will be able to experience optimum economic growth with financial stability.5. Conclusion and summaryThe challenges facing monetary policy in South Africa at this stage can besummarised as follows:•We must convince more South Africans that the one and only task for monetary policymust be to protect the value of the currency.•We must adapt monetary policy to the changing environment in which we now have tooperate. This may require of us to move away from money supply targeting and to adopta more direct focus on inflation developments.•We must guard against growing pressures in our country for the curtailment of theautonomy of the central bank.•The Reserve Bank must continue to guide the South African financial markets into theworld financial system. This will require further progress in the gradual elimination ofexchange control, the modernisation of the payments system, the encouragement of thedevelopment of more efficient markets and, in the context of Africa, support forco-operation and integration of financial markets within the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community.The overriding challenge remains to bring inflation in South Africa to a lowerlevel that will be more in line with the average rate of inflation of our major trading partners.This will require a sound monetary policy approach, based on realistic (but not necessarily low)interest rates; a stable (but not necessarily fixed) exchange rate; a sound (but not necessarilyprotected) banking sector, and effective and well-functioning financial markets.BIS Review   108/1997
Mr. Sherwin considers growth, productivity and monetary policy: thelonger-term perspective   Address by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,Mr. Murray Sherwin, to the Annual Conference of the New Zealand Forest Owners Association inAuckland on 12/11/97.Introduction: competitiveness and productivityI have been asked to discuss the New Zealand economy in a medium-term context,with particular reference to the place of forestry. I am conscious also of the overall theme of thisconference -- The Competition Gap. I applaud the Association for choosing to focus on that theme,because while that is clearly a very relevant issue for the forestry sector to be debating, it is equallyrelevant to the broader economy.We all wish to raise living standards in New Zealand. The reform effort of the past13 years has been focused on precisely that goal. To achieve it, we require a sustained lift inproductivity, across the New Zealand economy. Improved productivity and “meeting the competitiongap” are one and the same thing.It is not my intention to provide a substantive projection of New Zealand’s economicprospects over the growth cycle of a GF17 pine tree. Nor do I intend to discuss the likely prospects ofthe forestry sector. Rather, I will try to lay out a few of the very broad factors that will shape thedevelopment of the New Zealand economy over the medium term, and to reflect a little on the factorsthat influence interest rates and exchange rates over longer time horizons.The determinants of economic growthLast month, Governor Don Brash delivered a speech to the Auckland Rotary Clubunder the topic “How Fast Can the New Zealand Economy Grow?” The key theme of that speechwas that our growth potential is determined ultimately by quantities and quality. The quantity ofpeople and the quantity of capital -- in the form of factories, forests, trucks, roads, computers and allthe tools of a modern economy. And the quality of those same inputs -- how well they work, and howefficiently they are deployed.As Dr. Brash went on to say, the Reserve Bank believes that New Zealand’slonger-term growth potential is probably of the order of 3 percent annually at present -- a result of atrend growth in the working age population of around 1.5 percent and trend growth in output perperson, or productivity, also of around 1.5 percent.Lifting that growth potential requires bigger quantities or better qualities -- of people,attitudes, and equipment.On the quantities side, we can’t do a great deal in the short term about the size of theworking age population. After centuries of diligent practice, it still takes around 9 months to producea new Kiwi and, only a little quicker than Pinus Radiata -- around 20 years -- to get that new Kiwiinto the work force. Of course, we can import new workers “ready built up”. But even then, as wehave discovered in recent years, there are limitations on how quickly new immigrants can beabsorbed.In any event, while increasing the size of the labour force may enable us to boostoverall economic growth, what really matters for living standards is per capita growth. And thatBIS Review   107/1997
- 2 -means we need to focus on output per person, or the productivity of our work force, not just its rawquantity.In the longer term, and at the risk of doing some violence to the wealth of economicresearch on the subject, productivity is heavily dependent on one key factor -- the quality of ourhuman resources. Living standards rise on the back of overall educational attainment and attitudes.That implies a continuing need to raise the quality of our general educational effort. It means raisingthe numbers participating in higher education. It means improved on-the-job training. It meansbetter-trained managers able to make smarter decisions and provide improved management of ourwork force -- in the forest, on the factory floor, in the research laboratories, within both the publicand private sectors. And it means smarter governance from within the nation’s boardrooms.The role of capital investmentIntertwined with the quality of our work force and how well it is managed is the issueof the quality and quantity of physical capital available to each person. By teaming better-trainedpeople with better technology and working with more and better physical capital we can provide arecipe for making serious progress in raising productivity. And through that, we can make seriousadvances in our living standards.New Zealand’s history provides some useful insights into the role of capitalinvestment. During our slow growth phase -- through the 1970s and 1980s -- our investment levelswere quite respectable by the standards of other developed economies -- somewhere around 25percent of GDP per annum. What was impeding growth was not so much an inadequate quantity ofinvestment, but poor quality investment -- a persistent tendency to direct capital into low-yieldingactivities.The sources of that misdirection of capital are not hard to find. They lie withgovernment-led investment decisions -- for example, “Think Big” projects -- and with investmentencouraged into sectors or activities sheltered by protections of various kinds. It is thoseprotections -- the import quotas, licensing arrangements, or tax incentives -- that produce situations inwhich the returns to private investors become disconnected from the underlying market realities. Theindividual investor may be profiting as a consequence of those protections, but only at the cost ofoverall national efficiency and income.Raising productivity means allowing changeIt is with those considerations in mind that countries seeking to boost their growthperformance look to micro-economic reforms -- to reduced protection, to deregulation, to flatter andbroader tax structures, to increased market flexibility -- in order to encourage available resources oflabour and capital to move into those areas where private financial returns and national economicreturns are similarly high.Of course, encouraging the flow of resources into higher-yielding activities alsoimplies that those same resources, labour and capital, are permitted to move away from activities inwhich returns are low. So when we see sheep and beef farms being converted into either dairy units,on the one hand, or pine forests on the other, we need to check if there are particular regulatory ortaxation reasons encouraging that shift. If there are none, we are entitled to conclude that rationalinvestors are making a judgement that the future returns on investment in dairying or forestry arelikely to be superior to the future returns on sheep and beef farming. Moreover, we are entitled toBIS Review   107/1997
- 3 -presume that, as a result of that changed land use, our national growth potential will be higher. Theefficiency of our capital stock will have increased.Of course, rational investors may be wrong in their judgements. Only time will tell.But so long as those investors are risking their own money, in an efficient regulatoryand tax environment, we stand the best possible chance of maximising the performance of theeconomy overall.One message should be very clear. We cannot lift our economic performance bylocking land, labour or capital into low-yielding activities. Lifting our growth performance willinevitably mean continuing change, including the decline of some sectors, in order to free resourcesfor movement to expanding, higher-yielding activities. And in a world of ever-faster innovation, thehigh performance economies are likely to be the more flexible ones -- the ones most able to quicklytake up emerging technologies and production processes and to encourage the shift of resources fromone industry or production technique to another.Monetary policy has a background role in facilitating faster growthYou will note that so far I have managed to avoid any mention of monetary policy orthe role of the Reserve Bank in all of this. Interest rates and exchange rates haven’t entered theequation. That’s because monetary policy and the Reserve Bank have an important, but essentially“background”, role in allowing the economy to achieve its longer-term growth potential.A couple of points are relevant here.What I have discussed so far are the “real” contributors to economic growth -- thequantity and quality of inputs. These are the “supply side” factors.Monetary policy and the Reserve Bank operate on the demand side. The task ofmonetary policy is to maintain price stability. That involves ensuring that demand in the economygrows roughly in line with the capacity of the economy to meet that demand. The Reserve Bank’sPolicy Targets Agreement (PTA), signed by the Minister of Finance and the Governor, sets a 0 to 3percent inflation target as the Governor’s sole objective. The PTA establishes that single objective ofprice stability “... so that monetary policy can make its maximum contribution to sustainableeconomic growth, employment and development opportunities within the New Zealand economy”.The rationale for that position is quite straightforward, and is particularly relevant to asector such as forestry, which involves such long investment horizons. In an inflation-freeenvironment, investors and the public generally get their best shot at reading accurately the signalsthat markets are delivering -- which goods and services represent best value, where the best returnson investment may be found, how much to consume and how much to save.Simply adopting an easy monetary policy does nothing to increase the supply oflabour or its skill level. It does nothing to improve the availability of better technologies. But mostimportantly, an easy monetary policy that gives rise to a risk of future inflation is likely to divertinvestment and the flow of resources away from sectors with longer-term investment horizons -- suchas forestry -- towards quick-return real estate and similar investments that exploit the tax and otherdistortions which emerge in an inflationary environment.BIS Review   107/1997
- 4 -Once price stability has been achieved, monetary policy is essentially an exercise insmoothing economic cycles -- slowing the economy when it looks likely to overheat, stimulating it asactivity slows.That is not a straightforward exercise. Even if we get it right, (and we won’t always)there will still be economic cycles. But we should be able to avoid the boom/bust cycles of old. If ourlonger-term growth potential is around 3 percent, it is probably the case that growth outturns in the1 percent to 5 percent range will be the norm. Occasional external shocks and surprises -- climate,international events, and so on -- may take us outside that range. But surprises of that sort should berare.However, a sustained growth performance within a range of that sort would representa substantial step up from our experience through the 1960s and 1970s, and would place ussomewhere near the top end of the OECD growth league.Interest rates are determined by international conditions and local risk factorsSo what does that mean for interest rates and exchange rates in New Zealand over thelonger term?Essentially, in our world of open capital markets, interest rates in New Zealand willtend to settle at some margin above or below a benchmark set in US financial markets. How largethat margin is (and whether it is positive or negative) will depend on the risks and returns that savers,both domestic and foreign, associate with New Zealand.There are, of course, many different risks that enter that assessment. But a key one isthe risk of future inflation. A firm commitment to the maintenance of price stability is alreadyresulting in substantially lower interest rates in New Zealand. The rate paid by the New ZealandGovernment on its New Zealand dollar 10-year bonds has fallen from around 10 percentage pointsabove that paid by the US Government on 10-year US dollar bonds in the mid 1980s, to little morethan half of one percent above the US rate.Our shorter-term interest rates have also fallen sharply relative to those in othercountries over the past decade or so, but they remain high by OECD standards, and high in realterms. That will remain the case so long as the strong demand for borrowing that we have seen overthe past several years continues.On that note, it is worth reminding ourselves that the route to consistently lowerinterest rates lies in allowing both savers and borrowers to become confident that the risk of futureinflation is slight.We can’t look to the exchange rate to boost international competitivenessA conference examining competitiveness may find it tempting to look to the exchangerate for salvation at some point. Don’t bother.The forestry industry, like every other export industry in New Zealand, is going tohave to live with an exchange rate that varies. There is nothing you can do about that, and there isnothing the government or the Reserve Bank can do about that. We live in a world of floatingexchange rates.BIS Review   107/1997
- 5 -While it is conceivable that we could fix our exchange rate to the US dollar, or theAustralian dollar, or even the TWI (as we once did) we can’t fix to all simultaneously. Inevitably wehave to learn to cope with exchange rate variability.In fact, on measures of shorter-term exchange rate volatility, the New Zealand dollaris a surprisingly good performer. Day-to-day volatility of our currency is modest when measuredalongside the experience of other developed countries -- even those much larger than New Zealand.To assess the impact of longer-term exchange rate trends, we need to look tomeasures of the “real” or inflation-adjusted exchange rate -- because that is what matters forexporters. On that basis, we find that the New Zealand dollar moves through the inevitable cycles, butwill typically be found within about 15 percent to 20 percent of its longer-term average. Our recentexperience has been consistent with that. The real TWI was around 10 percent below its long-termaverage at its last trough in 1992. At its recent peak, in April of this year, it was around 17 percentabove that same longer-term average.While cycles in the real exchange rate of that amplitude can certainly creatediscomfort for exporters, it is clear that they are well within the range experienced by othercurrencies. In essence, exporters should be factoring cycles of that sort into their business planning. Itis clearly relevant to the variability of their future earnings stream, and therefore, to the value of theirassets and to the nature of the capital structure they require to stay in business. Of course, it is alsorelevant to their balance sheet management and to risk-hedging strategies they may need to adopt.The best contribution that governments and central banks can make to moderating realexchange rate cycles is to embrace policy consistency and transparency -- in monetary policy, fiscalpolicy, and in tax and regulatory policies. The decline in exchange rate volatility in recent yearsprovides some evidence to support that.One point we should all be clear on. There is no future in thinking we can pursuecompetitiveness, in forestry or any other sector, through attempts to use monetary policy to engineera weaker exchange rate. I say that for several reasons:•Competitiveness and the productivity improvements that ensure competitiveness are products of“real” advances in efficiency, technology and management. Lowering the exchange rate makes noone more efficient.•The focus of monetary policy on the single objective of price stability is key to convincing saversand investors that, in taking their decisions, they do not need to factor in a large inflation risk. It isonly in that way that we can get sustainably lower interest rates.•As our own history well demonstrates, any short-term gains that may be available to exporters asa result of a one-off depreciation of the exchange rate are quickly eroded as future inflationincreases. As a fix for competitiveness problems, exchange rate depreciations are both addictiveand ultimately destructive.•Central banks do not determine real exchange rates in the long term. Markets and relativeeconomic efficiency/productivity trends determine real exchange rates.What of the balance of payments deficit?Let me touch on one other issue that is relevant to the longer-term behaviour of theNew Zealand dollar and New Zealand interest rates -- the balance of payments.BIS Review   107/1997
- 6 -We are currently running a current account deficit of the order of 6 percent of GDP.That puts us amongst the largest external deficits in the OECD. Note also that New Zealand’s netforeign debt currently amounts to around 80 percent of GDP -- which puts us at the top end ofinternational experience. To prevent that external debt ratio from increasing further, it is necessary forthe current account deficit to decrease to less than the annual growth of GDP -- ie, to something lessthan about 3 percent.The key issue here is domestic savings behaviour. To the extent that domestic savingsare insufficient to fund the nation’s investment needs, we must rely on foreign savings. And if we arereliant on foreign savings, we must, by definition, continue to run a current account deficit. That is asimple accounting identity.I note with interest the estimates of some commentators who suggest that the forestryindustry alone will require substantial volumes of foreign investment over the next few years. Theymay be correct in their estimates of investment needs. But if those needs are met from foreigninvestment, we must accept that that is equivalent to saying that New Zealand must continue to run acurrent account deficit.Will New Zealand generally, and the forestry sector in particular, have difficultyattracting the investment capital it requires?Probably not. So long as investors have confidence in the quality of our industries, thereliability of future earning streams, and the quality of our future macro and micro economic policies,it is unlikely that we will have difficulty in attracting the necessary investment.We compete in a global market to sell our products. Equally, we compete in a globalmarket to attract savings for investment. The pool of savings available globally is enormous, andNew Zealand’s needs represent just a minute fraction of that available. New Zealand need not,therefore, regard itself as investment constrained.But to the extent that our domestic savings fall short of the levels required to fund ourinvestment needs, our external debt ratios continue to rise, then the risks perceived by potentialinvestors will also rise. With higher risks come increased interest rate margins. It is probably also thecase that those high external debt ratios leave New Zealand a little more vulnerable to shifts ininternational market sentiment, which may reveal themselves in sharp and sometimes disruptivemovements in interest rates and exchange rates.For those reasons, it is our belief that New Zealand would face a more secure future ifour dependence on the savings of others were reduced.BIS Review   107/1997
Mr. George looks at the prospects for the City of London - in or out of EMUSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J.George, at the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs Conference in London, on 24/10/97.Prospects for the City -- in or out of EMUMr. Chairman, you have asked me to speak specifically about “the prospects for theCity - or out of EMU”. You -- very kindly in recent circumstances -- did not ask me to discuss the widerpros and cons, either of the project as a whole, or of UK membership. But perhaps I might neverthelessbegin by making a more general point.Perfectly reasonable people can legitimately disagree about EMU, both in principle andabout the appropriate timing and pace of monetary integration. On the project as a whole, most analystswould acknowledge that there are real potential benefits, but that there are also real risks to be set againstthem; and most would acknowledge that those risks will increase if the politics of EMU are allowed torun ahead of the economics, so that countries are allowed, or even encouraged, to participate, withoutfirst having achieved genuine, and sustainable, economic convergence -- in substance and not just sometechnical accounting form. On the question of British membership the new Labour Government hasspoken of ‘formidable obstacles’ to this country joining EMU in the first wave. But one thing is clear:everyone, in or out, has an unambiguous interest, if EMU does go ahead, in doing everything we can tomake it a success. And it is equally clear that those countries that participate in Monetary Union have asimilar unambiguous interest in the economic prosperity of countries remaining, at least for the timebeing, on the outside.Larry Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the US Treasury, writing about EMU in the“The US is well served when Europe is vibrant economically and working to open itsmarkets and strengthen its ties with the global economy.”He might have been speaking for all of us here in Europe, in or out, recognising that wehave a mutual, and reciprocal, self-interest in each other’s economic well-being. So my general point isthis. Whatever the outcome on EMU, it is vitally important that we continue to maintain, and strengthen,positive and constructive relationships throughout the European Union area -- and indeed beyond -- inFor the UK, in particular, if we were to opt out of the first wave, that certainly means thatduring our EU Presidency, over the critical first half of next year, we must -- as I am quite confident wewill -- do everything we possibly can to ensure that the procedures leading up to the historic decisionsrun smoothly and that the decisions themselves are timely and, hopefully, harmonious. But beyond that itcertainly means, too, that “outs”, or potential “pre-ins”, should not attempt to exploit anyperceived -- and certainly short-term -- advantage from the additional policy freedoms they might haveon the outside, but should, for example, persist in macro-economic, fiscal and monetary, discipline inparallel with the EMU countries. But it also means that the “in” countries, for their part, have an identicalself-interest in maintaining an open and constructive relationship with the “outs”/“pre-ins”. Otherwise wewould all be cutting off our nose to spite our face.I make this general point, Mr. Chairman, because this context seems to me to be relevantto any assessment of the economic prospect, of the economy as a whole or of any particular sector,within or without the euro-area. In the rest of my remarks I assume that, in or out, we will be operatingwithin a constructive, co-operative, environment throughout the EU, for the powerful reason that that isin everyone’s interest.BIS Review   106/1997
- 2 -Against that background let me turn to the prospects for the City.I will, in fact, concentrate on the case in which the UK does not participate in EMU inthe first wave, because in the alternative case, the UK in scenario, while there may be uncertainty aboutthe overall macro-economic implications, there is little reason to suppose that there would be any adverseimplications for the City in particular. The only possible disadvantage I see would result from theimposition of onerous regulatory or financial burdens -- for example onerous minimum reserverequirements -- which might act to distort activity within the financial sector and/or drive it outside theeuro-area altogether.So what then are the prospects for the City if the UK is, initially, out?The current strengths of the City -- as a uniquely international, rather than simply anational or regional European financial centre -- will be familiar to you. They include a vast, critical massof markets and financial services in commercial and investment banking, securities and derivativesactivity, investment and fund management, insurance and commodities and so on, involving anextraordinary concentration of the strongest financial businesses from all around the world. To give justone example, uniquely among the major countries we have more banks which are incorporated abroadoperating in the City than domestic banks, and over half of the total deposits of the UK banking systemis denominated in foreign currencies, worth over £1 trillion -- that’s a one and twelvenoughts -- notwithstanding the current strength of sterling.The particular strengths that have contributed to this massive concentration ofinternational business are many and various. They include: the English language; the convenient timezone; the ready availability of the relevant trading and other financial skills as well as professionalsupport services -- in law, accountancy, tax, property, communications and so on. They include effectiveinfrastructure. And they include importantly, too, an adaptive regulatory framework which has in factbeen remarkably successful in maintaining confidence in financial institutions and markets withoutstifling innovation and risk-taking. All of these factors -- and no doubt others -- help to explain whysome 600,000 people are estimated to be employed in finance and other business services in GreaterLondon -- a number which I believe is roughly equal to the total population of Frankfurt.Now you will have noticed that none of these factors has anything to do with thequestion of the national currency used either here in the UK or in Continental Europe.The main impact of the advent of the euro on financial activity, as I see it, is that it willencourage the development of broader and deeper and more liquid markets, in financial instruments of allkinds, where they are currently fragmented because they are denominated in the various individualnational European currencies. The City of London thrives on liquid markets regardless of thecurrency -- and it will thrive on the euro, whether the UK is “in” or “out”. Measured in these terms theintroduction of the euro represents an opportunity for London rather than a threat. I have no doubtwhatever that there will be a vigorous euro-euro market in London, come what may, just as there is avigorous market in euro-DM or euro-francs as well as euro-$ and euro-yen at present. The reality is thatthe location of financial activity does not depend upon the local currency. It will continue to be carried onwherever it can most conveniently, efficiently and profitably be carried on. And the fact thatforeign-owned institutions -- from Europe itself and from around the world -- continue to build theirpresence here, despite the near universal assumption that the UK will not in fact participate in EMU fromthe beginning, suggests that they share this perception.I would hope that the rest of Europe would positively welcome the contribution that theCity can, and I am confident will, make to the development of markets and other financial activity in theeuro, because it is in their interest too. International or intra-regional trade and investment activity is not,at the macro-economic level, a zero-sum game. It is a positive sum game. And this is true of financial,just as much as of any other kind of economic activity. The prosperity of the City -- whether the UK is“in” or “out” -- is simply a particular case of the general point which I made at the outset. I welcome theBIS Review   106/1997
- 3 -prospect of increasing financial activity in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan or Amsterdam or wherever because itwill result in increased activity here too in London. And the converse is equally true. It is in this sensethat the City is a major European, not simply a national asset.Now some people may argue that “offshore” markets in national or regional currenciescomplicate the conduct of national or regional monetary policy, with the implication that national orregional currencies should somehow be confined to their national or regional space. I must confess thatthis view seems to ignore the fact that it has in practice over the past twenty or thirty years provedperfectly possible for monetary policy to be conducted successfully despite the existence of theeuro-markets. And I do not see how one could realistically expect to contain the use of a major currency,which the euro will certainly be, within territorial borders in any event.But as I have made clear, the UK’s interest -- “in” or “out” -- lies unambiguously indoing all that we can to ensure that the single currency succeeds. And in this context we would, ofcourse, co-operate with the ECB in any way we could, to avoid potential disturbance to Europeanmonetary policy, were it shown to exist.Mr Chairman, London does not hold its pre-eminent position as Europe’s major financialcentre as of right. We must continue to earn it. If we are to take advantage -- “in” or “out” -- of theopportunity that the euro will bring, then we must be technically well prepared.We will be.There is increasing evidence that financial institutions in the UK are now taking the stepsnecessary to ensure that they are ready for the introduction of the euro, whether or not the UK joinsEMU. In the early summer, we invited a representative sample of firms to confirm whether theirpreparations were on track. The response we received was broadly reassuring, though some of theirpreparations are dependent on decisions about the euro markets which have yet to be taken, as I shallexplain in a moment. But the key point is that the urgency of the need to prepare is now widelyrecognised.The Bank of England is playing a substantive role in the preparations in twocomplementary ways. Through our very active participation in the work of the EMI, we aim to make surethat the design of EMU, at least so far as the operations of the ECB are concerned, is capable of beingdelivered in a technical sense. That is the test that we have applied, for example, to the work of the EMIon the implementation of monetary policy and on the so-called changeover scenario. John Townendtalked about this yesterday.Our other role is to co-ordinate the preparations for the introduction of the euro in theCity of London, to the extent that co-ordination is required. The Bank’s role in helping the financialsector to prepare for the euro was recognised and reconfirmed by the Chancellor this summer when helaunched his complementary initiative to begin preparing the business community for the euro. Inaddition to making our own internal preparations at the Bank, we play a co-ordinating role in thefinancial community in three main ways:First, our job is to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is developed in the UK toallow anyone who wishes to do so to use the euro in wholesale payments and across the financial marketsin London from the first day of EMU.Second, we aim to promote discussion between the EMI, national central banks andmarket participants across Europe about practical issues on which the market is seeking a degree ofco-ordination.And third, we provide information: for example, through our quarterly series of editionson Practical Issues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro, which is distributed to around 32,000BIS Review   106/1997

And following the successfulsymposium we held early this year, we are planning to hold a further symposium, next January at theBank, on London as the international financial centre for the euro. Our theme will be: ‘London will beready’.I shall now turn to the steps that we are taking to ensure that London will be ready for theeuro, whether the UK is “in” or “out”.(i) Payments and settlement infrastructure for the euroFirst of all, the payments and settlement infrastructure. We are constructing paymentsarrangements in euro in London which we intend to be at least as efficient and cheap as anywhere else inEurope, even if the UK stays “out”. In the UK, the real-time gross settlement system which came intooperation in the spring of last year is being developed so that it will operate in euro. If the UK joins, theUK sterling system will effectively become a euro system. And, in case the UK is “out”, a parallel eurosystem is under construction to sit alongside the sterling system: it will enable the members of CHAPSto process euro payments as a foreign currency within the UK and across borders within the EU, throughits link to the pan-European RTGS system -- TARGET -- which is being developed.The idea behind TARGET is to link together in euro the national RTGS systems of EUMember States so that large-value payments can be made or received between Member States throughoutthe EU area, with finality in real time, in exactly the same way as they can at present be made andreceived within Member States with national RTGS systems denominated in their own nationalcurrencies. One of the main purposes of TARGET is to support closer European economic and financialintegration by reducing the risks in pan-European payments -- just as national RTGS systems reduce therisk in national payment systems. The other main purpose of TARGET is to integrate the euro moneymarket so as to ensure that the same short term euro interest rate -- determined by the single monetarypolicy of the ECB -- prevails throughout the euro area. TARGET is a project which we strongly support.It has been agreed that all EU Member States may connect their national RTGS systemsto TARGET, whether or not they join EMU. The main policy issue outstanding concerns the terms onwhich the European Central Bank will grant intraday credit to the “outs”. We see no monetary -- orother -- grounds for any discrimination against the “outs”. If intraday liquidity to the “outs” were to berestricted the effect would be to increase the cost of using TARGET, and to damage the efficiency of thesystem for both “ins” and “outs”. That would simply divert euro payments to alternative mechanisms,including correspondent banking and the EBA’s net end-of-day settlement system. It would be unlikelysignificantly to deter the international use of the euro -- if that were the objective -- any more than lack ofdirect access to national RTGS systems deters the international use of the dollar or yen or Deutsche Marknow. Its main impact would be to make intra-European payments less secure. We would regret that.Besides payments systems, the preparation of securities settlement systems for theintroduction of the euro is a complex task in its own right. One of the reasons for this is that there aredifferent approaches to securities settlement between different Member States and financial institutions.Another is that different approaches may be required to meet issuers’ requirements for re-denomination.Even in one market in one country, the introduction of major changes in securities settlement systemscan lead to teething problems, both in the central IT infrastructure and for individual institutions as theylearn how to apply the changes. Yet in the case of EMU, a number of Member States will switch to theeuro more or less simultaneously at the start. That carries considerable risks of confusion and error,unless there is an extensive programme across Europe to explain the changes required in detail first. Thisis not of course, a particular problem for the UK.(ii) Market framework for the use of the euroBIS Review   106/1997
- 5 -The second important aspect of preparation is the development of a comprehensivemarket framework for the use of the euro in London. The euro regulations help to provide the legal partof the framework as I understand you discussed yesterday.To make sure that the euro market in London, as elsewhere in Europe, is as deep andliquid as possible, we also need to harmonise market conventions on new issues of securities in the euromoney and bond markets, and conventions in the foreign exchange markets. Market associations nowagree on the basis on which conventions in these markets should be harmonised, and the Bank hasencouraged their initiative. The problem has been to see how EU-wide decisions will be taken.Harmonised practices may develop spontaneously in the markets, but there is no guarantee of this. So itis very helpful that the EMI Council decided with our encouragement in September to ‘welcome andsupport’ harmonised market conventions on the basis proposed by the market associations. We alsowelcome the EMI Council’s decision in September to prepare for the computation by the ESCB of aneffective overnight reference rate for the euro area.There remains however a good deal to be done everywhere -- in co-ordinating pricesources, for example, as methods of redenomination. But in all of these respects London is well up withthe game.ConclusionMr. Chairman, it is sometimes suggested that a perceived threat to its activity if we were“out” will cause the City to press for early UK membership of EMU, and that this will be an importantfactor in the Government’s decision. I am bound to say that I see very little sign of this. Certainly thereare those in the City who advocate our early participation, but there are equally those who are morehesitant -- just as opinions are divided elsewhere within the country. But for the most part, myimpression is that City attitudes to EMU, whether for or against, reflect a broader assessment of therespective pros and cons for the country as a whole rather than strong views about the implications forthe City in particular. On the whole I find that City opinion is relatively optimistic about its futureprospects, “in” or “out”. And, provided we do indeed operate within a co-operative framework, andprovided we are indeed well prepared, the City has good reason to be optimistic.BIS Review   106/1997
Mr. Erçel considers the European financial markets and their implications forTurkish institutions   Speech given by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,Mr. Gazi Erçel, in Istanbul on 23/10/97.The EMU will be the most important change in the international monetary system sincethe creation of the IMF at Bretton Woods. The creation of a new currency, the Euro, is in fact a historicalevent for the European Union (EU). It marks a new quality in the process of European unificationbecause it is the final point and coronation of efforts since 1958 to create one big market in Europe.The success of the Euro area will, of course, depend on the future development of thevalue of the Euro. The Euro, as we all know, has to compete with two strong international currencies: theUS dollar and the Japanese yen. According to one school of thought, the Euro will have a stable value.That is because the high stock of assets in Euro, held by official or private foreign holders and whichwere converted from national currencies, in particular from Deutsche Mark, will not be switched intoother currencies.Besides, once the Euro is introduced, there could be a significant switch of foreignexchange reserves out of US dollars and into Euro. This could give a boost to the exchange rate of theEuro against the US dollar over time. The sheer size of the economy in the monetary union willencourage the use of the Euro instead of the US dollar in trade and foreign exchange transactions. Thisprocess would further be accelerated by the fact that the use of a single currency will remove the notnegligible cost of transactions. According to a study conducted by the IFO Institute in Munich, “thetransaction costs for the inter-European currency management may be in the order of nearly 60 billionECUs, or nearly 1% the GNP of the European Union”.Also it is likely that central banks will use the Euro rather than the US dollar in foreignexchange interventions. In turn, this will encourage non-EU central banks to switch an increasingproportion of their reserves into the Euro. This process will take time and the Euro will not usurp the roleof the US dollar in the short term. However, the trend is likely to be persistent and eventually the currentimportance of the US dollar in the foreign exchange markets should be replaced by the joint importanceof the US dollar and the Euro. One factor which will affect the speed of this change is the outlook for theEuro based on the fundamentals of the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). Moreover,the creation of a monetary union will prevent exchange rate volatility within the united Europe, thereason being that the Euro area as a whole will be much less dependent on foreign trade. It is estimatedthat the share of foreign trade of the Euro area will be only about 10% of GNP in comparison to about30% for Germany today. And over the long term, the Euro should become almost as widely used as theUS dollar is today.One conclusion to be inferred from this is the following: since Turkey has close trade,service and financial links with Europe, and as the only country connected to Europe in a Customs Union(CU), which I hope will evolve over time towards full membership, the EMU will create completely newconditions in Turkey’s international and European relations. Therefore what will happen in Europe willbe decisive for Turkey in the years ahead. It will be a challenge for the Turkish authorities, as well as forbankers and businessmen.One of the most important prerequisites for a successful monetary union is a sufficientdegree of economic convergence among the potential members. From that standpoint the degree ofconvergence among the EU countries is remarkable, particularly as regards the convergence criteria;stable prices, stable exchange rates, low long-term interest rates and healthy public finances. In additionto these criteria, the Maastricht Treaty requires that all member countries in the EU must grantindependence to their central banks before the Monetary Union and the establishment of the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB). The reason behind the requirement of independent national centralbanks is that fixing exchange rates and unifying currencies requires a common monetary policy.BIS Review   105/1997
- 2 -For a currency union to function “smoothly and in a sustainable way, it is absolutelynecessary that all participants agree on either a single common policy or closely coordinated policies”.All costs and benefits of the union must be shared equally. Any member acting with the “free-rider”mentality, and benefiting from the system at the expense of the others, will eventually cause the systemto disintegrate. Therefore, a single common currency requires a single monetary policy with a clearlydefined target, which is price stability. This basic principle of monetary policy has already beenembedded in the Maastricht Treaty. And the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has been maderesponsible for achieving it.In order for the ESCB to fulfil the task assigned to it, it must act in full independencefrom national governments or from European institutions. The ESCB Governing Council, which iscomposed of the Board of Management of the ESCB and the governors of the participating central banks,will not be representing respective national interests. Although there are some differences between thetwo systems, the ESCB is like the Federal Reserve System of the US. For the ESCB to actindependently, individual national central banks must already be acting independently of theirgovernments, because the ESCB will be built on individual national central banks. That is why theMaastricht Treaty made it obligatory for the national governments to grant independence to their centralbanks in the period leading to the formation of the ESCB.The EMU is an event with far-reaching consequences; in one way or the other allcountries will be affected by it. Unlike the effect of a currency area, a customs union or a free trade area,a monetary union can affect in various degrees all countries, irrespective of whether they are in or out.This general fact, together with the signing a Customs Union (CU) Agreement with the EU, make EMUeven more important for Turkey than for other countries outside the EMU. Therefore, I believe that theTurkish Central Bank has a predominant role to play in informing and educating all Turkish entitiesabout the choices and implications of EMU.As you all know, Turkey is one of the potential countries to join the EU. I would say thatour country’s ultimate aim is to become a full member of the EU; therefore first we need to adapt toEuropean standards in many areas. The steps Turkey took on the way to the CU are also steps taken toensure full integration in EMU. After these general remarks I would like to look at the issue fromTurkey’s perspective.So far, the measures taken to support the independence of the Central Bank of Turkey(CBT) are remarkable. Recently, the Central Bank Law was amended and now limits have been set onthe so-called “short-term advances” which the Treasury is legally entitled to obtain from the CentralBank. Starting from 1994, the Treasury’s annual use of short-term advances is to be reduced graduallyover five years from 15 to 3 percent of each year’s incremental budget appropriations. By 1998, theTreasury will be entitled to short-term advances totalling not more than 3 percent of that year’sincremental budget appropriations over the previous year.In addition to that, the Treasury and the Central Bank have signed a seven-point protocolto cooperate in fighting inflation. The official aim of this accord is also to give the Central Bank moreindependence. So, an important development towards the full independence of the Central Bank has beeninitiated, as required in the Maastricht Treaty.However, we have been in the process of preparing a new Central Bank law in parallelwith the same institutions in the EU. The work has already been done and we are ready to submit it to thegovernment if and when the political environment is appropriate.On the other hand, in addition to the already installed electronic payments clearingsystem, the CB has signed a contract to develop and install a modern national securities settlementsystem. The new system will allow the Bank to increase the efficiency with which government securitiescan be traded on the capital markets and ensure that the payments system will match the standards ofthose in the EU and other western nations. The new system will also be capable of being connected to theBIS Review   105/1997
- 3 -TARGET network. At the same time the system will strengthen Turkey’s links with the Europeanmember countries and will enable it to trade in the same currency as other members, a requirement forparticipation in the EMU. As far as the technical infrastructure is concerned, Turkey is ready to integrateitself into the EU.I would like to remind you that Turkey has been pursuing a series of liberalizationpolicies since 1980 which are broadly in line with economic tendencies in the world. A wide range ofpolicy measures were put into effect to achieve the restructuring of the economy. Changes in exchangerate and trade policies were the main instruments in this process. This program has brought a radicalchange in Turkey’s development strategy by increasing its dependence on market forces. In this context,the fixed exchange rate policy was replaced by the flexible one, restrictive control measures on importswere abolished and protection was reduced gradually. Similarly, foreign exchange transactions werethoroughly liberalized, free trade zones were established, foreign investment was further encouragedalong with the privatization of public enterprises. As a result of these newly adopted policies, there havebeen spectacular changes in the Turkish economy, with exports and foreign investments having proved tobe responsive to the structural adjustment process; within this process, the Turkish lira has become fullyconvertible and restrictions on capital movements have been effectively removed.Even though the liberalization policies were adopted independent of the EU perspective,they helped to facilitate Turkey’s attempt to apply for full membership, by providing a solid basis forlasting progress.On the other hand, member countries of the EU have tried to make some adaptations intheir banking regulations to integrate financial systems. Competition among them has increased. Auniversal banking system is accepted. Banks either have increased their assets or have merged with otherbanks in order to be strong in a market where competition is intensified. New financial products arecreated every day. Technology is used intensively in order to reduce costs and serve customers better. Inparallel to these developments many reforms have been made in order to develop the Turkish bankingsystem. Some amendments were made to the Banking Law to harmonize it with European standards, andnow we are in the process of preparing a new Banking Law. These changes will require some banks tostrengthen their financial situation and bring their credit risk and equity participation ratios closer to theEU norms. Within the process of becoming more deeply integrated with the European financial markets,the Turkish banking system will now face new competition. The CU agreement has naturally affectedTurkish banks and changed the dimensions of competition. But Turkish banks seem ready in many waysfor this new and larger competitive environment. Today banks in Turkey are made more dynamic by ahigh-technology electronic infrastructure, high-quality services and well-trained manpower. What weneed is to integrate the legal and institutional systems in parallel with the EU banks.With the introduction of the Euro there would arise a number of technical issues whichmust be immediately tackled. As of today, Turkish banks are allowed to maintain foreign exchangepositions in 23 foreign currencies, of which 17, including the ECU, are European currencies. With theEuro the CB and the Turkish banks will no longer have to deal in these currencies, but only in Euro.Of course, initially there will be some currencies, like the British pound and a few others,which will continue to exist for a while. But within this process, all foreign assets and liabilities in thecurrencies of the countries participating in the monetary union will need to be converted into the Euro.Currently, Turkey follows an exchange rate policy based on a basket consisting of the USdollar and the Deutsche Mark. It is assumed that since other European currencies are related to theDeutsche Mark through the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), the basket also reflects theweight of other European currencies through the Deutsche Mark. With monetary union the share of theEuro area in Turkey’s overall trade in goods or services will be more than 50%. But this will not changethe picture from the exchange rate policy point of view. Therefore the Euro could easily be substitute forDeutsche Mark in the present basket.BIS Review   105/1997
- 4 -Within the CB’s foreign reserves, some positions are being held in the currencies of thecountries which are candidates for monetary union membership. These positions consist of securities andmoney market placements. It is expected that security investments will be converted to the Euro as ofJanuary 1st, 1999. Money market placements on the other hand will continue to be transacted in theiroriginal currencies until July 1st, 2002. The fixing of the Deutsche Mark rate against Euro, the Euro’svalue against other currencies in the international money markets and the depth and performance of theEuro bond market will be important factors in terms of our reserve management policy. In the Euromarket, there will no longer be any cross-currency risk and cross currency-induced interest ratedifferential. However, it is possible that the country risk-induced differential will become morepronounced. Therefore investors must pay attention to which country’s security they are buying wheninvesting in Euro-denominated securities.There are also issues which should be considered by the real sector. In particular thosefirms which are very active in trades across borders are likely to adopt the value of the Euro in theirdealings rather quickly, because firms competing in European markets, in order to make comparisonpossible, should set their prices in Euro.As I have already mentioned, the CB and the commercial banks have to convert theforeign exchange denominated accounts into the Euro. This is not an easy task and involves changes inaccounting systems and data processing. Therefore due attention has to be paid to these infrastructuralchanges prior to the introduction of the Euro.The fact that the EU is Turkey’s most important trading partner increases theimplications of EMU for the Turkish economy. On the other hand, the EU has the largest share in foreigninvestment in Turkey, and invisible earnings in the Turkish balance of payments have a significantEuropean content. Furthermore, most of our correspondent banks are in the Euro zone. Turkey has closetrade, service and financial links with Europe, as the only country connected to Europe in a CU whichhopefully will evolve over time towards full membership.In conclusion, I would like to point out that time is getting short for launching the Euro.The time remaining must therefore be used efficiently. Those who have prepared and are ready will alsobe those who will also derive the greatest benefits. I do believe that we are heading in the right direction.BIS Review   105/1997
Remarks by Ms. Phillips at the Asset/Liability and Treasury ManagementConference of the Bank Administration Institute   Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member ofthe Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Asset/Liability and TreasuryManagement Conference of the Bank Administration Institute, Chicago, on 4/11/97.It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the Federal Reserve’s perspective on riskmanagement. As you know, advances in the methods and techniques in this area are having wide-rangingeffects on the corporate decision making process in all types of business. The effects on bankinginstitutions have been especially profound. Clearly, financial engineering and improvements in riskmanagement have helped banks to expand product lines, offer more efficient services, and control therisks of ever more complex financial instruments and the growing volume of financial transactions.For some institutions, the application of new risk management techniques to specificareas is leading the way to a broader, firm-wide risk consciousness that is completely, and appropriately,transforming the entire corporate culture. This is particularly important since the very essence of bankingand financial intermediation is the acceptance and management of risk. Adopting a “risk-focused”corporate culture from the highest levels of senior management down through business line personnelrepresents the ultimate product quality assurance program for individual customers and the financialsystem more generally.From the Federal Reserve’s perspective, effective risk management at financialinstitutions plays a critical role in helping to achieve our central bank responsibilities of:1. promoting an efficient and effective financial system that adequately financeseconomic growth, and2. ensuring that financial institutions do not become a source of systemic risk, or pose athreat to the payment system or burden taxpayers with losses arising from the federal safety net.Advances in risk management clearly help reduce potential systemic disruptions. TheFederal Reserve, along with other supervisors both here and abroad, has focused increasing resources onencouraging developments in this area. Indeed, just as financial engineering and advances in riskmanagement are changing the operating methods and business cultures of financial institutions, they arealso transforming both the operations and the corporate culture of bank supervisors. While ultimate goalsand objectives remain the same, over the past several years, supervisors have been moving to more“incentive-compatible” approaches to 1) foster sound risk management within the institution rather thancompliance with narrow rules and regulations, 2) minimize burden through the use of new examinationapproaches and internal risk measurement systems, and 3) reinforce market discipline.Fostering Sound Risk ManagementKey to almost all of these initiatives has been an increasing effort by supervisors to avoidlocking themselves into formulaic, one-size-fits-all approaches to supervision and regulation. Too oftenfinancial engineering has been targeted at regulatory arbitrage -- that is, the exploitation of loopholes innarrow regulatory policies are based on old traditional instruments, activities or business lines.Supervisors are increasingly recognizing that the underlying risk characteristics of afinancial instrument, activity or business line are of primary importance and not what they are called orofficially labelled. To be sure, financial engineering can create derivative instruments which can combinecomponent risks (including market, credit, liquidity, operational and reputational risks) in complex ways.But seemingly simple traditional cash instruments can actually have higher risk profiles than manyinstruments that are formally labelled “derivatives.” In fact, the categorization of financial instrumentsand activities without regard to their underlying risk and economic functions can actually handicap soundmanagement.BIS Review   105/1997
- 2 -Thus, Federal Reserve and other supervisors have increasingly issued supervisoryguidance that emphasizes managing the risks involved in bank activities and de-emphasizes thesupervisory focus on specific instruments or traditional products.Most recently, the FFIEC published for industry comment a new policy statement thatwould eliminate the 1992 interagency policy that instituted the FFIEC high risk test. The older policystatement placed significant constraints on a depository institution’s holding of certain “high-risk”mortgage securities that met specific market risk sensitivity tests. The new policy would replace the highrisk test with broader guidance on sound practices for managing all investment and end-user activities. Inessence, the new statement would allow an institution to hold any bank-eligible instrument as aninvestment as long as the institution had an adequate risk management process commensurate with thescope, complexity, and sophistication of its investment and end-user holdings.The old FFIEC high-risk tests offer an excellent case study of the potential pitfalls ofnarrow formulaic supervision in an age of dynamic financial engineering. By requiring a pre-purchaseprice sensitivity analysis, the high risk test successfully helped institutions better understand the interestrate risk of certain mortgage securities. It effectively constrained many smaller financial institutions fromacquiring certain types of securities that subsequently created large losses for other investors.However, while protecting some institutions, the tests may also have distorted theinvestment decision making process at other depository institutions. Concerns about burden andheightened examiner review of all types of mortgage securities may have led institutions to blindlyeliminate them as potential investments -- regardless of the merits of their risk/return profiles. Also, byfocusing only on certain products, the test provided incentives for institutions to acquire other types ofsecurities with embedded options that required no testing. Such instruments were thought to have asupervisory “stamp of approval”, but in fact often had risk characteristics similar to or greater than thosedesignated as “high risk”.Assuming positive industry comments, the FFIEC hopes to implement the proposed newpolicy in early 1998. The comment period extends through November 17, and I encourage all of you tocomment.I might mention that the new policy will apply to all investment and end-user derivativesactivities. It illustrates that supervisors are increasingly emphasizing risk management on a portfoliorather than an instrument-specific basis. Although this is arguably the first principle of finance and iswidely appreciated by bankers and regulators, putting this principle into practice in banking has not beeneasy. Past banking crises have, in part, reflected a failure to recognize or to prudently limit concentrationsof risk. However, technology and financial innovation are now enabling financial theories and conceptualtechniques that have been around for decades to be put into practice to manage market, credit andliquidity risks. Moreover, these risks are increasingly being managed across activities and in some caseson a global basis.This move to a broad portfolio or “macro” approach to managing risk has influencedbank supervisory efforts in several ways. All three of the U.S. banking agencies now take a more“risk-focused” approach to bank supervision. Bank exams are no longer exhaustive reviews of all of abank’s specific activities. Instead, they now take a more targeted approach to identifying and reviewingthe sources of risk within a bank’s “portfolio” of activities. Exam resources are now targeted atevaluating the soundness of a bank’s processes for managing risks and our supervisory tools have beenenhanced in this direction.Increased Use of Internal Measurement and Management SystemsIn addition, supervisors increasingly are relying on internal risk management systems,including increasingly sophisticated risk measurement systems used by banks to manage their businesses.BIS Review   105/1997
- 3 -The objectives here are two-fold -- to help improve the effectiveness of our examinations and to reducethe burden on banking organizations.Examinations now involve significant off-site, pre-planning, analysis and fact finding.Then the on-site examination activities include spot checks to determine the reliability of the bank’sinternal risk management system. To the extent examiners gain confidence in the bank’s riskmanagement process, they will place greater emphasis on the findings of the bank’s internal auditors atan earlier stage in the examination process and focus resources in other areas.An area of bank risk management systems that has been particularly useful to supervisorsis risk measurement. No better example exists than the banking agencies’ adoption of a risk assessmentapproach for evaluating capital adequacy for interest rate risk.Early on in that rulemaking process, supervisors recognized that a number of bankinginstitutions had internal models for measuring interest rate risk that were much more sophisticated thanany possible standardized regulatory model. However, at the same time, supervisors were acutely awarethat many other institutions had limited capabilities in this area and that many banks may have beenhesitant to develop more sophisticated internal measurement systems prior to the determination of asupervisory approach. Accordingly, in 1993, supervisors proposed to use the results of internal modelsfor evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure at individual institutions. While therulemaking process was ultimately longer than desired, it did demonstrate the clear intent of supervisorsto encourage and provide incentives for improvements in risk management and to take full advantage ofsuch advances when possible. I think most banks would agree that the discovery process and commentperiods supervisors convened from 1993 through 1995, and the ensuing dialogue, spurred significantindustry development and refinement of interest rate risk models.A similar process evolved in developing the international capital standard for market riskin the trading activities of internationally active banks. Beginning next January, banks that meet certainqualitative and quantitative standards for risk management will calculate market risk capital charges fortheir trading activities on the basis of their own internal Value at Risk (VaR) measures. Here again,supervisors recognized early developments in the quantitative measurement of market risks, encouragedindustry progress, and sought to build on the VaR concept when developing a supervisory approach.During the discovery and rulemaking process the supervisory attention paid to VaR techniques led tomore robust modelling and has helped spread the use of VaR techniques worldwide.Moving forward, perhaps such supervisory/private sector synergies can be gained in otherareas of risk management, as well. The quantification of credit risks, by far the most important risk inbanking, may be a candidate. At present, some institutions are making significant strides on a number offronts to better quantify and manage credit risk. In addition to major developments in credit scoring andthe use of artificial intelligence in underwriting various types of consumer loans, a few banks arebeginning to use historical data to estimate probability loss distributions for the credit risk of differentquality commercial loans. In some banks, credit risk-adjusted returns to capital are being used toconstruct a portfolio management framework for credit risk. This, in turn, is providing a proving groundfor a risk-adjusted pricing of loans as well as a myriad of new instruments such as credit derivatives.While industry efforts to quantify credit risks are still in the early stages of evolution, recent progressholds promise for reducing both institutional and systemic risks.Indeed, these efforts might eventually lead to new supervisory regimes for addressingcredit risk. Better methods of quantifying credit risk have significant potential for reducing the timeexaminers spend in on-site examinations. Moreover, advances in credit risk measurement may ultimatelyallow supervisors to design regulatory capital standards around internal models. We recognize theinadequacy of the existing risk-based capital regime where such assets as loans are all treated as havingthe same risk. We are actively encouraging the development of more quantitative approaches to creditrisk management. However, better regulatory tools are not yet available. While supervisors can prodBIS Review   105/1997
- 4 -developments in risk management, ultimately it will be up to the industry to find other ways to bettermeasure and manage credit risk.Strengthening Market DisciplineHarnessing market forces to reinforce supervisory objectives is another important goal inthe changing culture of supervisors. Reliable financial information and adequate disclosure of riskexposures is an essential ingredient to achieving this goal. Market participants can benefit from enhanceddisclosure by being in a better position to understand the financial condition of counterparties andcompetitors. Investors have an obvious interest in being able to make meaningful assessments of a firm’sperformance, underlying trends, and income-producing potential. Sound, well-managed firms can benefitif better disclosure enables them to obtain funds at risk premiums that accurately reflect lower riskprofiles. Inadequate financial disclosures, on the other hand, could penalize well-managed firms if marketparticipants are unable to assess fundamental financial strength.It is this desire to see market discipline play a greater role in influencing bankingactivities that has prompted the Federal Reserve Board to join the debate about the derivative accountingstandards that are being developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Everyoneagrees that a critical function of financial statements is to reflect in a meaningful way underlying trendsin the financial performance and condition of the firm as well as the economic substance of its activities.However, the Board believes that the application of market value accounting to business strategies wherenot appropriate, and particularly when applied on a piecemeal basis, or when market prices are notreadily available, may lead to increased volatility or fluctuation in reported results. Such accountingpractices may actually obscure underlying trends or developments affecting a firm’s condition andperformance. Requiring companies to adopt market value accounting where it is not consistent withbusiness strategies can cause them to incur significant costs to provide information that may notrealistically reflect way underlying circumstances or trends in performance. Moreover, from thestandpoint of financial statement analysts and other users, having to make adjustments to remove theeffects of meaningless accounting volatility from income statements and balance sheets can also imposesignificant costs without offsetting benefits.The Board believes that these problems can be minimized by having large firms withactive trading portfolios place market values in supplemental disclosures rather than by forcing their usein the primary financial statements. Such an approach would give analysts the information they need,without imposing costs on an unnecessarily wide range of firms and without imposing the broader costsof having to reverse or “back out” the distorting effects of the proposed accounting standard.Emerging Challenges to Risk ManagementWithout a doubt, banking institutions have made significant progress in implementingnew techniques and methods in risk management. To date, most work in this area has centered around the“science” of risk management -- that is, the quantitative measurement of risk.However, quantitative measurement is only one element of the overall process offinancial risk management. Other elements such as board and senior management oversight, internalcontrols, and the role of internal and external audits are just as important. Given the pace of technologicaland financial innovation, inadequate internal controls can expose an institution to significant risk. Indeed,inadequate management oversight, combined with a lack of internal controls, has been the primary causeof the losses experienced by several high profile major international banking organizations. In some casesbasic time-honored internal controls such as segmentation of duties and independent risk assessment hadbeen ignored. In others, internal management processes have failed to keep pace with technologicaldevelopment, financial innovation, and global expansion. It is these “low tech” areas that pose continuedchallenges to risk management.BIS Review   105/1997
- 5 -Some institutions are beginning to address these challenges in their attempts to identify,monitor and control the operating risks of various business lines. Indeed, operating risk is quicklyemerging as the next frontier of risk management. While no clear standardized definition of operatingrisk has yet emerged, several progressive institutions are expending significant resources to address theoperating risks inherent in particular business lines. For some, this involves conducting extensive riskassessments throughout business and product lines to identify both the types of processing, information,and personnel risks that exist and the potential measures that can be taken to mitigate them. Others arebuttressing these assessments with attempts actually to quantify and charge internal capital for operatingrisk exposures.Supervisors can also be expected to more closely monitor banks’ efforts to identify andmanage operating risks. One very important operating risk that all banking institutions face is thechallenge of addressing the Year 2000 issue. U.S. banks appear to be taking this matter seriously and aregenerally well underway toward identifying individual needs and developing action plans. The FederalReserve and the other federal bank supervisors are reviewing the relevant efforts of every insureddepository institution in order to determine whether adequate progress on this issue is being made.Meeting the demands of this review and ensuring proper remedies both before and after the Year 2000will be a significant and costly task to both the industry and the banking agencies.However, even within the context of banking, the scope of the Year 2000 problemextends far beyond U.S. banks to foreign banks, bank borrowers, depositors, vendors, and othercounterparties. Banks and others need to address Year 2000 system alterations, not only because of thepotential effects on overall markets, but also as a threat to individual firm viability. At a minimum, banksshould be concerned about their ability to provide uninterrupted service to their customers into the nextmillennium. If nothing else, it is simply good business.SummaryIn summary, advances in computerization and communications have created a paradigmshift for financial markets, the financial services industry, and the management of financial risks. Inresponse, supervisors are also moving to a new, more “incentive-compatible” regime of greater relianceon banks’ own risk measures and internal controls. This transformation may be slow and will bechallenging for all. Supervisors can encourage innovation, but the private sector must do much of thedevelopment work.As always, a transition to an improved framework will work best with cooperative, opendialogue between the financial industry and its regulators, so that compatible and efficient answers arefound. In today’s markets, institutions and financial systems are linked as never before, and suchconnections are likely to grow in the years ahead. How effectively institutions manage their risks andallocate their capital will have substantial consequences for economic growth.We have seen significant progress in measuring market risk, and the groundwork is beinglaid for future gains in measuring credit risk, but those are only two risks. Operating risks such as fraud,human misjudgments, and the failure of information systems, processing operations and basic internalcontrols must be addressed comprehensively. At this point, we can take satisfaction in the riskmanagement strides we have made. But I am confident that opportunities for even greater progress lieahead.BIS Review   105/1997
Mr. Kelley's testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee onBanking and Financial Services   Testimony by Mr. Edward W. Kelley Jr., a member of the Boardof Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking and FinancialServices of the US House of Representatives, in Washington DC, on 4/11/97.I am pleased to appear before the Committee today to discuss the Federal Reserve’sefforts to address the Year 2000 computer systems issue. The Federal Reserve System has developedand is executing a comprehensive plan to ensure its own Year 2000 readiness and the banksupervision function is well along in a cooperative, interagency effort, to promote timely remediationand testing by the banking industry. This afternoon I will focus on actions being taken by the FederalReserve System to address our internal systems, coordination with the industry, and contingencyplanning.BackgroundThe Federal Reserve operates several payments applications that process and settlepayments and securities transactions between depository institutions in the United States. Three ofthese applications are the Fedwire funds transfer, Fedwire securities transfer, and AutomatedClearing House (ACH) applications. The first two applications are large-value payments mechanismsfor U.S. dollar interbank funds transfers and U.S. government securities transfers. Users of theapplications are primarily depository institutions and government agencies.The Fedwire funds transfer system is a real-time credit transfer system used primarilyfor payments related to interbank funds transfers such as Fed funds transactions, interbank settlementtransactions, and “third-party” payments between the customers of depository institutions. Fundstransferred over Fedwire are immediately final; they cannot be revoked after they have been acceptedand processed by the Federal Reserve. About 10,000 depository institutions use the Fedwire fundstransfer system to transfer each year approximately 86 million payments valued at over $280 trillion.The current average total daily value of Fedwire funds transfers is approximately $1.1 trillion.The Fedwire securities transfer system supports the safekeeping, clearing, andsettlement of U.S. government securities in both the primary and secondary markets. It providescustody of U.S. government securities in book-entry form, as well as the transfer of securitiesownership among market participants. On the custody side, the system calculates and credits interestand principal payments to the holders of securities, reconciles outstanding securities balances withissuers, and performs other record keeping and collateral safekeeping functions. On the transfer side,the system delivers book-entry securities against a simultaneous payment, calleddelivery-versus-payment, thus reducing the settlement risks of market participants. About 8,000depository institutions use the Fedwire securities transfer service to transfer each year approximately13 million securities valued at over $160 trillion. The average total daily value of Fedwire securitiestransfers is about $650 billion.The ACH is an electronic payment service that supports both credit and debittransactions and is used by approximately 14,000 financial institutions, 400,000 companies, and anestimated 50 million consumers. Typical credit transactions include direct deposit of payroll andcorporate payments to suppliers. Typical debit transactions include the collection of mortgage andloan payments and corporate cash concentration transactions. The ACH processes transactions inbatches one or two days before they are scheduled to settle. ACH transactions are settled throughdepository institutions’ accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks. Approximately 4 billion ACHtransactions were processed in 1996 with a total value of approximately $12 trillion. About 3.3 billionof these payments were commercial transactions; 625 million payments were originated by theFederal government.BIS Review   104/1997
- 2 -The Reserve Banks’ critical applications, such as Fedwire funds and securitiestransfer, ACH, and supporting accounting systems, run on mainframe computer systems operated byFederal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS), the internal organizational unit that processesapplications on behalf of the Federal Reserve Banks and operates the Federal Reserve’s nationalnetwork. These critical applications are “centralized”, that is, one copy of the application is used byall twelve Reserve Banks. In addition to centralized applications on the mainframe, the FederalReserve Banks operate a range of applications in a distributed computing environment, supportingbusiness functions such as cash distribution, banking supervision and regulation, research, publicinformation, and human resources. The Reserve Banks also operate check processing systems thatprovide check services to depository institutions and the U.S. government. A nationalcommunications network, called FEDNET, supports the exchange of information among the ReserveBanks, FRAS, and external organizations. The scope of the Federal Reserve’s Year 2000 activitiesincludes all of these processing environments and the supporting telecommunications network.Year 2000 ReadinessIt is crucial that the Federal Reserve provide reliable services to the nation’s bankingsystem and financial markets. The Federal Reserve is giving the Year 2000 its highest priority,commensurate with our goal of maintaining the stability of the nation’s financial markets andpayments systems, preserving public confidence, and supporting reliable government operations.We are taking a comprehensive approach to our preparedness which includesassessments of readiness, remediation, and testing. The Federal Reserve has completed applicationassessments and internal test plans, and we are currently renovating and testing software. We are alsoupdating proven plans and techniques used during other times of operational stress in order to beprepared to address potential century date change difficulties. All Federal Reserve computer programchanges, as well as system and user-acceptance testing, are scheduled to be completed by year-end1998. Further, critical financial services systems that interface with the depository institutions will beYear 2000-ready by mid-1998. This schedule will permit approximately 18 months for customertesting, to which we are dedicating considerable support resources.A large cadre of top personnel in the Federal Reserve System have been assigned tothis task. Our staff is putting in many extra hours to prepare for testing with customers, planning forbusiness continuity in the event of any unanticipated problems with internal systems, and enhancingour ability to respond to possible Year 2000-related operating failures of depository institutions.Assuring compliance internally is requiring review of approximately 90 million lines of computercode. While there are challenges and a great deal of work before us, I can report that we expect to befully prepared for the century date change.The Federal Reserve recognized the potential problem with two-digit date fields morethan five years ago when we began consolidating our mainframe data processing operations. Our newcentralized mission-critical applications, such as Fedwire funds transfer, Fedwire securities transfer,and ACH, were designed from inception with Year 2000 compliance in mind. The mainframeconsolidation effort also necessitated extensive application standardization, which required us tocomplete a comprehensive inventory of our mainframe applications, a necessary first step to effectiveremediation. Like our counterparts in the private sector, the Federal Reserve System still facessubstantial challenges in achieving Year 2000 readiness. These challenges include managing a highlycomplex project involving multiple interfaces with others, ensuring the readiness of vendorcomponents, ensuring the readiness of applications, thorough testing, and establishing contingencyplans. We are also faced with labor market pressures that call for creative measures to retain staffwho are critical to the success of our Year 2000 activities.BIS Review   104/1997
CDC Project ManagementAccording to industry experts, up to one-quarter of an organization’s Year 2000compliance efforts are devoted to project management. Managing preparations for the century datechange is particularly resource-intensive given the number of automated systems to be addressed,systems interrelationships and interdependencies, interfaces with external data sources and customers,and testing requirements. In addition, Year 2000 preparations must address many computerizedenvironmental and facilities management systems such as power, heating and cooling, voicecommunications, elevators, and vaults. Our Year 2000 project is being closely coordinated among theReserve Banks, the Board of Governors, numerous vendors and service providers, approximately13,000 customers, and government agencies.In 1995, a Federal Reserve System-wide project was initiated, referred to as theCentury Date Change (CDC) project, to coordinate the efforts of the Reserve Banks, FRAS, and theBoard of Governors. Our project team is taking a three-part approach to achieve its objectives,focusing on planning, readiness, communication, and monitoring. Our planning began with a carefulinventory of all applications and establishment of schedules and support mechanisms to ensure thatreadiness objectives are met. The readiness process involves performing risk assessments, modifyingautomated systems, and testing both internally and with depository institutions, service providers, andgovernment agencies. We are stressing effective, consistent, and timely communication, both internaland external, to promote awareness and commitment at all levels of our own organization and thefinancial services industry, more generally. Some of our most senior executives are leading theproject, and the Board and senior Bank management are now receiving formal, detailed status reportsat least every 60 days. Any significant compliance issues will be reported to the Board immediately.The Reserve Banks’ internal audit departments and the Board’s oversight staff are also closelymonitoring progress.A significant challenge in meeting our Year 2000 readiness objectives is our relianceon commercial hardware and software products and services. Much of our information processingand communications infrastructure is comprised of hardware and software products from third-partyvendors. Additionally, the Federal Reserve utilizes commercial application software products andservices for certain administrative functions and other operations. As a result, we must coordinatewith numerous vendors and manufacturers to ensure that all of our hardware, software, and servicesare Year 2000-ready. In many cases, compliance will require upgrading, or even replacing,equipment and software. We have a complete inventory of vendor components used in our mainframeand distributed computing environments, and vendor coordination and system change are progressingwell. These preparations also include careful attention to the Year 2000 readiness oftelecommunications providers.TestingAs we continue to assess our systems for Year 2000 readiness, we are well along inpreparing a special central environment for testing our payment system applications. We areestablishing isolated mainframe data processing environments to be used for internal testing of allsystem components as well as for testing with depository institutions and other government agencies.These environments will enable testing for high-risk dates, such as the rollover to the year 2000 andleap year processing. Testing will be conducted through a combination of future-dating our computersystems to verify the readiness of our infrastructure, and testing critical future dates within interfacesto other institutions. Our test environments will be configured to provide flexible and nearlycontinuous access by customers. Network communications components are also being tested andcertified in a special test lab environment at FRAS.BIS Review   104/1997
- 4 -The testing effort for Year 2000 readiness within the Federal Reserve will beextensive and complex. Industry experts estimate that testing for readiness will consume more thanhalf of total Year 2000 project resources. To leverage existing resources and processes, we aremodelling our Year 2000 testing on proven testing methods and processes. Our customers are alreadyfamiliar with these processes and the testing environment. We shared our testing strategy withdepository institutions in October of this year, and we are currently developing a coordinated testschedule. As I noted earlier, the Reserve Banks are targeting June 1998 to commence testing withtheir depository institution customers, which allows an 18-month time period for depositoryinstitutions to test their systems with the Federal Reserve.All of these activities require that we retain highly skilled staff critical to the successof the project. As I mentioned earlier, we have placed the highest priority on our CDC project, and, assuch, have allocated many of the best managers and technical staff in the Federal Reserve System towork on the project. The information technology industry is already experiencing market pressuresdue to the increased demand for technical talent. As the millennium draws closer, the global marketrequirements for qualified personnel will intensify even further. We are responding as necessary tothese market-induced pressures by implementing programs to retain staff members in critical,high-demand positions.Our focus at the Board goes beyond the immediate need to prepare our systems andensure reliable operation of the payments infrastructure. We are also working hard to address thesupervisory issues raised by Year 2000 and are developing contingency plans which I will discusslater.Bank SupervisionAs a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has worked closely with the othersupervisory agencies that are part of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)to alert the industry to our concerns and to monitor Year 2000 preparations of the institutions wesupervise so that we can identify early and address problems that arise. Comptroller of the CurrencyLudwig is testifying today as Chairman of the FFIEC to describe the interagency Year 2000supervisory initiatives of all of the five member agencies (Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, OTS andNCUA), so I will limit my comments on the Federal Reserve’s supervisory efforts.In May of this year, the Federal Reserve and the other regulatory agencies developeda uniform Year 2000 assessment questionnaire to collect information on a national basis. Based onthe responses and other information, we believe the banking industry’s awareness level improvedsubstantially during 1997 and is reflected in the intensified project management, planning, budgeting,and renovation efforts that have been initiated.Generally speaking, the nation’s largest banking organizations have done much toaddress the issues and have devoted significant financial and human resources to preparing for thecentury date change. Many larger banks are already renovating their operating systems and havecommenced testing of their critical applications. Large organizations seem generally capable ofrenovating their critical operating systems by year-end 1998, and will have their testing wellunderway by then.Smaller banks, including the U.S. offices of foreign banks and those dependent on athird party to provide their computer services, are generally aware of the issues and are working onthe problem; however, their progress is less measurable and is being carefully monitored. We aredirecting significant attention to ensure that these banks intensify their efforts to prepare for the Year2000.BIS Review   104/1997
Major third-party service providers and software vendors serving the banking industryare acutely aware of the issue and are working diligently to address it. Most of these suppliersconsider their Year 2000 capability to be a business survival issue, as it is of critical importance totheir ability to remain competitive in an aggressive industry.By mid-year 1998 we will have conducted a thorough Year 2000 preparednessexamination of every bank, U.S. branch and agency of a foreign bank, and service provider that wesupervise. Our examination program includes a review of each organization’s Year 2000 projectmanagement plans in order to evaluate their sufficiency, to ensure the direct involvement of seniormanagement and the board of directors, and to monitor their progress against the plan. As we proceedthrough the examination process, we are identifying any institutions that require intensifiedsupervisory attention and establishing our priorities for subsequent examinations.International AwarenessWith regard to the international aspects of the Year 2000 issue, U.S. offices of foreignbanks pose a unique set of challenges. We are concerned about the possibility that some offices maynot have an adequate appreciation of the magnitude and ramifications of the problem, and may not asyet have committed the resources necessary to address the issues effectively. This is a particularconcern for foreign bank offices that are dependent on their foreign parent bank for informationprocessing systems. In addition, we are increasingly concerned that the foreign branches of U.S.banks may be adversely affected if counterparties in foreign markets are not ready for the Year 2000.Therefore, we are working through the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS)Committee on Banking Supervision, composed of many of the international supervisory agenciesresponsible for the foreign banks that operate in the United States. Through formal and informaldiscussions, the distribution of several interagency statements and advisories, and the FederalReserve’s Year 2000 video (see below) to the BIS supervisors committee, we have sought to elevateforeign bank supervisors’ awareness of the risks posed by the century date change.The G-10 governors issued an advisory in September that included a paper by thebank supervisors committee on the Year 2000 challenge to banks and bank supervisors around theworld to ensure a higher level of awareness and activity on their part. The BIS supervisors committeehas developed a survey sent to about 40 countries to collect better information on the state ofreadiness of banks in those countries and the extent of the efforts of the bank supervisors to addressthe issues locally and internationally. The surveys will be evaluated and the findings distributed earlynext year. Also on the international front, William McDonough, President of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the Institute of InternationalFinance in Hong Kong, emphasized the importance of planning for the century date change on aninternational basis and the significant risk to financial markets posed by the Year 2000.We also participated in the BIS meeting sponsored by the Committee on Paymentsand Settlement Systems and the Group of Computer Experts for G-10 and major non-G-10 centralbanks in September which provided a forum to share views on and approaches to dealing with Year2000 issues, and we have been active in various private sector forums. The majority of foreign centralbanks are confident that payment and settlement applications under their management will be Year2000-ready. Like the Federal Reserve, however, the operation of foreign central bank paymentsystems is dependent on compliant products from hardware and software suppliers and the readinessof telecommunication service providers. The approach of foreign central banks toward raising bankindustry awareness varies widely. Information garnered from this meeting and similar meetingsplanned for the future will assist the BIS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, as well asthe Federal Reserve, in understanding the state of preparedness of payment systems on a global level.BIS Review   104/1997
- 6 -Public AwarenessWe are mindful that extensive communication with the industry and the public iscrucial to the success of century date change efforts. Our public awareness program concentrates oncommunications with the financial services industry related to our testing efforts and our overallconcerns about the industry’s readiness. We continue to advise our bank customers of the FederalReserve’s plans and time frames for making our software Year 2000-ready. We have inaugurated aYear 2000 industry newsletter and have just published our first bulletin addressing specific technicalissues. We would be glad to provide you with copies of our recent newsletter and the bulletin. Wehave also established an Internet Web site to provide depository institutions with informationregarding the Federal Reserve System’s CDC project. This site can be accessed at the followingInternet address: http://www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc.On behalf of the FFIEC, the Federal Reserve has developed a Year 2000 informationdistribution system, including an Internet Web site and a toll free Fax Back service (888-882-0982).The Web site provides easy access to policy statements, guidance to examiners, and paths to otherYear 2000 Web sites available from numerous other sources. The FFIEC Year 2000 Web site can beaccessed at the following Internet address: http://www.ffiec.gov/y2k.The Federal Reserve has also produced a ten-minute video entitled “Year 2000Executive Awareness” intended for viewing by a bank’s board of directors and senior management.The video presents a summary of the Year 2000 five-phase project management plan outlined in theinteragency policy statement. In my introductory remarks on the video, I note that senior bankofficials should be directly involved in managing the Year 2000 project to ensure that it is given theappropriate level of attention and sufficient resources to address the issue on a timely basis. Thevideo can be ordered through the Board’s Web site.Contingency PlanningWhile we will continue our public outreach efforts, our main focus is preparedness.Because smooth and uninterrupted financial flows are obviously of utmost importance, our mainfocus is on our readiness and the avoidance of problems. But we know from experience that uponoccasion, things can go wrong. Given our unique role as the nation’s central bank, the FederalReserve has always stressed contingency planning -- for both systemic risks as well as operationalfailures.In this regard, we regularly conduct exhaustive business resumption tests of our majorpayment systems that include depository institutions. Moreover, as a result of our experience inresponding to problems arising from such diverse events as earthquakes, fires, storms, and poweroutages, as well as liquidity problems in institutions, we expect to be appropriately positioned to dealwith similar problems in the financial sector that might arise as a result of CDC. However, CDCpresents many unique situations. For example, in the software application arena, the normalcontingency of falling back to a prior release of the software is not a viable option. We are, of course,developing specific CDC contingency plans to address various operational scenarios, and ourcontingency planning includes preparation to address unanticipated problems when we bring oursystems into production as Year 2000 begins. Key technical staff will be ready to respond quickly toproblems with our computer and network systems. We are establishing procedures with our primaryvendors to ensure direct communication and appropriate recourse should their products fail at FederalReserve installations during Year 2000 date processing. Our existing business resumption plans willbe updated to address date-related difficulties that may face the financial industry.We already have arrangements in place to assist financial institutions in the event theyare unable to access their own systems. For example, we are able to provide financial institutions withBIS Review   104/1997
access to Federal Reserve computer terminals on a limited basis for the processing of critical fundstransfers. This contingency arrangement has proven highly effective when used from time to time bydepository institutions experiencing major hardware/software outages or that have had theiroperations disrupted due to natural disasters such as the Los Angeles earthquake, hurricane Hugo inthe Carolinas, and hurricane Andrew in south Florida. In these cases we worked closely withfinancial institutions to ensure that adequate supplies of cash were available to the community, andwe arranged for our operations to function virtually without interruptions for 24 hours a day duringthe crisis period. We feel the experience gained from such crises will prove very helpful in the eventof similar problems triggered by the century date change. We are formulating responses foraugmenting certain functions, such as computer help desk services and off-line funds transfers, torespond to short-term needs for these services.Beyond reliance on a sound plan and effective execution of the plan, the FederalReserve provides several different payment services, such as Fedwire, ACH, check, and cash;therefore, the banking industry is not totally dependent upon any single system for executingpayments. Alternatives are available in the event of a disruption in a segment of the electronicpayment system.We recognize that despite their best efforts, some depository institutions mayexperience operating difficulties, either as a result of their own computer problems or those of theircustomers, counterparties, or others. These problems could be manifested in a number of ways andwould not necessarily involve funding shortfalls. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve is alwaysprepared to provide information to depository institutions on the balances in their accounts with usthroughout the day, so that they can identify shortfalls and seek funding in the market. The FederalReserve will be prepared to lend in appropriate circumstances and with adequate collateral todepository institutions when market sources of funding are not reasonably available. The terms andconditions of such lending may depend upon the circumstances giving rise to the liquidity shortfall.Our preparations for possible liquidity difficulties also extend to the foreign bankbranches and agencies in the U.S. that may be adversely affected directly by their own computersystems or through difficulties caused by the linkage and dependence on their parent bank. Suchcircumstances would necessitate coordination with the home country supervisor. Moreover,consistent with current policy, foreign central banks will be expected to provide liquidity support toany of their banking organizations that experience a funding shortfall.Closing RemarksAs I indicated at the outset, the Federal Reserve views its Year 2000 preparations withgreat seriousness. As such, we have placed a high priority on the remediation of date problems in oursystems and the development of action plans that will ensure business continuity for the criticalfinancial systems we operate. While we have made significant progress and are on schedule invalidating our internal systems and preparing for testing with depository institutions and others usingFederal Reserve services, we must work to ensure that our efforts remain on schedule and thatproblems are addressed in a timely fashion. In particular, we will be paying special attention to thetesting needs of depository institutions and the financial industry and are prepared to adjust oursupport for them as required by experience. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet ourobjectives and will remain vigilant throughout the process.As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve will continue to address the industry’spreparedness, monitor progress, and target for special supervisory attention those organizations thatare most in need of assistance. Lastly, we will continue to participate in international forums with theexpectation that these efforts will help foster an international awareness of Year 2000 issues andprovide for the sharing of experiences, ideas, and best practices.BIS Review   104/1997
M. Roth s’interroge sur la relation entre le franc suisse et l’euro   Exposé deM. Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice-président de la Direction générale de la Banque nationale suisse, à laChambre de Commerce Suisse en Italie, à Milan, le 27/10/97.1.  IntroductionLes échéances fixées par le Traité de Maastricht se rapprochent à grands pas. Auprintemps prochain seront désignés les pays qui participeront à la première phase d’intégrationmonétaire. Tout porte à penser, sur la base des indicateurs de convergence observablesactuellement, que l’Union monétaire sera plus large que ce que l’on imaginait il y a douze moisseulement. Dans moins d’un an, donc, il se pourrait que tous les pays entourant la Suisse aientuni leur destin monétaire.Que devons-nous attendre, en Suisse, de ce profond changement d’horizonmonétaire? Quelles en seront les conséquences pour le franc suisse et pour la politique de laBanque nationale suisse? Je suis heureux de pouvoir développer ces thèmes devant vous et dem’exprimer sur sol italien et lombard, une terre si proche, géographiquement etéconomiquement, de la Suisse et si proche aussi de notre coeur.2.  Un changement profond d’environnement2.1.  ....  en EuropeSi, d’un point de vue suisse, l’Union monétaire entraînera un profondbouleversement de l’environnement européen, le choc sera encore plus marqué pour lesmembres de l’Union eux-mêmes. Avec la monnaie unique, les marchés européens franchiront unnouveau et très important pas dans leur intégration. Non seulement les biens, les capitaux et lespersonnes circuleront librement, mais il n’y aura plus qu’une seule monnaie -- l’euro -- donc uneseule politique monétaire et une seule structure des taux d’intérêt.L’apparition d’un taux d’intérêt unique et d’un marché financier intégré marquerafortement l’économie européenne du 21ème siècle. Songez que, il y a cinq ans seulement, l’écartentre les taux à long terme en Allemagne et en Italie était de 660 points de base. Aujourd’hui, àla veille de l’Union, ce différentiel est tombé à 80 points, demain, il aura disparu. Laconvergence des taux d’intérêt à long terme a été le signe le plus concret des progrès versl’Union monétaire. L’exemple le plus frappant est celui de la parfaite coïncidence qui existemaintenant entre les taux français et allemands, la France et l’Allemagne étant les deux payssans lesquels l’Union ne pourra se faire.Une bonne part de la convergence financière observée ces derniers mois tient àl’anticipation de progrès substantiels dans la correction des déficits publics et le respect de lanorme des 3 %. Les récentes estimations effectuées à ce sujet par la Commission de Bruxellesl’ont encore renforcée. Mais il ne faut pas oublier non plus que la décrue spectaculaire des tauxd’inflation dans les pays du sud de l’Europe a grandement aidé à rapprocher les situations desmarchés financiers.Personne ne peut dire à quel niveau se situeraient aujourd’hui les taux d’intérêtdans les différents pays européens s’ils n’étaient pas engagés dans le processus d’intégrationmonétaire. Aujourd’hui déjà, certains d’entre eux bénéficient certainement d’un effetBIS Review   103/1997
- 2 -d’entraînement favorable, d’autres doivent compter peut-être avec une prime nouvelled’insécurité. A mes yeux, l’économie italienne profite déjà et profitera encore plus demain deson ancrage plus ferme dans l’édifice européen. Son dynamisme pourra s’appuyer sur desconditions de financement bien plus favorables que par le passé.La seconde révolution entraînée par la monnaie unique sera celle de l’unificationdes marchés financiers européens. Avec la disparition des monnaies nationales, les banques setrouveront en situation de plus grande concurrence, leurs clients étant en mesure de comparerrapidement la qualité des produits offerts. Les grandes manoeuvres ont déjà commencé dans lesecteur bancaire depuis l’introduction de la liberté des mouvements de capitaux; elles vont sepoursuivre et même s’intensifier. Sous la pression de la monnaie unique, mais aussi sous celle dela globalisation des marchés et des progrès technologiques, l’industrie bancaire européenne vadevoir procéder à un assainissement de ses structures. Notre continent est clairement„over-banked“; peu de chose s’opposera encore aux ajustements structurels lorsque la monnaieunique sera en place.2.2.  .... et en Suisse2.2.1.  Un environnement plus homogèneAvec l’apparition de l’euro, l’Europe passera donc d’un espace à devisesmultiples, à marchés financiers fragmentés, à une zone uniforme aux dimensions de celles desEtats-Unis. Si les Européens gagnent leur pari de mettre en place une monnaie saine, la Suissebénéficiera alors d’un environnement beaucoup plus homogène et stable que par le passé. Nousavons derrière nous l’expérience de plus de vingt ans de franc suisse flottant. Cette expériences’est révélée positive sur de nombreux plans, notamment sur celui de la maîtrise de l’inflation etdes taux d’intérêt bas dont nous jouissons.Mais les changes flottants -- ou plus concrètement l’absence d’ordre monétaireinternational -- comportent aussi des inconvénients pour les petits pays. Le plus grave est celuide l’absence de discipline imposée aux politiques économiques nationales. Avec la monnaieunique et l’application d’une seule politique monétaire, notre environnement gagnera enhomogénéité et des sources de perturbation disparaîtront. Evidemment, cette situation pourraattrister quelques salles de change, mais c’est sans aucun doute un point positif pour l’économiesuisse dans son ensemble. Pour illustrer ce point, permettez-moi de prendre deux exemples:Considérez tout d’abord la relation entre le franc suisse et le mark allemand aucours des quinze dernières années. Si les choses sont mesurées en terme réel, on constate que larelation franc -- DM a oscillé dans une bande de fluctuation relativement étroite, de – 5 %,autour d’un trend d’appréciation du franc de l’ordre de 0,5 % par an.Vue sous cet angle, la relation entre le franc et le mark, deux monnaies quin’étaient liées par aucun accord monétaire et dont les cours n’étaient pas influencés par desinterventions sur les marchés des changes, s’est révélée être extraordinairement stable. Leschanges flottants n’ont donc pas généré les cours irrationnels que certains annonçaient.BIS Review   103/1997
- 3 -Pourquoi cette stabilité relative entre le franc et le mark? Parce qu’il existait entrela Suisse et l’Allemagne une grande convergence des objectifs de politique économique et dessituations conjoncturelles. Considérez maintenant la relation entre le franc suisse et la lireitalienne, pour la même période et sur les mêmes bases. L’image que l’on en retire est fortdifférente. La volatilité est beaucoup plus forte. La lire connaît une longue périoded’appréciation jusqu’en 1992, puis chute dans un retournement dramatique de situation, suivid’une nouvelle normalisation. Vous connaissez les raisons qui se trouvent en arrière-plan de cesfluctuations de la lire. Elles tiennent aux situations souvent difficiles rencontrées par la politiqueéconomique italienne durant ces années.Pour l’économie suisse, de telles variations de cours sont extrêmementdouloureuses. Le degré de compétitivité de son industrie d’exportation se modifiedramatiquement, et ceci dans des périodes relativement brèves. Il s’ensuivit des coûts élevésd’ajustement au plan économique et social.La relation entre le franc et le mark et celle entre le franc et la lire révèlent doncdeux aspects bien différents de notre histoire financière récente. D’un côté, une relative stabilité,de l’autre, une volatilité marquée.C’est dans ce domaine qu’un progrès considérable sera réalisé grâce àl’intégration monétaire européenne. Avec la fixation irrémédiable des parités, puis l’introductionde l’euro, une seule politique monétaire sera appliquée. Le continent aura gagné en homogénéitéfinancière. Si l’euro disposait, demain, des mêmes caractéristiques que le mark allemand, larelation entre le franc suisse et les monnaies européennes sera beaucoup plus stable que par lepassé.Les progrès de la stabilité monétaire profiteront donc non seulement auxEuropéens mais aussi à ceux qui vivent à leur côté.2.2.2.     Une intégration accéléréeAu-delà du changement de l’environnement financier, je m’attends aussi à ce quela monnaie unique accélère l’intégration de fait de l’économie suisse dans l’économieeuropéenne.Aujourd’hui déjà, 80 % de nos importations proviennent de l’Union européenne,qui absorbe à son tour 60 % de nos exportations. De par nos flux commerciaux, notreconjoncture dépend fortement de ce qui se passe chez nos voisins. Les retournementsconjoncturels en Suisse coïncident avec ceux de la France et de l’Allemagne. Demain, avec unepolitique macro-économique unifiée autour de nous, tout porte à croire que les pulsionséconomiques qui s’exerceront sur nous seront de plus en plus synchronisées. Notre rythme deproduction deviendra ainsi encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent.Parallèlement à l’homogénéité économique croissante de l’Union européenne on constatera quela Suisse aura de plus en plus un profil européen. Cette intégration accrue de la Suisse dansl’Europe nous demandera évidemment de vivre étroitement avec la future monnaie européenne.Tous les secteurs de notre économie qui commercent avec l’étranger se trouveront concernés.En premier lieu, le marché européen va devenir effectivement un „grand marché“dans lequel une monnaie -- l’euro -- sera l’instrument de transaction. Nous devons en tenircompte. Les pratiques européennes en matière de contrats, de conditions, de normess’imposeront encore plus à nous que par le passé. Il sera toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le francBIS Review   103/1997
- 4 -comme monnaie de facturation pour nos exportations et les touristes qui passeront la frontièrecomprendront mal qu’ils ne puissent utiliser leurs euros pour effectuer leurs paiements. Laréalité d’une grande zone monétaire à notre porte nous demandera de la souplesse et del’imagination. L’Europe, qui jusqu’ici n’était qu’une mosaïque monétaire, deviendra unensemble monolithique. Ceci ne peut rester sans conséquence sur notre manière de commercer.Un autre aspect important de l’impact de l’euro sur l’économie suisse est celui dela mise en place d’un système de paiement interbancaire en euros. Cette question est délicate carelle n’est pas encore résolue au sein de l’Union européenne elle-même.De quoi s’agit-il?Au sein de l’Union monétaire, les systèmes nationaux de paiements interbancairesseront reliés entre eux. Il sera aussi possible de faire un paiement, valeur du jour même, de Parisà Francfort alors qu’aujourd’hui une telle opération s’exécute en 48 heures. Le système européendes paiements ainsi créé bénéficiera de l’appui de la Banque centrale européenne s’il devait êtreen manque de liquidités. Au niveau européen existera donc ce qui existe déjà au niveau national.La difficulté vient du fait qu’un certain nombre de pays de l’UE ne participeront pas à lapremière phase d’intégration monétaire. Pourront-ils se connecter au système des paiements, et àquelles conditions? Cette question n’est pas encore réglée au sein de l’Union.Dans ces conditions, la récente décision des banques suisses de créer enAllemagne une banque de clearing qui sera chargée d’exécuter leurs paiements mutuels en euroset d’établir un pont avec la Banque centrale européenne me paraît adéquate. Il conviendrad’examiner si la Banque nationale peut jouer un rôle utile dans ce cadre lorsque les conditions decoopération entre les „ins“ et les „outs“ au sein de l’Union européenne auront été arrêtées.3.  Les conséquences pour la Banque nationaleJ’en viens ainsi tout naturellement à la troisième partie de cet exposé: lesconséquences de l’intégration monétaire pour la politique de la Banque nationale. A mon sens,deux types de questions se posent:•les implications à long terme de l’intégration monétaire sur la politique de la BNS,•les influences de court terme.A long terme, l’Union monétaire européenne est pour nous synonymed’imbrication accrue de l’économie suisse dans la scène monétaire européenne. La situation dumarché des changes, qui est déjà aujourd’hui un facteur important dans notre appréciation de lasituation, le sera plus encore. Le fait qu’une grande partie de notre commerce s’effectuera avecla zone euro, le fait aussi que la conjoncture européenne s’imposera toujours plus à la nôtrecréeront forcément une communauté de destin entre le franc et l’euro. Une trop grande volatilitéde l’euro par rapport au franc pourrait devenir extrêmement douloureuse pour l’économie suisse.Nous en sommes conscients.J’ai toutefois confiance, et je base ma confiance sur l’expérience de lacohabitation du franc suisse et du mark au cours des quinze dernières années. Si les objectifs etles situations économiques convergent entre la Suisse et l’Union européenne, tout porte à penserque la volatilité de la relation franc -- euro se maintiendra dans des limites acceptables. CetteBIS Review   103/1997
- 5 -convergence des options fondamentales me paraît acquise puisque la Banque centraleeuropéenne, tout comme la BNS, fera de la stabilité des prix l’objectif prioritaire de sa politique.Au fil des années, le franc et l’euro reposeront donc sur des élémentsfondamentaux fort semblables. Cela aura également pour conséquence de permettre unrapprochement progressif des taux d’intérêt sur ces devises. Aujourd’hui, l’écart entre les tauxsuisses et allemands (représentant les taux sur l’euro) est de plus de 200 points de base. Cet écartme semble biaisé par les incertitudes liées à l’introduction de la monnaie unique. Une foiscelles-ci dissipées, un rapprochement devrait se manifester. Ce ne seront pas seulement les tauxsuisses qui monteront mais aussi les taux sur l’euro qui baisseront. Ce rapprochement n’est paspour demain, il se manifestera lorsque les marchés seront convaincus de la stabilité de lanouvelle monnaie européenne.Dans le court terme, la phase d’introduction de l’euro est marquée par une forteincertitude. Pourtant, tout a été mis en place au niveau institutionnel comme au niveau descritères de convergence pour convaincre les marchés que l’euro sera une monnaie de qualité.Mais tant que les marchés ne pourront pas juger sur pièce, une incertitude existera, incertitudequi pourrait être source d’instabilité des marchés et qui pourrait maintenir les taux d’intérêt à unniveau plus élevé que ce qui serait souhaitable d’un point de vue conjoncturel. Cette volatilitépotentielle de l’euro pourrait créer des difficultés pour le franc suisse, monnaie de refuge.Comment neutraliser de telles perturbations pour l’économie suisse?Il n’y a pas de réponse simple et évidente à cette question.Certains pensent qu’il conviendrait, à l’image de ce qu’avait fait l’Autriche, quela Suisse décide de se lier unilatéralement à l’euro afin d’éliminer le risque de change. Il luisuffirait pour cela de mener une politique de taux d’intérêt appropriée, voire de la renforcer pardes interventions sur le marché des changes. Ce n’est malheureusement pas si facile! Si nousfixions une parité entre le franc et l’euro, nous courrions deux risques majeurs:-soit les marchés nous croiraient et nous provoquerions alors une sortie massive decapitaux qui quitteraient le franc pour se placer dans la zone euro où les rémunérations sontnettement plus élevées;-soit les marchés ne considéreraient pas cette parité comme définitive et spéculeraient à sarévision à la hausse. Notre stratégie stimulerait alors la spéculation au lieu de la calmer.Nous devrons donc vivre avec un franc flottant, mais nous devrons aussi nouscomporter de telle sorte que „la bataille de l’euro n’ait pas lieu“. Dans ce domaine, comme dansbien d’autres, il vaut mieux prévenir une situation que la corriger. Nous nous sommes efforcésces douze derniers mois d’éviter une appréciation du franc suisse face au mark. Nous l’avons faiten menant une politique monétaire accommodante. Cette stratégie a été, je crois, couronnée desuccès. La faiblesse du mark engendrée par les incertitudes l’euro s’est reportée avant tout sur ledollar et la livre sterling, le franc suisse n’a été atteint que marginalement. Nous devonscontinuer sur cette ligne tant que les doutes sur l’euro n’auront pas disparu.Mettons-nous ainsi en danger la stabilité des prix à moyen terme? Je ne le croispas. La croissance de nos agrégats monétaires se ralentit maintenant et le dépassement de lamonnaie centrale -- notre indicateur principal -- par rapport à son trend d’équilibre exagèrevraisemblablement le degré d’expansion de notre action. Enfin, n’oublions pas que dans unBIS Review   103/1997
- 6 -environnement marqué par le risque d’un franc fort, la probabilité d’une résurgence marquée del’inflation est faible.ConclusionLes mois qui nous séparent de la première phase d’interprétation monétairepeuvent encore comporter des surprises. Le calme relatif du marché des changes au cours desdouze derniers mois est rassurant, il indique que les risques de perturbation futurs sont limités.Une fois la zone monétaire définie, la convergence des taux d’intérêt s’imposerad’elle-même et l’Union monétaire deviendra réalité.C’est une nouvelle phase de l’histoire européenne qui commencera alors. Pour laSuisse également, bien qu’elle ne participe pas à l’intégration monétaire. Nous aurons à vivreavec un environnement plus homogène, dont les taux d’intérêt seront peut-être relativementélevés dans une phase initiale, tant que la monnaie unique n’aura fait preuve de ses qualités. Surla durée, en revanche, il apparaîtra toujours plus de manière évidente que le franc suisse et l’eurosont des monnaies comparables, ce qui entraînera une convergence des taux entre la Suisse etl’Europe. Personne ne peut dire, aujourd’hui, à quel rythme ces ajustements s’effectueront.La révolution monétaire, comme toute révolution, comporte de nombreusesincertitudes. Nous en avons déjà vécues, nous en vivrons encore jusqu’à la fin de ce siècle.Cela demandera aux entreprises une grande capacité d’adaptation au nouvelenvironnement. Je ne parle pas seulement des établissements financiers mais aussi de tous ceuxqui commercent avec l’Europe.Mais sur la durée, notre industrie d’exportation pourra compter avec unenvironnement monétaire plus homogène, moins volatil que par le passé. L’Union monétairedemandera aussi beaucoup de pragmatisme dans la conduite de la politique monétaire. Le„pragmatisme“ est souvent attrayant mais ne nous cachons pas qu’il est synonyme de prise dedécision dans des conditions particulièrement difficiles où les points de repère sont moinsévidents que d’habitude.Nous avons bon espoir, Mesdames et Messieurs, que le nouvel ordre monétaireeuropéen ne créera pas de handicap majeur pour la Suisse et le franc suisse. Il s’agit au contraired’une chance pour notre pays, celle de clore le chapitre de vingt-cinq années de désordresmonétaires en Europe, pour déboucher sur une période où les politiques seront plus convergenteset stables. Nous en attendons plus de calme dans les changes, ce qui sera dans l’intérêt dudéveloppement de notre commerce extérieur et aussi dans celui d’un retour à la croissanceéconomique dans notre pays._____________________________BIS Review   103/1997
M. Tietmeyer explique la politique de stabilité dans la future UEM   Exposéde Prof. Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, Président de la Deutsche Bundesbank, au Club de l’Expansion, àParis, le 27/10/97.IA la veille d’entrer dans un nouveau millénaire, nombreux sont ceux qui enEurope attendent avec une certaine fébrilité une “nouvelle ère monétaire” qui doit commencerdébut 1999 déjà avec la monnaie européenne commune. Pendant longtemps, l’UEM n’areprésenté qu’une vision générale. Après avoir été inscrite pour la première fois --officiellement  -- dans le calendrier européen au sommet de La Haye en 1969, puis avoir étéconcrétisée par le plan Werner, l’Union monétaire a disparu de la scène politique durant les deuxdécennies suivantes.Avec la signature du traité de Maastricht en 1992, l’UEM est toutefois devenue unobjectif obligé s’inscrivant dans un plan fixé par contrat et comportant des échéances précises.Or, ce plan doit être réalisé de façon à ce que l’on puisse ériger une construction durablementstable qui ne soit pas un échafaudage fragile donnant lieu à des conflits. En effet, l’UEM nepourra faire progresser l’intégration économique et politique et éviter les conflits que si ellerepose sur des fondations vraiment stables et si les lois économiques sont continuellementobservées. Voilà en quoi consiste notre objectif commun. L’Union monétaire est lecouronnement d’un long processus historique. La France et l’Allemagne en ont été dès le débutles forces motrices. Depuis la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale, ces deux pays se sont fixécomme objectif la coopération économique et politique et ont cherché à établir des bases solidespermettant de garantir la prospérité et la paix en Europe. Ils ont été le moteur de l’intégration,même si par moments leurs motivations et positions étaient différentes. Mais c’est surtout dansle domaine de la politique monétaire que s’est produit, durant la dernière décennie, unrapprochement fondamental.IIEn conformité avec la mission qui leur est assignée, les banques centrales de nosdeux pays ont, aujourd’hui, comme objectif prioritaire la stabilité monétaire. Actuellement, letaux d’augmentation annuel des prix à la consommation en France et en Allemagne oscille entreun peu moins de 1½% et 2%. Les taux directeurs, de 3,3% dans les deux pays, sont pour lemoment au même niveau. Sur le compartiment du long terme, c’est-à-dire sur les marchés descapitaux où se négocient par exemple les emprunts d’Etat à long terme, les taux sont égalementplus ou moins identiques. Mais ce qui est encore bien plus important dans ce contexte, c’est qu’ily ait conformité entre les positions des deux pays sur le plan de la politique monétaire.Ainsi, les responsables de la Banque de France et de la Bundesbank sontconvaincues que la stabilité des prix est la condition essentielle pour assurer la croissance, unbon niveau d’emploi et la stabilité monétaire externe. Mais elles savent aussi que la stabilité desprix ne suffit pas, elle seule, à la longue. Elle doit s’accompagner également d’une réorientationdes politiques financière, fiscale, sociale et salariale, qui doit stimuler le dynamisme économiqueet, partant, encourager l’emploi. La stratégie à long terme de nos deux instituts, qui divergefondamentalement de la politique de réglage en finesse du processus économique pratiquéeautrefois dans les pays anglo-saxons, devrait également être adoptée, à mon avis, par la futurebanque centrale européenne. Le fait que les politiques menées par la Banque de France et laDeutsche Bundesbank soient semblables, en théorie comme en pratique, n’est pas dû au seulBIS Review   102/1997
- 2 -hasard. C’est l’aboutissement d’un processus de rapprochement lancé depuis assez longtempsdéjà.Le facteur décisif a certainement été le fait qu’au printemps 1983 la France a optépour une politique économique et financière axée sur la stabilité et qu’elle n’a pas dévié de cettevoie durant les années suivantes, malgré toutes les difficultés qu’elle a rencontrées. Le résultatest que les taux de change se sont stabilisés dans une mesure croissante au sein du SME, toutcomme le niveau des prix en Europe. Avec le traité de Maastricht qui prévoit que les banquescentrales nationales n’ont aucune instruction à recevoir des gouvernements, la France etl’Allemagne ont délibérément recherché aussi la convergence au niveau institutionnel et, àprésent, elles ont largement réalisé cet objectif.IIIEtant donné que les dangers menaçant la stabilité se sont accrus et que la politiquemonétaire exerce, depuis une assez longue période, des effets de plus en plus expansifs même siles taux directeurs n’ont pas bougé, la Bundesbank a légèrement resserré les rênes monétairesdébut octobre. Plusieurs autres banques centrales européennes -- dont la Banque de France -- ontelles aussi relevé quelque peu leurs taux. Dans nos deux pays, la loi stipule aujourd’hui que lesdécisions de politique monétaire sont du seul ressort des banques centrales et ne peuvent enaucun cas être influencées par le gouvernement et la politique.Cette règle est également conforme au traité de Maastricht. Et l’indépendance dela future banque centrale européenne a encore une fois été réaffirmée lors de la réunioninformelle de l’Ecofin à Mondorf-les-Bains et à l’occasion du Conseil économique et financierfranco-allemand de Münster. Cela implique également que la responsabilité sera désormaisassumée, au niveau européen, seulement à travers le rapport présenté par le président de laBanque centrale européenne et non pas par les divers membres du future Système européen debanques centrales.Le relèvement de 0,3 point de pourcentage du troisième taux directeur vise àcontrecarrer d’éventuelles pressions inflationnistes. Ainsi, la politique monétaire contribue à ceque les taux à long terme du marché -- qui sont d’une grande importance pour l’économie enAllemagne tout comme en France -- continuent à se situer à un niveau aussi bas que possible.Si, depuis, les taux d’intérêt à long terme ont subi une légère hausse dans nosdeux pays, c’est parce que l’évolution observée sur les marchés américains a gagné notrecontinent. De nombreux analystes des milieux bancaires sont d’avis que le relèvement des tauxdirecteurs favorise aussi la convergence des taux à court terme en Europe. J’estime qu’il fautfaire preuve, là, de circonspection. Il est certain que les taux à court terme des pays de l’Unionse rapprocheront progressivement les uns des autres à partir du printemps 1998, une fois que lestaux de conversion bilatéraux auront été fixés. J’espère qu’ils le feront au niveau le plus baspossible et non pas au niveau qui constituera la moyenne des taux directeurs pratiqués jusque-làen Europe. Mais ce niveau dépendra bien entendu de la situation économique du moment ainsique du choix des pays qui participeront à l’UEM, qui restent pour l’heure deux inconnues.IVActuellement, presque tous les pays de l’Union européenne sont confrontés à unchômage record. Mais ce n’est pas en pratiquant une politique monétaire laxiste qu’ils pourrontrésoudre ce problème puisque le sous-emploi a essentiellement une origine structurelle, tout auBIS Review   102/1997
- 3 -moins en Allemagne. Jean-Claude Trichet a indiqué récemment que les banques centrales nepouvaient -- et ne devaient -- fournir à l’économie que le meilleur environnement monétairepossible. Mais elles ne peuvent pas “prescrire” croissance et emploi. C’est aux partenairessociaux de faire le nécessaire -- par le biais d’une plus grande flexibilité et mobilité -- pour qu’iln’y ait pas de suppressions de postes et que de nouveaux emplois soient créés. Il est certain quela politique économique, financière et sociale de l’Etat doit également renforcer la dynamique del’économie en créant des conditions propices et en contribuant, surtout dans nos deux pays, àréduire le chômage.Récemment, le FMI a exhorté, à juste titre, les Européens à tout faire pour quel’euro puisse bien démarrer. Il a rappelé l’urgence de réformer les marchés du travail et lessystèmes d’assurance sociale et de retraite. Car, de lui-même, l’euro ne pourra pas résoudre cesproblèmes. La politique de stabilité n’est pas au demeurant une invention allemande. Il faudrait àce propos éliminer les préjugés qui existent encore dans nos deux pays. En France aussi, il s’esttoujours trouvé quelqu’un pour réclamer une économie stable non inflationniste. Rappelez-vousce qu’a écrit Jacques Rueff à la fin des années cinquante sur l’âge de l’inflation.Pour Rueff, les revendications excessives adressées à l’Etat mettent en péril lastabilité des prix et le système économique et social libéral. L’histoire est riche en exemplesmontrant comment, à la longue, des comptes publics non ordonnés peuvent ébranler la monnaieet l’économie. En France surtout, l’assainissement des budgets publics a toujours revêtu unegrande importance. C’est ainsi que jusqu’au début des années quatre-vingt, le déficit budgétairea été bien inférieur à la limite de 3% fixée par le traité de Maastricht. L’endettement est restéjusqu’à maintenant au-dessous du seuil de 60 % imposé par les critères de convergence.La limite de 3% n’a d’ailleurs pas été inscrite dans le traité de Maastricht à lademande des Allemands, mais sur l’initiative des Français. Il faudra aussi impérativement queles finances publiques soient durablement stables lorsque l’Union monétaire européenne (et sapolitique monétaire unique) aura été mise en place. En effet, des dettes publiques élevées -- enparticulier lorsqu’elles sont financées à court terme -- peuvent sérieusement compliquer la miseen application de la politique monétaire unique et être source de conflits.VAvant de conclure, j’aimerais encore parler brièvement du développement del’intégration politique dans l’Union, domaine qui à vrai dire n’entre pas tout à fait dans lesattributions d’un banquier central. Me référant à une phrase de Voltaire qui a dit que “les parolessont aux pensées ce que l’or est aux diamants; il est nécessaire pour les mettre en œuvre, mais ilen faut peu”, je résumerai ma pensée. La question de l’intégration monétaire à trouvé uneréponse dans le traité de Maastricht. Cependant, en dépit des efforts déployés avant et pendant leconseil d’Amsterdam, aucune solution n’a été trouvée pour une grande partie des interrogationssuscitées par la question de la finalité politique de l’intégration européenne.Je suppose que pour certains points très importants comme l’organisationinstitutionnelle ou la définition exacte des compétences nationales ou supranationales dans lesdifferénts domaines politiques, ces questions ne pourront pas être résolues dans l’immédiat. Maistoutes les nations concernées doivent être conscientes de ce que l’Union monétaire sera, dès ledépart, une communauté monétaire solidaire qui ne pourra plus être résiliée. Non seulement iln’y aura plus de taux directeurs différents dans l’Union monétaire, mais une importante partie dela politique cessera de relever de la compétance des pays pour être exercée à l’échelonsupranational, et ce de façon définitive. Il ne sera en effet plus possible de sortir de l’UnionBIS Review   102/1997
- 4 -monétaire. C’est pourquoi il faut qu’il y ait aussi une volonté politique de s’engager durablementen formant une union politique. Cela vaut en particulier à la veille de l’élargissement de l’Unioneuropéenne.Valéry Giscard d’Estaing et Helmut Schmidt ont rappelé, à juste titre, dans unarticle commun publié il y a quelques jours, que “le succès de la monnaie unique dépend, àterme, de l’accomplissement de nouveaux pas sur le plan politique. Sans cela, les changementsde gouvernement intervenant dans l’un ou l’autre des pays membres risqueraient de remettre encause la solidité de l’Union. (...) On aurait pu s’attendre à ce que le traité d’Amsterdamcontienne des décisions prises par les pays participants, mais ceux-ci n’étaient pas capables des’accorder sur des réformes. (...) L’Union monétaire est un projet fédéral qui doit êtreaccompagné et soutenu par d’autres mesures. Elle n’a jamais été faite pour rester un îlot isolédans l’œil d’un cyclone d’intérêts nationaux.” Pour toutes ces raisons, il est nécessaire que lacoopération franco-allemande devienne encore plus intense, afin que le dynamisme del’intégration ne faiblisse pas après l’entrée dans l’Union monétaire. L’unification européenne estet reste un objectif porteur.BIS Review   102/1997
Mr. Bäckström discusses the current situation for monetary policy in SwedenRemarks by the Governor of the Swedish Central Bank, Mr. Urban Bäckström, to the StandingCommittee on Finance, in Stockholm, on 23/10/97.I should like to thank the Committee for the invitation to discuss the Swedisheconomy and the current situation for monetary policy. In my opening remarks today I shall begin bybriefly summarising the recent years’ economic tendencies and then consider the present constructionof monetary policy. A look into the future will conclude. What I have to say is based on the latestinflation report and events since it was published.From a dual situation to broader expansionSweden’s economy is now entering the fifth year of expansion since the profoundcrisis at the beginning of the decade. Since GDP turned upwards in the summer of 1993, annualgrowth has averaged over 2.5 per cent. Annual inflation in this period has averaged only about 2 percent. This is a marked contrast with the 1970s and 1980s, when annual growth averagedapproximately 2 per cent and inflation about 8 per cent. In one respect, however, the situation to dateis still dismal, namely as regards the labour market and employment. If an economy is growing wellbut employment remains weak and unemployment high, there is a strong probability that the labourmarket is affected by structural problems.Although growth in recent years has been satisfactory, the generation of a broaderupswing in the economy has proved difficult. Initially, about three-quarters of the GDP’s increasecame from manufacturing, which represents only about 20 per cent of Sweden’s economy. Thismeant that bottlenecks occurred fairly quickly, accompanied by various types of inflationaryimpulses. Our relatively small industrial sector cannot be expected to sustain a growth rate that ishigher than the total economy achieved in the 1970s and 1980s.The problem with the dual economy -- a flourishing export-related industrial sectorand a rather weak recovery in sectors with a more domestic orientation -- stemmed in part from lowconfidence in economic policy’s determination and ability to keep inflation low in the longer run.This in turn was a consequence of Sweden’s poor record in this respect, coupled with seriousproblems with government finances. Long bond rates fluctuated widely and in 1994 and 1995 theyactually climbed to the levels of the years of high inflation. The exchange rate continued along itsdepreciating path from the 1970s and 1980s. For the Riksbank, the lack of confidence in the directionof economic policy left little room for manoeuvre. Although the instrumental rate was lowered duringthe spring of 1994, virtually all the market rates and particularly those for longer maturities rose.Sweden was approaching a point where economic policy had to demonstrate that the focus onstability was a firm commitment.The monetary tightening and, perhaps to an even greater extent, the fiscalconsolidation gradually generated increased confidence in Sweden’s readiness and ability to achievelow long-term inflation. Against this background, during 1996 it was possible to cut the repo rate toits lowest level since the early 1960s. Low inflation and decreased inflation expectations alsocontributed to falling bond rates, accompanied by an appreciation of the krona from the earlier lows.Since December 1996 the repo rate has been unchanged at 4.10 per cent.All in all, conditions were gradually created for a broader economic upswing. Withthe time lag that generally applies in economic policy, during 1997 we have observed a mood swingamong households, leading for instance to increased private consumption, while export growth hasBIS Review   101/1997
- 2 -been maintained. The Swedish economy is entering a phase of high activity with a combination ofstrong domestic demand and strong export growth.The impact of the Riksbank’s current monetary stance will take about two years tomaterialise in full. We therefore have to assess the outlook for inflation as far ahead as in 1999. Suchan analysis was presented some weeks ago in the inflation report. I shall be returning shortly to thatreport and subsequent developments but first I want to discuss the approach in principle to theconduct of monetary policy over the complete economic cycle.Monetary policy in a cyclical perspectiveA matter that savers and investors are currently discussing is not whether but whenthe Riksbank will raise the instrumental rate. An expected increase in the repo rate is also indicatedby the structure of market rates. The general impression among financial agents seems to be that arepo rate increase is probable some time in the coming winter.The timing of a change in the monetary stance is determined by the Riksbank’sassessment of inflation. The simple rule of thumb for the Riksbank can be formulated as follows: ifthe assessment of inflation, given an unchanged instrumental rate, points to a rate of inflation one totwo years ahead that is in line with the target, then the monetary stance is well balanced. If theassessment indicates a risk of inflation rising above (falling below) the target, then the monetarystance is too expansive (contractive) and the repo rate should therefore be raised (lowered).The time has not yet come for an increase in the repo rate, but when it does, our actionwill hopefully be seen as a natural ingredient of a monetary policy for price stability. Our ambition isto take predictable and timely measures so that sizeable interest rate movements can be avoided.Still, it is hardly surprising that the direction of monetary policy is being discussed. Atpresent Swedish monetary policy’s overall impact can be described as expansionary at a time whenactivity is becoming stronger.The short-term real interest rate is between 2 and 2.5 per cent, depending on theexact maturity and how inflation expectations are measured. How a neutral monetary stance translatesinto the short real rate is difficult to determine precisely but it can be said that the current rate iscomparatively low, with an impact on total demand that should be stimulatory. In addition, the levelof the real exchange rate is weak in relation to a reasonable long-term equilibrium. This means thatits effect is stimulatory, too. The combined effect of the short interest rate and the exchange rate istherefore tending to support the economic upswing.All else equal, an expansionary monetary stance leads to a successive acceleration ofdemand. In time, this may generate a growth rate that exceeds the economy’s long-term potential.The ability of the economy to cope with a high demand trend is not unlimited. As unutilisedresources are activated and the output gap closes, bottlenecks of various kinds arise in the labourmarket or in real capital. It is in such a situation that inflation may accelerate.In order to avoid the occurrence of shortages and accelerating inflation, the monetarystance must not remain too expansive for too long in an upward phase. Instead, a timelyadjustment -- bearing in mind the lag associated with monetary policy -- must be made to a moreneutral position before the output gap closes. This promotes a continued growth of demand at a ratethe economy can absorb -- for instance with the help of new investment, improved efficiency andlabour supply -- without generating inflationary bottlenecks. The purpose of such a monetaryadjustment is not to break the expansionary trend but to achieve growth that is more sustainable. InBIS Review   101/1997
- 3 -other words, a shift from an expansionary stance to one that is more neutral is designed to bring theeconomy onto the growth path that matches its structure -- not to bring growth to a halt. Neithershould this be described as a contractive turn; it is rather a move that yields a less expansionarystance.In the public debate the Riksbank’s monetary policy is sometimes described as thoughrepo rate adjustments were a form of “punishment” or “reward”, aimed at measures that have beentaken either by the political system or by labour market organisations in connection with wagenegotiations. My point here has been that interest rate adjustments are a natural feature of monetarypolicy’s path over the economic cycle. Of course this does not mean that the construction ofmonetary policy is not affected by fiscal expansion or contraction, or by low or high wagesettlements. What I want to make clear is that adjustments to the instrumental rate in the course of theeconomic cycle are a natural phenomenon and their purpose is to create conditions for sustainedgrowth and low inflation.If a central bank waits too long before shifting from an expansive to a more neutralmonetary stance, problems with bottlenecks are liable to become more widespread and the economymay become overheated. Besides entailing rising inflation, this causes firms and households to startaccustoming themselves to a high level of inflation. Monetary policy may then be forced to adopt acontractive stance in order to bring inflation back to the target rate. So if the central bank waits toolong, the interest rate increases may be all the larger. In the meantime, moreover, economicimbalances and tensions may become so great that they lead to economic setbacks. We are familiarwith such a course of events from the 1970s and 1980s, and perhaps not least from the early 1990s.Against this background, in situations when capacity is coming under pressure, it isclearly better for a central bank to act at an early stage.Future inflationThe assessment in the inflation report, published just over a month ago, is that growthin the Swedish economy will be about 2 per cent in 1997 and around 3 per cent in 1998. In 1999, therate is expected to go on accelerating to just over 3 per cent. This assessment envisages that, in anexpanding world market, export growth remains relatively high. This is accompanied by anaccelerating increase in private consumption, while public consumption at least stops falling.Economic growth in Sweden in 1998 and 1999 would then most probably exceed thepotential rate, which is estimated to be just over 2 per cent in annual terms. The broad rise in all themajor demand components will therefore gradually exert pressure on the available resources. Thissuccessive increase in resource utilisation is already evident in some indicators. A growingproportion of firms are reporting, for example, that output is being restricted by productive factorsrather than by demand.The gap between total demand and total resources for production is an important butelusive indicator of inflationary pressure. The Riksbank considers that the output gap, which is anattempt to measure the degree of unutilised resources in the total economy, is 2 per cent of GDP.With the GDP forecast from the inflation report, this means that the gap will narrow by degrees andclose some time during 1999, in any event towards the end of that year.In the light of the assessments of resource utilisation and other factors, in the inflationreport the Riksbank forecast that the annual increase in the CPI will be around 1 per cent in 1997 andaround 2 per cent in both 1998 and 1999, with some upward tendency in the latter two years. This isour main scenario.BIS Review   101/1997
- 4 -Like most other forecasts, however, inflation assessments are subject to uncertainty.Our forecasts as a foundation for monetary policy therefore do not consist of single point estimates offuture inflation. In practice we construct a number of alternative outcomes and assess theirprobabilities. Normally there is one main scenario and two alternatives.Economic activity could be stronger than we have envisaged, so that inflation issomewhat higher; but it could also be weaker, giving lower inflation. Most of the evidence suggests,however, that since the inflation report, an outcome which is appreciably weaker than the mainscenario has become less likely.The forecasts for all the demand components are naturally uncertain. It is, however,particularly worth discussing the forecast for private consumption, since this component representsabout one-half of total demand. Some factors suggest that the growth of private consumption couldbecome stronger than most observers count on today.The background here is that for a number years the growth of household disposableincome has been held back by fiscal consolidation. After 1998, however, the direct restrictive fiscalimpact on household finances is expected to diminish. But in spite of the weak or negative incometrend, private consumption has already been rising for a number of years, albeit rather slowly. Thereason is that, besides the effect of income on private consumption, spending by households, as wellas their view of the future, is influenced by the increase in wealth.Households have recently become appreciably more optimistic about the future.House prices and share prices have been rising markedly for some years. The realised and latentcapital gains of households in 1997 add up to the equivalent of about 25 per cent of their income, afigure that is as high as in the late 1980s. It would be surprising if such an increase in wealth did notcontribute sooner or later to higher consumer demand. The key question, however, is how rapidlyprivate consumption will grow.The above applies provided the increase in asset prices is maintained. Since shareprices turned upwards in the autumn of 1992, the increase on the Stockholm Exchange has been oneof the largest since the early 1920s, which is as far back as the statistics go. The overall valuation ofcorporate profits is also historically high. The present level of share prices calls for a further rapidincrease in profits for several years to come. Minor changes in this picture of the future could affectcurrent share prices.Another element of uncertainty concerns the economy’s supply side. We cannot besure of just how much the economy can produce without an increase in inflation. Moreover, it is notonly the total reserve of resources that may affect inflation. The rate at which resource utilisationrises may also be important. A rapid activation of the unutilised resources could generate strongerinflationary impulses even if surplus capacity still exists at total level.CPI inflation has moved up sharply during 1997. The 12-month change was downaround 0 per cent for a couple of months last spring but after that it moved up fairly quickly to 1.9 percent for September. In September alone the CPI rose 0.9 per cent, which was more than mostobservers had expected. The figure also aroused some uncertainty among savers and investors. Thequestion is whether the increase in inflation represents a new and unforeseen tendency.The main features of this development are not unexpected. One factor behind therising CPI is increased indirect taxes, for instance for tobacco, and higher administered prices.Another explanation is that the impact on the CPI from the falling interest rates in 1996-1997 isdiminishing. All in all, this means that the CPI is closing in on underlying inflation as measured invarious ways by the Riksbank.BIS Review   101/1997
- 5 -Still, the CPI outcome for September is somewhat higher than the Riksbank hadcounted on. Figures for a single month admittedly do not warrant definite conclusions but it iscertainly important to pay heightened attention to price movements in the coming months.Normally it is underlying or trend inflation that is primarily of interest for monetarypolicy. This holds unless transitory price effects influence inflation expectations. In a setting whereinflation expectations are firmly anchored to the inflation target, monetary policy has some room formanoeuvre. But if expected inflation starts to rise, we must be on the alert, particularly in that thecurrent monetary stance is stimulatory. The importance of expected inflation for price and wageformation was evident not least in connection with the 1995 round of wage negotiations. At that time,expectations of future inflation seem to have been a bit above 4 per cent, which probably contributedto the excessively high level of the ensuing wage agreements. Now that the Swedish economy is onthe threshold of very important wage negotiations, there must be no doubt that the Riksbank is trulyserious about the inflation target.Future wage formation is yet another risk factor that the Riksbank has to consider.There are some encouraging signs that wage formation is moving in the right direction, even thoughthe parties have gone in for a certain amount of bidding. This tends to be a process that conveys avarying degree of realism. It is important to bear in mind that wage formation is not just a matter ofthe level of wage agreements. The outcome for wages is also conditioned by the wage drift thatmirrors labour supply and demand. The less efficiently the labour market works, the soonerbottlenecks arise that generate increased wage drift. Tendencies to labour shortages in certain sectorsare already discernible, despite the high unemployment.Conclusion:  monetary stance well balanced; changes in the spectrum of risksA monetary policy that aims for sustained price stability is not at odds with goodeconomic growth. This presupposes that the supply side functions so well that growth does not giverise to inflationary impulses. But if the structure of the economy is such that only moderate growth isfeasible, demand and accordingly the monetary stance must be adjusted accordingly. The alternativeis demand growth that exceeds what the economy is capable of producing without inflationarybottlenecks. Accelerating inflation is a threat to sustainable growth and may even result in seriouseconomic setbacks, as history has taught us.As economic activity becomes stronger and monetary policy adjusts its sights on thefuture picture, the Riksbank’s monetary stance will have to gradually move away from its currentexpansionary position. The timing of such a move has to be assessed in the light of new informationand today one cannot say when it will happen.Our present assessment is that the monetary stance is well balanced. There has beensome shift in the spectrum of risks but our inflation forecast for the coming years is unchanged.BIS Review   101/1997
Mr. Issing considers the future role of the euro in the international financialsystem   Speech delivered by a member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank,Professor Otmar Issing, at the conference of the Royal Institute of Interntional Affairs in Londonon 24/10/97.1. Momentous changes in the financial marketsThe introduction of the euro is increasingly affecting expectations in the financialmarkets worldwide. We are little more than a year away from the start of the third stage of EMUon January 1, 1999, as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty; and in about six months’ time theparticipating countries are to be selected. From the viewpoint of financial market players, a multitude of questions arise:What will be the role of the euro as an international currency? How strong (or how weak) willthe future European currency be? And what changes will there be in the business environment ofmarket players owing to the advent of the euro?Expecting reliable answers to these questions implies greatly overrating aneconomist’s capabilities. Trustworthy forecasts at times of a change of regime -- and themonetary union in Europe undoubtedly constitutes such a change - are, to say the least,extremely problematic, if not utterly impossible. Even so, the economist finds it appealing “togaze into the future” and to ponder over possible patterns of development in terms of “informedguesses”.A conceivable starting point for such “brain-teasers” is the status quo: the role ofthe euro, as measured by the present position of potential EMU participants in the internationalfinancial markets and relative to the dollar.But the analysis must not stop at that point. EMU will trigger changes in thefinancial markets which have to be taken into account in any dynamic survey. The singlecurrency will eliminate market fragmentation in Europe in the important area of currencies, andwill enhance the intensity of competition in the financial sector. That will have a major impacton the position of the euro.But it is not only economic considerations that are of significance here, since theinternational role of a currency also depends crucially on political factors. It was not leastpolitical (i.e., foreign policy) considerations that prompted a fresh start in the direction of EMUin the late 1980s. The very aim of monetary union was to “reduce dependency on the dollar” and“strengthen (the member states’) scope for monetary policy action”.1 A tripolar currency worldis evidently what many people had (and some still have) in mind. The aim is for the euro to“compete as an international vehicular currency with the dollar and the yen on an equalfooting”.2 The single currency will, it is claimed, finally give Europe its due weight in theconcert of world powers. A rather cautious approach to the “key currency role”, such as was stillwidespread in Germany in the seventies, is not discernible in Europe at the political level.                                                  1Genscher, H.D., (translated from) Memorandum für die Schaffung eines europäischen Währungsraumes undeiner Europäischen Zentralbank: reprinted in Deutsche Bundesbank, Auszüge aus Presseartikeln (Press excerpts),No. 15, March 1, 1988, p. 6.2EC Commission, One market, one money.

- 2 -2. The euro as an international currencyClaiming a prominent role for a currency, even before it comes into being, is onepart -- the easier one. The other, unquestionably much more difficult part, is realising that claim.What role the euro will actually play in the concert of major currencies will be decided, first andforemost, in the international financial markets. It is only when the economic preconditions areright that investors will be prepared to hold assets denominated in euros, only then thatcross-border transactions outside the EU will be settled in euros on a significant scale, and onlythen that the euro will become an international currency.Expectations of the euro playing a major role in the international monetary systemare chiefly predicated on the stability of the new currency. The euro must earn its position in theportfolios of public and private investors in competition with other currencies. That will hingecrucially on expected exchange rate movements relative to its major competitors -- above all, theUS dollar. The key variables for exchange rate expectations are -- in the longerterm -- anticipated inflation differentials, since a tendency for exchange rate movements tomatch purchasing power parity prevails in the long run. 3Those wishing to establish the euro as an international currency would thereforedo well to make the maintenance of price stability their primary goal. The external trend of theeuro is inseparably linked to the prerequisite of internal stability -- stability begins at home.On the (often tacit) assumption that the anti-inflationary pre-conditions are met,widespread speculation is thriving at present about which market shares the euro might captureand whether there may be major portfolio shifts in the course of adjustment to the newconditions. Far-reaching conclusions are being drawn, in turn, as to the potential exchange ratetrend of the euro. The starting point of these notions is the various functions performed by aninternational currency and the quantitative dimensions involved in the international financialmarkets.Specifically, this concerns the role of the euro- as a reserve currency- as an investment currency- as a transaction currency, and- as an anchor currency for exchange rate arrangements2.1 The euro as a reserve currencyWorld foreign currency reserves amounted to around US$1,500 billion at the endof June 1997. The lion’s share was accounted for by US dollar reserves (65%), followed at aconsiderable distance by reserves denominated in Deutsche Mark (13%). Smaller shares werealso accounted for by the yen and the currencies of other EU member states.                                                  3See Deutsche Bundesbank, “Overall determinants of the trends in the real external value of the Deutsche Mark”,August 1995, pp. 17 - 37.BIS Review   100/1997
Upon entry into the third stage of monetary union (by 2002 at the latest), allassets that are still denominated in currencies participating in EMU will be converted into euroassets; that will apply, in principle, to central banks’ asset holdings, too. From the point of viewof the participating countries, “foreign currency reserves” denominated in these “in” currencieswill become domestic euro assets.Considered in isolation, the euro’s potential as a reserve currency will thereforeinitially be lower than the market share of all “in” currencies taken together. Will third countriesbe able to fill that “gap”? For the “immediate neighbours” of the euro area, a major role will beplayed by the precise nature of the currency arrangement (i.e., EMS II). The more closely theexchange rate is pegged to the euro, and the greater the recourse to intervention is, the higher thedemand for euro reserves is likely to be in the countries in question -- at least during the periodup to their entry into EMU. From the present perspective, it is not possible to make a definiteprediction as to whether other countries outside the monetary union will, in future, hold part oftheir reserves in euros. Portfolio-theoretical considerations argue, in principle, for adiversification of foreign exchange reserves. That would open up opportunities for the euro.Ultimately, the investment decisions of central banks will hinge chiefly on their assessment ofthe future European currency’s stability.The question of how the roles of the US dollar or the yen as reserve currencieswill be affected by the euro’s entry into the international financial markets is not all that easy toanswer, either. On the one hand, shifts out of Deutsche Mark assets into US dollar assets arepossible; that will apply -- as some anticipate -- to the introductory period in particular, when theeuro’s reputation still has to be established. On the other hand, the overall global demand forcurrency reserves might fall, because some of the EMS-related need for currency reserves willno longer exist, and because the degree of openness of those economies which are linked to oneanother by monetary integration will decline in purely arithmetical terms.4 That is because partof what was previously foreign trade -- already characterised separately as “intra-trade” in thesingle market -- will then durably become internal trade from the monetary point of view.It is possible to conjecture that, for the group of participating countries, the“need” for currency reserves to cushion unforeseen events will not be as great as it is under thestatus quo of different currencies; this fall in demand is likely to affect the US dollar, inparticular, primarily because the dollar has repeatedly played a major role in interventions in theEMS, too. It is not possible to state a priori what the ultimate outcome of these various effectswill be on balance. In that respect, whether the other reserve currencies will benefit from theintroduction of the euro, or not, must remain an open question. This applies all the more since asteeply rising share of global currency reserves is meanwhile being held by Asian central banks,which (at least up to now) have shown a preference for the US dollar.2.2 The euro as an investment currencyAlthough the reserve holdings of monetary authorities are certainly a majorfactor, trends in the financial markets are determined to a much greater extent by the decisionsof private investors. Currency reserves are accompanied by international bank loans which are                                                  4At present, over 60 % of EU foreign trade is accounted for by cross-border transactions with other memberstates. Assuming that all member states will (sooner or later) enter the third stage of EMU, the share of foreigntrade in GDP on an average of all EU countries will fall to around 10 %, and will thus correspond roughly to theratio for the United States. But even if all the member states do not adopt the single currency immediately, theinternal orientation in the euro economic area will be greater than it is at present in the EU.BIS Review   100/1997
- 4 -(in net terms) more than three times as large and by international debt securities amounting totwice their size;5 on top of these, there are direct cross-border lending operations betweennon-banks that are not included in the above-mentioned international financial market data.The US dollar is the dominant investment currency, too. The Deutsche Markaccounts for less than 15% of international financial assets. It is precisely in the internationalfinancial markets that a large number of other potential participating currencies in EMU, takentogether, have a significant share, too. (The share of the pound sterling, for example, is about5%.)The structural changes in the international financial markets over the past15 years, however, have been to the detriment of the US dollar, and have afforded the Europeancurrencies a rising market share. Theoretical considerations seem to suggest that this processmight actually be reinforced by monetary union.A crucial factor determining the widespread international use of a currency is thedegree of sophistication and openness of its financial markets. Financial markets that guarantee awide range of products, a broad maturity range and a high level of market liquidity exercise amagnetic attraction internationally. If cross-border capital transactions are free of restrictions,funds are attracted, on the one hand, and, on the other, the currency concerned becomesavailable for borrowing by non-residents, too. In short, the international use of that currency isfostered.In that respect, the introduction of the euro is likely to have a further positiveimpact on capital markets within EMU. The currency-related segmentation of the markets willbe eliminated, there will be a broader range of investment opportunities available, and theliquidity of the individual products will increase. Already, in the run-up to EMU, member statesare gearing themselves to intensifying competition, and are “updating” both their financialmarkets and their financial instruments.In terms of its total volume, the euro bond market will probably be the secondlargest after the US dollar bond market; if all the EU member states ultimately participate inEMU, bonds denominated in euros will amount to around 60% of the volume of the US market.Even if the third stage starts with only a limited number of participants, the increase in thefinancial market’s efficiency will be important in fostering the euro. This effect would bereinforced if the larger euro currency area succeeded in dissociating itself more than previouslyfrom developments in the United States.On the other hand, the euro will face greater problems than the US dollarinasmuch as the euro will not have the backing of a centralised European government, and as ittherefore still remains to be seen which securities will be able to perform a benchmark functionin the euro bond market.2.3 The euro as a transaction currencyAn international payment medium’s function as a transaction currency plays arole in transactions in goods and in foreign exchange trading.                                                  5See BIS, International Banking and Financial Market Developments, Basle, August 1997.BIS Review   100/1997
There are no up-to-date and reliable figures on the worldwide invoicing shares ofindividual currencies in foreign trade. Estimates (for 1992) assume that about one-half ofaggregate global exports are settled in US dollars, just over 15% in Deutsche Mark and around6% each in French francs and pounds sterling.6 These figures should be put into perspective,however, since they are influenced to a great extent by individual countries’ respective shares inworld trade; in general, every country has a comparatively large invoicing share of its ownexports in domestic currency. If the figures are adjusted to allow for that effect, only the USdollar and the Deutsche Mark can be classed as “international invoicing currencies”.Since, as explained above, a considerable part of what is now foreign trade willbecome internal trade in the euro area under EMU, the euro is likely, if anything, to account forsmaller market shares in “genuine foreign trade” in the first few years than the participatingcurrencies do at present. In the longer term, however, it is quite possible to foresee the euroassuming growing importance, since it will be backed by a large economic area -- particularly asit is precisely in the case of invoicing currencies that market size is obviously a major factor.7The economic advantages of invoicing in one’s own currency should not beoverrated, however. Given short-term exchange rate fluctuations, it may be an advantage tosettle in one’s own currency than in a foreign one. In the medium to long term, however, anyexchange risks are to be borne by the counterparties, irrespective of the invoicing currency, inline with market conditions.Transaction currencies are often referred to in connection with their use ininternational foreign exchange trading. In order to facilitate bilateral transactions betweendifferent currencies in narrow markets, “vehicle currencies” have developed, through whichforeign exchange market transactions are settled.After the US dollar, the Deutsche Mark is the most frequently employed currencyin the foreign exchange markets -- in particular, as a vehicle in transactions between Europeancurrencies.8 How important the euro is in foreign exchange trading will hinge crucially on itsmarket shares as an investment and reserve currency, as well as on its role as a potential anchorcurrency in Europe. If it does establish itself in those areas, it certainly has the potential to go onto become a major transaction currency in foreign exchange trading, albeit without being able todeprive the US dollar of significant market shares in the short term. Under those conditions, it islikewise predestined to become a vehicle currency for transactions in other European currencies.It is also clear, however, that a major segment of European foreign exchange trading will ceaseto exist as a result of the merging of currencies.2.4 The euro as an anchor currencyThe last function of the euro which is to be scrutinised -- and to which I havealready referred -- is that of being an anchor in the international monetary system. There is nolonger merely speculation to rely on in that area, as some of the broad outlines are already takingshape. An exchange rate arrangement with the euro at its centre is envisaged for those EUcountries which are not going to participate in the single currency from the outset. Above and                                                  6See ECU Institute (ed.), International Currency Competition and the Future Role of the Single EuropeanCurrency, London 1995, p. 70.7The EU is larger than the United States in terms of its population, and more or less on an equal footing in termsof GDP and foreign trade.8See BIS, Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Market Activity, Basle, May 1996.BIS Review   100/1997
- 6 -beyond that, orientation to the euro is to be expected, above all, in the countries of central andeastern Europe, either in the form of unilateral pegging exclusively to the euro or by gearingexchange rate policy to a basket of currencies in which the euro has a heavy weighting. The eurowill be highly attractive to potential candidates for accession to monetary union, in particular.3. Some reflections on the external value of the EuroThe introduction of the euro represents a radical change in the internationalmonetary system. It will call into question positions in world financial markets which havedeveloped over a period of decades; the conditions which obtain at present in global financialmarkets can serve, at most, as rough guidelines for the moment of conversion to euros. Whichdirection future trends will take -- and this is an important implication of the precedingsection -- cannot be readily predicted in every case, as different forces are at work.That applies to monetary reserves and to private financial assets alike. And it alsoapplies to the external value of the euro. The analysis has shown that, especially in the initialstages, the euro will have to build up a reputation of being a trustworthy currency. This isoccasionally interpreted as implying that a weakness of the euro is to be expected initially.Diametrically opposed to this hypothesis are the forecasts which prophesy a considerableappreciation potential for the euro on account of expected massive shifts in internationalportfolios owing to the increasing efficiency of the financial markets in Europe and possiblediversification advantages, with interest rates being only weakly correlated with othercurrencies.Both these arguments seem to me to fall short of the truth. Certainly, a highdegree of uncertainty can be expected in the early stages of EMU. However, the ECB, given itsindependence and single-minded commitment to the objective of price stability, deserves ameasure of confidence in advance. That applies all the more as -- viewed from the presentvantage point -- the starting conditions for EMU, with low inflation rates in virtually allpotential participating countries, are decidedly favourable. Risks to the euro are to be seen,rather, in the general political environment, where in some quarters -- with an eye on the highlevel of unemployment in Europe -- talk of a weak euro is widespread. However, (verbal)exchange rate manipulations will serve neither to solve the serious employment problems nor toestablish the euro as an internationally respected currency.The high level of unemployment in Europe is largely structural and can only beovercome by energetic, far-reaching reforms -- for which responsibility lies more or less entirelyat the national level. The hope that EMU will make a lasting contribution to reducingunemployment should rest on the expectation of low interest rates and a high level ofinvestment. These, in turn, depend crucially on investors’ confidence in the long-term stabilityof the euro. The misuse of the currency for employment (or trade) policy purposes would notonly jeopardise price stability in the euro area, it might also provoke retaliation from othercountries. This, after all, would be of no use to anybody.Some commentators are inferring from an expected substitution of euro fordollar-denominated assets that the single currency will have a substantial appreciation potential.Such thinking is predicated on a portfolio structure that is in line with other macroeconomicbenchmarks, such as the ratio to GDP or the share of the euro area in world trade. In my view,these rather mechanistic approaches take too little account of the supply side in the financialmarkets. The broader and deeper European financial market will not only attract investmentcapital, it will also result in enhanced cross-border borrowing in euros, which, in itself, tends toBIS Review   100/1997
dampen rates.9 Which effect will prevail in the end, and what the consequent time profile will befor the movement of the euro rate relative to other currencies, can hardly be forecast reliably apriori. In the long run -- as already stated -- relative inflation differentials will largely determinethe nominal euro rate.4. Concluding remarksThe statute of the ECB -- above all, central bank independence and the prioritygiven to the objective of price stability -- establishes crucial prerequisites for a stable euro at theinstitutional level. It is now up to those responsible to fill this monetary constitution with life, toimplement its targets in the real world. Especially in the difficult start-up phase, it will beimportant to appoint the right people -- people who are regarded in the public eye, andparticularly in the financial markets, as guarantors of a stability-oriented monetary policy. Anylack of confidence in the management of the ECB would be reflected in corresponding riskpremiums on interest rates, and hence might cost the participants in EMU dear.Thus we come full circle: the political objective of establishing the euro as aninternational currency will be attained only if the market accepts the newcomer. Investors, fortheir part, will prefer a strong euro, which presupposes stability within EMU. That is a challengeto the ECB, but the other economic policy players, especially the fiscal policy makers, mustlikewise do their bit to (continue to) keep inflationary risks as low as possible.                                                  9For a critical discussion see also McCauley, P.N., White, W.R., “The Euro and European Financial Markets”,BIS Working Papers No. 41, Basle, May 1997, pp. 18 - 20.BIS Review   100/1997
Mr. Reddy considers the future of India's debt market 1997   Inaugural address givenby the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. Y.V. Reddy, at the Invest India Conferencesin Mumbai, on 9/10/97.The Future of India’s Debt Market 1997I am happy to be amongst you this morning. This conference gives me an opportunity tosharpen my thoughts, and gain insights from the deliberations. The subject has gained importance overthe years, and in particular, more recently after the Monetary and Credit Policy of April 1997. In fact,there is a sudden spurt in conferences on this subject, as for example, the SBICAP Debt Market Seminarheld last month. Also, there was pretty elaborate coverage of this subject during the last two days in thediscussions of Bank Economists’ Conference on the Second Phase of Reforms in the Financial Sector.The objective of this national conference, as I understand, is to assess recent changes andexamine issues which merit urgent consideration in order to achieve an efficient and vibrant debt market.In the seminar organised by the SBICAP, Governor, Dr. C. Rangarajan had flagged some specific issueswhich would help in formulating an agenda for further reforms in the debt markets. I would urge thisaudience to give serious consideration to these issues.2.Let me, therefore, begin by highlighting the reforms initiated by the Reserve Bank ofIndia and the Government of India in the debt market in the recent period. These include:•setting up of a comprehensive system of primary dealers,•adoption of DVP system for settlement of government securities transactions,•abolition of tax deduction at source on government securities,•hedge their foreign currency risk in the forward market,•introduction of Treasury bills of varying maturities, and•placing investments of banks in preference shares/debentures/bonds of corporates outside the five per cent limit.In a bid to increase transparency in operations, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has beendisseminating information on its transactions in gilts and publishing the calendar of auctions in respect ofTreasury bills and repos.Soon, the RBI proposes to publish data on banks’ investments in corporate and PSU debtin the Weekly Statistical Supplement to the RBI Bulletin.To foster inter-institutional coordination, a Technical Advisory Committee forgovernment securities and a Standing Committee on Money Market have been set up. Major issuesconfronting the debt and money markets are discussed in these committees. These committees have beenfound to be useful to all participants.3.As I observe, the discussions in this conference are structured around five sessions, viz.,primary market, secondary market, legal issues, risk management and future directions. For the sake ofconvenience, I will follow broadly the same structure and pose issues for further deliberations.Primary Market4. Lack of market clearing yields at primary auctions of government debt is often beingcited as a significant factor slowing the development of the secondary market. The arguments run asfollows:First, it hampers efforts to broaden the investor base.BIS Review   99/1997
- 2 -Second, at times when cut-off yields in the primary market are lower than prevailingsecondary market yields, it curbs secondary trading.Third, to the extent the cut-off yields are lower than secondary market yields, itconstrains inventory build-up by primary dealers. Finally, to the extent volumes of pick-up in primaryauctions are reduced due to interest rate considerations, it reduces the availability of floating stock in thesecondary market.5. What are the factors that inhibit market clearing mechanisms? There are four importantissues, viz., notifying auction size, type of auction, element of non-competitive bids and frequency ofauctions of Treasury bills. Another issue of concern relates to large private placements of corporate debt.6. At present, there is no pre-announced notified amount in 364-day and 14-day auctions.This procedure enables the RBI to determine either the cut-off price or the amounts to be accepted in aflexible manner. Notifying amounts in auctions will bring more transparency in the auction procedure byremoving the uncertainty about volumes in auctions. In this context, it needs to be emphasised that thecapacity of primary dealers to absorb auction supply as an underwriter is limited. Currently, primarydealers underwrite to the extent of 50 per cent of the amounts in auctions with notified amounts. In thisscenario, there is a danger of devolvement on the RBI, if there is a pre-announced notified amount. Theextent of the devolvement on the RBI can be minimised by increasing the underwriting amounts toprimary dealers. The RBI could also change the notified amounts between each auction, depending onprevailing market conditions, in order to minimise the devolvement risk on itself.7. Presently, there are six primary dealers. The institution of primary dealers has partlycontributed to a significant increase in secondary market transactions in government securities.Authorising primary dealers is an on-going process. All eligible applicants will be considered by the RBIfor primary dealership. While on this subject, an issue that needs to be considered relates to thewhen-issued market. At present, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 prohibits short-sellingof securities. Two options could be considered. First, whether to give exclusive access of primaryauctions to primary dealers and simultaneously permit them to engage in short sales of governmentsecurities. Second, whether to continue with the existing system of access to primary auctions and allowall participants to engage in short sales of government securities. The timing and sequencing of thisreform -- whether to introduce it now or wait until the number of primary dealers has enlarged -- areaspects that need to be carefully considered. I would urge upon the participants to discuss the pros andcons of these options and the international practices in this regard.8. There is some debate over the type of auction that is most suitable for selling Treasurybills and dated government securities in India. There are advocates for both the discriminatory anduniform price auctions. But, international practices seem to be in favour of discriminatory price auctions.In a switch-over from one auction system to another, a number of considerations arise such as easy entry,cost to issuer, return to investor, role of primary dealers, incentive to gather information, etc. This isanother area fit for a careful assessment.9. As you are aware, non-competitive bids are allowed in 91- and 14-day Treasury billsauctions. A major issue relates to the treatment of non-competitive bids. Country practices show thatnon-competitive bidders are made allocations within the notified amount. However, the non-competitivebidders in other countries consist essentially of small, retail and inexperienced investors. Since themaximum bid is restricted to a small value, the competitive bid prices do not get distorted. There is aview in the Indian market that non-competitive bidders should also be allowed as competitive bidders.However, in our country, since State Governments are major non-competitive bidders, their volatilesurplus funds position could make their participation in Treasury bills auctions very uncertain. Thus,there could be large swings in terms of volumes in auctions. Another view is to make allocation fornon-competitive bidders outside the notified amount.BIS Review   99/1997
- 3 -10. There is a view in the market that the high frequency of auctions recently brought aboutby introducing 14-day Treasury bills auctions (along with frequent repos) tends to hinder secondarymarket activities by reducing investor participation in the secondary market in favour of waiting for a fewdays for primary issues. Also, the staggered settlement dates for Treasury bills falling on different days inthe week make secondary market trading across different maturities of Treasury bills less efficient.Perhaps, it would be useful for this conference to discuss the need, if any, to reduce auction frequencyand adjust settlement dates of different maturity Treasury bills to fall on the same day in the week so asto improve fungibility and thereby price discovery and market efficiency.11. Finally, an increasingly important concern relates to the issuance of PSU bonds andcorporate debentures through private placements. Although, the private placement market plays a crucialrole in enabling corporates to raise resources, certain vital issues need to be considered for a well-directedand efficient functioning of the market. At present, there is no transparency in this market and virtuallylittle information. In developed markets, the regulatory authorities indicate the framework within whichthe private placement has to function, like number of persons per placement, arrangements with onlyqualified investors and strict regulations to access certain qualified investors. We have to assess theadequacy of the regulatory framework to protect the interest of investors from risks associated withsubscriptions in the private placement market. With a proper regulatory framework and moretransparency, the private placement market can develop further as an integral and important constituentof the primary market for the raising of resources by corporates; hence, the need to deliberate on thestatus of regulatory framework.Secondary Market12. As part of the reform process, a number of technical impediments that prevented moreactive secondary market trading in government securities and Treasury bills have been progressivelyremoved. Let me briefly recall these:•abolition of the system of TDS,•issuance of benchmark securities, and•operationalising the DVP system at all centres.The RBI is encouraging banks to open SGL II accounts for constituents, therebyenlarging the coverage of book-entry holding of government securities. Recently, the National StockExchange has been authorised to open a SGL II account and a current account with the RBI. A decisionhas been taken to extend a similar facility to the Stock Holding Corporation of India. These steps wouldfurther streamline transfer and settlement procedures in the government securities market.13. In respect of PSU bonds and corporate debentures, which are held mostly in scrip form,a proper settlement system is yet to be put in place. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)was expected to dematerialise a sizeable stock of non-government debt. But, at present, NSDL has beenable to dematerialise only those securities which are exempt from stamp duty. Suitable amendments tothe stamp duty regime appear, therefore, necessary to avoid transaction costs and enable active use of thefacility. An appropriate solution is needed, since an efficient transfer and settlement system in the PSUbonds and corporate debt segments could usher in the resumption of repos in these instruments. Once itis assured that risk-free and transparent payment and settlement systems are put in place through adepository like NSDL in dematerialised form, it should be possible to permit such repos.14. Another issue that has been raised frequently relates to giving permission to financialinstitutions to borrow through repos in eligible securities. While there is a risk of generatingasset-liability mismatches among non-bank participants, the conference could discuss the operationalfeasibility of allowing such participants into the repo market under suitable safeguards.15. The Reserve Bank of India is considering a range of options to increase the interest ofindividual investors in government securities. There is an inherent potential for households to diversifyBIS Review   99/1997
- 4 -their investment portfolio encompassing government securities. It would be useful to quickly reviewmarketing and distribution strategies adopted in other countries for reaching government securities tohouseholds. Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden adopt direct sales of government securities tothe retail sector through special registration facilities. Hungary, Switzerland, the UK and the USA retailthrough non-competitive bidding arrangements. France and Norway use the primary dealers network.Germany, Spain and Turkey have retailing arrangements through the banking system, while Denmark,Ireland, and Poland retail government securities through the stock exchanges. Italy uses both the bankingand stock exchange network. The conference could do well to consider strategic options for thisimportant phase of market development.Legal Issues16. The most important segment of the debt market being government securities, let me startwith the relevant law on this. The law relating to government securities and their management by theReserve Bank of India is the Public Debt Act, 1944. The present act dates to pre-independence days,when marketable debt comprised almost the entire borrowing by the Government. This is no longervalid, with almost over Rs.300,000 crore worth of other liabilities of the Government comprising, interalia, instruments like NSS, Indira Vikas Patra, etc., falling outside the purview of this Act. Further,provisions of the Public Debt Act relate to issue, servicing and repayment of government securities anddo not provide regulation of trading/marketing of government securities. For instance, under the presentAct, the Reserve Bank has no substantive powers to design and introduce an instrument of transfer suitedto the computer environment. There are other constraints, such as those which preclude the RBI fromissuing government securities in the form of promissory notes in the name of trusts, non-availability ofnomination facility in respect of government securities, barring a minor from holding governmentsecurities, etc. A new Act on government securities is proposed to take care of these issues. Anysuggestions on this reform are welcome.17. It seems appropriate to consider extending the use of depositories established under theDepositories Act to government securities. The Depositories Act came into force in 1996 providing for alegal framework for holding of equities, bonds, debentures, units and other market instruments indematerialised form in a depository. Such deposits come under the regulatory framework of SEBI. Sincethe RBI manages the public debt of central and state governments, Public Debt Offices (PDOs) of theRBI are in effect depositories under the Public Debt Act. Thus, giving permission to depositories to holdgovernment securities in dematerialised form would make the provisions of the Depositories Actapplicable to the Reserve Bank as an issuer, bringing into focus the respective regulatory roles of theReserve Bank and SEBI in government securities. One of the suggestions to resolve this is by way ofincorporating a provision in the proposed Government Securities Act, excluding the provisions ofDepositories Act being applicable to government securities.18. It would certainly be useful to survey the international experience in this regard. InCanada, Germany and Switzerland, there is central government prudential regulation of depositoryinstitutions and provincial or state supervision of securities trading. The Bank of England used to provideregulation of depository institutions, although after the passage of the Bank of England Bill,responsibility for banking supervision will be transferred to the new and strengthened Securities andInvestments Board (SIB). The SIB will also take direct responsibility for the regulatory regime coveredby the Financial Services Act. In Australia and New Zealand, the central banks provide prudentialregulation of depository institutions, but there is no specific regulation of the government securitiesmarket. The Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Danish Supervisory Authority for Financial Affairsprovide centralised regulation of government securities. As you will have observed, internationalexperience is varied.19. Another legal issue which is often alluded to relates to forward contracts. This forumwould do well to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the repeal of the government notificationissued in l969 prohibiting forward contracts in securities.BIS Review   99/1997
- 5 -Risk Management20. Investors in debt instruments face three major components of risk, viz., credit risk,interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. In case of government bonds, credit risk is zero. The foreigncurrency risk is relevant only to non-resident investors like FIIs who are investing in debt instruments.Recently, the 100 per cent debt funds dedicated to the debt market were allowed to take forward cover toenable them to hedge their exchange rate risk. Investments in all debt instruments are exposed to interestrate risk. This risk can be better hedged if a futures market in interest rate exists, or if short-selling insecurities is allowed. However, the futures market will be meaningful only in an environment of totallyderegulated interest rates and the existence of a term money market which itself is dependent on acredible yield curve. Thus, while the eventual introduction of interest rate futures and permission forshort-selling is inevitable, the real issue is one of the timing of these reforms, so that it does not entailany systemic risks.Future Direction21. Consistent with the spirit of financial sector reforms, the RBI is in the process of thedivestment of part of its shareholding of DFHI and STCI, so that the RBI does not have the majority ofshareholding. As you are aware, the RBI has taken the initiative to promote STCI and DFHI. The RBI isnow a minority shareholder in DFHI and, after the second round of disinvestment in l995, its share isonly l0.5 per cent. It has also been decided to disinvest shares of STCI so that after the first phase ofdisinvestment, the RBI’s shareholding will be less than fifty per cent.22. Second, non-banking financial companies are now required to maintain a higher level ofliquid assets in the form of government securities and government-guaranteed bonds. This will increasethe demand for government paper in the market. This will be in addition to the demand generated due tothe opening up of provident funds to debt market instruments, emergence of MMMFs and investmentsby l00 per cent FII debt funds.23. Third, I would like to flag the vital issue of the role of market participants. Standardpractices have to be evolved by the market with regard to the manner of quotes, the conclusion of deals,the manner of pricing and accounting standards. A code of best practices also has to be evolved for repotransactions in eligible securities. In the context of moving towards a liberalised and market-orientedenvironment in the financial sector, it would be desirable if such standard practices were evolved andaccepted in a common forum of a self-regulatory body. At present, I understand that there are moves tocreate such self-regulatory body/bodies among the PDs and among banks and financial institutionscovering transactions in money and fixed-income securities markets. This is a welcome trend and theRBI would be willing to nurture such developments in the market.24. Finally, the time has come to accord priority for establishing electronic links betweenthe Deposit Accounts Department and Public Accounts Department/Public Debt Office of the RBI forachieving synchronisation of funds and securities transfers. We should also begin planning electroniclinks between banks, primary dealers and others who have access to the system, so as to pave the way fora more information-efficient and transparent securities market. These plans can succeed only with theconcerted efforts of all -- the Government, the Reserve Bank of India and the market participants. I wouldappreciate your detailed suggestions.BIS Review   99/1997
Mr. Greenspan's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of the USCongress   Testimony by the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. AlanGreenspan, before the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress in Washington DC on 29/10/97.We meet against the background of considerable turbulence in world financial markets,and I shall address the bulk of my remarks to those circumstances.We need to assess these developments against the backdrop of a continuing impressiveperformance of the American economy in recent months. Growth appears to have remained robust andinflation low, and even falling, despite an ever tightening labor market. Our economy has enjoyed alengthy period of good economic growth, linked, not coincidentally, to damped inflation. The FederalReserve is dedicated to contributing as best it can to prolonging this performance, and we will bewatching economic and financial market developments closely and evaluating their implications.Even after the sharp rebound around the world in the past twenty-four hours, declines instock markets in the United States and elsewhere have left investors less wealthy than they were a weekago and businesses facing higher equity cost of capital. Yet, provided the decline in financial marketsdoes not cumulate, it is quite conceivable that a few years hence we will look back at this episode, as wenow look back at the 1987 crash, as a salutary event in terms of its implications for the macroeconomy.The 1987 crash occurred at a time when the American economy was operating with asignificant degree of inflationary excess that the fall in market values arguably neutralized. Today’seconomy, as I have been suggesting of late, has been drawing down unused labor resources at anunsustainable pace, spurred, in part, by a substantial wealth effect on demand. The market’s netretrenchment of recent days will tend to damp that impetus, a development that should help to prolongour six-and-a-half-year business expansion.As I have testified previously, much of the stock price gain since early 1995 seems tohave reflected upward revisions of long-term earnings expectations, which were implying a continuingindefinite rise in profit margins from already high levels. I suspect we are experiencing some scalingback of the projected gains in foreign affiliate earnings, and investors probably also are revisitingexpectations of domestic earnings growth. Still, the foundation for good business performance remainssolid. Indeed, data on our national economy in recent months are beginning to support the notion thatproductivity growth, the basis for increases in earnings, is beginning to pick up.I also suspect earnings expectations and equity prices in the United States were primed toadjust. The currency crises in Southeast Asia and the declines in equity prices there and elsewhere dohave some direct effects on U.S. corporate earnings, but not enough to explain the recent behavior of ourfinancial markets. If it was not developments in Southeast Asia, something else would have been theproximate cause for a re-evaluation.While productivity growth does appear to have picked up in the last six months, as I havepointed out in the past, it likely is overly optimistic to assume that the dimension of any acceleration inproductivity will be great enough and persistent enough to close, by itself, the gap between an excess oflong-term demand for labor and its supply. It will take some time to judge the extent of a lastingimprovement.Regrettably, over the last year the argument for the so-called new paradigm has slowlyshifted from the not unreasonable notion that productivity is in the process of accelerating, to a less thancredible view, often implied rather than stated, that we need no longer be concerned about the risk thatinflation can rise again. The Federal Reserve cannot afford to take such a complacent view of our priceprospects. There is much that is encouraging in the recent performance of the American economy, but, asI have often mentioned before, fundamental change comes slowly and we need to evaluate theprospective balance of supply and demand for various productive resources in deciding policy.BIS Review   98/1997
- 2 -Recent developments in equity markets have highlighted growing interactions amongnational financial markets. The underlying technology-based structure of the international financialsystem has enabled us to improve materially the efficiency of the flows of capital and payment systems.That improvement, however, has also enhanced the ability of the financial system to transmit problems inone part of the globe to another quite rapidly. The recent turmoil is a case in point. I believe there ismuch to be learned from the recent experience in Asia that can be applied to better the workings of theinternational financial system and its support of international trade that has done so much to enhanceliving standards worldwide.While each of the Asian economies differs in many important respects, the sources oftheir spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have recentlyemerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.Following the early post-World War II period, policies generally fostering low levels ofinflation and openness of their economies coupled with high savings and investment rates contributed toa sustained period of rapid growth, in some cases starting in 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s mosteconomies in the region were expanding vigorously. Foreign net capital inflows grew, but until recentyears were relatively modest. The World Bank estimates that net inflows of long-term debt, foreign directinvestment, and equity purchases to the Asia Pacific region were only about $25 billion in 1990, butexploded to more than $110 billion by 1996.A major impetus behind this rapid expansion was the global stock market boom of the1990s. As that boom progressed, investors in many industrial countries found themselves more heavilyconcentrated in the recently higher valued securities of companies in the developed world, whose rates ofreturn, in many instances, had fallen to levels perceived as uncompetitive with the earnings potential inemerging economies, especially in Asia. The resultant diversification induced a sharp increase in capitalflows into those economies. To a large extent, they came from investors in the United States and WesternEurope. A substantial amount came from Japan, as well, owing more to a search for higher yields than torising stock prices and capital gains in that country. The rising yen through mid-1995 also encouraged asubstantial increase in direct investment inflows from Japan. In retrospect, it is clear that moreinvestment monies flowed into these economies than could be profitably employed at modest risk.I suspect that it was inevitable in those conditions of low inflation, rapid growth andample liquidity that much investment moved into the real estate sector, with an emphasis by both thepublic and private sectors on conspicuous construction projects. This is an experience, of course, notunknown in the United States on occasion. These real estate assets, in turn, ended up as collateral for asignificant proportion of the assets of domestic financial systems. In many instances, those financialsystems were less than robust, beset with problems of lax lending standards, weak supervisory regimes,and inadequate capital.Moreover, in most cases, the currencies of these economies were closely tied to the U.S.dollar, and the dollar’s substantial recovery since mid-1995, especially relative to the yen, made theirexports less competitive. In addition, in some cases, the glut of semiconductors in 1996 suppressedexport growth, exerting further pressures on highly leveraged businesses.However, overall GDP growth rates generally edged off only slightly, and imports,fostered by rising real exchange rates, continued to expand, contributing to what became unsustainablecurrent account deficits in a number of these economies. Moreover, with exchange rates seeming to besolidly tied to the dollar, and with dollar and yen interest rates lower than domestic currency rates, asignificant part of the enlarged capital inflows, into these economies, in particular short-term flows, wasdenominated by the ultimate borrowers in foreign currencies. This put additional pressure on companiesto earn foreign exchange through exports.BIS Review   98/1997
- 3 -The pressures on fixed exchange rate regimes mounted as foreign investors slowed thepace of new capital inflows, and domestic businesses sought increasingly to convert domestic currenciesinto foreign currencies, or, equivalently, slowed the conversion of export earnings into domesticcurrencies. The shifts in perceived future investment risks led to sharp declines in stock markets acrossAsia, often on top of earlier declines or lackluster performances.To date, the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has beenmodest, but it can be expected not to be negligible. U.S. exports to Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,and Malaysia (the four countries initially affected) were about four percent of total U.S. exports in 1996.However, an additional 12 percent went to Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (economies thathave been affected more recently). Thus, depending on the extent of the inevitable slowdown in growthin this area of the world, the growth of our exports will tend to be muted. Our direct foreign investmentin, and foreign affiliate earnings reported from, the economies in this region as a whole have been asmaller share of the respective totals than their share of our exports. The share is, nonetheless, largeenough to expect some drop-off in those earnings in the period ahead. In addition, there may be indirecteffects on the U.S. real economy from countries such as Japan that compete even more extensively withthe economies in the Asian region.Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagioneffect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive, rightly or wrongly, similarvulnerabilities. Even economies, such as Hong Kong, with formidable stocks of international reserves,balanced external accounts and relatively robust financial systems, have experienced severe pressures inrecent days. One can debate whether the recent turbulence in Latin American asset values reflectcontagion effects from Asia, the influence of developments in U.S. financial markets, or home-growncauses. Whatever the answer, and the answer may be all of the above, this phenomenon illustrates theinterdependencies in today’s world economy and financial system.Perhaps it was inevitable that the impressive and rapid growth experienced by theeconomies in the Asian region would run into a temporary slowdown or pause. But there is no reasonthat above-average growth in countries that are still in a position to gain from catching up with theprevailing technology cannot persist for a very long time. Nevertheless, rapidly developing, free-marketeconomies periodically can be expected to run into difficulties because investment mistakes areinevitable in any dynamic economy. Private capital flows may temporarily turn adverse. In thesecircumstances, companies should be allowed to default, private investors should take their losses, andgovernment policies should be directed toward laying the macroeconomic and structural foundations forrenewed expansion; new growth opportunities must be allowed to emerge. Similarly, in providing anyinternational financial assistance, we need to be mindful of the desirability of minimizing the impressionthat international authorities stand ready to guarantee the liabilities of failed domestic businesses. To dootherwise could lead to distorted investments and could ultimately unbalance the world financial system.The recent experience in Asia underscores the importance of financially sound domesticbanking and other associated financial institutions. While the current turmoil has significant interactionwith the international financial system, the recent crises would arguably have been better contained iflong-maturity property loans had not accentuated the usual mismatch between maturities of assets andliabilities of domestic financial systems that were far from robust to begin with. Our unlamented savingsand loan crises come to mind.These are trying days for economic policymakers in Asia. They must fend off domesticpressures that seek disengagement from the world trading and financial system. The authorities in thesecountries are working hard, in some cases with substantial assistance from the IMF, and the World Bank,and the Asian Development Bank, to stabilize their financial systems and economies.The financial disturbances that have afflicted a number of currencies in Asia do not atthis point, as I indicated earlier, threaten prosperity in this country, but we need to work closely withtheir leaders and the international financial community to assure that their situations stabilize. It is in theBIS Review   98/1997

Ms. Phillips reassesses the stock market crash of 1987 in the context of subsequentmarket and regulatory changes   Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, at Bentley College, Waltham, Massachusetts on 15/10/97.Black Monday: 10 Years LaterThank you for inviting me to participate in this program sponsored by the FinancialWomen’s Association. We are drawing very close to the tenth anniversary of the stock market crash. It isuseful to reassess that event in the context of subsequent market and regulatory changes. The crash wasone of those (fortunately rare) events that serve as a watershed for our discussion of markets and publicpolicies. Considerations of regulatory approaches now almost always use the crash as a reference point.Panels such as this one provide a vehicle for evaluating not only what we have learned from the event butalso the various actions taken following the crash. But it is also appropriate to look forward. Changes infinancial markets and the risk management capability of firms have been significant in the interveningyears. The crash may no longer be as useful a reference point for judging events and evaluating publicpolicy responses.I suppose everyone can remember what they were doing on the day of the crash. I had thegood fortune to have left the CFTC prior to the crash. Thus, I got to watch events unfold from thecornfields of Iowa. Later, however, I participated in several post-crash evaluations. Even now, at theFederal Reserve Board, the crash periodically comes up in supervisory discussions about bank risk.(Regrettably, the crash is now part of a pantheon of financial market “problems” that include Barings,Daiwa, Metallgesellschaft, Orange County, and Sumitomo.)The Legacy of the CrashThe legacy of the crash is both tangible and intangible. An impressive number of studiesof the crash were done. The more noteworthy ones take up about three linear feet on my bookshelf, avery tangible reminder. More seriously, the studies done after the crash were wide-ranging and examinedevents through the eyes of many different market participants, many different regulators, and a host ofacademicians. They identified weaknesses in trading and clearing systems that have resulted in tangiblechanges to those systems. These changes have been very positive. Exchanges have greatly expanded theirability to handle surges in volume, for example. The capitalization of market makers has been bolsteredas well.Numerous changes also have been implemented in clearing systems. Doubts thatemerged about the soundness of clearing systems were some of the most frightening aspects of the crash.The changes to clearing systems have received far less attention than those to trading systems, but theirlong-term consequences likely are more profound. Such critical parts of the “plumbing” as theagreements between the futures clearing houses and the settlement banks have been clarified and put on amuch sounder footing. In addition, many clearing organizations have established back-up liquidityfacilities that will enable them to make payments to clearing members in a timely fashion even if aclearing member has defaulted.In both our evaluation of trading mechanisms and our evaluation of clearing systems, animportant intangible outcome of the crash is that we now have a better understanding of the way thesesystems work. During ordinary trading days, market participants rarely if ever question counterparties’ability and willingness to perform on obligations. In the months following the crash, policy makers andmarket participants began to examine those payment conventions more closely. The bulk of the changesto risk management systems that flowed from the crash related to efforts to clarify or make more rigorousthe responsibilities and obligations of market participants that previously had been left ambiguous orwere part of the lore of “normal” market practice.BIS Review   96/1997
- 2 -Another very important intangible legacy of the crash is our better understanding of theneed for cooperation and coordination among commodity, securities, and banking market authorities. Thecrash vividly illustrated the extent to which markets are intertwined and the extent to which largefinancial firms have lines of business that cut across many markets. The forums for coordination arealmost too numerous to mention, not least of which is the President’s Working Group on FinancialMarkets. The Working Group comprises the heads of the Treasury, SEC, CFTC, and Federal Reserve,and in addition, other banking supervisory agencies, the National Economic Council, and the Council ofEconomic Advisers participate.ProspectLooking forward, we are better positioned today to absorb market shocks than we wereprior to the 1987 crash. We undoubtedly, however, will have many different problems in future periodsof volatility. Responses to events such as the 1987 crash tend to be crisis-specific. One of our challengesis to make public policy responsive to changing market conditions rather than let it be driven solely bythe most recent crisis. The circuit breakers put in place after the crash offer an interesting example of thisphenomenon.Circuit breakers are trading halts coordinated across the equity and equity derivativesmarkets. They were first suggested by the Brady Task Force, and they are one of the more notablerecommendations of that report. As stated in the report, the purpose of this (and the otherrecommendations) was “[t]o help prevent a repetition of the events of mid-October and to provide aneffective and coordinated response in the face of market disorder.”Circuit breakers are widely cited today as one of the successes of the crash post-mortems.But I, for one, question this evaluation. Circuit breakers have never actually been triggered, in contrast tosome of the so-called “speed bumps” which affect particular trading strategies and are now trippedroutinely. (In contrast to circuit breakers, which are coordinated across the equity and derivative markets,speed bumps are trading restrictions that have been put in place by individual market places.) If circuitbreakers have never been used to halt trading, it follows that we have never had the experience of tryingto re-start trading either. To an economist such as myself, some of the scariest times during the marketcrash were those in which trading was not occurring. Our tendency to worry more about stopping tradingthan re-starting it is mystifying. (I realize that there has been some discussion about the rules for theresumption of trading but the overwhelming attention has been on the halt.)Recent re-assessments of circuit breakers have focused on increasing the magnitude ofprice declines necessary to trigger coordinated trading halts. If we are going to continue having circuitbreakers, I am supportive of this action and feel that a periodic evaluation of circuit breakers is valuableto ensure that trading halts only occur during very unusual market conditions. Nonetheless, I think thatwe also should broadly re-evaluate circuit breakers in light of current market conditions. Are circuitbreakers fulfilling the goal articulated by the Brady Task Force of providing an effective and coordinatedresponse in the face of market disorder? Do circuit breakers continue to be the best public policyresponse to market volatility?Many features of financial markets have changed over the last ten years, not least ofwhich is the continuing growth in international activity. Circuit breakers are much more difficult toimpose when trading activity can move to markets that do not participate in the trading halt. As I notedearlier, one of my main concerns is the restarting of trading following a halt. If liquidity has moved toover-the-counter markets or foreign venues, how does one get that liquidity back in the domestic,exchange-traded market when the trading halt ends? What kinds of problems might domestic specialistsand market makers have in restarting if the market has moved away from them during the halt? Recentchanges to shorten the duration of the circuit breakers likely would ameliorate these concerns somewhat,but the worry remains.BIS Review   96/1997
- 3 -Another important change in the financial landscape in the years since the crash has beena greater focus on risk management by both market participants and supervisors. Developments of newinstruments, both on and off exchanges, and of new methods for evaluating risk, have given marketparticipants powerful new tools to allow them to absorb market shocks. Similarly, risk management toolshave been enhanced at clearing organizations.Regulators must respond to these new tools. To fully utilize their benefits, regulators willneed to approach regulation and supervision in different ways. A good example is to be found in theapproach by banking supervisors to developing a capital requirement for market risk. After initial fits andstarts, the Basle Supervisors’ Committee embraced the concept of using banks’ internal models as a basisfor a capital requirement for market risk. The Federal Reserve has taken this process of employing newapproaches to regulation a step further with its pre-commitment proposal. Pre-commitment allows banksto commit to the maximum loss they will experience over the next quarter in their trading portfolio; thiscommitment becomes their capital requirement. The proposal gives banks incentives to establish thecommitment in a prudent fashion through fines and disclosures if it is violated. Economists in theaudience will recognize this proposal as an application of an incentive-compatible approach to regulation.I suspect that there are far more areas in our regulatory structure in whichincentive-compatible approaches could be implemented. Self-regulatory organizations also may find suchan approach beneficial, particularly in this era in which SROs are being asked to assume more and moreregulatory responsibilities. Incentive-compatible regulation essentially tries to harness the self-interest ofmarket participants to achieve broader public policy goals. By using such an approach, our overall goal isto make individual market participants more resilient and better able to withstand shocks. This, after all,is the most basic (and probably the most effective) protection for firms faced with events such as the1987 crash.At a macroeconomic level, public policies also should ensure that markets and theeconomy itself can withstand shocks. While the 1987 crash did not have significant, real economiceffects, this is not always the case with stock market crashes. Such episodes are generally accompaniedby dramatic increases in uncertainty and increased demands for liquidity and safety. Some of thesedemands for liquidity may, in turn, reflect the fear that the crisis will spread more broadly to theeconomy. In 1987, a key role played by the Federal Reserve was to demonstrate a determination to meetliquidity demands, and thereby to reassure market participants that problems would not spread beyondthe financial system. Problems were contained in this instance, but policy makers cannot be complacent.In the lessons to be learned from the crash, we should not lose sight of the potential for financial crises tohave real effects and of the on-going need for public policies to be directed toward mitigating theseeffects.BIS Review   96/1997
Mr. Rangarajan addresses a special convocation of the Indian Institute ofManagement   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. C. Rangarajan, at a specialconvocation held to confer upon him the honorary title of Fellow of the Indian Institute of Managementat Ahmedabad on 3/10/97.It gives me immense pleasure to be on the campus of the Indian Institute of Management.I accept in all humility the award of the title “Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management”,Ahmedabad. What can be a greater honour than the recognition by one’s own peers and family? I lookback with immense satisfaction on the years that I spent on the campus here. Those fourteen yearsmarked the most productive period of my academic life. It is no mean task to have created here aninstitution of world-class excellence. All those who have been associated with IIMA can take legitimatepride in this achievement. This, however, makes the task of the current faculty members and studentseven harder. The race of excellence is a perpetual one and is, therefore, very demanding. I am sure thatIIMA will always remain ahead.We are celebrating this year the Golden Jubilee of India’s Independence. As a nation, wehave accomplished much during this period. We have moved from the status of dependent countrystricken at periodic intervals by famine and shortages to that of an independent nation with a high degreeof stability. But the unfinished agenda is still long. Our rate of growth, though high in relation to ourown performance in the previous fifty years, has fallen short of our expectations and that of what certainother countries have been able to achieve. The miracle of East Asian countries may to some extent havebeen dimmed by the recent crises in these countries. Nevertheless, they have shown that it is possible forcountries to grow at a sustained rate of 7 per cent or more for several decades. We need to set our goalshigh.We have over time created the wherewithal for progress. The real task today is to usethese advantages for further growth. All of us are conditioned by history. History is a great teacher if wecan draw appropriate lessons. The present is an extension of the past. We should not, however, becomeprisoners of the past. Where changes are called for, we must be willing to make them. It is only bymaking such changes that a nation can progress. In the recent period we have made some basic changesin our approach to economic development and the means to achieve the desired results. The fundamentalobjectives of economic development in our country remain the same: growth and social justice.Instrumentalities to achieve these will have to change in tune with our experience and according to thedemands of the time and the responses of the society.In bringing about faster growth we need to address many issues. Perhaps one that is mostrelevant in the context of work that is going on at IIMA is the issue of productivity. In ensuring a highergrowth rate, there is no doubt that we must bring about an increase in the saving rate and, consequently,the investment rate. But at the same time one cannot over-emphasise the need for improving theproductivity and efficiency of input use. Economists in fact talk about total factor productivity, whichidentifies the contribution to the increase in output of influences other than increase in factor inputs. Thetotal factor productivity growth thus encompasses the effect not only of technological progress but alsoof better utilisation of capacities, improved skills of labour, etc. In fact during the period 1960-87 thetotal factor productivity growth of East Asia was 1.9 per cent per productivity and efficiency. Contrary tothe general impression, the natural resources of our country are not large. From the point of view oflong-range sustainability, the need for greater efficiency in the management of natural resources of land,water, minerals, etc. has become urgent. In a capital-scarce economy like ours, there can be no excuse forunder-utilisation of capacity. Macro-policy framework and micro-management practices must be such asto bring about the desired increase in productivity. While the policy framework must be supportive,industrial structure must be such as to compel firms to continually innovate and to cut costs. The policyenvironment, the organisational structure and the attitude to work and technology: all these have to beright. Needless to say, institutes of management have an important role to play in bringing about thisimprovement in productivity by sharpening the skills and the vision of managers.BIS Review   96/1997
- 2 -The recent development experience has clearly shown that countries which have grownfast are those which have made very heavy investment in education. Even as we aim at creating abroad-based educational system, including compulsory education at the primary and secondary levels, wealso need institutions of excellence. Living as we are in a complex and globally competitive world,institutions of excellence in all disciplines are required to meet the challenges of competition, which ineffect is the competition in skills and techniques.We are living in a fast-changing world. One analyst has compared these changes to the movement of thecontinental plates under the surface of the earth -- “plate tectonics” as geologists call it. The same analysthas also compared the dramatic changes using an analogy from evolutionary biology: “punctuatedequilibrium”. In these periods, the environment undergoes such significant changes that the dominantspecies is replaced by another one and evolution takes a quantum leap. Whether such a description fitsthe changes that are occurring today, history alone can tell. There is, however little doubt that we areliving in exciting times. India missed the first Industrial Revolution. We cannot afford to miss the secondone. All of our institutions of higher learning have an important responsibility in this regard. IIM,Ahmedabad has played a major role in improving the managerial practices in this country in the last threedecades. In the current phases of industrial development, when Indian firms are subject to competitiveforces, both domestic and global, the role of IIM is even greater. If the past is any guide, I am sure it willfulfil this historic role.BIS Review   96/1997
1BIS Review 25/2000Mr Remsperger: Is there a New Economy in Germany?Lecture held by Prof Dr Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, in New York, on20 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,perhaps I have gone a step too far in asking the question I am putting today: How can one dare to askwhether there is a New Economy in Germany if economists are still debating whether the notion ofNew Economy fits to the US economy? Besides, I have been warned against using the label NewEconomy in the first place since, especially with a view to the rapid spread of computer-aidedtechnologies, the paradigm of interpretation used by the advocates of the “New Economy” is not sovery new at all.And indeed, it is quite appropriate in this context to recall the economic writings of JosephA Schumpeter. As early as 1911, in his Theory of Economic Development, he highlighted the role oftechnological innovation. Following Kondratieff, Schumpeter established that long-term developmentsare initiated by basic technological innovations. He also pointed out two characteristics: They areproduced from within the economy and generate long waves.Schumpeter, who completed his academic work in the United States, furthermore held the view thatthese new combinations of production factors are not evenly distributed through time “but appear, if atall, discontinuously in groups or swarms”.1 In another passage he wrote: “What we are about toconsider is that kind of change arising from within the system which so displaces its equilibrium pointthat the new one cannot be reached from the old one by infinitesimal steps. Add successively as manymail coaches as you please, you will never get a railway thereby.”2With these quotations from Schumpeter in mind, it is now easier for me to state what my commentstoday here in New York do and do not aim to achieve. It is not my intention to present a series ofacademic exercises on defining the New Economy. Instead, I aim to look at the German economy andeconomic policy from a perspective that has been created, as it were, in the “New Economy” of theUnited States. In doing so, I shall concentrate on four aspects: first, the labour market and inflation;second, growth and productivity; third, fiscal policy; and fourth, the financial markets.Before I continue with these topics in detail please let me emphasise how closely the subject of theNew Economy is linked to monetary policy. This applies not only to US monetary policy but also tothe two pillar approach of the European Central Bank. Regarding the first pillar - which is thereference value for money supply - the Governing Council of the ECB has pointed out that the trendgrowth of the economy could be enhanced by structural reforms on the labour and product markets.The European Central Bank would take such improvements into account in calculating the M3reference value. At the same time, the second pillar of the monetary policy approach - that is thebroadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments - would have to pay heed to traces ofa New Economy. However, it goes without saying that a conservative central banker cannot rely onhopes and expectations but only on reliable facts and established findings. To make it absolutely clear:My thoughts on some trace elements of a New Economy in Germany do not imply that I disregard theimportance of the money supply for the medium-term price development in the euro area.1Schumpeter, The Theory of Economic Development, (1911), Transactions Publishers, 1993, p. 223.2Schumpeter, loc. cit., p. 64.
BIS Review 25/20002But now let me get back to the four topics I have just mentioned. With regard to the labour market andinflation it is initially striking that the development of inflation in Germany over the last decade hasbeen fairly similar to that in the United States. However, there was a certain time lag in Germany.In the early 1990s, the German inflation rate was still around 5% owing to tight capacity utilisation.Since then it has fallen continuously. Since 1995 the inflation rate has been well below 2%. It is thuswithin a range that is consistent with price stability according to the ECB’s definition.In contrast to inflation, labour market trends in Germany during the 1990s have been fundamentallydifferent from those in the United States. Whereas the US unemployment rate has continued todecline, the unemployment rate in Germany has been rising significantly for a long time since thecyclical slump in 1992-93. And this has been accompanied by a continued decline in employmentdespite an active labour market policy and the creation of early retirement schemes. The Germanlabour market is, if you like, a classic element of an “old economy”. It is only recently that the dent ingrowth caused by the Asian crisis has been overcome, that an improvement can be detected on thelabour market.The causes of the German labour market problems are primarily structural. This can also be seen bythe comparatively large number of long-term unemployed. Wage formation is mainly geared to theinterests of “insiders” who already have a job and not to those “outsiders” who would prefer moderatewage settlements. The accelerated adjustment of east German wages to the west German standards isone example of insufficient wage differentiation. It is precisely in the lower wage groups that it wouldbe important to structure wage substitutes in a more incentive-friendly way.From a current perspective it remains an open question whether the establishment of Europeanmonetary union will ultimately also lead to a reduction in labour market rigidities. However, I shouldadd that we are witnessing a gradual erosion of industry-wide pay bargaining at least in easternGermany. And we also observe working hours becoming more flexible. However, further steps willhave to follow so that a wage policy which is in line with market requirements can help to stimulateemployment friendly growth.Furthermore, the non-accelerating rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, could also fall in Germany. Inthe United States all the signs indicate that the NAIRU declined significantly during the long boom.According to the Bundesbank’s calculations, which may like other calculations be regarded with somedegree of uncertainty, NAIRU has risen in Germany almost throughout the entire period since the endof the seventies. In western Germany, it is likely to have been above 8% towards the end of the 1990s.When I now come to the second area of my comments, “Growth and Productivity”, I do not have totell you about the US economy’s success story in the 1990s. It is well-known to you. In short: Outputand productivity growth has been very buoyant especially since the mid-1990s - that is in an advancedphase of the upturn. The scale and the timing of these productivity increases can scarcely be explainedin terms of the normal cyclical pattern. I wonder whether Schumpeter would have already interpretedthe available evidence as a long wave.In Germany, the GDP growth rate in the 1990s was almost 1½ percentage points below thecorresponding US figure. Currently, the difference in the trend growth is likely to be slightly morethan one percentage point.3 When considering the individual components of demand, the differentmomentum of capital spending is particularly striking. Whereas real investment in machinery andequipment in the United States has been growing at an annual average of almost 10% since 1993, it is3A precise quantification of this difference is not easily possible, since the forecasts of future developments are also ofimportance for estimates at the end of the series. For example, the OECD currently assumes a potential growth of the USeconomy of 3½%, whereas the IMF predicts 2¾%.
3BIS Review 25/2000only in the last two years that Germany has seen a recovery of investment in machinery andequipment, albeit not with double-digit rates of growth (1998: 9.2%, 1999: 5.1%).4If the different pace of economic growth is examined more closely, it becomes apparent that US outputgrowth is supported by a sharp increase in both employment and in labour productivity. This is astrong indication that a balanced growth process is existing, in which labour and capital complementeach other in terms of their contribution to output.With an average growth rate of 2%, labour productivity in Germany was quite close to the US figuresin the nineties.5 When analysing this development, however, it has to be remembered that theproductivity gains in Germany are also attributable to a fall in employment. The contrastingdevelopments in labour productivity and employment point to an extensive substitution of labour bycapital.It is, of course, not sufficient to look only at the highly aggregated level.6 The OECD comes to theconclusion that the development towards a services society has also made considerable advances inGermany: In a comparative study, it puts the share of “knowledge-based industries” in the UnitedStates and in Germany at just over 50% in each case.7 And within the category of investment, as in theUnited States, investment in software shows by far the highest growth rate in Germany.8 Thepioneering role which the United States has assumed in the development of new technologies is,however, likely to be unchallenged. A study by the Munich-based ifo Institute on the spread of newinformation and communication technologies, for example, concludes that generating suchtechnologies has not been a very prominent feature in Germany over the last decade as compared tothe United States or Japan.9This finding is broadly consistent with OECD studies on investment in R&D activities in theindustrialised countries: Whereas the share of these expenditures as a percentage of GDP declined inGermany during the nineties, it has been rising again in the United States over the past few yearsfollowing a decline in the early nineties.10 These facts are hardly surprising as the United States isgenerally attested a leading position in terms of the factor human capital in highly qualified,research-intensive jobs. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is known as acountry with a very good average quality of the factor human capital. This basically favours a broadapplication of new technologies and their adoption to particular enterprise-specific conditions.What do all these findings now imply for future growth prospects? Most of the currently availableforecasts agree that an economic recovery is to be expected in Germany over the next few years,whereas the pace of expansion in the United States is likely to decelerate, leading to a soft landing. Tothat extent, a certain convergence of cyclical growth can be expected. However, from the perspectiveof the debate on the “New Economy”, the key question is whether the anticipated upswing in Germanywill be more than cyclical in character and lead to a trend shift in the path of growth - in much the4An interpretation of these figures should take into account the fact that direct comparisons are complicated by thedifferent methods to adjust for price developments, especially in the capital goods sector. The depreciation components,which might differ for several reasons, should also be taken into account.5The figure relates to aggregate hourly labour productivity. The comparative value for the US corporate sector is 2.2%.6The term “New Economy” is also used especially “to describe the shift from the industrial production of goods towardsthe provision of knowledge-based services”. “The new economy has arrived in Euroland”, Goldman Sachs, EuropeanWeekly Analyst, 99/41, 199, S.1.7Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 1999. Benchmarking Knowledge-based Economies, OECD (1999).8This type of investment grew by an annual average of just over 8% in real terms in Germany in the nineties.9See in particular: Tertiarisierung und neue Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien, ifo-Schnelldienst, 29/99,p. 23-34.10Quoted from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Zur technologischen Leistungsfähigkeit Deutschlands,Endbericht 1999, p. 29.
BIS Review 25/20004same way as in the United States in the nineties. I believe this is possible if the willingness toundertake reforms is followed by action to match.What is of main importance to me in this connection is to point out that the integration of theEuropean goods and factor markets inherent in the EU’s single market programme is being acceleratedby the single monetary policy in the euro area. The resultant intensification of competition combinedwith the exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the enlarged markets might have a sustainedboosting impact on productivity. The changes in the telecoms sector are an example of how thederegulation of markets can make further progress in Germany as well. With the intensifiedcompetition, especially in an increasingly globalised competitive environment, this development willnot only act as a damper on prices. It is also likely to lead to further surges of modernisation, in whichnew globally available technologies will be employed.Before I come to the third area of my comments, I would like to touch briefly on the healthcare sector.It can be regarded as one of the engines of growth, provided it is not overly restricted by stateregulations. In Germany, this sleeping giant is still waiting to be unchained. But let me now turn tofiscal policy.Although fiscal policy is not at the actual centre of the New Economy controversy, I think it is a veryimportant player in the macroeconomic setting.In the United States, fiscal policy in the past decade has been characterised by a marked course ofconsolidation. For example, the initially quite high government budget deficits of almost 6% of GDPin 1992 were reduced completely and transformed into a slight surplus (1999: 1.0% of GDP).In Germany, reunification confronted fiscal policy with its most difficult task since the period ofreconstruction following World War II. The restructuring of the corporate sector in eastern Germanyin conformity with the social welfare system, the enormous task to modernise the public infrastructureand the adoption of the west German social security system required huge transfer payments to thenew Länder, the bulk of which was covered by public borrowing. As it happened, the opportunity ofapplying these measures as a tool for fundamental overall reforms was seized rather late and with littleenergy.In the end, there has been a significant increase in the public sector’s recourse to the resources of theeconomy as a whole: The ratio of public spending to GDP which had fallen to just under 46% inwestern Germany in 1989 rose to almost 51% by 1996. The public debt ratio increased from just under42% to almost 61% in the same period. Moreover, the taxes and social security ratio grew from justunder 42½% to slightly more than 43% owing to the sharp increase in social security contributions.These unhealthy developments in public sector finances made a reversal increasingly inevitable.Moreover, the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty had to be met. Since 1997, the deficit ratiohas been declining as a result of increased consolidation efforts. However, the fiscal framework at thebeginning of the new century cannot at all be described as optimal in macroeconomic terms.Nevertheless, the decisions taken since summer 1999 give rise to the hope that important changes inthe economy as a whole will also be supported by fiscal policy. However, the picture is very complexin this area.It has to be regarded as positive for the future development of the economy that the German federalgovernment is committed to pursuing a strict policy of consolidation. What is pleasing is that thiscourse does not just exist in theory but has already been substantiated by measures which will have arapid impact. Certainly, the savings package which envisages savings of DM 30 billion for 2000 andaround DM 50 billion for 2003 does not correspond to effective savings of the same level.Nevertheless, the public sector’s recourse to GDP is likely to fall.Moreover, there are plans to reduce the public sector deficit ratio to ½% by 2003. At a first glance, thismay not seem particularly ambitious. One might also have doubts as to whether the European Stabilityand Growth Pact target of achieving a budget close to balance or in surplus in the medium term can bemet in full. However, it should not be forgotten that the consolidation course is to be accompanied by
5BIS Review 25/2000tax reductions on a quite impressive scale. Hence, the planned reduction in public spending from48.5% of GDP in 1999 to 45% in 2003 is much stronger than the lowering of the budget deficit ratio.The twin-track approach of tax cuts and a restrictive spending policy has paved the way for a sustainedreduction of the public sector burden on the capital markets and hence the creation of greater scope forprivate investment. In addition, the conditions for investment and production in Germany are beingimproved through the tax cuts.It is possible to detect a distinct shift in focus in German fiscal policy. The Tax Relief Act which cameinto force at the beginning of 1999 primarily aimed at providing relief to lower-income earners andhouseholds with children. The economy was to be boosted from the demand side. The price paid forthis was a higher burden on enterprises and thus a deterioration in supply and investment conditions.The government’s plan for a reform of business taxation now aims to give relief to enterprises andthus create conditions that are more favourable to growth via the supply side. This reorientation isbeing accompanied by a further two-stage reduction in income tax in 2003 and 2005 which also coversthe top rates. In 2005, the top rate of income tax would then be 45% compared with 51% at present.The CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag would like to put through a reduction in the toprate of tax to 35% by 2003.The government’s planned tax reform will result in a substantial tax relief for enterprises in net termsas well, especially as a result of the sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to a uniform level of 25%.At present, the corporate tax rates are 40% on retained profits and 30% on distributed profits. The taxcut will strengthen Germany’s attraction as an industrial location. The planned tax exemption ofcorporations’ profits from the sale of equity stakes will facilitate corporate restructuring. Germany islikely to become more attractive as a location for holding companies.In all, the tax plans are an important and welcome beginning which should be followed by furthersteps. From the point of view of the tax system and in terms of a consistent and equal taxation of alltypes of income, the plans do have some shortcomings. Above all, problems are raised by the markedpreferential tax treatment of profits retained in enterprises, which cannot be justified onmacroeconomic grounds. This preferential treatment might also result in allocation distortions.Ultimately, a substantial reduction of all rates and a comprehensive widening of the tax assessmentbasis would be needed.Whereas approaches to a solution are becoming evident in fiscal policy, this cannot be said for thesevere structural problem of the statutory system of old-age provision. Here, the ageing of thepopulation has led to an implicit public sector debt building up on a major scale. With the existingsystem of old-age provision this debt can only be repaid by further increases in employees’ andemployers’ contributions. Official projections assume that this would result in the contribution ratehaving to rise to 24% by 2030. In addition, there would also be growing burdens in health and nursingcare insurance. The associated obstacles to growth and higher costs would be a severe strain on thedevelopment of the economy. The reform measures proposed so far are not enough to prevent such aquestionable development. Above all, what is needed is a restriction of the pension growth rate. Thiswould create room for supplementary privately funded pensions. This would also benefit the capitalmarkets. And mentioning the capital markets I have now arrived at the last topic of my presentation.Undoubtedly, the “New Economy” is closely connected with developments in the financial markets.For example, the sharp growth in the supply of venture capital in the United States suggests that themomentum of the real economy is being underpinned by flexible, innovative forms of financing in thecapital market.The German financial system has been traditionally characterised by the dominant role of the banks.Such more “bank-based” structures should by no means be equated with backwardness, however. Onthe contrary, the credit institutions’ intermediation can in some cases even be superior to themarket-based financial system. Just to give a particularly important example: The corporate landscapein Germany has traditionally been characterised by small- and medium-sized enterprises.Long-standing, strong business relationships with specific banks are particularly suited to covering thefinancing requirements of such enterprises at reasonable costs even in periods of economic difficulty.
BIS Review 25/20006However, from the perspective of the New Economy, market-based financing is especially important.It is precisely young, innovative enterprises with uncertain earnings prospects that often have to relyon financing sources outside the banking system.In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the rapidly increasing importance of the stockmarket in Germany. In 1999 alone, domestic enterprises issued shares with a market value of(cid:1)(cid:2) billion. This is an increase of almost 50% compared with 1998 and three times the 1997 figure.Particularly noteworthy is the high share of initial public offerings in what is known as the “NewMarket”, the market for young and innovative enterprises. More than 200 companies are now listed inthis category which has thus become an engine for financing innovative enterprises in Germany.However, the New Market is only appropriate for firms which have already established themselves inthe markets. Hence, it is of particular importance that, along with the success of the New Market,venture capital business has simultaneously taken a rapid upswing. Venture capital invested rose byDM 5 billion in Germany in 1999. At the same time, the structure of venture capital investment hasradically changed. Whereas it was more traditional sectors that attracted venture capital in the past,such investment now focuses on telecommunications, biotechnology and computing.The growth of both the New Market and venture capital are interdependent. The New Market offersideal conditions for transforming venture capital into risk capital traded on the stock exchangefollowing the phase of venture financing. In the past, the lack of such an “exit” option was one of theobstacles to the development of a broader venture capital market in Germany. The rapid growth of thestock market would not have been possible without the general public becoming increasinglyinterested in share investments. Much use is being made of indirect stock market activity throughinvestment funds.Complementing the provision of risk capital via the stock market, there has been a sharp rise in theissue volume of corporate bonds. This instrument was also used in the past year to finance mergersand acquisitions - in other words, the restructuring of the corporate sector. However, this increase isalso due to growing investor demand for higher-risk paper, since the scope of diversification hasbecome much smaller through the elimination of exchange rate risks following the introduction of theeuro. The German corporate bond market is still less developed than in the United States. However,there are indications that the emergence of corporate bonds as a means of long-term financing hasbecome increasingly prominent in supplementing the use of bank loans. The momentum and strengthof such an underlying trend seem to be influenced to a large degree by technological advances, thepace of structural change in the corporate sector and economic policy reforms, such as in tax law orold-age pension provisions. Additional impetus is being provided by European monetary union.Ladies and gentlemen, let me finally return to my initial question: “Is there a New Economy inGermany?” This question cannot be answered with a sweeping yes or no. But it can probably be statedfirstly that there are movements in Germany which are simultaneously beneficial to growth and pricestability. I see traces of such a New Economy, above all, in areas of the economy which for a longtime were subject only to limited competition, but which are now being deregulated. More growth inthose areas may even be accompanied by falling prices. Second, the new technologies are availableglobally. They are also available as growth potential outside the United States. Third, the Germanfinancial system seems well equipped not only to accommodate the changes in the real sector but alsoto support them. In Germany, we need and have both market-oriented and bank-oriented financialservices. I cannot and do not want to comment on the development of share prices in the New Marketin Germany. But I do believe that traces of a New Economy can also be found in this market segment.On top of that, ever-increasing competition and technological progress are leading to a far-reachingrenewal in the financial sector.Fourth, the economic policy decisions taken since summer 1999 suggest that an upswing in theeconomy as a whole is supported by the fiscal framework. What is especially positive is thecommitment to a strict consolidation course which is being reinforced by concrete savings measures.And, in line with Professor Issing, I would finally like to emphasise that monetary union in Europeand the completion of the single market are promoting corporate restructuring, which is improving theefficiency of the economy.
7BIS Review 25/2000Let me conclude by saying that computers and the Internet alone will not create a New Economy inGermany by themselves. Only structural reforms will reduce the impediments to growth. Acombination of technological change and structural reforms would make possible not only a better usebut also a widening of the potential for growth in Germany.
1BIS Review 28/2000Mr Latter looks at the implications of e-commercefor the banking and monetary system in Hong KongSpeech by Mr Tony Latter, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at aconference on China and the New Millennium: WTO, Entrepreneurs and New Technology for GlobalTrade, held in Nansha, Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China on 24 March 2000.*      *      *The internet has quite suddenly multiplied by a remarkable degree the number of potential suppliersand customers with whom we can do business, and the number of avenues through which we canperform financial transactions. This opens up all sorts of opportunities, but it also attracts all sorts ofwarnings - about needing to know the identity of those with whom we are dealing; about needingsomehow to satisfy ourselves, remotely, as to the quality of the products or services on offer; aboutneeding to be sure of the financial standing of counterparties, be it their ability to pay or to providecredit which concerns us; and so on.Speaking as a central banker, I begin to have a specific interest in the development of e-commerce atthe point where payment has to be made for the goods or services that are traded via the internet, orwhere people deposit money into internet accounts. But I also have a broader interest relating to theoverall stablity and integrity of the financial system. The internet undoubtedly brings us the prospectof greater choice and efficiency in financial deals, but it also sparks certain concerns. These fall undertwo headings: consumer protection, with worries about scams, transparency, security, accountability,legal recourse, and so on; and systemic stability, with questions as to whether the financial systemmight become more vulnerable to crisis as a result, for example, of a major technical failure or of amassive herd movement of money in a particular direction.This is a vast subject, so I need to narrow down my focus today. I want to discuss some of the issueswhich businesses or individual members of the public may face in relation to electronic money on theinternet. And I then want to discuss some points which a central bank has to address in the monetarypolicy context when confronted with electronic money.In fact there are two types of electronic money: that which is held on the internet and that which isheld in stored-value cards. Multi-purpose stored-value card schemes have been slow to becomeestablished, despite quite lengthy pilot projects in a number of countries. Hong Kong was neverthelessone of the first places to introduce regulations governing the issuance of such cards. Meanwhile,limited-purpose cards have proved more successful; we have a particular example in Hong Kong withthe Octopus card, used to pay for public transport, which is hugely popular. Today, however, I want todevote the limited time available to talking about electronic money within the internet itself, so I shallnot be discussing card-based money any further.Many people speak of the arrival of the internet era as a revolution in business practice. From theparticular viewpoint of making payments, I prefer to regard it as a step along an evolutionary pathrather than as something revolutionary. Our distant forefathers were sceptical about the introduction ofbanknotes in place of metallic tokens and coins; and our more recent forefathers were worried as to thereliability of cheques as a substitute for cash when they first appeared. Even during the span of myown working life I can recall initial resistance by some to credit cards and debit cards on suspicionsabout the security of the arrangements, as well as opposition to autopay and direct debit schemes forfear of granting to a third party too general an authority to debit one’s bank account.But each of these innovations has, in the event, been assimilated and has taken its place in the range ofaccepted payment instruments. I would expect e-banking to follow suit, as just another step along theevolutionary path. But it is perhaps worth pausing to consider whether there is anything intrinsicallydifferent about e-banking which demands special attention from the central bank.
BIS Review 28/20002Let me begin by examining the question from the central bank’s stance as guardian of the integrity ofthe payments system and as banking supervisor. I believe there are perhaps two characteristics ofe-banking which may deserve some vigilance here.The first is the technical security of access and messaging. This is a matter of accuracy, safety andsecrecy. If we use the internet to move our money, or to hold our money, we expect messages to arriveat their destination without error or interception; we expect the system to be safe from fraudulent orunauthorised access; and we expect to enjoy the same degree of customer confidentiality as withconventional banking arrangements. We want to be assured not only that the execution process isreliable and secure, but also that there are adequate controls on any “read only” access facilities.How can we obtain these assurances? Perhaps some of you mirror my own feeling of personalinadequacy in matters of electronic technology. Inevitably we are dependent on the experts. They havedevised sophisticated methods of electronic signatures, encryption, certification, firewalls and the like.One way or another, by obtaining appropriate professional advice, by applying rigorous standards ofcompliance and computer audit, and so on, those within an organisation should be able to deliver thenecessary assurances to customers, and the regulatory or supervisory authorities will need to satisfythemselves as to the dependability of such assurances. The financial authorities within countries, andon a collective basis internationally, may also have a role to play in developing recognised commonstandards in these arenas of technology and security.The second characteristic deserving our special attention is the nature of the person or company whichis offering us banking or payment services over the internet. If we are merely using electronic servicesprovided by our usual bank, which we know to be sound and to be supervised by an acknowledgedregulator in a known jurisdiction, then we should be in no more danger of losing our money than wewould be by banking with the same bank in the conventional manner, provided of course that both thebank and the regulator have kept pace with the requirements of internet banking, such as in respect ofthe security aspects discussed already.But it is quite a different story if we are tempted to part with money to some organisationmasquerading as a bank, or which actually is a bank but is registered in a jurisdiction with lowersupervisory standards than those to which we are accustomed. In Hong Kong, in order to protect thepublic we already have legislation governing usage of the word “bank”, and governing the advertisingfor deposits within our boundaries by anyone not authorised to take deposits in Hong Kong. But wecannot protect people from the possible consequences of clicking onto a website in a far-off placewhich is luring them to part with their money. The message is clear: make sure that you know andtrust your banker.In Hong Kong there has been some talk of new banks being established for the sole purpose ofconducting internet banking. In deciding whether to authorise such a bank, the Monetary Authoritywould expect to apply very much the same criteria as for a conventional bank, but would need to payparticular attention to the business plan in order to ensure that it reflected realistic assumptions andprudent banking principles. We intend in the near future to issue guidelines for any such applications.Already, as the supervisory body for existing banks, the Monetary Authority needs to take account ofany particular risks that pertain to internet banking and to be sure that banks who conduct suchbusiness do themselves properly appreciate and allow for such risks. I would mention in particular thestrategic risk, in that venturing into a new business arena may not always be assured of success; theoperational risk, of dependence on IT networks, and the associated security considerations to which Ihave already referred; and any additional banking risks which may arise if internet transactions aredeemed to be potentially more volatile or unpredictable, or customers less reliable, than in normalbanking business.The need to be confident about the intermediaries with which you are dealing is also very relevantwhen we examine schemes for so-called digital cash or a cyberpurse. There have been some falsestarts and business failures in this field, but some potentially more durable systems are now emergingin a number of countries, albeit still mostly in only embryonic form. The concept is of a storagelocation - or account - somewhere in cyberspace, into which you transfer funds from your bankaccount or credit card, just as you would draw cash from the bank and store it in your wallet. The
3BIS Review 28/2000schemes are designed essentially for the retail shopper, who can then make payments from the pursefor items purchased over the internet: the purse operator responds to your instructions by transferringfunds from your purse to an account of the seller.You may wonder what the advantage of such schemes is supposed to be. Why not simply pay for eachtransaction by an electronic instruction to your bank or, more typically in the case of most retailinternet purchases, by credit card? The answer is that digital cash purports to offer three advantages.First, it may be cheaper than other means for a series of relatively low value retail transactions.Second, it can be used by those who cannot or do not have a credit card - for instance teenagers. Third,it offers a degree of anonymity and perhaps a stronger feeling of security, in comparison to using abank account or credit card, since account-related personal data need not be passed on to the individualsellers of the goods or services.However, people should exercise some caution before utilising such cyberpurse facilities. Regardlessof how the system may be presented, the purse operator is in effect acting very much as a bank, inparticular by holding your money in a sort of deposit. Even if you initially acquired the digital cash orcredit for free (through a loyalty or bonus point scheme, for example), the accumulated “savings”represent value which you would doubtless wish to protect. Customers will want to be assured that themoney or credit points are in safe hands. Regulators, too, may desire to verify that no banking activityis taking place that is unlawful, although they will first need to ascertain the location of this virtualoperation (a task which is itself almost a contradiction in terms) so as to identify what is the applicablejurisdiction. Although in most of these schemes the maximum sum which anyone may hold in a pursemay, for the moment, be quite modest, and so the scale of potential losses limited, we need to establishthe foundations of prudent behaviour and regulation in preparation for the time when the sums may bemuch larger.Thus far I have been looking at the phenomenon of e-banking and e-payments largely from theregulatory point of view. I would like to turn now to examine whether there are any noteworthyimplications for the key central bank responsibility of monetary policy.I want first to consider possible implications for the physical currency. Central banks or theirgovernment shareholders enjoy a steady stream of profit from the issue of currency in the form ofnotes and coin - the so-called seignorage. It is noteworthy that the public’s demand for currency hasbeen much less affected over the years than one might have expected by the emergence of successivenew forms of non-cash payment such as cheques and cards. And personally I would doubt whether thedevelopment of cyberpurses, cybercash and cyberpayments would have much impact on cash incirculation, at any rate in the near term. But suppose I am wrong. Suppose there is a completerevolution such that cybercash, including electronic stored-value cards, substantially displacesphysical currency within a few years. How should central banks react?In such circumstances, central banks would lose an important source of income and would have to findways of replacing it. Perhaps some central banks would lose their financial independence and becomedependent - or more so than hitherto - on subvention from the government budget. But in a broadersense they should welcome the development because it would be evidence that the economy as awhole was enjoying a more efficient and less expensive means of money holding and transmission.With regard to operational aspects of monetary policy in pursuit of the general macroeconomicobjective of stability in the value of the currency, the advent of this new means of payment would, if itcaught on to a significant extent, have some impact on the public’s allocation of money holdings asbetween physical currency, various forms of deposit and, now, electronic forms. This in turn mightaffect the monetary statistics and their interpretation. However, any changes would only occurgradually. Besides, nowadays there are scarcely any central banks which rely single-mindedly andexclusively upon measures of money supply to guide their monetary policy decisions. Therefore I donot believe that there is anything much to worry about on this front.Next, it has been suggested that internet banking in its various manifestations could introduceadditional and unpredictable volatility into world financial markets by enabling millions of people toswitch funds between investments or between currencies at the click of a mouse. In general I amsceptical about such worries. Global financial markets have already been exploiting the IT age with its
BIS Review 28/20004immediacy of information and electronic dealing for some years. Capital is already hugely mobile inboth scale and speed. I doubt whether the inclusion of new players at the retail level would have muchof an additional impact.In particular cases where monetary policy is supported by capital controls, however, internet bankingmay make enforcement of such controls more difficult, since it would be operationally easier for thosewishing to evade regulations to maintain offshore bank accounts. Of course, every bank in reputablejurisdictions has in place rigorous procedures to combat money-laundering, but these procedures donot normally result in customers being turned away if they are merely trying to escape capital controlsor the tax regime in their home countries.Similar considerations lead some observers to enquire whether the internet might encouragesubstitution out of the national currency, resulting in dollarisation and also perhaps weakening thecentral bank’s influence over domestic monetary conditions. If internet facilities enable or encouragepeople either to economise on the usage of money (for example by netting payments due among twoor more parties or by practising barter) or to reduce the frequency of movements of money (forexample by leaving export receipts in an internet account in order to pay for imports, rather thanrepatriating them first), then there may be a prospect of a general reduction in transactions traffic in allcurrencies. The usage of some may fall more than others. I do not, however, see anything particularlysinister in such developments, except to the extent that the internet might facilitate avoidance of ruleson remittances. The survival of the national currency and its acceptability to the public will continue todepend on the central bank carrying out a responsible monetary policy which protects the value of thecurrency. Discharge of this duty should not be materially affected or impeded by technologicaldevelopments in payment methods. The central bank’s ability to influence interest rates or theexchange rate through its market operations will not be diminished.I conclude that, all in all, there are few concerns for the central bank in its monetary policy role thatarise from the development of e-commerce; where there is an impact it is likely to be gradual andcentral banks should be able to adapt to it as readily as they have to other structural changes in thefinancial sector over the years. For the reasons discussed earlier, however, the challenge to the bankingregulatory side of the central bank is likely to be rather greater.
